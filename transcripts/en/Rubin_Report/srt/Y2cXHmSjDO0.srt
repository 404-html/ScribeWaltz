1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,680
In case you've been hiding under a rock 
or if you just don't have twitter,

2
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:08,514
bless your heart.
Kanye West made his return to the 

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:13,560
platform and proceeded to crack the 
Internet with seven dirty words,

4
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,780
which would've put even George Carlin to
shame.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,910
Last Saturday.
Kanye tweeted,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,840
I love the way candace owens thinks.
If you don't know candice.

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,880
Oh,
and she's a black conservative woman who

8
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,890
originally went under the Youtube 
Moniker,

9
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,724
red pill,
black candace caught fire online around 

10
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,754
the summer of 2017,
and my interview with her in which we 

11
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:35,280
discussed her evolution from a lefty to 
a conservative,

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,470
is one of the moments that really put 
her on the map.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,190
It was the first time that she had been 
able to explain herself in her own words

14
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,024
in a long form conversational setting.
I don't want to rehash the whole thing 

15
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:45,924
right now,
but candace is no stranger to 

16
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,994
controversy and you may remember that 
infamous debate that I had with candice 

17
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,920
and Blair white late last year.

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,560
The whole thing was a debacle.
I make no bones about it,

19
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,394
but hashtag save.
Dave trended on twitter to who might've 

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,453
complained 2018 has already been a huge 
year for candice as she was hired as 

21
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,820
communications director for turning 
point USA,

22
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:08,610
the largest conservative college group 
in America.

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,653
Since then,
she's been touring the country with 

24
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,110
Charlie Kirk,
talking to young people,

25
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:17,910
particularly young black people as why 
they should embrace the victim mentality

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,744
rather than the victim mentality.
This is included directly attacking the 

27
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:25,980
black lives matter movement as well as 
democratic policies,

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,390
which candice argues has decimated the 
black family and the black community.

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,850
Just last week,
candice,

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,680
Charlie and I spoke at Berkeley to a 
wild crowd.

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,850
I'm proud to say that we had agreements 
and we had disagreements and even though

32
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,620
our styles are different,
no doubt,

33
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,440
candice certainly goes for the juggler 
more than I do.

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,550
I always enjoyed doing events with her 
and seeing her evolve politically.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,593
Something I know a bit about myself.
She's learning as she goes and as she 

36
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,250
said to me in our interview,
if I had swallowed the red pill,

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,000
then she had snorted it.
Beyond any of the politics though,

38
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,390
candice is a friend and our differences 
don't define us.

39
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,460
They actually bring us together.
All right.

40
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,440
Back to Connie for a second.
Beyond the headlines,

41
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,274
I don't know a ton about him,
although I'm obviously aware enough to 

42
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:13,890
recognize what a transcending cultural 
figure he is.

43
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,160
Not only is he hugely successful in the 
music world,

44
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:17,994
he has a hugely successful fashion line 
and he's married to Kim Kardashians who 

45
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,014
has her own empire.
You may not like the guy for whatever 

46
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,190
reason,
but make no mistake.

47
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,024
He is an absolute mogul.
I may not like or even respect the 

48
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:33,480
influence that celebrities have over 
culture these days,

49
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:38,481
but Kanye is truly someone who can move 
people's minds with what he raps or with

50
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,600
what he tweets.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,390
This is exactly what happened with these
seven words.

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,650
Immediately after Connie's tweet in 
supportive candice,

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,420
the Internet went ablaze twitter 
moments.

54
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:51,930
Lead story was about Kanye support for 
far right.

55
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:56,100
Candice Owens.
Candice was called Anti Gay and racist.

56
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:56,934
Something I'm still confused about as 
she's had dinner here with me and my 

57
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:04,150
husband at our home where her antiganey 
has never seemed to leak out as racist.

58
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,380
There's nothing like a white lefty 
telling a black person who doesn't think

59
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,214
as they demand that they do,
that the black person is the actual 

60
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,620
racist against their own race.
Irony is truly dead.

61
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,000
Folks.
On Monday this week,

62
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,940
Kanye refused to back down despite 
hysterics from the media.

63
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,910
He tweeted out a bunch of videos by 
another form of Rubin report.

64
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,110
Guess bestselling author and Dober 
creators,

65
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,660
Scott Adams.
In essence,

66
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:29,110
these videos were Scott talking about 
what a free thinker Kanye is.

67
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,944
That's it.

68
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,843
Next thing you know,
the usual suspects like buzzfeed media 

69
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,430
at the daily beast and others were 
labeling Scott Adams as far right.

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,593
We've seen the script a million times 
before with anyone who dare challenge 

71
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:43,950
leftist Orthodoxy,
be it candice Scott Column,

72
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,460
Moriarity,
Jordan Peterson,

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
or even little old me when mainstream 
media has moved so far left that this 

74
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:50,914
wide collection of people are all 
smeared with the same charges of far 

75
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,844
right racism.
You know that the overton window hasn't 

76
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,470
just shifted,
it's shattered.

77
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,470
The authors of these pieces aren't 
journalists,

78
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,810
they're activists,
or as candace says,

79
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,770
they are a journalist there hitman.
To recap,

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,813
we have a new player in Kansas who is 
fearlessly saying how she believes that 

81
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,834
the Democrats have used the black 
community for decades and that the 

82
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,530
victimhood mentality of the left is the 
root of this problem.

83
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,753
This by the way,
is similar to what plenty of other 

84
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,460
conservatives have been saying for 
years,

85
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,294
and yes,
this includes even black conservatives 

86
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,010
like my former guests,
Larry elder and Thomas Soul.

87
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,143
The voices of black conservatives and 
others espousing similar ideas has been 

88
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:37,330
largely ignored by the mainstream media.
However,

89
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,920
and that is exactly why everyone is 
freaking out about his tweets.

90
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,963
He just gave oxygen to a set of ideas 
that the Democrats and the mainstream 

91
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,614
media don't want you to hear,
and since they've controlled the 

92
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:51,154
narrative for so long,
they've relied on the usual smears of 

93
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,060
racism,
homophobia,

94
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,894
and bigotry.
Instead of strengthening their own 

95
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,594
ideas.
Your ideas get fat and lazy when you 

96
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,480
don't have to work them out because 
you've owned the narrative for so long.

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,630
This is where the modern left finds 
itself right now.

98
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,180
If Kansas,
his views are far right,

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,880
then that means that about 40 percent of
America,

100
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,760
if not more,
falls into that category.

101
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,580
I do want to address a different lurking
danger here.

102
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,414
However,
I know candace and I believe her to be 

103
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,650
forthright and passionate as she figures
this all out.

104
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,190
I obviously don't know Kanye nor any of 
his political beliefs,

105
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,203
so we have an interesting match here 
where candice is now the rocket and 

106
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,013
Kanye is the jet fuel.
If candice doesn't do the intellectual 

107
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:39,370
work to really figure out what she 
believes and why she believes it all the

108
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,204
while being under the insane microscope 
of the media that's going to be praying 

109
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:43,954
for her to fail,
well then the rocket will be faulty and 

110
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,224
this experiment will blow up.
What if Kanye says something absolutely 

111
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,510
crazy tomorrow,
which is not only possible,

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,270
it's probable or something that's 
counter to everything else that can just

113
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,580
believes he's been known to stir the 
pot,

114
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,414
and I can only assume that something 
like that will happen either 

115
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,414
intentionally or by mistake.
Does her rocket ship run out of fuel in 

116
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,533
midflight?
Where does that leave this incredible 

117
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,314
momentum over the past year when I've 
talked to people like Eric and Bret 

118
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,101
Weinstein,
Jordan Peterson,

119
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,480
Ben Shapiro,
Larry Elder,

120
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,010
Thomas Soul,
and many others.

121
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,843
What I'm most impressed by is how 
complete their outlook on politics and 

122
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,050
more broadly on life is they don't jump 
from conclusion to conclusion.

123
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,884
Depending on the political climate.
They try to really understand what they 

124
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,890
fundamentally think.
So as new issues arise,

125
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,980
they're responses are complete rather 
than conflicted.

126
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,083
This is something I've really tried to 
incorporate into my thinking and 

127
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,710
something that I know many of you are 
trying to do as well.

128
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
This will also be.
Candice is challenged now and I think 

129
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:43,874
she's up to it,
but only she could decide that for 

130
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,340
herself.
It blows my mind that every conversation

131
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:53,300
we have in this room seems to become 
more and more relevant as time goes by.

132
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,990
For All I know,
we'll have Kanye in that guest seat soon

133
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:57,824
enough,
whether he is just rocket fuel to boost 

134
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:00,914
ideas or is he the rocket ship that will
get us to the solutions remains to be 

135
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,900
seen but make no mistake.
The issues around free speech,

136
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,734
political correctness,
and the uncomfortable truths that might 

137
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:16,250
be the answers to those questions have 
just been leveled up.

138
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,410
Are the players ready for the next 
level?

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,730
We'll soon find out

140
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,210
joining me today as a national security 
expert,

141
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,640
the best selling author of defeating 
Jihad,

142
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,683
and a former.
I'll be at brief strategists to 

143
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:35,040
president trump,
Dr Sebastian Gorka.

144
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,840
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me,

145
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,400
David.
I'm happy to have you here.

146
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,780
Sara.
First off that voice,

147
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,673
you have a very.
Have you ever done any voice over work 

148
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,250
at all?
Um,

149
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,650
it's don't tell anybody,
but it's my dream.

150
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,050
What I wrote,
defeating Jihad.

151
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,480
I asked about the audio book.
I said,

152
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to get to do the audio book 
right by publishers.

153
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,000
You couldn't do the prologue.
Then we'll get a pro.

154
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,150
I was crushed.
So the next book coming out in June.

155
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,670
Why we fight?
I'm sorry if you're listening to margie.

156
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:07,020
I'm doing so.
I really can't believe that.

157
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:07,854
So first off,
we have already spent a good amount of 

158
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,530
time talking about star wars,
so very impressed.

159
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,330
Your Green Room and that post.
I'd never seen that in the quarry posted

160
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,800
before on the LP,
so I'm impressed.

161
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,830
That is the original 1977 poster.
I wonder,

162
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:23,664
do you think,
because we're obviously going to talk a 

163
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,480
lot about national security and foreign 
policy and all that,

164
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,523
do you think any of your thoughts 
related to foreign policy had anything 

165
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:35,130
to do with Star Wars?
Because I do think at some level some of

166
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:38,970
the way I view the world has been shaped
by some of the Lore and all the.

167
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,823
I'm not sure if it's causing effect but.
But absolutely in terms of good and 

168
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:45,660
evil.
I mean totally.

169
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,553
I mean,
the first three movies are about good 

170
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:52,650
versus evil before they become this 
social justice warrior absurdity.

171
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,820
So yeah,
sure.

172
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,040
I mean,
but as much being the son

173
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,930
of people who lived on the Nazi and then
communist dictatorship that these things

174
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,240
kind of flow together so

175
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,453
or is and growing up under the child 
with people who escaped from 

176
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,321
dictatorship.
Right.

177
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,071
There you go.
All right,

178
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:09,904
so you are in California because you 
were talking to a couple conservative 

179
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,133
groups here in California.
People don't believe that conservative 

180
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:17,974
groups could exist in California,
but I mentioned to you before we just 

181
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:20,944
had governor John Casick on,
he was talking with Arnold 

182
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,900
Schwartzenegger at some conservative 
groups here in California.

183
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,973
So are,
it seems like something is happening in 

184
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:30,190
California.

185
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,023
I don't live here,
but I come in and out to do these 

186
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,560
events.
Uh,

187
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,090
something's happening.
So something clearly is happening.

188
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,790
Um,
the energy I felt,

189
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,231
uh,
the,

190
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,064
uh,
the events here is like the energy I 

191
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:46,300
feel at events in Virginia,
um,

192
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,130
or,
or elsewhere,

193
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,370
like Texas.
And there's a commonality.

194
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:55,180
Whoever you speak to,
they keep mentioning the same things.

195
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,930
They talk about the gas tax,
they talk about sanctuary cities,

196
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,450
they talk about the burden on 
businesses.

197
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,403
When you,
when you get these things repeated 

198
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:04,084
enough times,
you realize something is happening in 

199
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,830
California.
Who knows where it'll go,

200
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,770
but this isn't the state I used to say,
you know,

201
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,610
the People's republic just last forever.
I'm not so sure.

202
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,943
Really.
So do you think this could be something 

203
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:21,900
that could happen as soon as our next,
our gubernatorial election that's coming

204
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,734
up now?
Or do you think this is sort of 

205
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,530
longterm?
Maybe presidential election,

206
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,670
20 slash 20 or

207
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,563
all I'll say is the following with the 
election of Donald J dot trump to 

208
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,554
president.
The political rule book has been 

209
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,900
shredded,
burnt,

210
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,960
buried under a Donald Trump jumped up 
and down on it.

211
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,540
It's gone.
So,

212
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:46,541
so any past expectations,
any trendlines are irrelevant.

213
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,120
I mean I traveled with the president to.
We flew on Air Force One to Youngstown,

214
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:55,890
Ohio back in June.
And the Steel Valley,

215
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,843
right?
This is the heart of a blue collar 

216
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:01,290
Democrat,
manual laborers.

217
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,421
And we,
we,

218
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:06,600
we arrived at the stadium and the 
president was in the back.

219
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:11,601
I was doing selfies with the crowd,
the crowd selfie.

220
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:12,774
I've seen many crowds.
What does it cost me that they want to 

221
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:15,961
sell for?
Yeah,

222
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:16,794
sure.
Why not?

223
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,650
Um,
so I got to engage with these people and

224
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,760
I realized that in this stage you move 
on at 20,

225
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,010
25,000
people.

226
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,010
Everybody was either a former registered
Democrat,

227
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,650
their parents or grandparents were all 
democrats.

228
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,850
And then what happens when the president
or when the first lady Melania comes out

229
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,580
of the stage,
it erupts.

230
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,140
The building erupts with chance with USA
drain the swamp.

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,430
And this is Democrat territory now,
if that can happen in young stoner,

232
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,810
youngstown,
Ohio,

233
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,330
who knows what can happen in California.
Yeah.

234
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,583
Yeah.
So I want to talk a little bit about 

235
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:53,040
your history and your parents and 
growing up that I just mentioned,

236
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,883
but as long as we're on the,
on the first part of the trump portion 

237
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,220
of this,
let's just keep doing that.

238
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:01,330
I heard you at the turning point usa a 
event in December.

239
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:03,130
Give a speech,
which I really thought was wonderful and

240
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:08,131
you described trump as the icebreaker 
and what I've been saying around here is

241
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,290
that I view him as the bull in the China
shop.

242
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,780
We wanted a panther to knock over a few 
things,

243
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:14,614
but we got the bowl and I think that 
it's really the same analogy that we're 

244
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,350
using there.
Um,

245
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,100
so can you just further on that one?

246
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,380
So,
um,

247
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,153
the United States was covered for at 
least 30 years in this massive 

248
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,544
permafrost layer of ice,
which is political correctness and it 

249
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:32,670
had frozen over the media,
education,

250
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:33,570
politics,
all of it.

251
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,573
Uh,
to the extent that by the Obama 

252
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,264
administration,
federal government was telling you who 

253
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,110
could use which bathrooms.
So just insanity.

254
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,660
Um,
and then along comes a guy who,

255
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,890
the first day I met him in summer of 
June 15 in his office in trump tower,

256
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,353
the first thing I knew about this man is
he's the Kryptonite of political 

257
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:52,351
correctness.
I mean,

258
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,670
he couldn't care less about,
well,

259
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,830
the New York Times or CNN says about a 
given issue.

260
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,490
So along comes this man,
layer of ice frozen over the country,

261
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,750
Fam slams into it like an ice breaker 
and smashes through the ice.

262
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,890
So he breaks a pathway for,
for the nation to,

263
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,620
to open up that silane.

264
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,663
And,
and my argument to conservative 

265
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:14,970
audiences is that this is great.
This is monumental.

266
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:17,640
It wasn't going to be the path that 
could never have one.

267
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,160
It had to be the bull,
it had to be the icebreaker.

268
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,650
But if you know your physics of 
icebreaking,

269
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,410
you can send that,
you know,

270
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,800
thousands of tons worth of shipping 
there with its tungsten hall rides up on

271
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:29,634
the ice slices through it.
But if you don't have the flotilla 

272
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,933
behind it,
that comes up and keeps that passageway 

273
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:37,330
open,
what actually happens in real life?

274
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,250
You suddenly one ship in breaks apart 
almost instantaneously.

275
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,263
The ice comes around the bow and read 
knits itself right around the ship and 

276
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,044
reseals.
So this is the moment in the 

277
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:48,144
conservative movement where we have to 
get serious about what does it mean to 

278
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:54,570
be a conservative in the 21st century?
What's the role of government?

279
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,330
How does national security look?
Uh,

280
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,960
so on and so forth.
Uh,

281
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,853
Donald Trump is the catalyst now we have
to do the heavy lifting of ideology and 

282
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:04,080
politics and policy.

283
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,690
Yeah.
Do you think he will years from now when

284
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:09,330
we look back,
be anything other than the catalysts?

285
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:10,164
Like how do you,
how do you consider his ideas compared 

286
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:13,554
to traditionally conservative ideas 
because just in the last couple months 

287
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,450
after signing the Omni bus thing,
you know,

288
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:19,284
right now when we're taking,
we're taping this a few days before 

289
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,950
we're going to air it,
but there's a big mess in Syria.

290
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:25,170
We're not sure if there's going to be 
more intervention or not.

291
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,213
He seems to be doing some things that 
are probably a little more big 

292
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:29,814
government than perhaps you want or,
or certainly then his base seems to 

293
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:33,654
want.
So where do you think he fits actually 

294
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,220
between catalyst and the enabler and the

295
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,750
flotilla?
So first things first.

296
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,490
I hate labels personally.
I,

297
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:42,470
I think labels is lazy thinking.
Um,

298
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,473
and in the case of Donald Trump,
that irrelevant and they have no 

299
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,790
application,
uh,

300
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,730
uh,
credit.

301
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:49,840
Monica,
Monica Crowley,

302
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,220
my friend with this,
the weekend after

303
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,220
the election was David Horowitz is a,
was it a restoration weekend in Florida,

304
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,280
which was either going to be awake or 
the party that was,

305
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,620
and Monica gave a great speech in which 
he said,

306
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,454
look,
everybody misunderstands who this man 

307
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,094
is.
He was never an ideological candidate 

308
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,100
because you simply cannot put him in a 
box because of what he does,

309
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,960
whether it's his attitude to gay 
marriage,

310
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:16,580
whether it's.
It just is what it is.

311
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,910
Just a sort of mixture.
He was never an ideological candidate.

312
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,810
He was an attitudinal candidate and she 
nailed it.

313
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,780
Now what does that mean?
Look at the last 40 years.

314
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,570
This guy is 71 years old.
He's not going to change.

315
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,433
He is who he is.
What has he done for the last 40 years 

316
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,450
as a professional?
He's been committed to one thing,

317
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,680
excellence,
whether it's a golf course in Scotland,

318
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,903
whether it's skyscraper in New York,
it's excellence and all he's done is 

319
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:46,214
he's taken that concept and tribes know,
translated it into excellence for 

320
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:56,130
America once more and that doesn't fit 
into neat neoliberal neo-con,

321
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,170
Paleo calm.

322
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,213
It just doesn't fit.
He's about getting stuff done and being 

323
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:02,444
the best,
but so how do you link that to what the 

324
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:07,120
general conservative movement is?
Now I get.

325
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,560
I get what you're saying about labels 
and I say it all the time.

326
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,300
The labels now,
especially because of trump.

327
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,490
The labels are all the brothers at this 
point,

328
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,230
but the thing that I'm struggling to 
fully grasp about the trump thing is how

329
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,750
does this connect to.
You know,

330
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,640
when I see you right now,
you have a huge split,

331
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,520
right?
We've got the trump base and then you've

332
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,740
got the never trumpers and these people 
are.

333
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,520
That should be kind of lining up.
They can't quite get there.

334
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,983
And how do you connect those things?
Like how do you connect what you're 

335
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,850
going to connect you to?
The never.

336
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:42,220
Trump has a pathological pathological.
When Bill Crystal,

337
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,040
who's all obsequious and oleaginous to 
me in the greenroom at Fox,

338
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,023
when he tweets out actually tweets out 
in a choice between the deep state and 

339
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,580
president trump,
I choose the deep state.

340
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,110
Yeah,
Bill,

341
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,320
you don't have a conservative.
You're a subversive right.

342
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,220
Can get out of the tent,
get out of the tenant.

343
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,153
So that's never going to happen.
The broader question of what does 

344
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:04,694
conservative mean today?
We can't answer that because have you 

345
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:10,964
seen a good article,
a really good article which understands 

346
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:17,450
first principles,
founding principles about what trump ism

347
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,460
is or should be?
I haven't.

348
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,720
I've seen a lot of people who think they
know what they're talking about,

349
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,563
but who never met the president.
So I think with a lot of work to be 

350
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:27,524
done,
but it's not going to be done by 

351
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,534
conservative establishment individuals.
The NRO is not going to tell you who 

352
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,094
trump is and the NRO is not going to 
revitalize the conservative 

353
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,370
establishment.
Right.

354
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,470
This is a new era.
It's exciting,

355
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,830
but we have to get to work to define 
what it means to be a conservative.

356
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:43,664
So that to me is why it seems so obvious
that you're so passionate about this 

357
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,050
that nobody else was going to do it.
And I think that's all.

358
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,973
So that's sorta what Monica was saying 
and it's sorta what Horowitz has been 

359
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:55,110
saying for a long time.
Even when he sat right there that no one

360
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:58,950
else was going to break through.
And now it's imperfect.

361
00:17:58,951 --> 00:17:59,730
But

362
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,930
at least there's let.
Let,

363
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:03,960
let,
let me be brutally candid.

364
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,360
You know,
I grew up in the UK to Hungarian parents

365
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:10,140
who escaped communism.
I went through the private school system

366
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,630
in the UK,
stiff upper lip and all that stuff,

367
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:13,464
and the debating club.
So the precedent style is not exactly 

368
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,560
the style used to.
I have to get used to it.

369
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,210
And I understand when people have 
issues.

370
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,163
The biggest people,
the biggest thing people have issues 

371
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,190
with on,
on the right of his tweets.

372
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,710
I get it.
But guess what?

373
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,630
Who was going to Defeat Hillary?
Wasn't Jeb Bush wasn't even sent.

374
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,483
It accrues.
None of them were going to the only 

375
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,784
person who could come up through that 
Miasma who could break through the ice 

376
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:46,050
of political correctness walls,
this rank outsider from Manhattan.

377
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,970
And whether you like it or not,
he had to say for the Sophocles,

378
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:54,930
he was the necessary but not sufficient 
calls of victory.

379
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,360
Um,
you don't have to like it,

380
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,680
but it had to be him.
With that start,

381
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,430
we tried to do marquess of queensberry 
rules for 30 years.

382
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:07,980
What did it get us?
When did it get us?

383
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,400
Mitt Romney among guys.
Right?

384
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,750
So it had to be Donald Trump.
Now we have to backfill what it means.

385
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,440
Yeah.

386
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,273
And that seems to be where I think you 
and so many of these other people that 

387
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,380
are either part or formerly part of the 
administration.

388
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:25,230
So you had a very brief stint at the 
administration,

389
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,430
uh,
first of all.

390
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,060
And then some years from now they'll go.
My Dad,

391
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,700
he was there for 90 percent longer than 
everybody else,

392
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,440
but it.
But it pretty breached in seven months.

393
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,603
First,
can you just tell me how you got 

394
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,254
involved because you had only,
you just mentioned you only met him a 

395
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:39,234
little bit before the election in the 
first place and then sort of what 

396
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:45,300
happened that had you leave because that
will really tie into the media,

397
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:46,134
which I think we're very much aligned on
what's going on with the media right 

398
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:48,984
now.
So a summer of 15 I got a phone call 

399
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,720
from a guy called Corey Lewandowski that
I'd never heard of

400
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,200
and he said,
uh,

401
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,230
candidate trump is prepping for the big 
full gop presidential debate on national

402
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:06,640
security.
And you'd like to talk to you said,

403
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,320
sure.
So I took the plane,

404
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,450
flew to New York,
went to trump tower.

405
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,660
It was just the three of us in Donald 
Trump's office and we had this

406
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,480
incredible blue sky discussion on 
national security issues.

407
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,710
You name it from the civil war up to the
Middle East,

408
00:20:23,711 --> 00:20:25,430
a nuclear weapons.
What kinds of topics?

409
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,710
How knowledgeable did he seem about 
things?

410
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,980
Because this is one of the parts that I 
think people we have no handle on,

411
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:31,814
like does he really,
really interested but not a guy that 

412
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:37,340
you're going to debate what happened in 
Karbala in the ninth century,

413
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:37,731
but,
but,

414
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:40,040
but really interested in this stuff

415
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,183
and with opinions and,
and halfway through this discussion and 

416
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:44,924
he was sitting closer to me than you are
and qualities over here and he does a 

417
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,480
classic trumpism.
He goes,

418
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,943
just stops the conversation with cory.
I like this guy that's hiring and that 

419
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,230
was it.
And he asked me to help write.

420
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:01,030
It wasn't part of the campaign,
but I became an advisor,

421
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:01,864
wrote policy papers that he used in the 
briefings and we stayed in touch but I 

422
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:06,544
never joined the campaign.
And then as things progressed and he 

423
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,090
know the field whittled down to what it 
did,

424
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,643
I kept meeting General Flynn at events.
I was a participant was just in the 

425
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:18,574
crowd.
I kept bumping into General Flynn and 

426
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:23,500
I'd known him from when he was directed 
to dia and eventually we just.

427
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,690
He pulled me in and by October,
the month before the election,

428
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,120
I don't know if you're familiar with the
system in the presidential election,

429
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,083
the last two runners get a support from 
the federal government before the 

430
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,283
election and they get offices near the 
White House to create transition teams 

431
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:42,874
to prep.

432
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,833
And so hillary got one story and,
and the president got another story of 

433
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:48,970
this building and I was pulled into the 
pet.

434
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,410
Hilarious.
It's in the same building.

435
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,330
Oh yeah.
And you see if you talk in the elevator.

436
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,070
Right.
So,

437
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:55,904
uh,
so I got pulled in and asked to work on 

438
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:58,684
the National Security Council Transition
Team for General Flynn and my wife who 

439
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:05,750
has a background in the issues,
was pulled into work on the dhs q and a.

440
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,110
So I became part of the official 
transition team.

441
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,423
And up until the very last moment,
the week before maybe the week of the 

442
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:15,320
inauguration,
I was going to be doing counterterrorism

443
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,000
staff or General Flynn and the NSC.
And then Steve Bannon,

444
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,240
who knows me,
reaches out at the last minute.

445
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,820
So new,
they're going to come and work for me.

446
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,280
And the office of the chief strategist,
a strategist to the president.

447
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,900
And that's how,
you know,

448
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,820
at uh,
12.

449
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:31,654
Oh,
one on January the 20th I became a 

450
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,480
deputy assistant to the president.

451
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,890
Yeah.
So the second that happened,

452
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:39,020
basically the media just went bananas.
And I knew,

453
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:43,190
I mean every store I mentioned to you 
that right now the act where they went

454
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
bananas.
Was it even before that?

455
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,181
No,
no,

456
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:45,600
no,
no.

457
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,920
It's very interesting.
They didn't,

458
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:53,040
they didn't go bananas until the travel 
band dropped.

459
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,893
And I realized things were not going 
well in terms of communicating the 

460
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:58,674
travel ban.
So I said to Steve and I said to Sean 

461
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,440
guys,
I've done a bit of media in the past.

462
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,470
I can be the face of this stuff if you 
want.

463
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,540
I mean we've got the NSC communications 
team,

464
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,240
but I'm prepared to go on CNN and debate
these guys.

465
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,450
And so they threw me into the,
the,

466
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:16,051
you know,
the,

467
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,480
the fire.
And I loved it.

468
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,440
And the left went nuts.
They just absolutely went insane.

469
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,690
And it was once I was vehemently 
representing the president on television

470
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,450
that out came the hit pieces.
And the lights.

471
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,493
Yeah.
So let's talk about that a little bit 

472
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,074
because I see this happening to almost 
everyone that I have any degree of 

473
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:37,790
respect for.
I see it,

474
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,080
I see it.
It's coming.

475
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,820
It's coming to me now too.
I mean,

476
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:45,980
I see this to almost anyone that I think
is trying to be honest.

477
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,540
The endless effects.
I mean,

478
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,573
you know,
there were just endless slew of things 

479
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:52,640
that you're an anti Semite and all of 
this craziness.

480
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,250
I mean at the turning point event that I
saw you speak at,

481
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,100
you gave one of the strongest defenses 
of Israel that I've ever heard,

482
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,780
but they almost take everything and do 
the complete reverse of that.

483
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,103
What do you make of that tactic 
specifically where it's literally the 

484
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:09,470
reverse of what the truth is.
It's not just like we're going to take a

485
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,180
line and make it seem a little 
different.

486
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,130
We're do something that's absolutely.

487
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,390
You've got a big viewership.
I know your why.

488
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:20,810
I'm no longer a progressive thing.
Has got millions of views now.

489
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,113
And I'll,
I'll open up a little bit the spot size 

490
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,510
of your audience.
Um,

491
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,820
I have a reputation for being a scary 
dude and being a hot ass,

492
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,263
that's fine,
but after the seven months that I went 

493
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:41,830
through and my family went through,
every time,

494
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:42,664
every few weeks,
I have the same emotional response and 

495
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,820
it probably surprises your others as a 
human being.

496
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,380
I want to try and understand how another
human being who's never met me,

497
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,600
who knows nothing about me or what my 
family has been through,

498
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,300
can write what they wrote about me will 
say what they say about me.

499
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,973
It leaves me speechless that you can 
have such venomous hatred for somebody 

500
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,463
and pedal so egregious sets of lies.
And you not only call yourself a 

501
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:29,834
journalist,
but you actually think you're a human 

502
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:33,150
being.
Um,

503
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,603
I was attacked and that's fine because 
I'm a politically commissioned officer 

504
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,920
of the president.
I'm a proxy.

505
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,830
I was approximate for Steve as a proxy 
for the president.

506
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,510
I understand that.
That's okay,

507
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,703
but hey,
why don't we debate the policies they 

508
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:47,894
never wanted,
never wanted to debate the policies was 

509
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,850
ad hominem attacks and lives.
And secondly,

510
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,030
it's okay to attack me,
but guess what?

511
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,030
It's not a kate attack,
my wife.

512
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,943
It's not okay to attack my dead mother's
reputation and it's not okay to attack 

513
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:05,684
my teenage high school age son either 
these people are reprehensible and 

514
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:12,850
they're out of control,
David.

515
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,780
And then not learning the doubling down.

516
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,110
So that's the part that I'm concerned 
about right now that it seat.

517
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,610
People always asked me.
I did an event in Irvine last night and,

518
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,120
and the question I'm getting more and 
more now is,

519
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,983
is this thing turning around now?
I sense my sense is that there is 

520
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:34,880
something brewing against it.
There's something brewing finally,

521
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,000
and I think any of us in this space or a
little piece of it,

522
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,163
but to me it's going to get a lot worse 
before it gets better and that that's 

523
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,770
what I'm concerned about.
Uh,

524
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,340
you're already.
So I suspect

525
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,173
you,
under what conditions does something 

526
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:50,550
like that change.
If we rule out violence,

527
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,110
right?
We don't want to have violence.

528
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:52,944
Okay.
We've,

529
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:53,701
you know,
the,

530
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,430
the worst war we ever had was all civil 
war.

531
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,890
Okay?
Six hundred thousand Americans killed.

532
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,060
Even though they're subtly condoning 
violence,

533
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,080
CEO of twitter is condoning it.
Um,

534
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,700
so let's,
let's,

535
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,330
let's pray to the good Lord that that's 
not where we're going.

536
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,940
What's the other option?
What's the other scenario that they look

537
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:15,774
in the mirror and they stopped,
but one would thing they reward each 

538
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:23,850
other for the lies.
I mean,

539
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:28,410
look at Time Magazine's latest issue.
It's just a for Rango of lines.

540
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:31,050
It's all opinion pieces,
not journalism.

541
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,550
When they look at the people who they 
celebrate at their get togethers,

542
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,833
they're not journalists.
I mean there's maybe six journalists 

543
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,284
left in this country that are actually 
doing investigative research like Sarah 

544
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,430
Carter,
right?

545
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,263
Like Molly Hemingway.
When are they going to be recognized by 

546
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:52,050
the Washington press corps?
Never,

547
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,393
never,
because they don't comport with the 

548
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:59,571
narrative that we're Nazis.
And the president is a dictator.

549
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,740
This is a man whose grandchildren are 
orthodox Jews.

550
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,200
Can you wrap your heads around it?
New York Times,

551
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,550
CNN,
Huffington Post,

552
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,384
buzzfeed.
You'll reprehensible for calling this 

553
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,750
administration what you call it.
I know that he doesn't,

554
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,360
not that he doesn't have a racist bone 
in his body.

555
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:21,120
He doesn't have a racist molecule in his
body.

556
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,920
The stunning thing,
and this is,

557
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,953
this is what,
why it was such an honor to work for 

558
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:26,574
him.
The stunning thing about Donald trump 

559
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,680
is,
and look,

560
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,720
I got a Bible in my pocket.
I can swear on it.

561
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,520
I'll swear on this Bible.
This man wants only two things.

562
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:39,354
We're all Americans.
He wants you and your family to be safe 

563
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,073
and he wants you to prosper,
which is what all American president 

564
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,340
should want,
but you know it's starting,

565
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,174
David.

566
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,980
He wants that for you.
Whether or not you voted for him or not,

567
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,170
he doesn't care whether you voted for 
Hillary.

568
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:56,004
He doesn't care whether you want to burn
it all and he doesn't care whether you 

569
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,034
stayed at home and ate doritos.
If you're an American living here 

570
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,010
legally,
he wants you to be safe from harm,

571
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,210
from gangs,
from terrorism,

572
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,180
and he wants you to prosper like he has 
prospered.

573
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,510
And the left.
This is the answer to your question.

574
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,690
The left will never ever believed that.
Although it is true and I tested it.

575
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,610
So when they put you out there and as 
you said you.

576
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:23,861
No,
no,

577
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:24,090
no,
no,

578
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,541
no.
That,

579
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,650
that,
that's what it's all about,

580
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:26,580
right.
That's what it's all about.

581
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,414
What you just said there,
when they put you out there and as you 

582
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,280
said,
you willfully went out to,

583
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,540
to go for the,
for the ban the Muslim ban.

584
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,270
I when,
uh,

585
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,270
when we talked about it on our tour,
but I'm glad for it to their narrative.

586
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,633
Okay.
So we talked about it a bunch of the 

587
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,040
show.
I

588
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,110
did a bunch of videos.
I tried to be very fair.

589
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:44,983
I have Muslim friends,
I've had Muslims on the show and ex 

590
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:49,450
Muslims and I've had people that are 
critical of religion and people that are

591
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,520
religious in the whole freaking thing.
Look,

592
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,413
most of the countries,
the most of the most populous countries 

593
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,260
of Muslim people were not included on 
the band.

594
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,094
The original list,
the original list was Oklahoma by the 

595
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:00,970
Obama administration.
All that.

596
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,700
So I tried to talk about it as fairly as
possible,

597
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,534
but it seems to be one of those issues.
And then I think this will sort of lead 

598
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:08,614
us a little bit into your book as well,
talking about radical Islam and trying 

599
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:17,161
to make the distinction between Islam as
a set of ideas versus Muslims as people.

600
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:19,540
And of course you shouldn't be prejudice
and all of that.

601
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,430
This seems to be basically the stickiest
thing that we have going right now,

602
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:25,264
right?
Like the quicksand to even talk about 

603
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:27,904
it.

604
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,470
Okay.

605
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,990
Uh,
you mean the threat,

606
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,070
the threat of jihadism?
Well,

607
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,933
just trying to kind of things that are 
so well the quicksand of trying to make 

608
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:39,804
the distinction of we have to be able to
talk about ideas and what we have to 

609
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:44,370
fight for good ideas and against bad 
ideas,

610
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,580
but at the same time make sure that 
we're not being prejudice towards people

611
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:50,430
and making sure that America remains the
open plurals,

612
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,170
pluralistic society that it is.

613
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,760
Look at the argument in,
in my book,

614
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,240
different jihad is a very simple one.
Um,

615
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,613
we live in the only country ever created
on the principle of individual freedom 

616
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,810
and liberties and granted to us,
not by the government,

617
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,180
but by our creative because we are made 
in his image,

618
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,870
not the founding fathers said you are,
you have dignity because you all made in

619
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,704
the image of the creator,
not because Washington says you have 

620
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:16,864
dignity.
And that concept of the individual's 

621
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,753
dignity and the freedom that it provides
is antithetical to the spectrum of 

622
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:33,060
politics that says manage perfectible 
and perfection can be created in real.

623
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,310
My first degree was philosophy and 
theology.

624
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,790
And I study,
uh,

625
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,070
this event here in California.
All politics can be,

626
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,740
can be all ideological differences can 
be summarized in just two camps.

627
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,050
It doesn't matter which country you're 
in or what era,

628
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,063
two camps,
those that believe truth is objective 

629
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
and not manmade.

630
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,870
And those who say no man can define 
truth and perfection can be created here

631
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,704
on earth.
This statement that man defines truth 

632
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,220
leads to the gas chambers and to the 
gulags.

633
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,420
Okay?
Now,

634
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,250
social justice warriors don't realize 
that they're walking down the same path,

635
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,480
but it's the same concept to say,
I'm going to perfect the world and there

636
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,210
will be justice and equality.
No,

637
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,980
you won't.
If we are free,

638
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,330
there will never be justice for all and 
equality for all,

639
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,180
as long as we are free because evil is 
real.

640
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,343
Evil exists.
Man is fallen and jihadism is just the 

641
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,160
latest version.
Like my book is a very simple argument.

642
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,093
There is a connective tissue between al 
Qaeda and Isis and the Nazis of the 

643
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,640
Third Reich and the comments of the 
Soviet Union.

644
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,723
Yes,
they watch different things on worship 

645
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:45,710
and Erin Rice when we should work in 
class,

646
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:47,600
the other worship,
that version of Islam,

647
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,230
but guess what?

648
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,063
The connective tissues,
they're all totalitarians and if you 

649
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:53,120
disagree with them,
guess what?

650
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,020
You're going to be enslaved or murdered.
End of story and if you.

651
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:59,660
If you deny that reality,
I've trained,

652
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,710
I don't know,
six,

653
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,690
$7,000
federal officers.

654
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,090
I've trained more than that in the 
military.

655
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:10,670
When the military professional and FBI 
agent understands that his government is

656
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:15,410
telling him what he can or cannot say 
about the threat group is supposed to be

657
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,244
protecting us from then we have problems
when President Obama says in a 2011 

658
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:23,114
writes a memo to the chairman of the 
joint chiefs and the then attorney 

659
00:33:25,581 --> 00:33:26,414
general all counter terrorism training 
of FBI agents and the US military must 

660
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:34,850
not mention Islam and especially must 
not mention the word Jihad.

661
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,463
Well,
that's like saying we're about to storm 

662
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:41,480
the Normandy beaches and guys make sure 
you're [inaudible] one's loaded and your

663
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:43,910
boots are tied up,
but whatever you do,

664
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,870
don't mention the word Nazi because you 
could offend a German.

665
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,420
It's a bad snl skit,
David.

666
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,643
It's insanity and the fact that we 
weren't allowed to talk about it 

667
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:56,450
truthfully,
that gets people killed.

668
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,710
Political correctness

669
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,280
eventually can lead to good people 
dying,

670
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:06,320
so that also explains why there's such 
craziness in Europe right now.

671
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:06,860
Right?
I mean,

672
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,693
we're going to see.
It seems to me that we're going to 

673
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:12,740
consistently see the rise of right or 
far right parties,

674
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,860
but it really is just the symptom of not
being able to talk about these issues.

675
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:19,020
Honestly.

676
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,480
Let's differentiate between the rise of 
two different things.

677
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,380
Okay.
So,

678
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:24,480
um,
we've just had an election in Hungary.

679
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,270
We've seen the elections in Italy and 
elsewhere and we've seen brexit.

680
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,380
Let's don't conflate two issues.
There's the rise of very disturbing,

681
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,273
uh,
groups like your back in Hungary that 

682
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:36,640
are really crypto nationalists and,
and feed off a,

683
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,900
a long seated antisemitic kind of era 
dentist,

684
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,900
a sentiment in the country.
So these are the true

685
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,820
sort of.
They're not all white nationalists,

686
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:47,440
but the true sort of,
they want ethno state and they want,

687
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,030
right?

688
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,010
Well,
it's complicated because as history that

689
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:52,870
has tree and on this side,
but that big.

690
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah,
little nuggets.

691
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,650
Okay.
Then that you mustn't conflate that with

692
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,070
the trump phenomena and things like 
brexit,

693
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,650
original,
a causation,

694
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,330
and I don't even use the word populism.
I reject the word populism,

695
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,740
unless your definition is part of 
populism is a,

696
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,510
those kinds of politics that the elite 
disagrees with.

697
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,003
Good.
Definitely.

698
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm pretty sure that's not the standard 
for me.

699
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,860
This isn't populism that trump winning 
or brexit happening.

700
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,020
This is a reassertion of democracy.
I mean why?

701
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,700
Why did trump occur?
Because people on the left and the right

702
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:32,640
looked at DC and said,
you know,

703
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:34,260
I don't know the difference between 
Sunni and Shia,

704
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,510
but guess what?
It's broken.

705
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,250
I don't know what a federal

706
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,083
budget should look like,
but we were spending like drunken 

707
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:41,454
sailors,
so it's the reassertion of accountable 

708
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:44,784
politics,
vice faceless bureaucracy or uni party 

709
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,080
swamp to others,
whether they're in DC or whether they're

710
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,850
in Brussels.
So for me it should be.

711
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,893
We should welcome it with open arms.
This is a reassertion of accountable 

712
00:35:58,771 --> 00:35:59,604
government,
but for the left that wants uniformity 

713
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:04,770
of thought and bigger government.
It's fascism.

714
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,500
So how does the,
how do then does the right.

715
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,873
How do you police that?
I know that you don't like that idea of 

716
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:12,500
policing and government coming in fixing
it,

717
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,343
but how do you make sure that the part 
that you're worried about doesn't lead 

718
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:19,470
to the good part?
Because I think from the way,

719
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,950
at least from the way I see it,
the left is always lead now by its worst

720
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,230
parts,
so for them,

721
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,410
that's why they purge everybody.

722
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,090
The video that you mentioned that I did,
I'm praying for you.

723
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:27,901
That's what I talked about.
I mean,

724
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:28,734
anyone that steps out of group think you
get purged and that's why I think 

725
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:32,724
there's such a movement towards 
libertarianism or classical liberalism 

726
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,770
or whatever you wanna call it,
so I see what the left's doing on that.

727
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:38,604
How do you make sure that doesn't happen
on the right where the far right that 

728
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:41,874
you were worried about,
you think it's fair estimation to call 

729
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:44,540
it fire,
right?

730
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,880
Yeah.
I don't even like the alt right.

731
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,570
I think it's bogus.
I think those are just.

732
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,760
That's a new label for nationalist or or
or,

733
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,490
or incidental bigots.
All right.

734
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:56,640
That's a reader that re wrapping 
themselves to be solid.

735
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:59,210
Faith will be fit for polite company.
Well,

736
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,053
I hate to tell you,
I hate to tell you on your wikipedia 

737
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,910
page,
it calls you all right.

738
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,680
Of course.
Right.

739
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,793
And offset the page.
That doesn't allow the subject to 

740
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,380
correct when I try and correct the lies.
It's frozen.

741
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:14,790
Interesting.
Wikipedia you.

742
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,624
I told you right before we started,
but your wikipedia out of all of the 

743
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,020
ones that.
Because I usually just glance there,

744
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,863
not for fact,
but just to get a sense of what's going 

745
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:23,070
on.
Yours is such a mess.

746
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,540
It's.
I've tried.

747
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,820
I've tried to correct the friends who 
have tried to correct it.

748
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,370
Then they froze it and then forget about
it.

749
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,204
Yeah.
So what do you do though to make sure 

750
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,350
that those two songs don't come?
We need to spine.

751
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,580
So those of us that have a podium,
those that are out there,

752
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:43,581
those that wish to see the principles we
believe in in terms of the founding come

753
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:44,604
back and be celebrated in this country.
We have to call them out like we don't 

754
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:50,310
believe that you use legislation.

755
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,960
I mean hate speech.
Give me a break.

756
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,670
I mean,
either you're inciting violence,

757
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,504
so you will not,
either you're committing a crime or 

758
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,900
you're not.
We don't need extra labels and we don't.

759
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:01,460
It's censorship.
Call them out for what they need.

760
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,750
People on the right hand side.
You know what?

761
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,210
He's a racist.
That.

762
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:06,840
All right.
Think that's just bigotry.

763
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,650
That's just the KKK wrapped up in a new 
bow.

764
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,590
It's up to us.
Do you think that's happening?

765
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,130
That's not gonna do it,
right?

766
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:14,964
They're going to use it.
You want to use those people to silence 

767
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,160
the majority.
Do you think that went not enough?

768
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,810
Not Enough,
but by far,

769
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,540
um,
we have um,

770
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,630
begun,
but there's a lot of work to do.

771
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,883
Yeah.
Does everything that's happening in 

772
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:31,284
Europe right now and there's definitely 
a distinction to be made between what's 

773
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,160
happening in eastern Europe.
Western Europe

774
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,980
and Eastern Europe I think is dealing 
with some of their existential crisis.

775
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:40,814
He's a little bit better perhaps because
western Europe still a little behind on 

776
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,250
the political correctness stuff that 
you're talking about.

777
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,190
Does everything that's happening in 
Europe right now?

778
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:50,770
Does it all come down to immigration,
do you think?

779
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,520
No,
no,

780
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,803
no.
Uh,

781
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,000
immigration,
uh,

782
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,270
was the blue touch paper on the 
firework?

783
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,300
No,
it's,

784
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,240
it's the death of representative 
democracy.

785
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,663
I mean,
I watched this because I grew up in the 

786
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:10,940
UK under Margaret Thatcher.
For me,

787
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,013
Maggie,
the Gipper blessed St John Paul the 

788
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:17,270
second.
These were my heroes.

789
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,193
I remember riding to school on the bus 
in the morning in west London and the 

790
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:26,024
bus driver would be Jamaican.
I'd be with my Indian or Pakistani 

791
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:31,580
school body I with,
with this Polish guy next to me.

792
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:32,414
I mean it's super hydrogenous part of 
London and as far as far as I was 

793
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,980
concerned,
these are all Brits.

794
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,830
The guy must've might've had the 
thickest Jamaican accent possible.

795
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,610
My,
my,

796
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,190
my friend Martin's mom cooked the best 
Indian cars,

797
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,780
but guess what?
We're all British.

798
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,220
Yeah,
that's gone.

799
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,930
You know,
when Tony Black came in,

800
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,210
when Clinton came in,
this idea that,

801
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:51,044
you know,
the West is guilty and words like 

802
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:55,784
British,
a pejorative to your wealth or whatever 

803
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,930
that was the death of these countries.
I mean,

804
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:06,920
why do you think I'm in America?
I'm a proud American citizen now because

805
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,153
they lost the plot.
The things that the Gi guys that fought 

806
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:16,961
for that,
the Tommy's fought for make safe spaces,

807
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,893
really got 19 year olds that are being 
blown up over Berlin and bomber planes 

808
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:27,420
and you want a safe space.
This is in a space of 70 years.

809
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,210
I mean,
what's going on in London right now?

810
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,070
Here's the line of Churchill.

811
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,890
Yeah,
it's shocking.

812
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,150
So I saw,
I'm sure you saw this,

813
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:38,580
but just in the last couple of weeks 
they said London's crime.

814
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,270
Violent crime has now surpassed New York
cities for the first time in history.

815
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,100
And then Cindy Kahn,
who's the mayor,

816
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,440
a statement saying,
you can't carry knives.

817
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:47,161
I mean,
first off,

818
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,780
people are walking out with Swiss army 
knives,

819
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,550
a woman that might want to protect 
herself.

820
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:53,610
My one have a knife in her pocket.
I mean it.

821
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,220
It seems like a mass mental disorder to 
me,

822
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,820
but that's what happens.
That is the natural progression when you

823
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:04,660
deny objective truth.
If everything is plastic,

824
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,713
then you will get wrapped around your 
own act solely in absurdities and for 

825
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,670
for mayor of one of the most powerful 
cities in the world of financial centers

826
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:17,671
to say no one should ever have a knife 
on them and nobody needs a knife.

827
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,370
So every plumber,
every tradesman,

828
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:25,030
every person working at the fish market 
is suddenly out of a job.

829
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,820
So conduit,
insane.

830
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,713
So what does your Britain or Europe in a
wider sense have to do to reverse the 

831
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,070
tide on

832
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,210
some of this stuff?
I mean,

833
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,800
Nigel Farrage,
I dunno.

834
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,653
I mean it's lucky that the saying and 
crops up in every nation and every 

835
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:43,970
country deserves the politicians.
They elect.

836
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,213
Don't bitch and Moan.
Get up the street where I live outside 

837
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:53,280
DC.
I mean you're the conservatives who's so

838
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,860
fed up and they're constantly posting 
stuff on facebook.

839
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,320
What have you done to do something about
it?

840
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,143
Have you gone out with leaflets?
Have you given more than $5 to a local 

841
00:42:03,991 --> 00:42:05,920
candidate?
Have you given up and surrender?

842
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,310
I see this all the time that people who 
say,

843
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,020
well,
greatest nation on earth,

844
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,340
and then they said,
well,

845
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:15,060
you know,
we're going purple and bureaucrats moved

846
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,940
in and what are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

847
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,300
Would you have said that in 17,
76,

848
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,750
the founding fathers have said,
what are you going to do?

849
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,970
No.

850
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:26,803
Is this just a symptom of the success of
the West that we've just become so 

851
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,034
successful that you're right.
We kind of sit there and we sit on 

852
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:35,990
twitter and we complain all day,
but we're all talking.

853
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:38,270
We're not doing anything like it's all 
talk.

854
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:41,690
It's not do a.
it's much more than that.

855
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,680
It's deep.
I mean,

856
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,270
I.
I went to the Jesuits.

857
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:47,390
I studied philosophy under them.
It was painful,

858
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:49,310
but I will,
I won't regret a minute of it.

859
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:56,170
Identity is a function of history and 
culture and values and if,

860
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,910
if you don't study Western civilization 
and your schools colleges,

861
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,963
this is what happens.
If you don't understand why people have 

862
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:10,970
dignity,
just that they do.

863
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,800
Oh,
unless that conservatives,

864
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,083
right.
This is where you arrive at and and you 

865
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,800
know who's responsible for this.
I don't play in the Left,

866
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,840
David.
This is not the.

867
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,750
This is not the left's culpability.
It's ours.

868
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,930
It's the conservatives.
The radicals,

869
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,063
when they saw Paris and fire in 1968,
believed that they could do the segment 

870
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,703
America,
that we could have a left wing 

871
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:34,634
revolution.
This is what your students were 

872
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:38,360
democratic society believed,
and when Bernadine,

873
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:43,361
dohrn and bill as took over the SDS and 
try to execute the Chicago days of rage.

874
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:48,380
What happened?
Because Americans are not rabble rousing

875
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,670
a leftists.
It died.

876
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,500
It was a damp squib article there.

877
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,410
Maoist revolution.
The,

878
00:43:56,411 --> 00:43:57,171
the.
What was it?

879
00:43:57,171 --> 00:44:00,410
The prairie fire manifesto died 
instantly.

880
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,730
So what did they decide?
They'd read that Trotsky.

881
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:05,860
They'd read their lending.
They even knew.

882
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:06,783
Hitler said,
give me that children and our own their 

883
00:44:08,731 --> 00:44:09,564
future.
So these people actually became tenured 

884
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:14,750
professors in Chicago.
They became high school teachers.

885
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,990
And what did we do on the right?
We let them.

886
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,980
People who are avowedly believe America 
is evil.

887
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:27,230
We're allowed to influence our education
system to the point at which they pretty

888
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,650
much owned it.
But with exceptional,

889
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,040
your hillsdale and grove city,
they own the education

890
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,770
system.
And what was our response?

891
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,350
Homeschooling.
Great.

892
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,220
I love the movement,
but you're not going to save,

893
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,230
but that ain't,
that ain't enough.

894
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,160
Yeah.
So,

895
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,020
um,
it's gonna be a hard slog.

896
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,240
It's going to be 20,
30 years of saying guys,

897
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,690
America means this and it's nothing to 
do with your skin color.

898
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,430
It's nothing to do with your sexual 
preference,

899
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
your social class,
your gender.

900
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,320
America is eternal values and that's,
that's gonna be a lot of work.

901
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,213
Alright.
So I want to shift a little bit to 

902
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,840
foreign policy because I think that sort
of a,

903
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,290
one of your,
one of your.

904
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,930
Would you say that's one of your main 
strengths?

905
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:09,764
So my,
my,

906
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,660
my claim to fame is counter terrorism 
and stuff like this.

907
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:13,494
But,
but really deep down I'm a strategy 

908
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:17,220
wank.
Grand Strategy is my thing.

909
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,330
Okay.
So we'll talk.

910
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,190
We'll talk in the language and strategy 
then.

911
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,980
So as we're taping this right now,
I mentioned earlier,

912
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:24,820
it's gonna,
it's gonna sit on the shelf for a couple

913
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:25,654
of days,
so I don't want to get too lost in 

914
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:28,164
anything that happened today,
but at the moment it's a little upside 

915
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:30,924
down in Syria.
We know there might've been strikes 

916
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:33,144
already from when we're taping this.
A hungry just had elections in your 

917
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,304
wikipedia that I referenced earlier.
It says you worked for the guy who just 

918
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,380
won you.
Apparently you never worked for him.

919
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:46,490
He told his potty.
I wasn't victim to Audubon's advising,

920
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,540
which is what it says on Wikipedia at 
least.

921
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,531
Um,
what,

922
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:53,130
what's your general thoughts on foreign 
policy strategy?

923
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:58,131
Like what is a sensible policy and 
Eddie's trump applying that view?

924
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,660
Uh,
first things first.

925
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,050
Uh,
the great irony of all nation is that we

926
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:06,300
are the most powerful nation in the 
world has ever seen.

927
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,170
And until recently we have been the 
dumbest and most a strategic.

928
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,213
I mean we haven't done,
we haven't thought or acted 

929
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,163
strategically since about 1989.
November the ninth when the Berlin Wall 

930
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:19,210
fell.
And,

931
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,130
and this is,
you know,

932
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,000
how have we acted?
What,

933
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,040
what would you say that since then,
it's just nineties was just this kind of

934
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:30,550
confused.
What is national security about lurching

935
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,463
for the snooze button,
just who are the threats is that China 

936
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:36,450
is a weapons of mass destruction and say
you just love it.

937
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,433
It was just a mess.
And then we had 2001 and nine slash 11 

938
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,860
and we had just as neo-con disasters,
it's not an accident.

939
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:47,034
These guys were former trotskyites 
because they're so naive the way they 

940
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:50,754
look at the world that we're going to 
create democracy at the end of a gun 

941
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,953
barrel in a country with 36 languages 
that defeated Alexander the Great and 

942
00:46:59,611 --> 00:47:03,870
the British empire and the Soviets.
You couldn't be stupid or if you tried.

943
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,973
So,
you know,

944
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,600
we,
we've done some very,

945
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:10,020
very foolish things because we haven't 
stuck to the basics.

946
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,990
Strategy at the end of the day is about 
one thing.

947
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,860
It's about prioritization based upon 
interests.

948
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,730
But you've got to say some things are 
more important than others.

949
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,623
And guess what?
Some countries are more important than 

950
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,490
others.
And in a postmodern secular world,

951
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:28,870
you'll not allowed or no countries,
oh,

952
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,070
Vanuatu is as

953
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,903
important as Turkey wrong.
It's not that I love the people that a 

954
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,121
while too,
but no,

955
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:37,900
it's not a geo strategic import to the,
to the country of America.

956
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,943
So number one,
we have to prioritize and I think this 

957
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,064
administration,
I dock my cap to Nadia shadow a HR 

958
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,693
mcmasters deputy.
She held the pen in the meetings that I 

959
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:51,310
was in on the new national security 
strategy of America.

960
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,390
And I tell you David,
it is the first document of that name in

961
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,930
steady is that deserves the name 
national security strategy.

962
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:01,510
Every administration has them.
This is the first one that says,

963
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,970
this is what we stand for.
These are our values,

964
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,833
these are our friends,
these are our enemies and this is what 

965
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:08,560
we're going to prioritize.
Prior to that,

966
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:12,010
it was laundry lists of,
well we're going to have to front walls,

967
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:14,460
we're going to save the whales and you 
know know.

968
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,180
So you have to prioritize.
And finally this administration is about

969
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:22,570
America first.
We are not isolationists,

970
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,523
nor are we interventionists.
This is really annoys me that if you're 

971
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:29,890
a conservative for 20 years you were 
given two options,

972
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,830
button a invade other people's countries
and occupy them button.

973
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Be be a Randy Sta and close the curtains
on the Pacific and the Atlantic and say,

974
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,753
we don't care about anybody else.
Well guess what is the most powerful 

975
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:47,950
nation in the world?
There is a large pallet of options.

976
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,300
It's got to be something in the middle 
there.

977
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,030
Yeah,
so it's about being smart.

978
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:57,190
It's about our interests and it.
To summarize the president's approach,

979
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,840
this isn't official,
but I like it.

980
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:03,550
We have numerous former generals and 
active generals from the Marine Corps at

981
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:05,800
the highest level of administration 
showed the joint chiefs,

982
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,690
Chief of staff,
secretary defense.

983
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,853
And the interesting thing is they all 
come from the same Marine Corps 

984
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:12,240
division,
not just the Marine Corps,

985
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,150
the same division.

986
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,580
And that division has a motto,
no better friend,

987
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,090
no worse enemy.
That's America first.

988
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,550
So when you see someone like John Bolton
a now part of the cabinet,

989
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,680
and if you were to look on,
you know,

990
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:31,360
not that you can get truth out of 
twitter,

991
00:49:31,361 --> 00:49:33,520
but the day it was happening,
you know,

992
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,563
everybody's saying this is going to 
start world war three and just the 

993
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:37,534
general hysterics.
And now John Bolton is definitely 

994
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,680
suspect more of a neocon than you're 
comfortable with it.

995
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,553
Is that.
I don't think it's fair to Chordoma 

996
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,700
Naoko.
I don't,

997
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,880
I don't,
I don't think he's ideologically driven.

998
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,050
If you watch the videos that he know 
recording of his speech is 20 years ago,

999
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,260
he was certainly very much like trump.
We're America and we have interests.

1000
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:57,200
You want to work with us,
fight.

1001
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,570
If you don't,
there's a problem.

1002
00:49:58,571 --> 00:49:59,400
So,
um,

1003
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,233
and I think it's very telling that 
within 40 minutes of the president's 

1004
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:05,500
tweet about John Coming on board,
um,

1005
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,393
massive bulk and gave an interview on 
Fox and they asked him about what are 

1006
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:11,690
you going to be like as a national 
security advisor?

1007
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:16,390
And he gave a very interesting onset.
He could've Dean Acheson and you know,

1008
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:16,741
the,
the,

1009
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:20,370
the doyen of foreign policy in America,
and uh,

1010
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,213
I don't know if this is true story,
but John said the natural one was once 

1011
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,380
asked,
how do you have such a good relationship

1012
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:27,650
with the president in serve

1013
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,410
Indian actress and said,
well,

1014
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:34,430
it's very easy.
We may disagree on policy issues,

1015
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,960
but at the end of the day,
I never forget who was elected president

1016
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:42,770
and it wasn't me.
That's a John Bolton two point.

1017
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:43,604
Oh,
he understands that unlike his 

1018
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:45,554
predecessor hr mcmaster,
he's not there to lecture the president 

1019
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,240
or forced his version of what you should
do onto the commodity and chief.

1020
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,343
He's at to be an honest broker and 
provide a palate of options because 

1021
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:00,230
guess who gets to decide the person who 
was elected president.

1022
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:02,710
So I'm very excited about John and I,
I'm,

1023
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,853
I'm as excited about Mike pompeo coming 
from the CIA to the State Department 

1024
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,920
that we are in.
Very good hands,

1025
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,570
David.
So how do you make sure,

1026
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:14,160
if it's between the pure isolationists 
and,

1027
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,020
and the neocons or something,
something like the nation builder,

1028
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,780
something like that.
How do you make sure that not everything

1029
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:24,740
that you do outside of our borders 
becomes something much bigger?

1030
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,131
I mean,
look,

1031
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:29,010
we're still at war in Afghanistan.
I don't think anyone knows why.

1032
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,840
I mean,
can you,

1033
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,820
can you tell me why we're at war in 
Afghanistan?

1034
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:32,654
Can anyone tell me why we went,
why we went to Afghanistan in October 

1035
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,211
of,
uh,

1036
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:40,640
one is the only reason we should be that
today.

1037
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,900
Nothing's changed.
Okay.

1038
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,720
The idea that goes go to school.
I love it.

1039
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,613
I get it that people can listen to music
freely and the Taliban won't execute 

1040
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,600
you.
My parents lived on the communism.

1041
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,493
My father suffered under fascism.
He protected his fellow Jewish 

1042
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:56,600
classmates during the occupation of 
Budapest.

1043
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:58,910
I get it.
I don't like those kinds of systems,

1044
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,373
but there's only one reason why they 
were there to make sure that that piece 

1045
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:07,661
of land that would never ever again be 
used to execute mass casualty attacks in

1046
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,224
Manhattan,
in Washington or in a field in 

1047
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,134
Pennsylvania.

1048
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,183
End of story.
It's not about building a ring road 

1049
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,180
around Kabul.
The not even the Soviets could finish.

1050
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,810
It's not about building hospitals.
I'm sorry you never make the ideal,

1051
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:21,644
the enemy of the good.
What the president does is he looks at 

1052
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:25,124
things as questions of possibility.
You cannot be a massively successful 

1053
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:33,020
realtor in the toughest market in the 
world,

1054
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:33,854
which is New York real estate.
If you have a filter that distorts 

1055
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:37,934
reality,
I mean either this square footage is 

1056
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:40,514
worth x or it's not worth x according to
the market and that's how he approaches 

1057
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:47,690
these issues.
So Afghanistan is only important to make

1058
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:51,180
sure that bad guys don't use it again to
kill Americans in America.

1059
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:52,580
So.
So you would say,

1060
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:56,060
or at least if you were,
if you had to guesstimate basically what

1061
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:56,894
he believes you would say that he 
believes that still keeping us there at 

1062
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:01,490
the moment is still accomplishing.

1063
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,573
Oh,
I don't have to get somebody tell you 

1064
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:03,920
that.
Yeah.

1065
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:07,660
So you believe that as well because he 
just seems unclear and it has nothing to

1066
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:08,600
do.
He will.

1067
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,170
He will never.
I tend to write this 71 year old man who

1068
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:12,470
is now the most powerful man in the 
world,

1069
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,210
will never,
ever,

1070
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:19,510
ever buy into a nation building scenario
anywhere outside of the United States.

1071
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,703
Not happening for the next seven years.
End of story and the idea that you have 

1072
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,770
my followers on twitter,
tearing their hair out,

1073
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,083
the boltons going to invade Syria guys,
get a grip on reality and stop talking 

1074
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:40,560
about crisis actors and 10 fall how to 
garbage.

1075
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,320
It's not gonna happen while the 
president's the president.

1076
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,213
Well that I tweeted something to that 
effect the day of the Bolton thing 

1077
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,154
because it also reminds me that people 
don't understand basic deterrence that 

1078
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,420
you have to bring in people that you 
know,

1079
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,390
talk a big game.

1080
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,580
So that pronounced to arrange these.
Hello?

1081
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,280
Right.
The man who was going to take us to war,

1082
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:02,880
what did he do?
I think the success in North Korea today

1083
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,953
has in large part been been a thanks to 
his tweets because that's how you deal 

1084
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,580
with dictators.
You make fun of them.

1085
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,440
They hate that.
And then you were ridiculed him.

1086
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,910
Right?
And then you do what you scare them.

1087
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,530
Oh,
Lo and behold,

1088
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:22,380
they want to negotiate for the first 
time in 65 years.

1089
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:23,400
Well,
isn't that interesting?

1090
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,430
Do you think there's any chance he would
ever give up his nukes?

1091
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,170
About three percent because at that 
point,

1092
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:32,790
what leverage does he have left?
Right?

1093
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:33,683
So that you still think it's worth 
having the talks to figure out what we 

1094
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:37,351
can.
Absolutely.

1095
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:39,480
Because what's happened for the last 25 
years?

1096
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,800
Escalation,
escalation,

1097
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:41,634
escalation.
I mean we,

1098
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,580
we have given into nuclear blackmail 
since Bill Clinton.

1099
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:45,790
Uh,
so yeah,

1100
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,830
we have to at the end of the day,
we have to remember 1953 was not a peace

1101
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:54,080
treaty in 1953 in Korea was a ceasefire 
and an armistice and that,

1102
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,780
that is actually a wall that's just 
simply been frozen for 65 years.

1103
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,720
Will be nice to have a little bit of a 
peace treaty or something.

1104
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,733
Yeah.
How much of what's happening in the 

1105
00:55:03,961 --> 00:55:06,480
world right now?
Do you?

1106
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:09,300
You must be thrilled,
I assume with everything going on at the

1107
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:12,720
UN,
Nikki Haley as basically walked in there

1108
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:14,570
and John Bolton two point.
Oh yeah.

1109
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,241
Yeah.
I mean,

1110
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:17,960
she strikes me as.
I almost wondered,

1111
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:19,920
did trump really know what he was 
getting with?

1112
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,030
Ideally?
Yeah.

1113
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:22,440
Did anyone know?
Anybody did?

1114
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,211
Yeah,
we're,

1115
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:24,540
we're going to do,
do you know her at all?

1116
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:25,670
Where do you think that,
that kind of.

1117
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:27,210
I don't know her as a friend.
Um,

1118
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,610
she found herself.

1119
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,940
She found herself in more power to her.
What,

1120
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:35,040
what usefulness do you see in the UN at 
this point?

1121
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,830
Because it seems like truly it seems 
like the most corrupt should be backward

1122
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,310
pushed into the river.
I mean really,

1123
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,173
I,
well the buildings basically other now 

1124
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:48,120
they're going to quote that and go,
you see,

1125
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:51,600
he was calling for him to be knocking.
Look,

1126
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,040
the idea was a good idea in 1945 in San 
Francisco,

1127
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,700
let's have an organization that stops us
from killing 60 million people again.

1128
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,123
Um,
but when you look in dictatorships like 

1129
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:09,384
China and Russia into the Security 
Council with veto power and then you 

1130
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:18,480
create this,
this empire of UN organizations,

1131
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,613
I mean,
has that been a year in the last 20 

1132
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,560
years that we haven't seen a UN scandal?

1133
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,813
Whether it's money for oil,
whether it's UN troops raping children 

1134
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,254
in Africa?
Have we seen it one year without a UN 

1135
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:33,070
scandal?
I don't think so.

1136
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:37,520
So try and reform it.
And if you come with a question,

1137
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:39,430
the validity of what it does.
I forget.

1138
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:40,300
I'm not talking about,
you know,

1139
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:40,751
the,
the,

1140
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:41,584
the,
the children's rights organizations and 

1141
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,130
food,
food security.

1142
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,040
I'm talking about its main mission which
is stability and safety.

1143
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,870
Failed abysmally.
Yeah.

1144
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,793
What,
what do you make of the endless 

1145
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:52,244
obsession with Israel that something 
like 47 of the last 51 resolutions are 

1146
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,330
against Israel and usually voted on by 
countries.

1147
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,483
Sorry,
but that alone is a reason to dissolve 

1148
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:04,990
the UN mean what a lack of moral 
compass.

1149
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,620
What an utter bankruptcy of the morality
that there are nations in the world that

1150
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,783
actually still have slavery going on.
Slavery where we're basic human rights 

1151
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:23,850
for individuals are not guaranteed based
upon sex based upon lifestyle choices.

1152
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,970
And you're going to lambast Israel the 
only democracy in the Middle East.

1153
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:32,931
Yeah,
I think.

1154
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:34,140
I think you nailed it.
I mean that,

1155
00:57:34,141 --> 00:57:39,141
that in and of itself is a reason enough
to question the future of the UN.

1156
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,880
So is the US sort of in an odd position 
where it's like if we don't do anything,

1157
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:45,980
nothing can get done sort of.
And that,

1158
00:57:45,981 --> 00:57:50,360
that then puts us endlessly in these 
quagmires or at least in these positions

1159
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:51,194
where we can either watch the world burn
or get involved in things where we may 

1160
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:56,540
end up adding to the burning in the 
first place.

1161
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:58,090
Like for example,
you know,

1162
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,110
with Russia going into Crimea,
you know,

1163
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:01,940
they gave up their weapons,
right?

1164
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:03,220
They gave up the weapons.
They said alright,

1165
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,920
NATO is going to take care of us,
but what that really means is the United

1166
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,753
States is going to take care of you.
And I'm not saying we should have gone 

1167
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:13,520
in and done anything there,
but that we're in this endless situation

1168
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:17,450
now where it is either us there,
there is no international fighting.

1169
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,733
Yeah,
you're super careful not to get caught 

1170
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:21,734
in a binary dichotomy.
You can absolutely say a world without 

1171
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:27,824
American leadership is a more dangerous 
world because it was for the last eight 

1172
00:58:30,651 --> 00:58:31,484
years.
Look,

1173
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,760
I mean we had a government that actually
said we're going to lead from behind,

1174
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,220
which is an oxymoron.
You cannot lead from behind.

1175
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,413
We're going to have strategic patients,
which means we do nothing and allow 

1176
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,910
others to act.
What happened?

1177
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:49,600
You name it from China building fate,
ministry basis on fake islands to isis,

1178
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:52,460
to Russia invading.
It was just a disaster.

1179
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,990
We back the guy,
the other guys and Rebecca.

1180
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,333
So yeah,
to say that a world without American 

1181
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:01,100
leadership is,
is more dangerous,

1182
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:02,563
is true,
but that doesn't mean that we have to 

1183
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:09,161
fix everybody's problem and that's where
smart strategy comes in where you say,

1184
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:14,990
but we have a moral duty to espouse 
certain values,

1185
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,210
but that doesn't mean we are responsible
for all human beings because.

1186
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,850
Because American revolution says the 
opposite,

1187
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,220
right?
Each nation is responsible,

1188
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:29,060
the citizens are responsible if you 
don't like your system,

1189
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,133
do something about it because guess what
we did against the most powerful empire 

1190
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:35,540
in the world.
So,

1191
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,500
um,
again,

1192
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,453
it's about finding that,
that happy medium in the middle and 

1193
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:41,300
being smart about it.
And again,

1194
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,290
without being callous,
being realistic,

1195
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:46,503
right?
There are atrocities everywhere from 

1196
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:52,871
Orlando to Yugoslavia,
part American taxpayers going to pay for

1197
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:56,030
fixing all of them.
Are we responsible?

1198
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,090
Are they responsible for what's 
happening in their country?

1199
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,720
Sure are the times when we could perhaps
help them,

1200
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,230
but it's a balance to balance.
All right,

1201
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,780
so let's shift back to your book 
defeating Jihad.

1202
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,643
It seems to me that the main sort of 
narrative on this is not that we can 

1203
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,820
defeat it,
but we should live with it,

1204
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,100
that there's a degree of it with which 
we should just live,

1205
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,150
which is don't carry knives in London 
and it's,

1206
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,400
you know,
we're going to put up more barricades so

1207
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:26,234
the trucks can't be driven into 
buildings or into shopping centers or 

1208
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:29,714
just down the street and killing people 
that we can't really defeat this 

1209
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,970
ideology.
We just have to manage it.

1210
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,853
Right.
I suspect you do not agree with that 

1211
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:40,040
premise because we've defeated 
ideologies before.

1212
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,393
You can't look.
There are idiots who run around with 

1213
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,770
swastika arm bands today.
I get it.

1214
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:46,604
So Nazi-ism hasn't disappeared,
but we have made it so anathema that if 

1215
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:53,330
you walk down the street with a Nazi 
flag,

1216
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,390
you will be rejected by society 
instantly.

1217
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:58,490
The same thing with the KKK,
right?

1218
01:00:58,910 --> 01:00:59,743
Sadly,
not with Che Guevara was a hammer and 

1219
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:02,271
sickle.
Right,

1220
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:02,651
right,
right.

1221
01:01:02,651 --> 01:01:03,484
But,
but there are ways to defeat ideologies 

1222
01:01:05,631 --> 01:01:10,400
or to put them in a box where the La 
football and everybody shuns them.

1223
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,770
We have to do the same thing with 
jihadism.

1224
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,380
This is my argument.
This is the conclusion of the book.

1225
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,350
We have to be as effective in dealer 
gentamycin.

1226
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:21,230
The message of Jeff,
because very simply put,

1227
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,110
killing jihadis is great,
but at the end of the day,

1228
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,350
a bodybags as a metric,
not a good metric.

1229
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:30,380
It didn't work in Vietnam doesn't work 
today because guess what?

1230
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:32,180
If you've got a recruiting pool,
it's massive.

1231
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,540
Not just recruit new jihadis,
so what's your victory condition?

1232
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:36,374
Your victory condition is when the life 
style of jihad is no longer sexy from 

1233
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:44,810
Brussels to San Bernardino.
How do you do that?

1234
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:46,340
You make a laughingstock.

1235
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,293
You discredit that value system.
We're not asking white skin Catholic 

1236
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:54,410
isn't going to do it right,
but we help.

1237
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,503
President Sisi were helped.
King Abdullah of Jordan will help mbes 

1238
01:01:58,401 --> 01:02:00,310
in Saudi Arabia.
I mean mbs,

1239
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,480
historic things.
He said,

1240
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:05,420
I mean massive about Israel in just the 
last few weeks.

1241
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,870
That's how we win because sooner or 
later enough people say,

1242
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,400
those guys are losers.
That's how we win,

1243
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,620
but you only do that if you get to talk 
about it.

1244
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:16,454
Truthfully.
You've got to be able to talk about the 

1245
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:21,540
Koran or jihad means the history of the 
religion because if you can't talk about

1246
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,374
it honestly,
you're never going to treat it 

1247
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:23,780
accurately.
Yeah.

1248
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,440
We're not very good at that though.
Well,

1249
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,610
political correctness,
right?

1250
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:29,683
I mean,
imagine if you're a doctor and you've 

1251
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:35,850
got a patient that comes in with a third
stage lymphoma,

1252
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,030
but your hospital administrator,
because it's a scary word,

1253
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:40,800
has banned the use of the word cancer.

1254
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,710
You can't say it right.
It's just not allowed.

1255
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,663
Yeah,
and then you have to tell the patient 

1256
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:46,470
what,
well,

1257
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,700
you know,
you're dehydrated.

1258
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:48,600
Go home,
drink some water,

1259
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:50,620
and take some aspirin.
What happens to your patient?

1260
01:02:50,621 --> 01:02:52,530
And they die.
It's the same thing.

1261
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:55,830
If you can't diagnose a geo strategical 
issue accurately,

1262
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,490
however much money you throw at it,
you will not solve the problem.

1263
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:00,623
So are you concerned at all that just 
even if it's purely because of the way 

1264
01:03:03,391 --> 01:03:04,224
the media frames things that perhaps 
trump is not the right person to lead 

1265
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,950
the fight against this,
that for whatever,

1266
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,233
whatever he's going to say about Jihad 
or a radical Islamic terrorism or the 

1267
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,870
rest,
even if he said everything the exact way

1268
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:19,704
that you wanted it to be sad,
cleanly and clearly and correctly 

1269
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:23,424
defined all of that,
that he may not be the right messenger 

1270
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:30,330
on this just because of the filter it 
has to get through to get to reality.

1271
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:31,463
He's not the right messenger 
domestically because of what political 

1272
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:39,381
correctness is wrought in our country,
but he is absolutely the right message.

1273
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:43,710
Internationally.
Watch the video of his speech.

1274
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,083
Don't watch him.
Watch the 53 mostly matter of heads of 

1275
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:51,350
state and the body language because man 
did he say,

1276
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,403
guys,
you got a problem in your most and your 

1277
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:56,070
society is extremely determined.
You have to deal with it.

1278
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,933
It was tough.
A new thing that'd be all negative and 

1279
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:01,740
arms crossed.
They were beaming,

1280
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,000
right?
Cc Abdullah.

1281
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:04,680
We're going,
oh,

1282
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,513
finally a guy who understands our 
problem and what is giving us tough 

1283
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:11,190
love.
So yeah,

1284
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:12,024
he,
he is absolutely the right guy to fix 

1285
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:14,664
this internationally,
which is where it needs to be fixed 

1286
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:16,943
domestically.
Now the political correctness thing is 

1287
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,750
going to get in the way.
The media insanity.

1288
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,913
So do you think he has more support from
foreign heads of state and then we'll 

1289
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:26,610
have a sense.

1290
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:29,910
I mean even at the Ga there was a 
feeling of like that actually these guys

1291
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:33,020
kinda liked him or I can tell you.
Yeah,

1292
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:37,590
I told people before the inauguration,
you have no idea.

1293
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,483
Even if you voted for him,
you have no idea how successful he will 

1294
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:42,084
be internationally because he's a 
straight shooter because he's an Alpha 

1295
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:49,350
dog.
And guess what?

1296
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,380
In a lot of places outside of Berkeley 
they like have that right?

1297
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,530
Because they know what you're talking 
about.

1298
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:02,970
They don't have to walk on eggshells.
They understand your direction.

1299
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:07,050
So yeah,
internationally are prestige as a nation

1300
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,330
has skyrocketed in,
you know,

1301
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:15,210
outside of the European Union and maybe 
certain century pin countries exempted.

1302
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,433
Yeah,
absolutely.

1303
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,100
Uh,
I know we could do a whole

1304
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,240
other show on this,
but,

1305
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:22,300
but very quickly just on Russia 
collusion,

1306
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,340
as someone that has been around the 
administration,

1307
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,900
you've mentioned some of these people 
already,

1308
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:26,800
flint,
you know,

1309
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:27,634
down the road.

1310
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,301
Well,
what,

1311
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:30,134
what can you tell me about that and is 
there anything that people should be 

1312
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:35,240
worried about or do you think this is 
all going to actually point just back to

1313
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:36,680
the Democrats,
which every time it seems,

1314
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,633
every time it seems to point to trump,
you go a little bit further and then 

1315
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:40,451
going,
oh,

1316
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:41,240
well,
wait a minute.

1317
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,350
That was actually the Democrats do.
My good friend has a,

1318
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,450
the best morning show in DC.
Uh,

1319
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:47,284
I'm Chris plot.
The radio host is actually a national 

1320
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,560
syndicated and I have to credit him with
this.

1321
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:52,403
He says it's the last scene from the 
hunt for Red October when the bad 

1322
01:05:56,301 --> 01:05:57,134
captain Tupolev launches the torpedoes 
against Sean connery on the radio 

1323
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:04,880
October.
And it takes the fuses off and then what

1324
01:06:04,881 --> 01:06:06,470
happens?
Remember his ex says,

1325
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,213
your thing comes back and syncs them.
This is the most hilarious boomerang in 

1326
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:14,954
history,
right?

1327
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,060
I'll tell you what the president told me
in the Oval Office,

1328
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,913
it's just the two of us.
It was very frustrated one day I think 

1329
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:22,840
maybe dad had just testified or given 
his speech,

1330
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:23,893
his little press conference,
and he said they will not find anything 

1331
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,330
because there is nothing and you know 
what?

1332
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,120
I take that to the bank.
There is no Russia collusion.

1333
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,240
How could there be off for the last 15 
months from arming the Ukrainians to the

1334
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:44,950
xl pipeline to Anwar to finally after 30
years,

1335
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:45,784
the first president to ever get NATO to 
finally stump up the two percent of GDP 

1336
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:50,824
that they promised they'd spend on 
defense to our own military expenditure 

1337
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:54,574
increases.
Every significant policy decision this 

1338
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:57,443
president has taken with regards to 
Russia has been bad for that former KGB 

1339
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:03,700
colonel,
so the idea that we're colluding,

1340
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,880
you have to be on drugs or be so 
ideologically blind to believe that,

1341
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,460
well then what do we do with this?
This layer,

1342
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,660
you know,
whatever that you.

1343
01:07:14,661 --> 01:07:16,960
You've referenced deep state before,
whatever.

1344
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:17,780
Yeah.
What?

1345
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,950
What do we do with this thing?
Do we have an ongoing investigation?

1346
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:23,720
To me,
the Mueller investigation,

1347
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:26,750
which seems odd to me,
is that I don't know what the actual.

1348
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,720
I don't know that they ever laid out 
what their mission is other than to find

1349
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,363
what was the crime,
right and that illusion to commit to 

1350
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,850
collusion to conspire in a crime.

1351
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,370
Okay,
but what's the crime?

1352
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,593
Because if it's Russia misrepresenting 
itself or perverting the truth on 

1353
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:47,894
facebook,
well then Zuckerberg should be charged 

1354
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:53,683
then.
Then you know Anderson Cooper should be 

1355
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:56,594
in the dark.
What are the charges that have been 

1356
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:04,841
brought outrageously ridiculous or lying
to federal investigators?

1357
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,033
You?
You would probably be able to be caught 

1358
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:11,330
in a perjury trap today.
Okay,

1359
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,910
because not everybody remembers what 
they did and how they did it.

1360
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,953
Poetry traps.
What you said to somebody Irri 

1361
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:20,450
irrespective of Russia.
That's not donald trump's problem.

1362
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,640
Why a fraud?
Eight years ago when manafort worked for

1363
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,474
the Ukrainian president,
what's that going to do with Russian 

1364
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:30,890
collusion?
Nothing.

1365
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,760
My worry is that Mueller is not a good 
actor.

1366
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:39,260
If you look at who is hired,
it's clear that there's massive bias and

1367
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:44,261
this report is writing for Congress is 
simply going to be a political weapon in

1368
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:48,590
the elections and and that's not how 
justice is served.

1369
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:49,424
That's the rule of law.
That's a law enforcement official 

1370
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,640
getting involved in politics.

1371
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:57,310
So that's what I'm concerned about.
Also,

1372
01:08:57,311 --> 01:08:58,144
whether,
whether you think something for the 

1373
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:00,394
people that are watching this,
the thing something happened or didn't 

1374
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:02,284
happen,
what I'm more concerned about is that 

1375
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:03,744
we're entering this new phase where 
whether it's trump that's president or 

1376
01:09:06,581 --> 01:09:09,220
it's a Democrat that's president or it's
a different republican or whatever,

1377
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,293
that we're just going to endlessly also 
have this layer that all it does is 

1378
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:15,130
investigate itself.
Waste money,

1379
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,313
you know,
just constantly just be keeping us all 

1380
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,350
in this state where we never know what's
real.

1381
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:24,010
Because if you listen to half of the 
pundits on television,

1382
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:28,330
I mean their implication is that Russia 
has installed our president,

1383
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:29,164
in which case that's probably the single
biggest active board and the history of 

1384
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:33,910
the world and what are you actually 
saying?

1385
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:34,744
Do we take trump out?
And then do you take out pence and now 

1386
01:09:36,491 --> 01:09:37,440
should Paul,
right?

1387
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,293
I mean if you take it to its logical 
conclusion or do we have Paul Ryan as 

1388
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,320
president then and right where are you 
really taking this?

1389
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,213
And that's what I'm worried about is 
that we're just going to end up in this 

1390
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:48,543
constant state where yes,
we'll have a democrat and a Republican 

1391
01:09:50,471 --> 01:09:53,180
or whatever,
but we'll really be caught in just con.

1392
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,320
All government can do is investigate 
itself be more than anything else.

1393
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:59,790
I see myself as an optimist,

1394
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:02,280
but you're giving me a real challenge 
with that last one.

1395
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:05,740
I see myself as an optimist too,
but I think I'm a realist.

1396
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,270
So for months and months and months or 
refused to use the phrase deep state,

1397
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,850
I really thought that was a tinfoil hat.
He kind of thing.

1398
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,430
One of the record,
I don't even know that I've even said it

1399
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:17,070
once on this show.
It sort of pops up and answers.

1400
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,810
Uh,
I

1401
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:22,810
use it now because I've seen it.
I've seen it inside the administration.

1402
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:27,620
When you go to enough National Security 
Council meetings that are classified,

1403
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,220
that is the,
the,

1404
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,083
the,
the pinnacle of policymaking in America 

1405
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,290
outside of the Oval Office,
and this is where policy's made.

1406
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,393
Everybody's in the room from the NSC.
Then you've got the outstations on 

1407
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:43,760
secure vtc from Dia,
a chair of the joint chiefs,

1408
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,410
CIA state,
you name it,

1409
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,750
right,
and you sit there as a new deployment of

1410
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:51,170
political and you listen for two hours 
on a big issue,

1411
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,490
isis,
Russia,

1412
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:53,324
whatever it is,
and not one participant mentions the 

1413
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:58,154
name of the president or what he said 
yesterday in Warsaw or what his 

1414
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:05,054
objective is,
given that specific issue and you see 

1415
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:08,714
this happen again and again and again,
and you're the guy at the end of the 

1416
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,230
conversation with the funny accent.
He says,

1417
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,560
excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,

1418
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,190
you do

1419
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,260
know what the president said about x 
yesterday.

1420
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,900
Can we actually do that?
The deep state is real.

1421
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:24,710
When you've got gas fifteens and scs is 
saying,

1422
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:26,760
well,
I've been here for 20 years.

1423
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:28,950
I know this guy is going to be here for 
four.

1424
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:31,440
I know better.
That's bad for democracy.

1425
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,274
So it'll be clear that you don't think 
it's some sort of massive underground 

1426
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:37,440
conspiracy.
You think it's just the apparatus,

1427
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,423
the,
it's just the old Washington apparatus 

1428
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:40,584
so that I don't think you know,
these people who think Obama sitting in 

1429
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,770
a cave somewhere with a joystick,
he's lazy.

1430
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:49,700
He'd never be a Muslim was I'll specter,
not blofeld but,

1431
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,833
but no,
there's a culture in government that's 

1432
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:53,784
antithetical to an undermining,
undermining the president on a daily 

1433
01:11:57,211 --> 01:11:59,100
basis.
But,

1434
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:01,470
but there is,
there is concerted effort in the media.

1435
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:02,304
Oh my gosh.
I mean,

1436
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,760
Ben Rhodes brags about Ai.

1437
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,510
That guy's unbelievable.
What he says.

1438
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,350
My bodies,
the left wing journalists are morons and

1439
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,720
they're my echo chamber.
He,

1440
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,673
he built this machine that was,
was this incestuous connection between 

1441
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,074
people in the West Wing,
people in the think tank community and 

1442
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:23,010
their buddies in the media.
I mean,

1443
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,530
look at the attack pieces on anybody.
Me or whatever.

1444
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:27,780
It's very interesting to.
Somebody should do a case study.

1445
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:30,960
A journalism school,
one attack piece will drop at 7:00

1446
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,030
AM by 2:00
in the afternoon,

1447
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,060
30 have been written.
We're just simply cut and paste.

1448
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,890
But if you don't know that,
it looks as,

1449
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,230
oh my gosh,
gawkers a fascist.

1450
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,730
No,
it's one guy's article.

1451
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:44,010
It was written because Ben Rhodes told 
them to ride it.

1452
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:48,480
That comes and multiplies on the right.
How do we react?

1453
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,440
Well,
I got my ipad international review.

1454
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:53,274
This one right there.
There's a Gulf in terms of managing 

1455
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:01,800
narrative.

1456
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,043
The left built,
built a whole ecosystem and we're still 

1457
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:07,380
in the 19 eighties,
you know?

1458
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,303
Oh,
we'll take out a full page ad in the 

1459
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:12,060
Washington.
Well that's why when discussing,

1460
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:13,340
right?
Yeah.

1461
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,930
I think it's so important to not odd.
I think most people,

1462
01:13:15,931 --> 01:13:17,820
especially just because of the way 
social media works,

1463
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,600
they immediately go to the full on 
conspiracy of Obama with the joystick or

1464
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,070
just some other,
you know,

1465
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:26,830
the globalist thing and this whole,
to me it's like they're there.

1466
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:27,893
What you just described seems more 
realistic to me that there's an 

1467
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:30,684
apparatus there that then is still 
connected to the media that seems we 

1468
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:36,744
can,
we can discuss that in a sensible way 

1469
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,910
with one audition.
And,

1470
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:43,470
and I appreciate this,
not having been,

1471
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:44,463
you know,
in the target has the crosshairs for so 

1472
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:47,214
long,
they have an advantage because our site 

1473
01:13:52,051 --> 01:13:56,730
is predicated on what David,
the individual manifest destiny,

1474
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:57,750
the rugged individualism.

1475
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:00,510
We believe in individual,
the left by definition,

1476
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:01,344
as a collective entity.
There are elements of the Borg in the 

1477
01:14:04,981 --> 01:14:09,981
left and it is a truly is a collective,
collective mob mentality.

1478
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:12,640
A friend of mine on Raphael Watching,
I mean,

1479
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:14,180
thank you.
[inaudible] is smoke.

1480
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:15,203
What,
when,

1481
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:18,040
when,
when one guy goes off the goal Golkar or

1482
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,903
Bannon or whoever,
the president that has this massive 

1483
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:23,740
collective pylon sort of conspiracy,
but it,

1484
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:26,290
but it's a,
they're all on the same hymn sheet.

1485
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,320
They don't need direction,
but they say,

1486
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:31,180
Oh yeah,
let's go off to him.

1487
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:32,463
Which,
which puts us on the right at a 

1488
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:34,010
disadvantage.
Yeah.

1489
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,040
So this is just sort of an emerging 
group thing.

1490
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,900
It's a cultural thing.
Yeah.

1491
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:38,920
Yeah.
Wow.

1492
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:39,841
We could do.
We're,

1493
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:41,350
we're going to do this again.
I hope so.

1494
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:42,330
This is so much fun.
Yeah.

1495
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,380
This was an absolute pleasure for more 
on Dr Gorka can.

1496
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:50,800
I feel like I have to say,
I know well it I would if I'm a pro when

1497
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,520
I'm doing that later,
have clients who have asked you,

1498
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:53,883
but I feel like Dr Gorka.
I mean you should be a star wars 

1499
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:58,720
character.
It's all in there for more on Sebastian,

1500
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:01,510
follow him on twitter.
It's at Seb Gorka.
