1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,643
  

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,780
of all the polarizing issues in politics
today and yes,

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:08,614
there are many.
The climate change debate is right at 

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:11,434
the top of the list.
Climate change seems to be one of the 

5
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,820
year either with us or you're against 
us.

6
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:16,654
Topics usually debated by people 
immediately taking a partisan stance 

7
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:22,360
rather than a well thought out position.
This past year,

8
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:23,194
I actually lost a good friend who told 
me that she could no longer be 

9
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,060
associated with people who leave in 
debate climate change,

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,570
and I'm someone who's had such 
conversations on this very show.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,673
I think the most hate that I ever got 
for a Reuben report episode was when I 

12
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,274
had Alex Epstein,
author of the moral case for fossil 

13
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,860
fuels in for a sit down.
Alex.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,350
His argument isn't against manmade 
climate change specifically.

15
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:45,184
Instead,
he's more focused on how to increase 

16
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:48,880
human prosperity with what we have now.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,983
Essentially,
his argument is although climate change 

18
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,204
could be real,
fossil fuels still have many net 

19
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,920
benefits for our society.
After endless tweets,

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,783
emails and messages from angry people.
Alex did a follow up video on youtube 

21
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:04,990
himself where he answered around a 
hundred viewer questions.

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,063
Engaging with people who have different 
views is exactly what the battle of 

23
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,800
ideas is all about.
On the flip side of the debate,

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,813
I've also sat down with Michael Mann,
a climatologist and the author of the 

25
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:18,310
famous,
the hockey stick and the climate wars,

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,890
who's a thought leader in the climate 
change debate.

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,023
I've discussed climate change to some 
degree or another with believers in 

28
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:27,610
manmade climate change like Sam Harris,
Michael Shermer,

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,653
and Richard Dawkins,
as well as some of the more skeptical 

30
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,980
views such as Andrew Klavan,
Steven crowder,

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,050
and Ben Shapiro,
and for the record,

32
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:35,884
not one of these guests believe the 
exact same thing as anyone else I just 

33
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,060
mentioned right there.

34
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,703
I find the climate change to be a really
interesting discussion because it often 

35
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,110
shows how one's thinking works in other 
areas as well.

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,900
Generally speaking,
Democrats are those on the left.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,913
See climate change as manmade and 
believe that governmental action is the 

38
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,570
best or in some cases the only way to 
reverse its negative effects.

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,763
Republican's are those on the right 
generally believe that something is 

40
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,334
happening to the environment.
Though there is some debate as to 

41
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,034
whether it's manmade but regardless 
believed that the private sector is 

42
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:09,754
better left to deal with these issues.
Of course there are outliers on each 

43
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:13,444
side such as my former guests,
California democratic gubernatorial 

44
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,030
candidate,
Mike Shellenberger who wants the private

45
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:19,864
sector to be more involved in solving 
climate issues and at the same time 

46
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,424
there are also Republicans and people on
the right who deny manmade climate 

47
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,874
change at all.
The science debate on climate change is 

48
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:33,700
an interesting one and one in which I'm 
happy to have.

49
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,773
What interests me more though is how the
government should or should not be part 

50
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,840
of the solution to whatever the problem 
may be.

51
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,913
You know,
my feelings on this that the government 

52
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:46,120
is rarely the solution to anything.
Actually at this point,

53
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:46,954
I think the government is usually the 
problem in the first place and I'd 

54
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:53,050
always rather exhaust private options 
before turning to the government,

55
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,810
especially the federal government.
Ironically,

56
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:59,050
this should be the position of the 
people who hate trump.

57
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,063
Would you want to keep giving the 
government more power when you hate the 

58
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,674
guy in charge,
but at the end of the day it's not 

59
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,000
governmental power that they have a 
problem with.

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,863
It's that they only have a problem with 
governmental power when it's not their 

61
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,614
guy in charge.
Fortunately there does seem to be a 

62
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:15,574
younger generation that is tackling 
issues like climate change in the 

63
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,170
environment in a totally new way.

64
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,243
It seems to be based not only in 
scientific facts but also in an 

65
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,650
understanding of how a limited 
government should work.

66
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,723
My guest this week is Benji backer,
president of the American conservation 

67
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,194
coalition.
The group is dedicated to finding new 

68
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,090
ways to look at old problems as its 
mantra states.

69
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,340
They are committed to efficient,
effective,

70
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,670
conservative environmentalism.
As for me,

71
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:46,420
I'm a believer in the science behind 
climate change and the funny thing about

72
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,060
science is that it doesn't care whether 
you believe in it or not.

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,580
For me,
the real debate around climate change is

74
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,810
how to go about finding solutions 
without giving more power and more money

75
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,644
to the government.
Whether you believe in climate science 

76
00:03:58,901 --> 00:03:59,734
or not,
whether you want more government 

77
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
regulation or less,
or whether you believe the private 

78
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:05,614
sector can find a solution or not.
We're all stuck on this little rock 

79
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,200
together.
So until Elon Musk,

80
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,720
a private businessman gets us all to 
Mars.

81
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:18,460
Let's try to figure out how to solve 
some our problems on this pale blue dot.

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,810
While we still have a chance.

83
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,603
Okay.

84
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,540
Joining me today is the founder of the 
American Conservation Coalition,

85
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,374
an organization committed to efficient,
effective conservative environmental 

86
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,640
ism.
Hashtag Green Gop Benji backer,

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,520
welcome to the Rubin report.
It's great to be here.

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,210
I feel you are long overdue even though 
20 years old,

89
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,030
you didn't have a lot of time to get 
here,

90
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,940
but you got here.
We've met a couple times.

91
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,760
I kind of found out about you a couple 
of years ago.

92
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,903
Uh,
we're going to talk about what kind of 

93
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:54,844
put you on the map in the political 
world and got your activism going and 

94
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,020
all that.
Uh,

95
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,640
but it's good to have you here.
I liked that you,

96
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,260
uh,
you dressed ready for the park?

97
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,153
Oh yeah.
You gotta you gotta look good to feel 

98
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,400
good.
All right,

99
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,390
so you have a really interesting story,
uh,

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,470
of what got you in this mix.
But first I just thought I'd like to ask

101
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:13,304
me,
I guess just kind of tell me a little 

102
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,050
bit about your upbringing,
family,

103
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:15,760
that kind of thing.

104
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,650
Yeah.
So I grew up in a family of five,

105
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,420
a completely non political,
uh,

106
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,780
very close family.
We traveled a lot together.

107
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,890
Uh,
youngest.

108
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,040
I had two older sisters.
Uh,

109
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,310
my parents were actually entrepreneurs.
They started a business when I was,

110
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,290
I want to say 10,
um,

111
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,080
which was a software company based on 
mortgages.

112
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,050
And,
uh,

113
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,943
it really started to take off,
but it was during the recession and it 

114
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,270
was a really bold move for that time.
I hadn't really paid off and they're not

115
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,430
retired and kind of live the American 
dream,

116
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,710
which is a really cool thing to be 
brought up by.

117
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,693
Yeah.
What about the politics at home where 

118
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,260
you guys always kind of conservative or 
didn't talk about it?

119
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:53,540
Yeah,

120
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,100
actually you've got really differing 
views.

121
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,990
My sister is a liberal,
uh,

122
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,120
one of them and then one of them is 
more,

123
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,830
uh,
just not into it very much.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,570
Uh,
my parents are conservative,

125
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,580
but they never told us really about 
their views.

126
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,300
They wanted us to decide for ourselves,
obviously their morals and values,

127
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,130
I think played into how I feel about 
things,

128
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,173
but it was never forced upon us or they 
were not adamant about politics or 

129
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,850
volunteered or donated to my knowledge,
uh,

130
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,703
to campaigns.
So I really wasn't talked about in the 

131
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,171
house.
You know,

132
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,600
they'd have the debates on or they'd,
um,

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,730
you'd have the news on,
but nothing really more than that.

134
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:26,564
So I was able to figure out my opinions 
for myself when I was a little bit 

135
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,220
earlier than most people when I was 10.
Um,

136
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,300
but yeah,
what kind of opinions does a 10 year old

137
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:35,600
have?

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,190
While I was watching the John Mccain 
Obama debates,

139
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:39,790
which 10 years old,
yes,

140
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,693
at 10 years old.
And I found it really interesting and I 

141
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,504
wanted to figure out where I stood on 
the spectrum of what I support John 

142
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,370
Mccain or would I support,
uh,

143
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,930
I think Senator Obama at the time.
And so I looked up online,

144
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,764
kind of just a basic outline of what 
each side believed in and I figured out 

145
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,310
that I was conservative.
Um,

146
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,320
and so for the last couple of years I 
kind of,

147
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,580
I forced my parents to put signs in our 
yard for John Mccain.

148
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,920
I forced them to put bumper stickers on 
our cars.

149
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,250
I've [inaudible] what did your parents 
think about this?

150
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,380
They're tenured.
They're like,

151
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,370
all right,
we'll support you in whatever you do.

152
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,260
Um,
but they were very,

153
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,310
I mean it's,
it's,

154
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,110
I think that they were surprised.
I mean,

155
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,790
I don't know.
I don't know.

156
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,623
I don't know if any parent thinks that 
there are 10 year old kid is going to 

157
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:29,200
get super interested in politics because
it doesn't really affect you at 10 years

158
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,910
old.
It doesn't really affect you until after

159
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:31,840
college.
Really.

160
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,080
Um,
so that was kind of a surprise to them,

161
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,060
but they were supportive.
They let me,

162
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,894
you know,
research as much as I wanted to and 

163
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:39,460
again,
uh,

164
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,380
they allowed me to put the signs in the 
yard,

165
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,830
uh,
the bumper stickers on my ripstik,

166
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,730
you know,
that type of thing.

167
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,240
So it was a pretty cool time.
And then I got injured,

168
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,163
um,
and decided to volunteer because I 

169
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,200
couldn't play sports.
So I want to get to that in a sec.

170
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,034
But wait,
I just want a picture of this 10 years 

171
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:57,491
old.
We were watching it,

172
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:59,280
but I assume you were watching with your
folks probably.

173
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,463
Right.
Okay.

174
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,493
You go online to figure out the issues.
What mattered to you at 10 years old 

175
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,060
that you said at the end of it,
okay,

176
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm a conservative or I'm going to vote 
for Mccain.

177
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,610
Well,
my pa,

178
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,443
my parents were always really fiscally 
conservative was just how they spent 

179
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:14,400
money.
You know,

180
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,243
we were never like in a really,
really tough position when I was super 

181
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,320
young,
but we always were saying,

182
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,760
you know,
buy the cheapest product you can save as

183
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:25,594
much money as you can.
And that was something that I was 

184
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,780
brought up with.
So that really mattered to me.

185
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,883
And knowing that the government could 
take away my parents hard earned money 

186
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,323
and knowing that the government could 
come in and harm my dad's business by 

187
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:41,710
putting a ton of restrictions,
that kind of struck me pretty harshly.

188
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:45,070
And then also my family,
we were raised on family values,

189
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:45,580
right?
You know,

190
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,500
close knit family.
Um,

191
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,423
it kind of happens that way.
So those two things were kind of the 

192
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,490
main drivers I would say.
Yeah,

193
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,490
it's just hard to imagine a 10 year old 
thing,

194
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,010
but it's pretty cool

195
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,690
and it explains why you're here right 
now.

196
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:58,524
So,
okay,

197
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,423
we'll put you on the map.
And when I found out about you and I 

198
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:01,944
think nationally when people found out 
about you and now this makes sense now 

199
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:06,770
that I know that this was brewing at 10 
years ago,

200
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,030
2013 you're 15 years old.
Yeah.

201
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,083
What happens?

202
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,033
Yeah,
so I had been active in politics for 

203
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,920
three years before that.

204
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,620
And what does that even mean?

205
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,880
Volunteering on Scott Walker's campaign,
Senator Ron Johnson's campaign,

206
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,530
I helped out a Mitt Romney as well in 
2012 and

207
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,303
believe it,
sorry to draw up a could people even 

208
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:31,340
believe it?
Like here's this 12 year old kid,

209
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,530
11 year old kid working on these 
cameras.

210
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,443
It's actually really funny.
The first campaign ever worked on did 

211
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,140
let me use the phones at first because 
they can,

212
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,120
when you're talking to a 12 year old on 
the phone,

213
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,490
you can tell it's like,
hi is Michael?

214
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,620
And they're like,
uh,

215
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,513
yeah,
but like who are you and why are you 12 

216
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,960
and why are you calling me from 
congressional office?

217
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,430
Right.
Regressional campaign.

218
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,250
And so people were actually really 
surprised.

219
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,140
Conservatives were really supportive.
They're like,

220
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,003
Whoa,
look at this 12 year old kid is 

221
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,400
volunteering for us.
And on the left is like,

222
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,040
why is this 12 year old kid volunteering
for them?

223
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,110
Right.
So it was pretty funny.

224
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,953
Now again,
I was injured so I needed something to 

225
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,470
do.
And like any 12 year old,

226
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,080
I decided to volunteer for politics.
Um,

227
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,550
very normal.
Um,

228
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,260
so yeah,
it was a very interesting dynamic

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,850
because this is also hilarious that an 
injury got you into politics.

230
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:20,850
What were,
what kind of injury?

231
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,893
Oh,
it was an ankle injury that the doctors 

232
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:25,240
couldn't figure out.
I was on crutches for a year and a half.

233
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,050
Wow.
Uh,

234
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,820
gained a lot of weight.
Um,

235
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,713
it was during middle school,
which does not help because those were 

236
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:32,410
the worst years for that.
Anyways.

237
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,570
Um,
and so then again,

238
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,200
I went into congressional office and 
they didn't want me to do the phones.

239
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,034
They didn't want me to go door to door.
Cause imagine a 12 year old coming to 

240
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:41,650
your door and they're like,
hey,

241
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:44,300
you should vote for x,
Y or Z.

242
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,800
Right.
Like,

243
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,510
why am I,
why should I trust the 12 year old?

244
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,530
Right.
So,

245
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,503
uh,
this is a very interesting dynamic at 

246
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:50,104
that age.

247
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,941
So,
all right,

248
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,250
so now what puts you on the map?
2013,

249
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,860
you're 15 years old.
Something happened.

250
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,970
Yes.
So,

251
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,860
uh,
in high school,

252
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,550
early on in high school and middle 
school teachers had really come after me

253
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:02,384
for my political views because I was 
trying to make local headlines for my 

254
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:07,250
activism,
especially in the recall election,

255
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,890
uh,
for Scott Walker in 2012.

256
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,240
Um,
so

257
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,193
tell me,
tell me a little bit about what your 

258
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,090
opinions were in what your teacher,
yeah.

259
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,080
Yeah.
So I was really pro Scott Walker guy.

260
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:17,914
I was,
I actually ended up becoming close with 

261
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,270
his family and then,
and a great guy,

262
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,700
but I even better policies,
um,

263
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,593
you know,
I talked to a lot of teachers who were 

264
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:30,670
sick of being forced to join unions and 
sake of starting out with $30,000

265
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:35,020
base pay when senior senior teachers 
were making $100,000

266
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:37,990
with benefits.
And it took them 40 years to get to that

267
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,550
level,
even if they a better teacher.

268
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,643
Um,
so people were really kind of sick of 

269
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,750
that.
Um,

270
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,743
but it was a very small minority because
the unions really had a lot of 

271
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:48,940
brainwashing in the state and I'm sure 
in other states as well.

272
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,043
Um,
and so my view is that Scott Walker was 

273
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,474
really helping out the state cause he 
balance the budget and he's kind of 

274
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:58,180
freed the teachers up and help their pay
become more of a fair shake.

275
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,190
Uh,
but they,

276
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,200
the teachers did not like that.
The majority of them,

277
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,034
I mean,
most people know of the huge uprising 

278
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,500
that happened,
the protest,

279
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:09,460
hundreds of thousands of people at death
threats to every Republican in the state

280
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,040
legislature and the governor.
Um,

281
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,870
and so the teachers would leave school,
um,

282
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,580
they protested and they'd take leave.
They would cry in class.

283
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,180
I mean,
it was,

284
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,740
it was pretty insane.
Yeah.

285
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,670
And then,
you know,

286
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,510
you have me over here bold little 
Benji's going out there and saying,

287
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,040
Ooh,
Rah Rah Scott Walker.

288
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,473
They did not like that at all.
So they would say pretty disparaging 

289
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,280
things to be in class in front of my,

290
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,280
like what kinds of things would they say
to you?

291
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,563
My family for being business owners and 
saying that they were lazy and saying 

292
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,094
that.
Right.

293
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,650
Yeah.

294
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,810
They assume that my parents golf every 
Friday,

295
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,310
by the way.
My parents don't know how to golf,

296
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:50,800
so that's not true.
I don't even know how to golf.

297
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,020
And um,
so that was,

298
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,960
that was one thing that they are,
that they would always say and um,

299
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,160
they would call me a racist or weird for
being in politics at such a young age.

300
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,320
What's that like for,
for a kid of that age to be dealing with

301
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:05,700
that?
It's one thing to be outspoken,

302
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,420
but right now your teacher is,
your authority figures are attacking you

303
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,700
publicly in school.
I can't imagine right

304
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,593
then me because at first I was pretty 
taken aback and I was kind of sad about 

305
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,350
it.
Uh,

306
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,110
but my parents really pushed me on and 
said,

307
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,040
you're doing the right thing and just 
kind of block out as the,

308
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,960
as the millennials say blackout the 
haters.

309
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,823
Yeah.
Um,

310
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,850
so I didn't really care that much as 
long as it didn't affect my grades,

311
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:30,803
um,
or how my classmates viewed me cause I 

312
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,640
do care about the people that I am 
friends with.

313
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:36,690
So,
uh,

314
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,590
so that was kind of frustrating but 
after awhile it just kind of got used to

315
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:41,424
it because it would happen in a class 
every single quarter of every single 

316
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,923
semester of every single year from 
seventh grade until till I started 

317
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:51,150
coming out nationally about this issue.

318
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,113
Did it ever affect your grades?
Cause I could see a teacher in a 

319
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,874
subjective class,
maybe not math where it would be tough 

320
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,274
to screw with your grades,
but as a social studies teacher where 

321
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,424
you're writing an essay or an English 
teacher or something actually harming 

322
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:02,850
your grade,

323
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,170
it did actually.
Um,

324
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,200
my lowest grade ever was in a social 
studies class in middle school.

325
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,173
Uh,
I've never gotten anything really below 

326
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:16,690
like a high b level.
And there I got a s a d plus and wow.

327
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,370
And that social studies class,
it's middle school.

328
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:23,520
So at that point it was middle school.
So it didn't really matter,

329
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,840
um,
per se.

330
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:25,674
But you could say,
you can see that there is a trend going 

331
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,570
and that I'd be worried in future years 
whether or not that it would affect me.

332
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,140
And in other classes I don't think it 
did as much,

333
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,620
which is good.
But in that class I did see,

334
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,473
I mean it's a pretty obvious correlation
between me getting good grades in every 

335
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:41,484
class since that and every class before 
then and then getting a d plus in that 

336
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:45,230
class,
which was kind of weird.

337
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:45,370
Yeah.

338
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,203
And also probably not a coincidence that
social studies is the class that you 

339
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:50,080
were probably talking about this right 
the most.

340
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:50,800
Right.
Did you,

341
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,100
did you try to fight the teacher on 
that?

342
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,300
Did your folks get involved or anything?

343
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,041
Oh,
we actually,

344
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,780
I actually ended up switching schools.

345
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,871
Wow.
I mean,

346
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:57,570
it's incredible.

347
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,261
Yeah.
So,

348
00:14:58,261 --> 00:15:00,030
so that was,
that was a big change.

349
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,980
I'd actually ended up being for the 
better because,

350
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,990
uh,
the school I switched to is the one,

351
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,060
the feeder school to the high school 
that I was going to.

352
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,160
So I ended up making better connections 
there.

353
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:09,150
But,
uh,

354
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,510
it was an annoying change that shouldn't
have been necessary.

355
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,633
Um,
and it was a teacher who had a history 

356
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:15,564
of these types of behaviors,
not just on politics but on other 

357
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:17,994
things.
So,

358
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,720
um,

359
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,540
so it's interesting because you were 
fighting the unions,

360
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,403
which in your estimation was actually 
pro teacher because you felt the unions 

361
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,080
were too powerful and meanwhile you have
teachers fighting you,

362
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,123
which is really only feeding your 
initial premise right in the first 

363
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:32,050
place.

364
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,060
Yeah.
So that was real,

365
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,030
it really enhanced my opinion on the 
subject.

366
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:37,864
It made me really want to,
to push further because I could tell 

367
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,374
that some of these teachers were really 
worried about their job or their job 

368
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:47,710
security because they knew that they 
could actually be held accountable now.

369
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,380
And some of the senior teachers knew 
that,

370
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,273
oh,
I actually have to perform well to get 

371
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:53,044
paid well,
I don't am my age isn't just the 

372
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:56,380
deciding factor.
Yeah.

373
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,480
So I think that that's why people came 
out so strongly in certain areas.

374
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:02,314
So some people just didn't really 
understand the full scope of the 

375
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:06,880
situation and calm him down once they 
figured that out.

376
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,893
But,
so I think we're really worried about 

377
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,563
their,
their future pay because they had kind 

378
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,010
of just been relaxed for the last 20 
years since their pay had gone up.

379
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,013
Right.
So basically they weren't doing a great 

380
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:16,570
job.
Right.

381
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,030
This isn't just unique to Wisconsin.
This is happening all over America where

382
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,740
you have these teachers that have been 
at it forever.

383
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:24,470
I've kind of given up or not working 
that hard anymore,

384
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,930
but they're protected by the unions.
Their salaries keep going up,

385
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,250
they get great benefits,
etc.

386
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,103
Etc.
That's what you're fighting and you're 

387
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:33,920
seeing the fruits of what happens with 
that as they're cracking down on you.

388
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:37,200
So what actually put you on,
what was the specific incident that,

389
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,810
that put this all in motion.

390
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,673
Yeah.
So I kind of took all the information 

391
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:43,214
that I had of all the experiences that I
had gone through and wrote it up in a 

392
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,490
blog for freedom works.
Um,

393
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,470
it ended up going to drudge and then,
um,

394
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,290
todd starnes at Fox wrote something up 
about it.

395
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,770
Town hall had something.
It started to get in that space and then

396
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:59,750
eventually Megan Kelly's show reached 
out,

397
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,910
uh,
to ask me to come on and talk about it.

398
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,133
So that kind of put me on the map there.
And then I started to be invited to 

399
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,763
conferences to speak about my experience
and kind of how other young 

400
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:13,250
conservatives shouldn't be scared to 
speak out in the classroom even if their

401
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:15,500
teachers or other fellow students come 
after them.

402
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,643
Um,
it wasn't easy because it was my 

403
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:19,574
sophomore year of high school,
actually my fresh end of my freshman 

404
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,080
year of high school.
And the,

405
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,900
after that Fox News interview,
I received death threats.

406
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,734
People were threatening me at school 
because some of the teachers that I had 

407
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,570
called out,
which I'd never named their names,

408
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:34,520
but I called them out.
Um,

409
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,610
they were popular with the students.
Um,

410
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:40,790
so people weren't happy about it.
So it was,

411
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,610
it was not an easy time for my family 
either.

412
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,420
Yeah.
I want to focus on that a little bit.

413
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,850
Cause I think cause everyone gets this 
these days.

414
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,684
I mean this is one of the themes.
What we do here is everyone's just like 

415
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,070
afraid to say anything because they 
don't want to deal.

416
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,930
They don't want to deal with just the 
hate they get on twitter.

417
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,240
And you've got plenty of that.
And that's how I found you after this.

418
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,950
But,
but the other stuff,

419
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,570
like you had to go to school the next 
day.

420
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,340
So literally what,
what is that like?

421
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,611
Well,
I,

422
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:04,910
I don't know if I've ever said this 
publicly,

423
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,940
but I carry a knife to school cause I 
was so scared,

424
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,260
uh,
with my life.

425
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,123
And I didn't tell my parents.
I had a friend give it to me that was 

426
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,680
worried about my safety.
Um,

427
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,240
it was a pretty hard time,
uh,

428
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:20,090
because no matter if people think I was 
doing something right or wrong,

429
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,010
I think part of the problem with our 
culture,

430
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:24,350
and it was the same way four years ago 
or five years ago,

431
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,930
is that if someone's doing something 
that you don't agree with,

432
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,860
you're just going to completely attack 
them wholeheartedly without any,

433
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,943
uh,
respect for what they're doing or their 

434
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,004
opinions or anything like that.
And so I was honestly scared for my 

435
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:38,180
life.
You know,

436
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,013
I couldn't go anywhere.
I got my bike stolen when I biked to an 

437
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,744
ice cream shop and I live in a very safe
place and it was somebody from my high 

438
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,370
school that just really didn't like me.
Yeah.

439
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,493
You know,
I'd be walking my dogs and some would 

440
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,170
flip me off and say,
after you Benji backer,

441
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,210
you know,
suck a whatever.

442
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,093
What about your family at that time?
Cause I know you said your folks were 

443
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,010
always backing you and telling you what 
to do,

444
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:57,844
what you believe in.
Was there any repercussions for them or 

445
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:00,910
their business or anything like that?

446
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,851
No,
a,

447
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:03,210
their business was fine.
I think,

448
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,044
you know,
most,

449
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,380
most adults who knew what was going on,
treating me with a lot of respect.

450
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,210
I think it was mostly the young people 
who,

451
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,430
who were a little bit ignorant about 
what was going on.

452
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,593
Um,
so my parents didn't have any negative 

453
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,780
repercussions that I know of.
Again,

454
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,614
I might've been not telling me because 
they didn't want to make it any worse 

455
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:20,670
for me cause I got all that I care about
them.

456
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,150
So that was,
that was a tough time for them though,

457
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,180
because they live through their kids and
having something like that be constantly

458
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,030
going after,
uh,

459
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,963
are people constantly going after your 
son is not the greatest thing in the 

460
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:35,604
world,
especially when they know that what 

461
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:36,924
you're doing is right.
So they were kind of my biggest 

462
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:42,660
supporters at the time telling me to 
keep pushing on and um,

463
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,860
you know,
again,

464
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:44,694
block out the haters and just kind of,
and do what you think is right because 

465
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,100
at the end of the day,
people are gonna realize it eventually.

466
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,203
Um,
and I had tons of people come after or 

467
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:54,930
come up to me a years afterwards and 
apologize,

468
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,013
um,
and realize that what they did was 

469
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,210
immature.
Um,

470
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,020
people who said the worst things to me 
or told me to kill myself or whatever,

471
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,370
those people would come up to me and 
say,

472
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,260
I'm really sorry.
Um,

473
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,123
because as people mature,
they start to realize that that's not 

474
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,260
okay dialogue even if you totally 
disagree with someone.

475
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:10,730
So

476
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,563
yeah,
sadly we have a lot of people who don't 

477
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:15,260
mature these days.
But that is nice to hear though.

478
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,060
What about the support you got from your
friends?

479
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:17,894
I mean,
where your,

480
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,823
where your friends that supported you 
willing to publicly support you because 

481
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,820
that's enough.
See that's another,

482
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,140
there's,
there's certain things.

483
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,550
That's why I think this is so 
interesting.

484
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,590
There are certain trends with all of 
these,

485
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,424
whether it's you taking an unpopular but
principal position or it's a guy like 

486
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,990
Bret Weinstein at Evergreen,
right?

487
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,990
Just all these different people that 
come out come out.

488
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:39,260
I mean,
it's a coming out in a way that the same

489
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:41,540
tactics happen every time.
And in this case,

490
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,630
the idea that you're your friends or 
whatever won't back you publicly,

491
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:47,110
but privately probably had no problem 
doing it.

492
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,990
Yeah.
I had friends who

493
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,823
came up to me or text me saying,
I support you and I feel terrible for 

494
00:20:52,911 --> 00:20:55,250
what you're going through,
but I can't associate myself with you.

495
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,383
Um,
and those friends ended up trying to 

496
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:01,300
associate it with me later on.
In a way though,

497
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,820
those are the worst ones,
right.

498
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,310
Cause it's like if someone just tells me
to go after yourself,

499
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,750
it's like big deal.
Okay.

500
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:07,890
Whatever.
But the friends,

501
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,630
it's like,
am I your shield?

502
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,243
You know what it'd be like?
Am I the guy that's supposed to just be 

503
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,510
out there while you sit quietly and do 
nothing?

504
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,340
You're not helping me.

505
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,911
Right.
Yeah.

506
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:20,720
I had one really good friend named 
Brandon who supported me through it all.

507
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,130
Um,
and would come over every,

508
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,003
eh,
this death threat stuff started to 

509
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:27,740
happen right as summer started.
Um,

510
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,690
which was the worst time is in high 
school as a freshman,

511
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,450
you're not really doing anything during 
the summer,

512
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:34,730
so you're just like at home sitting,
looking at your twitter thing.

513
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,020
Oh,
all these people want to kill me,

514
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,540
or they think I'm the worst person in 
the world.

515
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,540
So it's really nice to have,
you know,

516
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,350
one friend who I could rely on.
Um,

517
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,450
plus my family.
Yeah.

518
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,520
And I actually took a little bit of a 
break from the town that I lived in.

519
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:47,960
Um,
my dad even said,

520
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,240
you know,
things got worse that we could move,

521
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,430
um,
if that was necessary,

522
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:55,100
which I never thought it was going to be
necessary and it never was.

523
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,193
Um,
but I took a little bit of a break and 

524
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,470
went to my grandparents' house for 
awhile just to get away from it all.

525
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,573
Um,
because there was one time actually at 

526
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,030
my house when,
well,

527
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:04,864
the two times,
once when someone called and said they 

528
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:07,520
were going to come to my house and kill 
me,

529
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,860
I had an anonymous line to my home 
phone.

530
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,580
And then a second time when,
um,

531
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,570
I was watching a movie,
um,

532
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,773
and it's actually Ted and I was trying 
to like have a fun night after all this 

533
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:24,900
stuff had been going on.
And the uh,

534
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,053
uh,
someone knocked on the window and was 

535
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,810
like flipping me off and it was like in 
the middle of the night is I was sitting

536
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:33,380
in my living room.
So I was pretty scared to be at home for

537
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,670
a little while.
And so I went away for a little bit.

538
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,613
Yeah.
And it's interesting cause I don't want 

539
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:39,810
to Belabor the point with you and 
there's a lot of other rice,

540
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,980
the important stuff I want to talk 
about,

541
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,833
but I think that it's worth mentioning 
just because so many people go through 

542
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:46,454
this and more importantly,
you're on the other side now you made 

543
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,810
it,
you're doing cool stuff and you survived

544
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:53,360
and it's just worth showing people that 
yeah,

545
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,310
most usually you will survive.

546
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,400
Yeah.
And I think,

547
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,653
you know,
what was really big for me is that it 

548
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,750
takes a strong person to go through 
that.

549
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:04,260
But there are tons of people going 
through the exact same thing nationwide.

550
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,570
And I wouldn't even say that there are 
some people on the left side,

551
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:09,210
he'd go through the exact same thing 
because it's not just,

552
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,000
it's not just people on the left who 
have this nasty attitude.

553
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:15,270
It's people on the right as well.
And I think it's,

554
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,840
it's sickening,
um,

555
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,050
because even if you disagree with 
someone wholeheartedly,

556
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,270
um,
just stay quiet if you really,

557
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:25,200
if you really are going to be that rude 
and that upset about it,

558
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,453
be respectful and be quiet.
That's kind of how I would like to do 

559
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,393
things.
And so I think to other people who are 

560
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,004
in similar situations persevering 
through this is the best thing that you 

561
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:35,820
can go through.

562
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,111
I mean,
I,

563
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:39,280
I feel like I matured into a 45 or 50 
year old,

564
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:43,920
but I was like 14 or 15 years old.
And so I was able to really progress in.

565
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,343
Um,
I think it actually might be one of the 

566
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,833
best experiences of my life,
even though it was the one of the worst 

567
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:52,880
experiences of my life in terms of 
furthering myself.

568
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,500
It was one of the best.
And I also think,

569
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,663
um,
just knowing that if I can persevere 

570
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:00,560
through it,
anyone can and anyone should,

571
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,040
and standing up for your viewpoints 
isn't going to be easy,

572
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,210
but it's totally worth it.

573
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,720
Well said.
You know,

574
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,140
I think we talked about this while we 
had lunch a couple of weeks ago.

575
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,160
Yeah.
And I think we talked about this,

576
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:10,994
but I told you that I think my best 
professional moment is also my worst 

577
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:14,504
professional moment.
And it was when Larry elder just 

578
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:16,964
bludging be over the head with facts and
it was my worst because I wasn't 

579
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:23,030
prepared and it was my best because it 
opened me up and then I was like,

580
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,170
oh,
new information,

581
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,250
new facts.
So let's,

582
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,350
let's explore that.
So,

583
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:27,921
uh,
so yeah,

584
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:29,660
getting through something is pretty 
beautiful.

585
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:32,680
Not that I'm comparing that moment with 
Larry to everything that you,

586
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,313
yeah.
And I think what I've found is that it 

587
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:36,624
actually,
what I did open up the eyes of a lot of 

588
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:39,840
the people who attacked me,
right.

589
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,970
They event eventually apologized and if 
they went to attack me and apologized,

590
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,220
they went to open their minds either,
you know,

591
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,960
a couple of years later they're probably
thinking back like,

592
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,860
Oh wow,
you know,

593
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,693
that was really terrible of me.
But would they ever have thought about 

594
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:55,020
that?
If that wouldn't have happened,

595
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,970
they might've done the same thing five 
years later,

596
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,100
which would be way worse than doing it 
in high school.

597
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:01,290
So I think that going through those 
experiences,

598
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,780
no matter what side you're on,
is better.

599
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:05,640
And I don't think that it should happen,
but it does.

600
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,750
It does help you persevere.

601
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,750
Yeah.
So that moment puts you on the map.

602
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:09,830
Now,
you know,

603
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,300
I started following you on twitter.
Every,

604
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,070
all these people are following you.
You're suddenly,

605
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:15,170
your voice is being heard,
uh,

606
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,970
where you immediately involved in more 
activism after that or I,

607
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,073
cause then it's,
you had an interesting phase of like 

608
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,303
sort of,
I could tell you were like very 

609
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:23,684
frustrated with politics at times and 
you were pissed at your own side a lot 

610
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:28,720
and,
and you know,

611
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,460
and trump and all of that flashing 
forward a little bit later.

612
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,361
But what we,
yeah,

613
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:34,300
what was the next step?
Let's just get us to,

614
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:35,270
to where you're at now.
Yeah.

615
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,820
I dealt with so much negative,
uh,

616
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,630
political,
uh,

617
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,513
experiences that,
so many negative political experiences 

618
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:46,110
that I wanted to do something positive.
Um,

619
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,960
and I was sick of the partisan bickering
on both sides.

620
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:49,620
You know,
I've,

621
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,990
I have not really changed any of my 
beliefs.

622
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:52,824
I think both sides have just gone 
further and further away from the 

623
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:56,220
middle,
which is frustrating.

624
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,100
Um,
so I actually took a year hiatus in high

625
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:00,460
school,
uh,

626
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,463
my senior year just to enjoy school and 
enjoy my friends and kind of graduate 

627
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,000
with,
uh,

628
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,833
with a fun last experience.
But I couldn't really stay away as long 

629
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:10,884
as I had hoped.
I was thinking that I could probably 

630
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,360
stay away through college as well.
Um,

631
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,623
but I had seen so many negative things 
that there needed to be something done 

632
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:21,300
that was positive and I was so,
you know,

633
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:22,134
again,
it's like get the partisan bickering 

634
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:23,604
that I wanted to,
to get involved in something that would 

635
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:28,920
benefit society and have a decent 
dialogue,

636
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,740
um,
and wouldn't generate complete hate from

637
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:34,200
both sides.
And I think that we need more of that in

638
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,940
politics,
a decent dialogue.

639
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:38,070
And if it has to,
has to happen on an easy intro,

640
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,730
a issue like the environment,
which is what I focus on then so be it.

641
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:46,500
But I would hope that that could over to
really hotly contested issues too,

642
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,840
like gun control or immigration.
Right.

643
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,720
Um,

644
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,171
by the way,
I,

645
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:53,650
I would argue that actually talking 
about the environment can be perhaps the

646
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:58,540
most hotly contested anytime,
anytime I've done anything on climate on

647
00:26:58,541 --> 00:26:59,374
this show,
the amount of hate is bananas on both 

648
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:01,921
sides.
Right?

649
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,550
So each,
of course it shouldn't be right.

650
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:04,384
We're all,
we are all living on this planet earth 

651
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,210
through,
so we probably all care about it.

652
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,090
At least I hope or,
yeah,

653
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,933
the vast majority of us,
it's a matter of what you think is the 

654
00:27:10,391 --> 00:27:11,470
best way to care about it,
but we're,

655
00:27:11,471 --> 00:27:12,580
okay,
so we're going to get all your,

656
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:13,930
you're working on that and just not

657
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,430
should be about is how we all care about
it,

658
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,140
but let's talk about the different 
solutions.

659
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:18,751
Yeah.
Okay.

660
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,180
So before we get to the solutions and 
what you're doing now.

661
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,200
Yeah.
What else?

662
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,980
I think when people see a young 
conservative,

663
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:25,814
they,
there's still a piece of them that they 

664
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:27,654
don't know what to make sense of that.
How would you describe conservatism in 

665
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:31,974
2018 you gave me a little bit of sort of
what your initial thoughts on it were 

666
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,693
when you were 10 but right now,
what do you make of just sort of the 

667
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,240
state of conservatism?

668
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,533
I think that it's a pretty tough spot.
I think that what we've done as a 

669
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,614
movement is just gone to everything 
that's anti-left and I don't think that 

670
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:49,324
that's how it should be.
And I don't think that it's 

671
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:52,500
conservative.
I think a lot of the principles,

672
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,370
um,
I could go issue by issue,

673
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,204
but there are,
there are a lot of principals that I 

674
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:59,920
don't think are necessarily conservative
and are being pushed forward now.

675
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:00,754
Like I think that there are some things 
that Ronald Reagan wouldn't support in 

676
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:04,594
today's time.
And I actually don't think that he'd be 

677
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:08,590
successful as a conservative in today's 
world.

678
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:09,424
I think people would see him as to 
moderate too wishy washy when actually 

679
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:15,010
he's,
he's the token conservative.

680
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:17,380
Right.
And I think that that is frustrating and

681
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:19,870
I think on the environment and every 
other issue,

682
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,450
the conservative goals to be Anti 
Hillary,

683
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,284
anti Bernie anti-left and sometimes we 
forget to do our own solution and 

684
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,230
sometimes we just go to the exact 
opposite under the spectrum,

685
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:32,290
which is just as dangerous as whatever 
the far left is proposing.

686
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,183
Yeah.
So I think that that's worth 

687
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:38,710
conservatism is now,
and I think that is dangerous because if

688
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:39,544
it keeps going down that path,
I think the first party to start 

689
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:45,160
realizing that they're just going 
further and further away from the truth.

690
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:46,480
And the middle,
um,

691
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,960
are the first one to realize that and 
change the course is going to have a lot

692
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:50,794
of success.
And I hope that conservatives can 

693
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:56,890
realize that and start to come back to 
what conservatism truly is,

694
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:58,900
which is free markets,
limited government.

695
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,240
Um,
it's not just bashing the left,

696
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,070
it's trying to work with them if you 
can.

697
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,173
Um,
and it's not always a far right policy 

698
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:07,024
that's going to be the answer.
And I think that what conservatism was 

699
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,750
in 2008 or 2012,
um,

700
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,070
isn't exactly ideal,
but it's more,

701
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,860
it's closer to where,
where it should be than it is today.

702
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,890
Um,
and I'm not saying trump's to blame,

703
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:21,724
I think it's just a huge movement that 
has been sick of the laugh for so long 

704
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,990
and sick of the radicalism of the left 
that they've done the exact same.

705
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,183
And I think if we could just actually 
stay true to our morals and take the 

706
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:33,934
higher ground,
I think that it would be a lot better 

707
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:35,800
for the country.

708
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,633
Yeah.
It's interesting the way you described 

709
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,340
that,
that whichever one stops first.

710
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,450
Yeah.
Because in my view,

711
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:42,610
and it's funny,
we come at this from different places,

712
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:44,410
right?
Like I was a card carrying lefty,

713
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,840
progressive liberal.
I'm obviously a little older than you,

714
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:48,880
but you came at it from,
from the other side.

715
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,110
And it's like,
for me,

716
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:53,320
the stuff that I focus on,
I've just seen the left implode.

717
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,131
Yep.
And if anything,

718
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:56,680
I would say it's basically like a train 
that the brakes are off,

719
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,500
they know the cliff is coming,
but they're just going to keep going and

720
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,110
going and going and keep pouring call on
it.

721
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:03,370
And let's go off the cliff and see what 
happens.

722
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,650
Yeah.

723
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,483
Don't mention Colton.

724
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,350
Yeah.
Prayer.

725
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,981
Yeah,
exactly.

726
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,990
But,
but to me that's what I've seen there.

727
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:10,824
And I really spend a lot of my life,
at least these last couple years trying 

728
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:15,150
to correct that.
Okay.

729
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,580
What I do see,
and I think maybe,

730
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,020
maybe you agree,
but maybe not as,

731
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:19,854
I do see more fertile ground on the 
right for ideas that I can now go to 

732
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:25,194
libertarian events and conservative 
events and they hear my differences and 

733
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,334
they're willing to hear them out.
Where I see virtually none of that on 

734
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:32,784
the left.
Do you think that's a fair estimation 

735
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,540
even though I know you were concerned 
obviously about what's happening on the,

736
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:37,820
on the fringes of the right?

737
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,640
I do to a certain degree.
I can't,

738
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,240
there is more,
and I think it's a relative statement.

739
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,310
I don't think that it's,
it's enough.

740
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,540
No,
I don't think it's nowhere,

741
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,510
anywhere near enough.
Um,

742
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,163
I think the perfect example is that any 
conservative that doesn't agree with 

743
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:53,874
trump 100% of the time it's kind of 
shunned and you look at an amount like 

744
00:30:57,211 --> 00:31:00,390
Seapak or how the rnc looks at things or
something like that.

745
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,224
And I think that what they should be 
doing is embracing people of all 

746
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:06,930
ideologies that come from the 
conservative perspective.

747
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,120
And I think when it comes to young 
people,

748
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,370
not every young person is gung Ho for 
trump.

749
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,650
Not every young person is Gung Ho for,
Oh,

750
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,573
uh,
you know,

751
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,290
uh,
a wall or whatever it may be.

752
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,483
And I think that conservatives need to 
embrace the diversity more in a 

753
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:22,950
leadership level.
I think like I college campuses,

754
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:23,784
like the College Republicans tend to be 
a more open and I think even like a 

755
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,344
county party,
it would be more open to different 

756
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:30,480
views.

757
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,330
Obviously,
I don't know every county party and then

758
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:34,530
millions of counties that we have here.
But the,

759
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,683
the fact of the matter is I think that 
the national landscape or at least the 

760
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:43,491
national leaders are currently unlikely 
to care about what no moderates think or

761
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:45,714
what even our typical conservative 
things if they're not on 100% in 

762
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:49,940
agreement.
Um,

763
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,963
and again,
I think conferences kind of show that 

764
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:53,910
like the,
the Seapak conference.

765
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,510
Um,
and I think it,

766
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,350
and that's been an issue going on for 
years.

767
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:01,230
I mean the log cabin Republicans were 
banned from Seapak for,

768
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,071
I dunno,
how many years,

769
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:03,380
six years.
Um,

770
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,613
and I think that we just need to 
diversify the party and that's going to 

771
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:11,370
include non Christians.
It's going to include Lgbtq people,

772
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,420
it's going to include minorities and 
it's,

773
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,254
and it,
it's going to include women and that's 

774
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:16,974
going to be the future of the 
Conservative Party along with the 

775
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:21,480
support that we have now.
Otherwise,

776
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,583
we're going to be going down a very 
wrong track record and if we keep 

777
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:27,270
shaming all those people,
it's going to be tough.

778
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,890
What part of you doesn't say you're a 
libertarian?

779
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,790
Because I think I know so much about 
what your ideas are and you're trying to

780
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:35,624
build all those bridges.
I can give you a libertarian reason for 

781
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:38,384
why all of those people obviously should
be included in a conservative party or 

782
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:42,374
any party.
Is there anything about libertarian or 

783
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,224
do you just not,
you're just doing a little political 

784
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,350
realism,
which I hear from a lot of people.

785
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,333
It's like I'm a libertarian,
but the Conservatives and the 

786
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,500
Republicans are the party that I can 
work with most to to get those right.

787
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,610
I think that that's what you just said 
is probably the best answer I have.

788
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,970
The other thing that I would say is I 
think that there are,

789
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,863
I disagree with Libertarian sometimes on
the level of government that should be 

790
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:07,330
involved.
I'm still a limited government person.

791
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,060
I also think of myself as like a Reagan 
conservative,

792
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:10,894
but Reagan wasn't anti government and a 
lot of ways he increased spending some 

793
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:17,920
times he did taxes when it is necessary.
Um,

794
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,350
again,
I'm limited government and when spending

795
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:22,720
is not possible,
we should never,

796
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,280
you know,
we should ever perceive spending if it,

797
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:25,114
if it can be avoided.
Same with taxes and everything like 

798
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:28,114
that.
But I also don't think that it's 

799
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,660
completely off the table,
which some libertarians do.

800
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:32,494
Not all,
but I think that I probably issues why 

801
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,890
is agreeing North Libertarians,
especially on social things,

802
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,410
um,
maybe even immigration.

803
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,540
Um,
but I think at some of the,

804
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,390
just the overarching government 
involvement,

805
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,670
I think the government does have a place
in some things.

806
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,743
Um,
but it should be trying to help the 

807
00:33:50,981 --> 00:33:52,260
people.
Um,

808
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,750
instead of push things on the people,
which I think is,

809
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,930
is something that maybe makes me a 
little bit more moderate.

810
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,923
You've decided to put your stop if the,
if the Republican or the right 

811
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:02,914
conservative trains going off that way 
and you've decided to put your stake in 

812
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:07,600
the ground and say,
we're going to talk about environment.

813
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,630
Yup.
Now even just hashtag green gop,

814
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,840
I mean people think the Republicans,
the general consensus out there,

815
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:15,460
if you ask the average person walking 
down the street,

816
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,740
Republicans either hate the environment 
or the,

817
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:21,610
or they want endless pollution and they 
believe in industry more than the earth.

818
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:22,444
I mean just you,
all of this stuff that really generally 

819
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:26,044
I find not to be true,
but they haven't done a great job on 

820
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:28,870
answers.
Yup.

821
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,273
So first off,
how much do you think people your age 

822
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,720
generally care about the environment?

823
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,750
Yeah,
so I think,

824
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,584
you know,
millennials according to some recent 

825
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,250
polling showed that that's the most 
important issue.

826
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,310
Um,
the environment is in terms of when they

827
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,190
go to the voting booth.
Um,

828
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,680
the University of Texas and Pew Research
polls have shown that.

829
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,633
So I think that that's a huge wakeup 
call to conservatives that this is 

830
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:55,640
something that an important voter base 
is interested in tackling.

831
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,833
Um,
I know that most conservatives are 

832
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:01,130
behind clean energy,
especially when they're young.

833
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,290
Um,
millennials especially.

834
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,330
And then obviously the laughters as 
well.

835
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:06,164
And so I think clean energy,
sustainability and just the general 

836
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,040
environmental issues are very important 
to young people.

837
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,490
And then a recent poll just came out 
that showed that climate change,

838
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,920
uh,
57% of conservatives,

839
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,140
uh,
millennials want action on it,

840
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:21,974
which is a pretty big amount.
And then you've got 77% of independence 

841
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,933
and an 84% of liberals.
So climate change is also a very 

842
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,294
important issue to millennials.
So I think that all those together to 

843
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,594
kind of showcase why it's important that
conservative starts to talk about these 

844
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:34,430
issues.

845
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,263
Yeah.
How would you have this new thing is 

846
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:36,854
about belief,
whether people actually believe the 

847
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:40,314
science on this,
of whether manmade climate change is 

848
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,064
real versus just what the answers are.
So I know you were focusing on the 

849
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,090
answers,
which I want to get into,

850
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,030
but that basically,
meaning it's either you have some set of

851
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:51,864
people that believe or don't believe,
but then you have this other subset of 

852
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:58,170
people that either think the government 
is the answer or that the private sector

853
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,930
is the answer.
How do you even get those things to meet

854
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:01,660
in some way?

855
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,493
So I think that the private sector and 
limited government is the answer for 

856
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:06,244
these issues and that,
or if you believe the science or don't 

857
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:09,220
believe the science,
I think that we all,

858
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:12,970
like we said earlier,
can agree that these issues do matter.

859
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,320
That protecting the earth doesn't 
matter,

860
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:15,880
no matter if climate change is real or 
not,

861
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:19,570
we still have a duty to protect the land
that we've been given by God.

862
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,673
Um,
and so I think that that's something 

863
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:27,061
that can gel with most conservatives.
And then with people on the left or even

864
00:36:27,191 --> 00:36:28,024
independence,
if there are kind of convinced that big 

865
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:32,530
government is the answer,
which has been kind of the only solution

866
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,700
proposed so far.
Right.

867
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,440
It's our job as conservatives to 
showcase why one that doesn't work,

868
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:41,080
which is what we do focus on,
but two is

869
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,680
let,
let's focus on one for a minute.

870
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:45,470
Why doesn't that work?
Cause I think most people,

871
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,690
because most people don't think 
critically about these things,

872
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:48,291
they go,
okay,

873
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,540
I believe in climate change.
The meme is out there.

874
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,950
Yup.
You believe in climate change,

875
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,390
they always look to the government.
So they go,

876
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:55,430
Whoa,
I believe in climate change.

877
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:56,264
What's the government doing about it as 
opposed to the alternatives that you're 

878
00:36:58,941 --> 00:36:59,631
offering?
So first,

879
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:00,920
how do you disconnect those two things?

880
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,803
Well,
the first problem is that most people 

881
00:37:02,951 --> 00:37:03,784
have only seen that as the only answer.
So that's all the thick hand associated 

882
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:09,040
with environmental progress,
which is a problem in itself.

883
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,530
But why they haven't worked.
Why had,

884
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:13,360
the big government hasn't worked on 
these issues.

885
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,970
And some examples of that is the 
endangered species act,

886
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,690
which has only taken 1% of the listings 
awful list,

887
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,683
uh,
since 1982 and there had been a ton of 

888
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:24,940
new species added.
And the reason that is,

889
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:28,480
is because private land owners don't 
have any rights on their land.

890
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,220
If they have a endangered species that's
residing on their land,

891
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,200
the government can come in and take it,
control it.

892
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,243
Uh,
which is really frustrating to land 

893
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:39,490
owners.
So what they try to do is either move it

894
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,760
off their land or they just shoot it and
bury it so they can keep their land,

895
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,003
which is again people just trying to 
avoid big government from coming in and 

896
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,764
taking their private property because 
private property is one of the most 

897
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,493
inherent rights that we have and 
something that people really like to 

898
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:53,440
protect.

899
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,140
Just pause there cause what a what a 
whacked out situation that is.

900
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:56,974
So if you have some private land that 
has something that's on this endangered 

901
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,290
species list,
you might go ahead and kill it.

902
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,153
Yup.
So that the government won't know that 

903
00:38:04,301 --> 00:38:06,460
it's there so that even if you don't 
want to,

904
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,440
you might love animals.
You might love nature.

905
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,530
Usually the case.
Right.

906
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,620
I would assume most of these people who 
would probably is the case.

907
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:12,843
You might literally be killing 
endangered animals just so the 

908
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:18,550
government won't take your land.
That's how warp to this whole thing is.

909
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,050
Yeah.
And the uh,

910
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,310
the mantra is,
shoot,

911
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:24,190
Barry shut up.
That is a common thread when it comes to

912
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:25,024
endangered species.
A and kind of how private land owners 

913
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:28,714
look at it,
which is really sad because like you 

914
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,660
said,
most of them do care about animals.

915
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:32,494
They,
they have farms and they just have 

916
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:37,480
private property and they love nature.
Why they have a place in nature.

917
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,610
They don't want to shoot these places,
but they also don't,

918
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,473
or these animals,
but they also don't want to give up 

919
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:44,050
their land and have it controlled by the
government,

920
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,450
uh,
until,

921
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,750
until whatever date they deem fit.
Um,

922
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,240
and that would be really frustrating as 
a private land owner who worked hard and

923
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:55,030
purchase the land.
It's just not a good way to approach it.

924
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:55,864
And that is the same problem that we've 
had with tons of other issues is that 

925
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,093
when there's big government involved,
there's always a loophole to get around 

926
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:02,200
it.

927
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,210
There's always a loophole to get around 
the punishment.

928
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,223
And usually that loophole hurts the 
environment is people don't respond 

929
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:08,920
well.
The punishments,

930
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,783
they respond well to incentives.
They respond well to doing things on 

931
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:16,210
their own for moral good or economic,
a wellbeing.

932
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,820
And so I think that's where the policies
need to shift.

933
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,953
And then another example of the big 
government not working is the Paris 

934
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,110
climate accords,
right?

935
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,760
It would be,
in theory,

936
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:25,594
having every country come together to 
try to help the environment is a great 

937
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:28,691
idea,
right?

938
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:31,770
That that just sounds nice and peachy of
course.

939
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,100
Sounds good.
Okay.

940
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,403
But then when you're making the people 
who aren't polluting pay for it and the 

941
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:38,854
people who are polluting go off scotch 
free and no countries are meeting their 

942
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:43,594
goals and there's just a ton of money 
being thrown around that's going to no 

943
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:51,880
benefit or it has no benefit on the 
environment and it's non binding.

944
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,713
There was nonbinding,
there was literally no mechanism to 

945
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,564
force anyone to do anything.
So the u s could do the bulk of the 

946
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,990
payments,
but we don't have any mechanism to check

947
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,490
whether anyone's doing anything.
Right.

948
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,150
And we're doing those things in terms of
cutting emissions on her own.

949
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,760
It's technology,
it's innovation,

950
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,310
it's hybrid cars,
which the left loves to paint.

951
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:13,870
But where did it come from?
The free market.

952
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,270
Where's the electric cars come from?
The free market.

953
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,350
Where has Microsoft,
we're having Microsoft and apple and all

954
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,600
these companies who have started to cut 
their emissions.

955
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,880
They're doing it because of the market.
They're doing it.

956
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,743
Not because the government is telling 
them to not be as the Paris climate 

957
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,384
accords are telling them to,
but because they know it's the right 

958
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,900
thing to do.
The sensible thing to do.

959
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,730
I on an economic level and even oil and 
gas companies are cleaning up their acts

960
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:37,564
because they know it's necessary for pr,
but they also know that being more 

961
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,153
environmentally sustainable,
it's going to be better in the long run 

962
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,943
economically.

963
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,570
So it's not going to be some huge accord
that changes these things,

964
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:50,404
especially when they're not pressuring 
the right countries like China to 

965
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:54,544
actually act and do something about it.
It's going to be countries deciding on 

966
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:01,240
their own level what's going to be right
and how they're going to fix it.

967
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,163
And if countries want to come together 
and create an actually cohesive plan 

968
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:10,030
that works and gets things done and give
some flexibility and doesn't,

969
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,250
um,
just do nothing,

970
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,143
then that's great.
That should be something that happens 

971
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,423
and something that president trump 
should actually encourage a beneficial 

972
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:19,354
accords.
The Paris climate accords doesn't do 

973
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:21,214
that.
And that's an example of big government 

974
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:23,560
failing.
I like that you're linking this directly

975
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,840
to technology because it also,
it's sorta like,

976
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:26,674
you know,
20 years ago if there was an oil spill 

977
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:31,060
somewhere in some remote area of 
Antarctica,

978
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,620
most likely we wouldn't have heard about
it.

979
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,010
You know,
unless

980
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,020
it was a massive one like that.
Cause I'm about these or something.

981
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,450
But like a lot you could get away with a
lot.

982
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,310
But these days literally everyone in the
Western world at least has a cell phone,

983
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,160
right worker is at these places.
If there's a leak,

984
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,023
can videotape it anonymously,
upload it to twitter and then everyone 

985
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:53,600
finds out.
So it's so obvious to me that technology

986
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,270
is the answer here.
The,

987
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,113
you know,
cause everyone's always afraid if you 

988
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:58,310
get rid of any of these lines is what I 
hear from,

989
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,230
from the left all the time.
I've been here this from,

990
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,420
from bill models and if you,
if you get rid of these laws,

991
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:03,800
they are going to start polluting the 
lake,

992
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,910
right,
right next to the,

993
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,530
to the factory.
And it's like,

994
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,390
nope,
actually no,

995
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,240
not anymore.

996
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,073
Oh,
accountable.

997
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,103
And that's just the truth.
And some of that I'd love to point out 

998
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,270
is that technology is the reason why 
emissions those have started to go down.

999
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,373
Technology is the reason why we have so 
many amazing opportunities to fix the 

1000
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,174
environment.
There's no big government regulation 

1001
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:27,070
that's able to cut emissions like 
technology can.

1002
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,430
And one thing that's really amazingly 
pointed out by one of our board members,

1003
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:33,334
Todd Myers,
is that thing about how much the iphone 

1004
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:38,080
itself can do and conservation and 
climate.

1005
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,320
You are able to control your heating and
energy costs from your phone,

1006
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,513
turn off the energy when you don't use 
it and control it completely from your 

1007
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:50,224
phone instead of having to run back to 
your house before you go on a long 

1008
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,700
vacation or whatever.
And then just saying,

1009
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:55,421
okay,
a screw it,

1010
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:57,460
I'll just leave them on my lights or 
whenever it is.

1011
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,670
Yeah.
That's helping the environment a ton and

1012
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,640
each year more,
uh,

1013
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,650
effective cars come out with more miles 
per the gallon or electric and hybrid or

1014
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,930
electric is starting to really start to 
take over,

1015
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:11,764
which is really exciting.
That's technology that's not the 

1016
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:14,194
government and technology and 
environmental progress go hand in hand 

1017
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,000
and you look at oil spills or you look 
at nuclear waste or whatever.

1018
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,193
All those have improved dramatically 
over the past couple of decades because 

1019
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:28,000
these companies know that that has to 
happen.

1020
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,893
People will find out about it and never 
give them business again and basically 

1021
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:35,050
shut down their business if,
if more accidents start to happen.

1022
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:36,400
I mean,
look at what bp went through.

1023
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,743
BP is one of the best stewards on the 
environment out of gas companies ever 

1024
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:41,674
since then because they know that they 
can't have that type of a situation 

1025
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:44,470
again.

1026
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,303
Yeah,
they can't have like how many days was 

1027
00:43:46,421 --> 00:43:48,460
that thing leaking and there was the 
live camera on.

1028
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,460
Right.
Everyone knew about it.

1029
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,010
I mean if she has any American they 
would know about the BP oil spill.

1030
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,800
Where do you guys stand on nuclear?
Just a couple of weeks ago,

1031
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,240
I had Mike Shellenberger in here who 
love my shown.

1032
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,831
Oh,
okay,

1033
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:00,390
cool.
So this is interesting then.

1034
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,630
So you are a conservative with some 
libertarian leanings.

1035
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:04,464
Yeah,
he's running for governor of California 

1036
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:07,320
as a Democrat.
You know,

1037
00:44:07,321 --> 00:44:09,520
he started as an independent,
but I think just for,

1038
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,120
because of a little political realism,
he's running as a Democrat,

1039
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,223
but obviously for nuclear power and he's
trying to erase some of the stigma to 

1040
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,154
it,
which there's obviously a tremendous 

1041
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:18,211
amount,
you know,

1042
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:19,044
just unnecessary.
Fukushima was just a couple of years 

1043
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,061
ago.
Right.

1044
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:22,680
So,
so that's interesting.

1045
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:23,610
So you like this guy.

1046
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,543
Yeah.
Michael Shellenberger is a perfect 

1047
00:44:25,451 --> 00:44:29,950
example of what democrats need to aspire
to be and that is common sense.

1048
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:30,784
Able to work with sides isn't afraid to 
just stray away from the talking points 

1049
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:36,810
of the laughed,
which is,

1050
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,260
which are usually incorrect,
especially on like nuclear.

1051
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,123
Nuclear is supposed to be the most 
dangerous and harmful when in reality 

1052
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:48,240
it's kind of the future.
And Michael Shellenberger knows that.

1053
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:48,990
So,
uh,

1054
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:49,823
Michael Shellenberger is great and I 
think that California would be much 

1055
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:55,440
improved by having a governor as 
moderate as him.

1056
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,120
Yeah.

1057
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,400
You know,
we're going to get me Gavin newsome.

1058
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,340
Right?
But what can you do proper?

1059
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,160
Michael should,
I may have to move to Wisconsin.

1060
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:04,994
I think it's got water is great and I 
think he'll be there for another four 

1061
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:08,310
years,
hopefully after this year.

1062
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,750
Um,
but yeah,

1063
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:10,584
I think nuclear is,
is an important part of an all of the 

1064
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:15,660
above energy strategy that America needs
to start adopting.

1065
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,400
And nuclear is the least amount of 
accidents out of any energy sector.

1066
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,830
They're really improving a technology.
I mean,

1067
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:26,100
if there's only been like three nuclear 
accidents in history,

1068
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,650
everyone knows about them because 
they're terrible.

1069
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,570
But there haven't been any since Japan 
and,

1070
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,090
and all of them are avoidable.
All of them are avoidable.

1071
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:33,924
None of them have happened in the United
States because the United States has 

1072
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:39,180
been careful about it.
And these companies are careful and it's

1073
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,014
almost become impossible with recent 
technology to have an accident like 

1074
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:45,540
that.
Unless you were like deliberately trying

1075
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,240
to hurt the area around you and trying 
to,

1076
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,440
to,
to release the waste.

1077
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,493
Is it partly because of government 
regulation that our nuclear plants 

1078
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:56,950
haven't had problems that keep,
can you give any credit in that way?

1079
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,791
Uh,
I,

1080
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:00,250
I don't know enough about how those 
regulations have worked,

1081
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:01,084
but all I know is that regulations from 
the government have shut down nuclear 

1082
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:04,880
progress,
uh,

1083
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,833
because right now they're discouraging.
Nuclear plants are being built and not 

1084
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:10,684
our,
I don't think any are being built 

1085
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,250
currently.
Uh,

1086
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,113
because the United States government is 
trying to phase it out when really it's 

1087
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,660
going to,
it's clean,

1088
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,523
it's effective,
it cuts and missions and it's very 

1089
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:20,380
powerful.
Um,

1090
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,543
and I know that I think the vast 
majority of the changes have come from 

1091
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,273
these companies realizing that there's 
no way for them to succeed if they 

1092
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,720
aren't careful with their operations.
And they also know that,

1093
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,460
I mean,
unless you're a terrible human being,

1094
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,294
you don't want to put nuclear waste and 
you don't want to give everyone cancer 

1095
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,790
and have them die unless you're a 
terrible human being.

1096
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,340
So I think that that's also just part of
a thing.

1097
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,020
And,
and,

1098
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,853
and new technology is,
is making nuclear more effective and 

1099
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,330
less dangerous.
And I,

1100
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,440
and I,
I think it's safe to say that nuclear is

1101
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:55,930
almost a hundred percent foolproof at 
this point in time.

1102
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,180
But you can't always go on the best 
intention to these people cause,

1103
00:46:59,181 --> 00:46:59,521
right.
Yes.

1104
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:00,354
I agree.
Most people don't want people that have 

1105
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:03,300
cancer and do all that stuff.
But you know,

1106
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,710
business owners,
just like government regulators often do

1107
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:08,544
shady things.
So it's part of the issue here is that 

1108
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,900
you can't always control the business 
owner.

1109
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,370
Yup.
The industrialist.

1110
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:16,230
But you also can't always control the 
government.

1111
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:18,030
So there,
there isn't a perfect answer here,

1112
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:18,320
right?
Yeah.

1113
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,150
No there's not.
And I think that there are,

1114
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:25,190
it is the duty of the government to 
protect the people to a certain degree.

1115
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:26,060
I mean,
you're not it.

1116
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,820
They have to band murder and they have 
to ban certain things.

1117
00:47:28,821 --> 00:47:30,430
So not,
uh,

1118
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,653
so that's not lawful.
And I think that certain basic 

1119
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:34,564
protections can be put in place on 
nuclear to make sure that these 

1120
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:39,790
companies are making sure that it's 
safe.

1121
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,953
They shouldn't be so stringent that you 
can't start one up or that you get 

1122
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,070
punished for,
um,

1123
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,091
you know,
what x,

1124
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:49,720
Y or z unless it's a terrible breach of,
of uh,

1125
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,613
knowledge.
So I think that that's something that 

1126
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,384
the government can play into.
I think it's going to be more up to the 

1127
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:55,054
technology and the business owners to 
have the answers to make nuclear better 

1128
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,490
with a couple basic nuclear,
uh,

1129
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,810
government regulations.

1130
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,753
What kind of traction are you guys 
getting sorta with mainstream 

1131
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:05,994
Republicans and with people that are in 
office right now because these seem to 

1132
00:48:08,911 --> 00:48:11,730
be the answers that I would love these 
guys to take a,

1133
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:13,590
but they've been very hesitant to take.

1134
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,523
Yeah.
So one thing before we even launched 

1135
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:17,154
this organization,
I met with a lot of congressmen and 

1136
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:19,174
women and the on the Republican side and
they said that they cared about these 

1137
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:23,950
issues.
They wanted to tackle them,

1138
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,650
but the only reason I didn't was because
they didn't hear from their base.

1139
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,680
They only heard it from the Sierra Club 
and the League of conservation voters.

1140
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,203
And the fact of the matter is those 
people are never going to be their 

1141
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:34,480
voters and matter how they come out on 
environmental issues.

1142
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:40,110
So we think that there is a latent base 
of support not only at the base but with

1143
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,760
legislators who want to lead on these 
issues,

1144
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:45,220
but they just need some uh,
pushing.

1145
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,263
Um,
so I think that that's something that 

1146
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,240
the conservative movement is ready for 
and there are a good handful of 20 to 25

1147
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,600
current Republican congressmen and women
who are already leading on these issues.

1148
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,433
It's just a matter of getting that 
number up and starting to have those 

1149
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:01,660
legislators hear from their base,
talking about the base.

1150
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,210
The base is totally ready,
especially millennials,

1151
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,850
like I was talking about earlier with 
some of the polling that's been done.

1152
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,163
Basically all young conservatives care 
about the environment in one way or the 

1153
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,250
other.
No matter if it's climate change related

1154
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,840
or not,
they're ready for clean energy.

1155
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,090
They're ready for all of the above 
energy.

1156
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,730
They're ready for common sense 
conservation practices.

1157
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,223
And so we have had such success with the
base that we have 37 out of 50 college 

1158
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,294
Republicans,
state chairs on board with what we're 

1159
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:27,424
doing.
I was more to come in the next few 

1160
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,793
months.
We are working with countless college 

1161
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:31,954
Republican and turning point USA and 
young Americans for freedom chapters 

1162
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:36,760
across the country to spread some of 
these things.

1163
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,520
We have the support of all the youth 
leaders on the right.

1164
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,920
Charlie Kirk Chandler,
Thorton of the College Republicans,

1165
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:43,930
grants Strobel as young Americans for 
freedom.

1166
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,200
Um,
it's really been welcoming and we hadn't

1167
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,034
really gotten too much flak from the 
right because they're so ready for 

1168
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:51,850
something like this with common sense 
solutions.

1169
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,773
It's interesting.
Does this feel like a little bit of a 

1170
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:54,664
perfect storm right now for you guys 
with what's going on on college 

1171
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:57,850
campuses?
I mean,

1172
00:49:57,851 --> 00:49:59,950
you know,
I had charlie in here from turning point

1173
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:00,784
a couple of weeks ago and I did.
The guy is just knocking it out of the 

1174
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:04,490
park it every day what they're doing.
Yeah.

1175
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,180
It's just incredible to me.
Even for the things that I disagree with

1176
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:07,750
them on.
Yep.

1177
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,090
It's like you've really built this grass
root thing.

1178
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,880
I was just at the students for liberty 
conference a couple of weeks ago.

1179
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:13,714
I thought what they were doing is great.
I think what you're doing is great that 

1180
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:16,474
suddenly it seems like there's this like
backlash against the hysteria of the 

1181
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:23,650
left than what you would say is also the
the history or at least in environmental

1182
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:24,484
terms,
the backward thinking of the right that 

1183
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:29,240
it's kind of led to a nice moment here 
where,

1184
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,550
Whoa,
maybe there are some other answers.

1185
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,990
Yeah,
and I think college students are so sick

1186
00:50:33,991 --> 00:50:38,130
of being painted as anti environment and
they don't really know where to amp that

1187
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:38,964
with.
The answer is and concern us haven't 

1188
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,330
really provided the answer.
They just go on and go after the last,

1189
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,173
which is great.
We need to criticize the left on their 

1190
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,350
environmental policies that haven't 
worked,

1191
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:48,660
but we also have to provide our own 
answers and I think you're,

1192
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:51,060
you hit on something perfectly in that 
college.

1193
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:55,240
Students are always looking for more 
knowledge and uh,

1194
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,450
to be more active and issues that they 
care about.

1195
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,313
Turning Point USA has done that ton of,
a ton of other organizations have begun 

1196
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:02,064
to really activate young people.
And the environment is something that's 

1197
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:06,504
been kind of left out so far.
And that's why turning point in College 

1198
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,563
Republicans are so supportive is because
they realize that that's an important 

1199
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:11,664
part of their mission is to garner 
attention and activism from people that 

1200
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,433
may really care about the environment 
and maybe a little bit hesitant to be 

1201
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:21,570
active unless the conservatives are more
active on that issue.

1202
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,643
So I think that is a perfect storm and 
there's no other group like us out 

1203
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:26,544
there.
There's no group advocating for 

1204
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,180
conservative environmental solutions.
We're doing it,

1205
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,313
focusing on millennials,
but there's nobody doing it for any age 

1206
00:51:33,001 --> 00:51:33,834
group.
And so we're having to work with 

1207
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:35,574
anybody.
But,

1208
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,810
uh,
I think that it's perfect.

1209
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:38,190
And then also,
uh,

1210
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,503
conservatives are looking for a way to 
talk to liberals on some issues on 

1211
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:45,210
college campuses.
College campuses are so divided that,

1212
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,920
you know,
you bring in a speaker,

1213
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,070
even if they're the most moderate 
speaker and there's protests,

1214
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:51,540
you know,
up the Wazoo,

1215
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:51,931
you know,
there's,

1216
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:53,850
there's no,
there's no end to it.

1217
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:56,420
Even if you bring in John Case that 
you're going to get half,

1218
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,770
you know,
half of your school out there protesting

1219
00:51:58,771 --> 00:52:00,120
saying he's a white nationalist.
Right,

1220
00:52:00,121 --> 00:52:02,310
right.
So even though most people would say the

1221
00:52:02,311 --> 00:52:03,144
navy,
he identifies more with the Democratic 

1222
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:04,800
Party now.

1223
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,760
So I think sometimes they do it when 
that day Reuben guy shows up.

1224
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:10,090
It's very busy.
It's crazy though.

1225
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,830
He's off the walkies off the diva.

1226
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,170
I understand that one.
But yeah.

1227
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,700
Uh,
but I think,

1228
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,470
you know,
if we can have a dialogue with people on

1229
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,080
the left and showcase that we actually 
do care about the environment,

1230
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:23,380
we're just not,
we're not anti left on everything.

1231
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:26,680
We just want to work with you guys on 
the actual common sense solutions,

1232
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:27,514
not what you guys are pushing but 
something that maybe both sides can 

1233
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:30,574
agree on.
What I have found in my own college 

1234
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:32,464
campus,
cause I go to the University of 

1235
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:33,694
Washington in Seattle,
is that I've talked to a bunch of 

1236
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,990
typical people who would show up to a 
protest,

1237
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,650
maybe even mtf up and they've found 
that,

1238
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,180
okay,
let's just kind of fun.

1239
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:44,920
There's a conservative who cares about 
the environment.

1240
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:47,590
That's cool.
I didn't know they existed.

1241
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,360
And I'm like,
well they're everywhere.

1242
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,493
Almost every conservative that you've 
ever talked to or protested against 

1243
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:53,374
cares about the environment.
But we need to start having that 

1244
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:55,594
dialogue.
And I think that slowly it can sort of 

1245
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:00,220
start to bring together some of the 
divide on call.

1246
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,160
I would imagine that in a place like 
University of Washington,

1247
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:04,180
they look,
you got Seattle there.

1248
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,014
That's obviously progressive Palooza.
But I would imagine there's so many 

1249
00:53:07,991 --> 00:53:11,440
people there that lives suburban lives 
and out there in nature and all of those

1250
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,540
things where they had this strange 
dichotomy.

1251
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:16,390
Now they've been told that the 
Republicans hate the environment,

1252
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,403
they love the environment,
but they also love freedom because they 

1253
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:20,440
want to be on their own land.
All that.

1254
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,030
So to me that's a very fertile ground.
It's a just the,

1255
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,973
I would imagine that the Pacific 
northwest is probably the perfect place 

1256
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:28,440
to start using this as the incubator

1257
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,490
it is.
And some of the old conservative leaders

1258
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,383
in Washington state,
we're pioneers for environmental 

1259
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:38,180
progress nationally.
You've got former governor Dan Evans who

1260
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,550
created the Department of the ecology,
which was what was,

1261
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,410
uh,
the EPA was founded after,

1262
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,393
which is supposed to be a limited 
government but important agency that 

1263
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,460
only stepped in when necessary.
It's gone far past those bounds.

1264
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,280
But that's what he had done.
And he was a conservative.

1265
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,443
A lot of the public land has been named 
after him because of all of his 

1266
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:58,700
contribution to conservation in the 
state.

1267
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,450
You've got a lot of former senators and 
congressmen and women,

1268
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,990
even some current ones who are leading 
on these issues from the Republican side

1269
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,920
because they realize they live on this 
land there in the mountains there,

1270
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:10,943
yeah.
In the cascades and the Olympics and 

1271
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,460
they really care.
Um,

1272
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,770
and I think that it's a different state 
for that.

1273
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:18,620
And then if you take away a Seattle,
it's a very conservative state.

1274
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:20,270
I mean,
you can say that about a lot of states,

1275
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:21,890
but uh,
and their big cities,

1276
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,710
but in Washington,
a lot of those mountainous,

1277
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:25,544
rural areas that are constantly impacted
by the environment or they live in the 

1278
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:30,140
environment,
uh,

1279
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,760
itself are conservative people who want 
to have leadership on this issue,

1280
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:36,650
but just don't really know where to find
it and only know,

1281
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:38,330
like you said,
of the big government,

1282
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,220
um,
interactions that can happen.

1283
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,260
And you've got the Seattle mayor and 
the,

1284
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:45,680
and the Washington governor who claim to
care about the environment,

1285
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:46,514
but nothing ever happens.
And I think a lot of people are sick of 

1286
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:49,184
those things,
especially in a state like Washington 

1287
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:51,110
where the environment matters.

1288
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,053
Yeah.
So where are you at with trump on all 

1289
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:54,460
this?
Because,

1290
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,190
okay,
we talked about climate,

1291
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,480
the Paris climate accords.
He got us out of that.

1292
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:00,460
So I sent your,
you're happy about that.

1293
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,730
His regulation situation,
I think they're cutting something and it

1294
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:04,564
changes all the time,
but if they're cutting a ton of 

1295
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:07,870
regulation for every new one that they 
pass,

1296
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,830
I think you're generally for that.
But I know you're not a big trump guy.

1297
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,210
That's probably putting it mildly,
right?

1298
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,590
Yes.
So where,

1299
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,960
where do you think he falls on the 
environmental stuff?

1300
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,563
I think I actually haven't been as 
annoyed with his environmental policies 

1301
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:22,914
as I would have thought before he was 
elected or even right after he was 

1302
00:55:25,431 --> 00:55:26,700
elected,
which I think is a good thing.

1303
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,920
But I think part of the problem that he 
falls into,

1304
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:31,020
which is what most conservatives fall 
into,

1305
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:36,380
is that they criticize the laugh.
They might like deregulate,

1306
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:38,940
they might remove some protections or 
whatever,

1307
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,760
but what are they going to do as an 
answer?

1308
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,330
What's going to be their solution that 
isn't anti-left or that,

1309
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,021
you know,
whatever.

1310
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:47,910
Whatever the solution is that they're 
cutting.

1311
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,650
What are they going to replace that 
with?

1312
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,200
And I think that trump hasn't done a 
good enough job,

1313
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:56,670
just like most conservatives recently of
doing that.

1314
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:57,563
Um,
swap of policy in terms of if you're 

1315
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:04,080
going to remove the protection here,
how are you going to protect it on the,

1316
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:04,460
Yep.

1317
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,070
So what is that answer that you'd like?

1318
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,693
Well,
I would like to see a and all of the 

1319
00:56:08,961 --> 00:56:12,490
above energy policy that is not focused 
on um,

1320
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,423
subsidies or tax breaks.
We need to remove those from the clean 

1321
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:18,740
energy or just from the energy sector in
general.

1322
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,830
I was actually not a fan of,
of trump's tariff on solar because while

1323
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:27,790
they have a ton of tax breaks,
so does oil and coal and we need to just

1324
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:28,624
put them on an even level playing field 
because consumers care about the free 

1325
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:32,560
market.
Also have the free market compete and if

1326
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:36,400
soar is the worst thing in the world and
it's just being propped up by subsidies,

1327
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,170
let's have the free market take it out.
If the coal,

1328
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:40,870
if calls done,
let's have colgate taken out.

1329
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:44,920
The free market needs to just dominate 
on the energy sector.

1330
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,980
And I think that the president needs to 
focus on that.

1331
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,900
Where would you leave a lot of that to 
the state?

1332
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:51,000
So for example,
a place like California where the sun is

1333
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:51,990
shining,
you know,

1334
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,720
367 days a year,
uh,

1335
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:55,643
you'd be for California just doing 
whatever it feels is right and related 

1336
00:56:57,961 --> 00:56:58,740
to solar.

1337
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,573
Exactly.
I think it should be up to the states 

1338
00:57:00,301 --> 00:57:01,950
and their different states that need 
different things,

1339
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,784
right?
Like Iowa and different states in the 

1340
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:05,970
Midwest get a lot of wins.
So,

1341
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,110
so,
uh,

1342
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,060
you know,
when energy makes a ton of sense.

1343
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,283
Um,
there are states like Washington that 

1344
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,040
have a lot of water and hydropower makes
a lot of sense.

1345
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:17,430
Arizona and Texas are two of the leading
states on solar.

1346
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,580
They're conservative states and usually 
solar is identified as a liberal thing,

1347
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,030
but those governors have totally 
implemented solar rvs.

1348
00:57:24,031 --> 00:57:26,250
They know it works and they know it's 
effective in their states.

1349
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,830
Solar would not really work that well in
Seattle.

1350
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:31,020
Right.
So it just depends on the state.

1351
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:31,854
And I think that unless the free market 
can decide that and have different 

1352
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,810
states figure out what they need,
uh,

1353
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:39,100
it's going to be really frustrating 
because it's,

1354
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,013
again,
it's going to be really frustrating for 

1355
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:41,514
states like Texas and Arizona and 
California who now are going to have to 

1356
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:47,580
pay a premium for solar when it's been 
really effective there.

1357
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,820
And now there's a tariff on it and an 
unnecessary tariff.

1358
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,590
And then,
you know,

1359
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:53,460
what,
what are they gonna do?

1360
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:54,294
They're going to have to figure out a 
different way to get their energy for 

1361
00:57:56,851 --> 00:57:59,070
those areas that they're losing the 
solar from.

1362
00:57:59,071 --> 00:58:01,110
So I've,
and solar panels,

1363
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:03,180
it's not like the ones that are already 
there can just stay there.

1364
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,430
They have like a 10 year lifespan a lot 
of the time.

1365
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,473
So a lot of them needs to be replaced.
And if there's a new tariff that's 

1366
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:09,810
damaging.
So I think that it just needs to be left

1367
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:14,130
up to the states.
And I think it also needs to be a lot of

1368
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:16,350
deregulation,
less subsidies,

1369
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,180
less tax breaks on the energy side.

1370
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,730
Yeah.
So a couple of minutes ago you mentioned

1371
00:58:19,731 --> 00:58:22,190
that the EPA has gone well past its 
mandate.

1372
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,810
Yeah.
I think this is an interesting one to,

1373
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,703
to sort of end on because I think it's a
good place to start when you're talking 

1374
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:30,074
to people because everyone,
I think if you talk to the average 

1375
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:32,354
person that,
that wants to do good by the 

1376
00:58:34,371 --> 00:58:35,204
environment,
they automatically think the EPA is 

1377
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:37,401
good,
right?

1378
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:40,220
It just environmental protection agency.
It sounds good.

1379
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,610
How could that possibly be bad?
What does that actually mean?

1380
00:58:43,611 --> 00:58:47,570
That they've gone beyond their original 
mandate and why does it keep growing and

1381
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:48,280
growing and grow?

1382
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,160
They're supposed to enforce the law,
not create the law.

1383
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,233
And the EPA has gone to the point where 
they are creating their own laws and 

1384
00:58:56,621 --> 00:59:00,340
they had been incredibly,
incredibly regulatory,

1385
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,403
um,
and have not helped the environment at 

1386
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:04,924
all.
What they're supposed to do is enforce 

1387
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,550
what Congress passes and what the 
American people want.

1388
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:11,790
And environmental protection.
For example,

1389
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:15,220
some Republicans put together a really 
amazing coastal barrier,

1390
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,323
uh,
resiliency act while Reagan was 

1391
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:22,220
president and the EPA enforces that.
That's what the EPA is supposed to do,

1392
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,590
not create their own regulations that 
says you can't do this.

1393
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:25,970
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

1394
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,090
Let that be up to the states and the 
local areas and if it needs to happen on

1395
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:30,590
the national level,
what type of a vote on it.

1396
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:31,813
And I think the EPA has become more of a
punishment organization rather than a 

1397
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,120
let's help the environment and get 
people to do the right thing.

1398
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,830
Um,
and only enforce the law.

1399
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,040
That's really what it's supposed to be.
And it's not become that at all.

1400
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,810
Um,
that being said,

1401
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,100
they,
they enforce the law.

1402
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:49,400
So those things need to stay in place.
You can't just remove that,

1403
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:53,450
but they have created their own really 
unnecessary regulatory reforms that have

1404
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:53,970
just not worked.

1405
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:54,803
Is that just the best argument for small
government in general that we just 

1406
00:59:56,851 --> 00:59:57,684
create these things,
these entities that are well 

1407
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:00,900
intentioned?
Usually?

1408
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,710
I think usually most of them are well 
at,

1409
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,320
you know,
department of education sounds good.

1410
01:00:04,321 --> 01:00:06,180
We're going to educate people,
environmental protective,

1411
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:09,180
we're going to predict the environment 
that these are usually well intentioned.

1412
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,223
But then just because of the way the 
government works because of gridlock in 

1413
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:14,340
Washington,
because of all the money poured in,

1414
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,850
they become these albatrosses that 
they've pretty much never,

1415
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,200
uh,
were intended to be.

1416
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,263
Yeah.
I think that that kind of leads into a 

1417
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:24,380
bigger issue as of how do we keep that 
from happening.

1418
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,483
Because I think most people will agree 
that there needs to be some sort of 

1419
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:28,964
government.
We're not just going to be governed by 

1420
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,063
ourselves.
We need to have some sort of government 

1421
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,510
and,
but it needs to be held accountable.

1422
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,433
So I don't know how often they need to 
look at where these agencies had been 

1423
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:39,584
going,
but obviously a lot of that have gone 

1424
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:43,730
way past what they need to be doing.
The Department of Education is a perfect

1425
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:48,500
example of really actually ruining the 
education system in the United States.

1426
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,560
And EPA has gone way past what it needs 
to be doing.

1427
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:52,663
We need to have a way to check on these 
areas frequently and make sure that 

1428
01:00:56,541 --> 01:01:00,620
they're sticking to what they were 
created to do and not going past that,

1429
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,450
uh,
and being held accountable for it.

1430
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,313
And I'm sure that happens.
It definitely happens with every new 

1431
01:01:06,051 --> 01:01:08,540
administration,
but nothing really ever changes.

1432
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:12,410
And I think that it's trump and every 
president from here on out that needs to

1433
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,890
analyze when they get into office,
where these agencies are at,

1434
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,620
how we can cut down or increase if 
that's necessary,

1435
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:19,483
what they're doing.
And I think that that can be a really 

1436
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:21,554
good answer,
but a bigger answer is to have state 

1437
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:25,304
governments and local leaders and local 
governments as well as businesses do 

1438
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,700
their own thing on these issues to prove
to the government,

1439
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,400
the federal government,
that we don't need restrictions,

1440
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,293
we don't need regulations,
we can do it ourselves and we're far 

1441
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,444
more effective.
And I think that that's the answer 

1442
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,350
rather than waiting on Congress to do 
something.

1443
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,070
Well that is a great closing statement,
my friend.

1444
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,340
But I got to ask you one more because 
it's so obvious to me.

1445
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:49,174
You've become a master at what what you 
care about and you're trying to do good 

1446
01:01:51,881 --> 01:01:55,240
work and that you actually are affecting
people.

1447
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,800
So what year are you running for office?
Just give me a ballpark.

1448
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,830
Maybe 2036

1449
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,193
wow.
Usually when I've asked a few people 

1450
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:05,300
this,
they pumped the question.

1451
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:10,810
You did not punt for more on Benjy and 
his budding political campaign.

1452
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,260
Check them out on twitter at Benji 
backer.
