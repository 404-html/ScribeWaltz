1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,473
I truly don't know if I could've come up
with a more perfect guest for the first 

2
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,970
episode of the show.
Sam Harris is a neuroscientist,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,540
author and founder of project reason and
according to some people,

4
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,820
he's also a genocidal maniac,
bent on nuking,

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,470
much of the Middle East.
Sam,

6
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:17,700
welcome to the show.
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,200
Pleasure to be here.
Which,

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,440
which half of that would you say 
describes you better?

9
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,350
We'll talk about both halves,
I imagine.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,190
Yeah.
I'll take the first though.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,900
Well I'm,
I'm really thrilled that you're here and

12
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,441
that,
you know,

13
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,274
you came in for my first show.
You said you were going to come in and 

14
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,130
October when your book comes out,
but I twisted your arm sufficiently and,

15
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:34,890
and here you are.
Yeah.

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,840
Well congratulations on the show too.
Thanks.

17
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,730
I appreciate it.
Alright,

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,340
so let's start.
Um,

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,840
I want to start basically were sort of,
I really found out about you and where I

20
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,740
think this whole discussion that we've,
every,

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,653
everyone's been having for the last 
eight months or so started and you were 

22
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,750
on real time with Bill Maher and you 
were on to talk about your book.

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,040
Bill was talking about liberalism and 
Islam and Ben Affleck was on,

24
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,750
and I know everyone's seen this clip 
already,

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,160
but let's take a look when

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,393
you want to talk about the treatment of 
women and homosexuals and free thinkers 

27
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:07,204
and,
and public intellectuals in the Muslim 

28
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,154
world.
Uh,

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,290
I would argue that the liberals have 
failed us and the crucial point

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,233
confusion,
like,

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,850
yeah,
thank God you're here.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,040
The crucial point of confusion

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,893
and is that,
that we have been sold this meme of 

34
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,374
Islamophobia where every criticism of 
the doctrine of Islam gets conflated 

35
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:30,390
with bigotry toward Muslims as people.
Right?

36
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,293
That is,
it's

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,540
intellectually ridiculous.
So even if it gets cold,

38
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,413
hold on.
Who the person who understands the 

39
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,420
officially codified doctrine of Islam.
You say,

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,263
well,
this is actually well educated on this 

41
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,290
topic.
I'm asking you if I criticize the,

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,270
you're saying that Islamophobia is not a
real thing,

43
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,800
that if you're critical of something,
it's not a real thing when we do it.

44
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,990
Right?
Well,

45
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,900
no,
it really is.

46
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,843
I'm not denying that that certain people
are bigoted against Muslims as people 

47
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,770
and that's a problem big have you.
But the gross,

48
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,740
it's racist and it's not.
It's,

49
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:06,880
but it's so nice.
So it's like saying nine years shifted,

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,753
you know what we are saying,
you guys are saying if you want to be 

51
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,520
liberals believe in liberal principles 
of freedom of speech.

52
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,730
Like you know,
we are endowed by our forefathers of the

53
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,850
low,
like all men are created.

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,693
No Fan.
We have to be able to criticize bad 

55
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,180
ideas.

56
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,010
So first off,
I think it's gross.

57
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,510
It's racist.
Should be your twitter bio.

58
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,344
Have you considered putting it there?
People have been just throwing that at 

59
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,330
me on twitter ever since.
Yeah,

60
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:27,860
yeah.
No,

61
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,600
it's a bit of a meme.
Yeah.

62
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,493
So what I want to start with is,
because I think there's obviously a ton 

63
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:33,344
of.
We can talk about the fallout of this 

64
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:34,814
and we'll get to that,
but I want to talk about actually the 

65
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:38,960
specifics of what happened there.
Did you expect.

66
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:39,794
Because usually when they bring on the 
guests that sits on bill's side of the 

67
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,494
table,
usually it's for a one on one with bill 

68
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,120
and sort of a casual conversation.
The panel doesn't really jump in.

69
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,060
Did you expect that whole thing to 
explode the way that it did?

70
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:50,600
No.
No,

71
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,433
not at all.
I was selling a book on meditation at 

72
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,160
that moment I was talking and the first 
year,

73
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,160
that's about 60 seconds into the 
exchange.

74
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,190
Yeah.
And so initially

75
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,150
it starts with,
you know,

76
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,310
how can an atheist be spiritual and 
there was a.

77
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,350
we're talking along those lines and I 
said something slightly derogatory about

78
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,800
the new age and Ben jumped into that 
space and,

79
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,853
and you know,
it was at my throat about Islam hadn't 

80
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,990
even come up so he clearly was poised to
do that and yeah,

81
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
it's considered a protected interview.
Everyone on the panel knows they're not 

82
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,580
supposed to jump in.
What do you think was going on with Ben?

83
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,743
Well,
apart from him possibly being on 

84
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,810
steroids for his,
uh,

85
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,200
his Batman role,
um,

86
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,920
I dunno,
I just think he clearly had he,

87
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,813
I think he had no idea who I was really,
but someone had given him a paragraph 

88
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,550
bio of me and had,
had more or less told him that,

89
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,480
you know,
I'm a,

90
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,050
a bigot who's intolerant of Muslims and,
you know,

91
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,020
he really should,
you know,

92
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:52,960
take a whack at me on that topic.

93
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,860
Yeah.
And honestly,

94
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,703
I was,
I think I was a little slow to 

95
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,270
appreciate how hostile he was because I 
wasn't just looking at him.

96
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
I was actually looking at Nick Kristoff,
who I have actually collided with on 

97
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:08,950
this topic and who my remarks were more 
pitched to,

98
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,920
I think more appropriately pitched 
because nick really deals with,

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,770
with,
uh,

100
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,480
especially women's rights issues in the 
developing world to a unique degree.

101
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,890
So I had a bit of a bone to pick with 
nick and um,

102
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,163
and there were other.
Michael Steele was on the panel and so 

103
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,103
my attention was split and so I wasn't 
just kind of out of the corner of my 

104
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,100
consciousness was I was understanding 
that there was a level of hostility here

105
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:33,934
that I didn't really expect or know how 
to interpret and so talking about 

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,010
knowing how to interpret it,
like it's a little different if,

107
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,893
if Nick Kristoff or some author or a 
philosopher had immediately jumped out 

108
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,030
at you like that,
I think perhaps it would have dealt with

109
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,540
it in one way,
but when a big.

110
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,340
I mean this is an a list Hollywood star,
this is Batman jumps at you that way.

111
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,010
Did that throw you off in a way that you
look,

112
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,844
you were cool and collected there,
but just having to deal with someone at 

113
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:02,310
that level,
it's a different ballgame,

114
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,280
you know?
Yeah.

115
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:06,010
Well it's hard to interrupt a,
a,

116
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,900
a movie star who doesn't want to be 
interrupted.

117
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,830
So at a certain point,
you know,

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,160
if bill's not going to cut them off,
I can't cut them off.

119
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,370
So trying to get a word in edgewise is a
challenge there.

120
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:19,420
But I mean,
the irony is the sentence,

121
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:20,254
he was reacting to the sentence where I 
say everyone conflates criticism of 

122
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,730
Islam instead of ideas with bigotry 
against Muslims as people.

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,073
Uh,
he no sooner no sooner were those words 

124
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,924
uttered.
Then he demonstrated my thesis with 

125
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,360
every subsequent statement and it was 
just impossible to,

126
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,480
to get that mirror bent,
you know,

127
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,330
close enough toward his face so that he 
could recognize what,

128
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,430
what he was doing.
So he literally,

129
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,380
for the remainder of the 12 minutes,
I mean,

130
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:51,030
he continually go and repeatedly proved 
your theory.

131
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,620
Then I continued for an hour in the 
green room afterwards and it was,

132
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,420
it was,
it was by no means resolved.

133
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah.
And clearly hasn't resolved since.

134
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,050
All right.
So

135
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,990
I don't want to focus too much on that 
specifically,

136
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:02,360
but I just want to talk about when 
someone throws,

137
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,171
you know,
he throws this,

138
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,820
it's gross,
it's racist.

139
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,530
Suddenly I noticed that the next day the
onus was on you and Bill Maher.

140
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,950
And a little more to bill I think to 
prove that you weren't racist.

141
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,620
I have never been a big fan of bills for
a long time.

142
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,010
I've never heard anyone call him racist 
ever before,

143
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,680
but suddenly the next day on all the 
websites,

144
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,200
it was Ben Affleck Call Sam Harris and 
bill and my racist is Ben,

145
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,650
is Bill Maher Racist?
Is Sam Harris Racist?

146
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,753
How does that feel in that moment of the
discussion when someone throws that 

147
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,660
gauntlet down because you're,
you're,

148
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,640
you're used to debate and people with 
ideas,

149
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,230
not just words.

150
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,673
Well,
it's very dispiriting because it's 

151
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:45,890
almost guaranteed to convince half the 
audience happy and this is something.

152
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,870
This is the first thing I said to Ben 
afterwards in the green room,

153
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:52,080
I said,
you realize just calling us racist,

154
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,333
convinced half the people listening and 
watching that were racist and leaders 

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
are using that word is enough for 
people.

156
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:02,190
So people just assume where there's 
smoke,

157
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,024
there's fire.
They can't figure out what anyone is 

158
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:05,514
actually saying that their attention 
span is so truncated that using words 

159
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:11,590
like that,
uh,

160
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,880
again,
just convinces fully half the audience.

161
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,773
And the most depressing thing in the 
aftermath of this was to see the 

162
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,513
outpouring of the celebration of 
disproportionally and the Muslim 

163
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:25,464
community on social media from people 
who thought that he had just mopped the 

164
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:33,234
floor with us,
that he had exposed our racism for all 

165
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,174
to see and he had argued brilliantly and
he's just this white knight for the 

166
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,850
Muslim world.
And it was so embarrassing because he,

167
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,170
of course he did none of that.
He was,

168
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,023
he wasn't making any sense.
He wasn't listening to what we were 

169
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,280
actually saying.
And he was simply,

170
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,490
um,
uh,

171
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,290
you know,
calling us names,

172
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,960
know very loaded names and,
and it,

173
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,010
it works for people who want to perceive
the conversation along those lines.

174
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,060
Was there was this meme or this idea of 
you as a racist,

175
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:03,894
was that even out there?
Because now I see it in a dialogue all 

176
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:07,320
the time.
But,

177
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,110
but I had never heard of it.
And to be 100 percent honest with you,

178
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,800
I had sort of ancillary knew your work.
I'm not even sure if I was following you

179
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:14,634
on twitter at the time.
So I know a lot of people when they're 

180
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:18,330
done with this,
they're going to have just as Sam Harris

181
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,470
fanboy and blah blah,
blah,

182
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,304
blah,
blah.

183
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,570
But I really,
I didn't.

184
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,310
I was watching that and I thought,
well,

185
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,144
here's someone making some sense.
And Now ben Affleck's just using the 

186
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:27,684
worst kind of language with him.
But was that idea about you out there 

187
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:31,640
before?

188
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,150
Well,
not.

189
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,901
Well,
yeah,

190
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:36,580
I think Glenn Greenwald and a few other 
people had put it out there.

191
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,730
So it was,
I mean,

192
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,590
it's,
it's a trope of,

193
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,843
um,
political politically correct liberal 

194
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:47,960
apology around criticism of Islam.
So this notion of Islamophobia,

195
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,940
the idea that,
that to single out Islam for any special

196
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:57,941
attention as a set of doctrines or as a 
political in today's world is tantamount

197
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,450
to synonymous with or covertly motivated
by racist bigotry toward Arabs are Brown

198
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,060
skinned people.
Um,

199
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,923
and you know,
there are many people like Glenn 

200
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,820
Greenwald who quite irresponsibly,
you know,

201
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,270
make that point again and again.
Um,

202
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,870
and so,
yeah,

203
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,670
so,
so ben's a started.

204
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:27,870
That was not the first time criticism of
Islam has been conflated with racism,

205
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,480
but it's,
it's,

206
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,470
I mean it's such a crazy claim because 
it,

207
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,570
I mean this has been pointed out again 
and again,

208
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,060
and bill's done this,
but Islam is not a race.

209
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,030
It's a set of ideas.
You can't convert away from a race.

210
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,940
You can't convert to erase Rachel 
Dolezal.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,920
You can get this right.
You.

212
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,890
Yes you can.
You can.

213
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,773
A few at one person can do that.
Everything I say about Islam applies to 

214
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,554
white,
converts to the faith every bit as much 

215
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,740
as it does to,
to Arabs or,

216
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,190
or anyone born into it.
Sure.

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,193
In fact,
even more so because that means you've 

218
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,563
had,
if you're 30 years old and had not had 

219
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:04,050
this drummed into you on mother's knee 
and with a full adult,

220
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,400
you know,
clear viewing of,

221
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,800
of your life and all the opportunities 
available to you,

222
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,933
you decide to convert to the most 
doctrinaire and repressive form of 

223
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:12,864
Islam.
Well then then I have the most to say 

224
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,390
about you.
You know,

225
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,540
someone like Adam.
Good.

226
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,580
Don,
who's the.

227
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,623
I think he's now dead,
but I'm the guy from Orange County who 

228
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,740
joined al Qaeda,
you know,

229
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,793
this is,
these are so and everything I say about 

230
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:29,160
Islam as a religion.
That is true.

231
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,994
I've said some disparaging things about 
it as a set of ideas and I've compared 

232
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,880
it unfavorably to Buddhism and Hinduism,
which you know,

233
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,050
their,
their adherence are,

234
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,033
are for the most part not white like me.
So the idea that racism has the notions 

235
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,190
of race has anything to do with this is 
just completely crazy.

236
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,990
I took the top five things that I think 
people attack you on my opinion,

237
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,950
misquote you on and I thought maybe we 
could take five minutes for each one,

238
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,880
five or six minutes for each one and 
that way each time someone says,

239
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:56,714
well,
Sam Harris wants to nuke the Middle 

240
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,903
East,
or Sam Harris wants to racially profile 

241
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:00,584
Muslims or whatever it is.
You or I or anyone that's clear-minded 

242
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,800
can just send a link and say,
here it is in five minutes.

243
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,663
You don't have to read a book.
You don't have to watch a three hour 

244
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,050
interview here.
I think the number one thing that people

245
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,350
say about you is that when you say 
Islam,

246
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,460
you mean all Muslims.
Right?

247
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,610
Right.
So take it away.

248
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,241
Yeah.
So the,

249
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,074
the claim is that I generalize about 
Muslims and this is incredibly ironic 

250
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:30,470
because half the time on,
in that film clip,

251
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,693
uh,
was spent where I was talking about 

252
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,323
statistics and poll results and 
percentages and a certain percentage is 

253
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,450
jihadist and then there's a wider circle
of,

254
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,390
of Islamists and then there's a wider,
wider circle of conservatives.

255
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,553
And so I never generalize about the 
Muslim world and in so far as we have 

256
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:50,684
good data on the numbers of people who 
subscribed various beliefs that I'm 

257
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:59,371
always looking at those data.
And so I'm at everything I say about the

258
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:04,150
problem of,
of Islam and Islamism,

259
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,590
um,
takes as its area of concern.

260
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,424
First and foremost,
the people living in the Muslim world 

261
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,370
who are living under the shadow of,
of,

262
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,990
if not the boot of theocracy.
So you know,

263
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,970
women and gays and free thinkers and 
public intellectuals and atheists.

264
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,240
People who email me saying they're 
afraid their,

265
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,350
their mother and father will kill them.
If they knew they were an atheist,

266
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,760
for instance,
um,

267
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,043
and there's nobody who I,
who I celebrate more than Muslim 

268
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:36,874
apostates and muzzle and true reformist 
Muslims like my coauthor on this new 

269
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,134
book,
Magenta was who have taken just heroic 

270
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:44,614
risks to say critical things about the 
faith in a context where it's much more 

271
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,410
dangerous to do so then the context and 
where were you and I live and I mean,

272
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:53,910
so,
you know,

273
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,640
if I were a Muslim in Pakistan saying 
half of what I'm saying on this show,

274
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:01,700
I would have a life expectancy of about 
five hours and that is a,

275
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,583
that is a political and human rights 
reality that every liberal who's using 

276
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,960
this term Islamophobia is disregarding 
at,

277
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,380
at,
not at their peril,

278
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:15,730
at the peril of all the people who are 
not being helped by,

279
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,570
um,
by Westerners who could help,

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,433
you know,
and non Muslims who could help and what 

281
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:22,284
non Muslims can do is help in whatever 
way possible to make criticism of 

282
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,070
theocracy in the Muslim world.

283
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,760
Safe to do so.
Yeah.

284
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:32,770
No,
I don't generalize.

285
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,830
And I think,
um,

286
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,223
of course there are millions and 
millions of Muslims who do not take the 

287
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,930
barbaric passages in the Quran and the 
Hadith seriously and who are not wanting

288
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:51,250
to kill apostates and don't and don't 
want to throw gays from rooftops.

289
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,740
And those are not the people I'm talking
about.

290
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:54,574
I mean,
or if I'm ever talking about them in my 

291
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,674
criticism of religion,
I'm talking about them in the same 

292
00:13:58,601 --> 00:13:59,860
spirit that I talk about,
you know,

293
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:04,180
reformed Jews or,
or non-doctrinaire Christians who are,

294
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,910
who are not a real threat to anybody who
but who,

295
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:10,480
or but who may be bending public policy 
around in ways we don't like.

296
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,063
The problem with many of those Muslims 
is they don't want their religion 

297
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:23,920
criticized at all and they don't want 
any link between its core tenants.

298
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:26,650
Could tenants around Jihad and paradise 
and martyrdom.

299
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,910
A spelled out,
uh,

300
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,620
with,
you know,

301
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,533
in terms of it's,
it's the way it's generating the kinds 

302
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:37,510
of violence and intolerance where we're 
seeing in the world today.

303
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,344
So in so far,
if you're going to defend your religion 

304
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,044
by saying Islam is a religion of peace 
and the Islamic state has nothing to do 

305
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,980
with Islam,
you're being intellectually dishonest.

306
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:52,550
And that kind of denial of obvious 
realities now is I think,

307
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,560
you know,
irresponsible and dangerous.

308
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,453
Yeah.
Just to close the door to notions of 

309
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,250
racism and bigotry against Muslims as 
people.

310
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,420
And I think,
I think the apostates,

311
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,390
the intellectuals,
the women,

312
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,243
um,
the gaze of the Muslim world are the 

313
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:11,714
most,
the most important people in the world 

314
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:14,960
right now.
If we,

315
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,950
if we could give green cards to every 
real secularist in the Muslim world,

316
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,200
I think they should just get to the 
front of the line.

317
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,620
I mean,
these are,

318
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,440
these are the people who need to be 
empowered.

319
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,620
And so that's um,
I mean,

320
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,430
the irony is that they,
if they could leave the Muslim world,

321
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,380
the Muslim world needs them,
right?

322
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,390
So maybe we,
the best thing to do would be to empower

323
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:37,280
them in the Muslim world.
But method,

324
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,740
you know,
life for these people is,

325
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,910
um,
in countries like Pakistan and Bankman,

326
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,753
we have Bangladeshi blogger is being 
murdered in public by machete wielding 

327
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,210
maniacs and nothing happens,
right?

328
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,650
Um,
it's,

329
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,940
um,
yeah,

330
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,320
I mean,
I,

331
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,153
so my,
everything I say about Islam is a 

332
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:59,150
confession of solidarity with these 
people.

333
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,770
And so how you get racism out of that or
bigotry against Muslims as people,

334
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,000
you know,
that's you.

335
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,580
You're a better geometer than I.
This is,

336
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,443
this is a big one and I've seen this one
really take a life of its own that you 

337
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:15,680
want to do a nuclear first strike on the
Muslim world,

338
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,663
right?

339
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,713
Is that true,
Sam?

340
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,831
No,
no.

341
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:19,700
Alas,
it's not true.

342
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Okay.
Um,

343
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,810
I guess it,
it was made,

344
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,813
made true apparently,
or at least to the satisfaction of many 

345
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:26,774
people by Chris Hedges who went around 
in every stop on his book tour Know 

346
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,673
Radio,
television,

347
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,790
print telling people that this was in 
fact my position.

348
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,320
Um,
and many people like Glenn Greenwald and

349
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,790
Reza Aslan,
and you know,

350
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,970
you're a old colleague,
Janky,

351
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:46,430
eager,
have,

352
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,520
have,
have reiterated this claim.

353
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,760
There are a couple of passages in the my
first book,

354
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,594
the end of faith where I talk about how 
a certainty about paradise and about 

355
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,354
martyrdom is the best way to get there,
just destroys the logic of nuclear 

356
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,024
deterrence,
of mutually assured destruction that we 

357
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:07,094
had kept us more or less poised on the 
brink of a mutual annihilation with the 

358
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,500
Soviet Union for so many years.
Uh,

359
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,260
and I just pointed out what I think is 
an obvious fact and still isn't obvious.

360
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,093
Facts should be an obvious fact and a 
very troubling one that if you have a 

361
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,550
regime that has the,
the,

362
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,290
that is the psychological equivalent of 
the 19 hijackers,

363
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,133
but people who woke up in the morning 
wanting to fly a plane into a building 

364
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,560
that is a regime who you can't,
they're not rational actors,

365
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,600
you can't,
or if they're rational,

366
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:42,230
it's rational within a context of 
believing that they're going to paradise

367
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,460
this way.
Right?

368
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:44,920
So what's the rational part of that?
Yeah,

369
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,173
but it's rare.
If you believe that it's rational to 

370
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:48,380
blow up the world,
you know,

371
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,550
it's rational to hit the wall 400 miles 
an hour.

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,070
So,
um,

373
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,263
this is not,
so I pointed out the obvious fact that 

374
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:56,454
we have to avoid the circumstance at all
costs and there's no one who should be 

375
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,104
more cognizant of this problem then 
so-called moderate Muslims or so or 

376
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,280
secular Muslims or non jihadist,
uh,

377
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,373
Muslims and um,
we have to collectively find some path 

378
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,243
to a alternative future in which you 
don't have a true jihadist regime armed 

379
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,160
with a long range.

380
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,820
Nuclear Weapons and all of those long 
range is,

381
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,230
is crucial.
And so you have Pakistan,

382
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,064
Pakistan already has nuclear weapons.
Do I think we should execute a nuclear 

383
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,150
first strike on packs?
Pakistan?

384
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:33,984
No,
in Pakistan is not first of all age 

385
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,090
hottest regime and though,
you know,

386
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,100
they're one cool away from being taken 
over by one,

387
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:41,934
but they're also,
they don't have the warheads that can 

388
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,530
deliver these nukes to the capitals of 
Europe or to the US.

389
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,270
Um,
it's a very different circumstance.

390
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,740
And um,
so yes,

391
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,390
no,
there's nothing that I say in that book,

392
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,790
the suggests that we should be nuking 
Iran,

393
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,560
you know,
and it's just,

394
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,633
this is all I was talking about is how 
the kind of game theoretic logic of 

395
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,940
nuclear deterrence that we lived however
precariously under,

396
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:09,774
with the Soviet Union falls apart.
Once you admit to yourself that it's 

397
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,574
possible that truly suicidal religious 
maniacs can get their hands on these 

398
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:20,790
weapons.

399
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,900
And so all I was calling for his,
his,

400
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,250
um,
our awareness that is a,

401
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,790
that really is a game changer and we 
have to avoid that at all cost.

402
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,890
Right?
And you know,

403
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:33,000
you said this was just a few passages in
your book.

404
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,630
It was literally about a page,
right?

405
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,160
It's like a paragraph or two.
Yeah.

406
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,480
Right.
So when people have blown this up into,

407
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,483
into some something that somehow this is
like this massive idea that you had 

408
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,063
actually a good friend of mine who I 
agree with that a lot of things and 

409
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:48,170
disagree on some other things.
Uh,

410
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,103
he,
what he says to me in relation to this 

411
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,310
is that you are laying the philosophical
groundwork for a nuclear first strike.

412
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,203
People respond to this passage as though
I invented nuclear weapons or that I 

413
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,314
think there are a good thing.
I'm just talking about the reality of 

414
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:03,450
our world.

415
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,300
We have a,
we have a nuclear policy,

416
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,980
right?
We have a first strike policy.

417
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:11,370
We have a.
So someone somewhere in a war room has,

418
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,263
has beaten out every choice point in 
terms of what are the circumstances 

419
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,810
where we would use nuclear weapons 
first,

420
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,850
what are the circumstances where we 
would do,

421
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:22,310
where we would,
um,

422
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,223
uh,
where we would imagine that they're 

423
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,050
going to be used against us first and 
then have to preempt that.

424
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,923
And uh,
this has all been thought out in a Cold 

425
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,873
War context.
We haven't had to worry about anyone 

426
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:34,914
else doing this to us.
And when you're talking about other 

427
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,960
regimes like China or North Korea,
there are,

428
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,143
um,
there's a plausible assumption that 

429
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:46,470
they're not suicidal then that everyone 
isn't eager to die.

430
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,433
Right?
And now we are talking about a set of 

431
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,260
ideas,
you know,

432
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,310
jihadist eschatology to this,
this idea that,

433
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,173
that martyrdom is a real metaphysical 
principle and it's not only okay to die 

434
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,220
in the right circumstances is the best 
possible thing that can happen to you.

435
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,380
Um,
and that there really is,

436
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,243
there's no such thing as innocent 
collateral damage because all the good 

437
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,034
people are going to go to paradise with 
you and they're just going to thank you 

438
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:16,414
for it,
right?

439
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,400
So there's nothing can go wrong and this
world is just fit to be destroyed.

440
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,510
That is the ideology that you see in a 
happily a,

441
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,390
a small minority of Muslims at this 
moment.

442
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:35,110
But it is not an accident that these 
people feel this way because it's,

443
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,430
it's a very plausible,
literal reading of the texts during real

444
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,264
time.
You said that Islam is the mother lode 

445
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:42,814
of that ideas.
Now I've seen since I've seen you 

446
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,304
tweeted someone you tweeted a couple of 
weeks ago at somebody that Judaism is a 

447
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,960
motherload of bad ideas.
Well,

448
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:52,250
I should've said the motherlode.
I mean,

449
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,630
that was,
that was the one moment in that exchange

450
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,130
with,
with athletic wear.

451
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,890
Um,
it seems to me,

452
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:02,460
I misspoke.
I mean it was just insane.

453
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,650
V as opposed to a what,
because I obviously I've written,

454
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,480
I've written more about Christianity 
then Islam,

455
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:10,420
right?
So I criticize religion in general.

456
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,720
I think faith based religion is the 
mother lode of bad ideas.

457
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,590
My faith,
faith based thinking,

458
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:22,591
this idea that somehow you're wanting 
something to be true is a good surrogate

459
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,300
for evidence that it is true,
right?

460
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,134
And,
and a way in which you can embrace self 

461
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:32,020
deception and deception of others as a 
legitimate principal.

462
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,243
Um,
that I think as a mother lode of bad 

463
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:38,200
ideas and religion has kind of a corner 
on that market at the moment.

464
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,130
But,
uh,

465
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,963
Islam is an especially dangerous a 
variant of it within our current 

466
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:50,830
political rally or I should say Islamism
as opposed to Islamic general.

467
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,723
So when you,
when you say that you're talking about 

468
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:53,674
because of the Geo politics,
because of the maturation of the 

469
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:57,760
religion itself,
right?

470
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,610
We know that Judaism is far older,
Christianity's older,

471
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,500
they've gone through different 
reformations.

472
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,780
So partly this just has to do with 
timing,

473
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:05,591
right?
Yeah.

474
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:07,810
It's not old,
but unfortunately it's not only time,

475
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,033
but timing is enough to differentiate 
them because obviously Christianity 500 

476
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,790
years ago was Christians were burning 
people alive,

477
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,830
but the on street corners,
by the way,

478
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,230
you've written a ton about that.
Oh yeah.

479
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,750
This isn't just saying.
You're saying to me right now.

480
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,850
No,
I've written more about that.

481
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,010
I wrote a whole book just on 
Christianity.

482
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:27,020
I have done that with Islam except this,
um,

483
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,710
this newest book that I wrote with the 
Majid Nawaz.

484
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,530
So,
you know,

485
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,970
there are,
there are historical differences between

486
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,280
Islam and Christianity and other 
religions.

487
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,114
And there,
there are unfortunately theological 

488
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:43,531
differences that make Islam a harder 
doctrine to modify.

489
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,000
But it's just as,
as a sheer matter of history,

490
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,900
Islam has not had a reformation,
a,

491
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,280
a,
an enlightenment.

492
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,730
I mean,
they had,

493
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,563
hasn't had the,
hasn't been modulating buy maternity in 

494
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,620
the same way.
And um,

495
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,503
you're talking about for the most part,
people who have been intellectually 

496
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:05,930
isolated to a degree that,
that should be unheard of,

497
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:10,931
but it's still quite common in the 21st 
century and unhappily they are,

498
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,023
they're isolated from the ideas and ways
of thinking that the give a science and 

499
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,624
give us a commitment to human rights and
give us a commitment to pluralism and 

500
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,254
democracy,
but they're not isolated from the 

501
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:26,180
destructive enabling technology that 
we've produced.

502
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:29,150
So you have people who are legitimate 
engineers,

503
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,110
right.
And legitimate,

504
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:30,944
you know,
computer scientists even who are 

505
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:34,880
jihadists.
Right?

506
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:35,714
Who wants,
who will use the tools of maternity 

507
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,210
against any kind of set of modern values
that,

508
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,030
that we would be wise to defend.

509
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:44,861
Yeah.
All right.

510
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:47,830
So I think what you said is it is not 
the mother load,

511
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:51,790
but it is a motherload within the 
context of timing,

512
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,740
geopolitics and,
and a whole bunch of others.

513
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:54,210
Yeah.
No,

514
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,090
I certainly should've said a motherload 
about it.

515
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,960
It's the next one.
You want to racially profile Muslims,

516
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,060
right?
That was a painful.

517
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,913
Yeah.
Now,

518
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,221
yeah,
I've,

519
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:05,170
uh,
I read your piece on it.

520
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,140
If that's the case,
you actually want to,

521
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,770
you're either Muslim where you want to 
actually go screw yourself.

522
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,350
I am of the race that should be 
profiled.

523
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,243
Yeah.
So can you explain that a little bit 

524
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,744
more?
So we've all had this experience of 

525
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:16,340
going through

526
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,173
clarity and seeing people who at a 
glance you can rule out as a non 

527
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,170
jihadist.
I mean we,

528
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,550
we,
all I've argued for in,

529
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,413
in,
in the few things I've said about 

530
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,950
profiling is that we should be honest 
about where,

531
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,030
what we're looking for.
We're looking for gi suicidal jihadists.

532
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,953
Now there are other,
you know,

533
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,210
there are other suicidal people who may 
bring down planes,

534
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:43,640
but as,
as a general matter,

535
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,893
we're looking for people who are the 
functional equivalent of the 19 

536
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,294
hijackers,
right?

537
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,380
So we're not looking for an 80 year old 
women from Okinawa.

538
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:58,460
We're not looking for a little girls 
from Norway.

539
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:00,590
If Jerry Seinfeld is going to the 
airport,

540
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:01,424
if he gets the same search that,
that someone who looks like Osama bin 

541
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,790
Ladin does,
that's a crazy misuse of resources.

542
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:11,840
Now there are little wrinkles here that 
we can correct for.

543
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:14,270
It's possible to put a bomb and someone 
else's bags.

544
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,080
All banks should be searched.
I mean the.

545
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,420
Yes,
you can think this through,

546
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:22,421
but there are people who you absolutely 
know at a glance are not terrorists.

547
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,743
Right.
And any moment spent scrutinizing them 

548
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,113
in this security theater we've all 
witnessed at TSA is a moment not 

549
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:35,930
actually intelligently looking for a 
more plausible threat.

550
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:36,764
So I met my.
My view is we have $10 worth of 

551
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,330
attention.
If you spend a dollar over here,

552
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:43,650
you've got nine to spend elsewhere.
Right.

553
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,530
So it's just a zero sum game.
And so my,

554
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,860
my sense is,
because again,

555
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:53,910
we,
we need well trained smart people at Tsa

556
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,020
to do that.
So that's a whole other.

557
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,200
Yeah.
So it's not,

558
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,080
it's not like we're well poised to do 
this,

559
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:00,240
but when you look at what the Israelis 
do,

560
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:03,330
when you look at you,
if you ever get on l and you look at how

561
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,100
they run security,
yes,

562
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:07,170
they look at everybody,
but there's,

563
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,033
there's,
there's absolutely no pretense of being 

564
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,020
fair in this process and there shouldn't
be.

565
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,920
Right?
It's just like a.

566
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,140
and when I go through security,
you know,

567
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,350
50 percent of the people to me look 
like,

568
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,480
and I'm not,
I'm not saying that I'm an expert here,

569
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:22,314
but I'm,
you know,

570
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,750
I pay attention to this sort of stuff a 
lot.

571
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,093
Um,
I would be willing to bet my life that 

572
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,400
certain people are just in this blog 
post.

573
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,234
I showed a picture of one.
I'm a one old woman who you just know 

574
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,570
it's,
there's absolutely no way she's joined.

575
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,730
Okay.
So you look at her and you say,

576
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:42,564
okay,
the scrutiny on her is a waste of time 

577
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:45,594
and it's a dangerous waste of time.
And in the interest of appearing fair 

578
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,900
and we are actually ramping up our risk,
um,

579
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,640
and being appearing right because it's 
just appearing.

580
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,550
It's not actually.
Yeah.

581
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,300
But you and I fit it,
fit the profile,

582
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,500
you know,
young to middle aged men who could be,

583
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,500
we could be jihadists right there.

584
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,820
There are jihadists who ally.
Like,

585
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:09,830
as I said,
you know,

586
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:11,930
Adam Gadahn or um,
uh,

587
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,823
and in these other western recruits to 
al Qaeda or isis who functionally look 

588
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,081
like us.
They're not,

589
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,220
they don't look like Arabs,
they're not,

590
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,220
you know,
they're not holding Pakistani passports.

591
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,230
Um,
so yeah,

592
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,064
no,
I'm not letting myself off the hook 

593
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:27,840
here.
It's not like I,

594
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,673
you know,
I want me and the other white guys to 

595
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:30,930
just sail through.
It's just,

596
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,470
it's just there.
There are still people who are obviously

597
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:35,304
not jihadists and until these people 
start blowing themselves up on planes I 

598
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:40,220
am,
I think we're,

599
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:43,260
we'd be wise to just admit we know what 
we're looking for,

600
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,090
we have,
we have some sense of what we're looking

601
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,924
for.
And just to be crystal clear in that 

602
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:48,720
post,
you literally said,

603
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,673
I'm just reiterating what you just said,
but that you should be picked out and 

604
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,070
you actually should be picked up.

605
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,903
And as I describe it as anti profiling,
it's not that I want certain people 

606
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,164
profiled.
I just want us to admit that certain 

607
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:02,310
people require less scrutiny.
And you know,

608
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:03,650
Jerry Seinfeld is one,
you know,

609
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,150
when you see a famous celebrity,
you know,

610
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,093
go through security,
treat it as though he just may have 

611
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:11,640
become a jihadist,
you know,

612
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:12,450
and you know,
when,

613
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,650
when no one was watching,
it just,

614
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,110
it's crazy making it is security 
theater.

615
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,973
Yeah.
And there,

616
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,893
there,
there are many people who though not 

617
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,873
famous,
are every bit as unlikely to be members 

618
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:29,040
of al Qaeda as a prominent people who we
know,

619
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:29,874
you know,
Betty White,

620
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,350
betty,
Betty White is,

621
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,920
is,
uh,

622
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,360
I would not be happy about that.
That would be a surprise.

623
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:36,810
Yeah,
I will have one if they weren't.

624
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,880
Betty white gets a profile.
All right.

625
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:39,714
So the final one of these sort of five 
pillars of Sam Harris being the big one 

626
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,440
is your anneal con.
Uh,

627
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,320
so I think we should define neo-con 
first.

628
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,154
You want to,
you want to handle that or do you want 

629
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:51,480
me to.
Well,

630
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,140
I think it means many things to many 
people,

631
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,190
but it's,
it's the,

632
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,970
uh,
it's the,

633
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,830
the attitude toward foreign policy that 
I think most was,

634
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,753
was canonized by people like Richard 
Perle and Paul Wolfowitz in the run up 

635
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:09,480
to,

636
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,160
um,
uh,

637
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,290
the first,
uh,

638
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,060
uh,
or our,

639
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,930
our invasion of Iraq after nine slash 
11.

640
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,933
This idea that we can go in in a very 
muscular way and just create nations 

641
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,600
along democratic lines and that our 
foreign policy should be very aggressive

642
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,470
and,
and,

643
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,304
um,
we'll fight them over there so we don't 

644
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:32,800
have to fight them here.
And

645
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,433
um,

646
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,220
I think we've all,
I mean I was,

647
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:38,140
you know,
I was never for the Iraq war.

648
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:38,974
I was never a vocally against it either.
I just was at every moment through that 

649
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,330
process,
I was just painfully aware that I had no

650
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,164
idea what to think about it.
Apart from it looked very risky and it 

651
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:54,310
looked like a frank distraction from the
war in Afghanistan,

652
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,144
which did seem to me to be necessary and
seemed like something we were probably 

653
00:30:58,571 --> 00:30:59,404
gonna botch.
One thing you can say against 

654
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,983
neoconservatism,
which is that it is idealistic to a 

655
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:09,070
degree that now seems not at all 
sustainable.

656
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:09,904
I mean we,
W we,

657
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,590
we should have learned a lesson at this 
point,

658
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:14,140
which is we don't do this very well.
We don't nation build very well.

659
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,453
We have a political environment where we
just can't stay committed to these 

660
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:19,070
things.
Even if we were,

661
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,560
we're doing it well,
you know,

662
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,020
we,
we,

663
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,230
we,
we view everything through a four year,

664
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,620
you know,
Presidential Lens and an election cycle.

665
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,510
And so,
and these are,

666
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,050
these are multi-decade commitments if 
we're going to do this as well.

667
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:33,490
So,
um,

668
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,683
but Iraq looks like a disaster and it 
looked like a disaster for most of the 

669
00:31:38,681 --> 00:31:39,770
time apart from,
you know,

670
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,680
15 minutes thereafter,
the surge.

671
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,600
Um,
and I certainly don't consider myself an

672
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:46,450
neo-con.
I just,

673
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,333
I,
I just think we have to be honest about 

674
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,593
in ethical terms,
what is really going on in the world 

675
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:52,924
when you,
if you're going to say that we never 

676
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:54,754
should have gone into Iraq,
which I think is a reasonable thing to 

677
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:57,874
say.
And it was a reasonable thing to say 

678
00:31:58,571 --> 00:31:59,404
then you just,
you only decent to admit how depressing 

679
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,730
a claim this really is.
Ms Dot.

680
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:07,564
We're saying that,
that Iraq is a place that requires a 

681
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,470
psychopathic thug to run it in a given 
the level of religious sectarianism,

682
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,480
given the fact that when you remove a 
butcher like Saddam Hussein,

683
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,750
everyone starts killing their neighbor,
right?

684
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,400
Which is,
which is in fact what happened.

685
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,443
And,
and which is in fact they political and 

686
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,634
religious reality.
We underestimated when we walked in 

687
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:33,604
there thinking that they were just going
to put flowers in the barrels of our 

688
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:37,450
guns and welcome us as liberators.

689
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,170
Uh,
so it's a,

690
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,004
um,
it's a very depressing thing to admit 

691
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,330
about the state of,
of a place like Iraq.

692
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,193
But I,
and I think we should all mean I view 

693
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,410
Iraq as initially we went when Saddam 
was there as a,

694
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,244
as a kind of hostage crisis when you 
have a totally illegitimate regime run 

695
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,910
by barbarians,
uh,

696
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,650
keeping tens of millions of people 
hostage.

697
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,773
And,
and so the people who criticize the war 

698
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:11,300
based on saying that it was a sovereign 
government.

699
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:12,134
And we should never have gone in there.
It's not just a failure to engage with 

700
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,093
the moral reality,
which is this was a terrible place to 

701
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:23,450
live and if we could have done something
to help these people,

702
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,313
we should have.
And there are many countries that fit 

703
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:27,590
that description.
I mean North Korea is one of them.

704
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,753
If there would be some way to,
to depose that regime and liberate the 

705
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,880
North Koreans,
we should do it now.

706
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,660
We know that it would just be a bloody 
mess if we tried and we're learning that

707
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,000
more and more in,
in these other societies.

708
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,100
But um,
and so,

709
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:46,934
so neoconservatism,
I don't know what its current state is 

710
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:52,250
now,
but I can't imagine anyone is,

711
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,340
you know,
even Wolfowitz or parole is a,

712
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:59,600
I can't imagine any of them are,
are as saying what about the possibility

713
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:01,670
of building a nation anywhere from 
scratch.

714
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,810
Right.
That's actually a great point.

715
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:03,644
Like,
are these guys still believing that 

716
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:05,714
idea?
Do they think if we went back into a 

717
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:07,370
rack right now,
would it,

718
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,230
would it be any better?
I somehow doubt it.

719
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
No,
no I.

720
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,383
and it's.
But the idea that that we created isis 

721
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,510
by going into a rack,
that's also just delusional,

722
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,051
I mean the,
the,

723
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:21,884
the set of ideas that get gives us isis,
that is the set of ideas and the level 

724
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,310
of sectarianism that gave us the civil 
war that,

725
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,230
that,
you know,

726
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,063
we,
we could barely contain a that drove us 

727
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,374
out of Iraq and that set of ideas in one
or another degree has been animating a 

728
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,000
subset of the Muslim world for a very 
long time.

729
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,863
Right.
So this is where I think some of your 

730
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,820
critics would say,
well,

731
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:44,654
you're blaming things more on religion 
than the geopolitics because had we 

732
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:48,704
never gone to Iraq,
Saddam would still be there and that 

733
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,140
isis would be controlled.
But basically you're saying this,

734
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,710
this thing sorta would have bubbled up 
one way or another.

735
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,120
Is that so?
But no,

736
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,963
but if isis,
those religious sectarian commitments 

737
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:10,571
were controlled by a dictator a that's.
Yeah.

738
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,463
That's.
That seems to me an intrinsically 

739
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:15,320
unstable situation.
At some point they're going to,

740
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,290
they're going to bubble up.
But I'm.

741
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,170
Let's just admit how depressing that 
remedy is.

742
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,010
And we're talking about someone who's 
got a torture chamber,

743
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:24,844
is running full time and he's got sons 
who show up at people's weddings and 

744
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:30,560
rape the bride.
And I mean,

745
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,394
it's just,
it's like this is just a playground for 

746
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:37,410
sociopath's,
if that's what it takes to modulate the,

747
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,560
the Sunni Shia Internet saying,
uh,

748
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,010
uh,
animosity,

749
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,590
you know,
that's,

750
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,540
it's a,
um,

751
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,260
okay.

752
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,420
That,
that does not exonerate religion,

753
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,283
right?
And it does not exonerate at that level 

754
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:57,260
of commitment to a device of theology.
Uh,

755
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,470
and so it's,
um,

756
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,150
and they're,
you know,

757
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,030
I think it's a,
uh,

758
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,720
yeah,
I,

759
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,553
I think it is totally appropriate to be 
humble about how hard it is to help 

760
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,910
people in these circumstances.
But if you look at a place like Rwanda,

761
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,290
right where Clinton's one regret was 
that we didn't do more to help,

762
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,920
uh,
or to,

763
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,170
to prevent that genocide.
Um,

764
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,143
and if you look at,
at a total failure to intervene and the 

765
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:30,930
resulting massacre of nearly a million 
people,

766
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,400
and you say,
okay,

767
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,010
that was,
that was something we,

768
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,460
we should not play that hand precisely 
that way again.

769
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,900
Right?
We should do something differently.

770
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,260
We should have intervened.
Well then what do you think we should do

771
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:43,981
to the,
you know,

772
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:46,350
the,
what's happening to these cds and in,

773
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,560
under the Islamic state,
you know,

774
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,160
we got people being crucified by the 
side of the road.

775
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,993
We've got thousands of sex slaves.
We've got gay is being thrown from 

776
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,434
rooftops.
We.

777
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,090
So do we intervene or not?
I think it's,

778
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:02,160
um,
it's not obvious,

779
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,583
uh,
that there's anything we can do in each 

780
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,020
one of these circumstances to help 
people.

781
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:07,854
But the idea that you are a moral 
monster to even think that we should 

782
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:15,090
intervene is deeply suspect.
Yeah.

783
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,003
All right.
So one of my intentions with this show 

784
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:18,024
is that I really want to talk about 
ideas and not people and I think that's 

785
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,500
what we've done so far for the half hour
or so,

786
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,334
but I do think sometimes you have to 
address certain people within the 

787
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,144
context of these conversations.
So I have to talk about one of your 

788
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,590
favorite people to start.
Reza Aslan,

789
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,053
who in my view has repeatedly 
mischaracterize and misrepresented your 

790
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:40,440
abuse.
He's done this in a very forum.

791
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,120
I've seen him,
you know,

792
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:45,600
say to my former boss jaggery that you 
and bill,

793
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,523
you know,
that this is about all Muslims than the 

794
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,643
day later I'll see them on Huffington 
Post live saying that bill is his 

795
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:51,300
friend.

796
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,133
I mean,
just a myriad of things that don't sort 

797
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:56,490
of add up.
It also,

798
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,800
it sounds like maybe he half made up his
bio.

799
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,480
Again,
I don't want to make this about people,

800
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:02,520
but sometimes I do think this has to be 
addressed.

801
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,673
So you want to just take that and put it
somewhere because I also sense that 

802
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,230
you're sort of tired.
We're talking about right.

803
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,160
Didn't you say on twitter that you just 
weren't going to do it anymore and then.

804
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,860
And then he feels like the mafia,
like you get sucked back in,

805
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:14,880
right?
Yeah.

806
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:15,491
Well,
so yeah,

807
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:17,760
I took,
I declared a unilateral ceasefire at one

808
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,594
point on my podcast saying that I would 
never mentioned these people again 

809
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:24,330
unless absolutely necessary.
Um,

810
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,763
but yeah,
like I kind of painted myself into a 

811
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,320
corner there because they don't stop.
So you know,

812
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,900
people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza are
the,

813
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,030
have the larger platforms.

814
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,400
But there are many people who fit this 
description where they,

815
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,403
they seem to imagine that it's fair and 
intellectually legitimate to 

816
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,613
misrepresent the views of their 
opponents as a way of sliming them 

817
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,820
because they know it's effective.
It's like,

818
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,654
if you can just get something to stick,
that's good because the person you're 

819
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,640
arguing against is,
um,

820
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,710
so I'm unethical in his or her 
commitments that it's,

821
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,930
this is the end justifies the means.
Right?

822
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,441
So,
and,

823
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,274
and I'm noticing more and more of this.
This is obviously not a problem just 

824
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,550
with razor or Glenn,
but this is a,

825
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,010
a larger problem in our,
um,

826
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,770
conversation with one another and it's,
it's,

827
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:18,521
um,
but it,

828
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,354
it seems to be a pathology that's 
expressing itself on the left 

829
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,510
politically in a way that I'm not seeing
it quite so much on the right.

830
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,540
Right.
I get attacked by people on the right,

831
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,470
but they actually,
for the most part,

832
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,770
do me the courtesy of understanding what
my views are.

833
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,140
And they attended a Bible thumper,
like,

834
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,360
uh,
um,

835
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,980
I don't know Rick Warren or anyone else 
like that.

836
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,030
I have debated,
you know,

837
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:43,600
he,
he,

838
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,433
he will,
he understands what my position is and 

839
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:49,564
then he,
he disagrees with it based on his own 

840
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,470
commitments and then we can have an 
honest debate,

841
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,910
um,
and it,

842
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,880
and it can be totally pleasant.
It can be barbed onstage,

843
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:59,890
but it can be totally pleasant in the 
green room because we,

844
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:00,460
you know,
we,

845
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,370
we both know what,
what game we're playing and uh,

846
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,263
but with these guys,
it's not at all pleasant in the green 

847
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,900
room.
In fact,

848
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,690
it's interesting.
I mean,

849
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,650
it's impossible to,
to engage at this point.

850
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:15,760
It's just so poisonous and mean.
The crucial piece is,

851
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,310
and this is something I honestly can 
say,

852
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,070
I'm innocent of Amanda,
if I've ever done this,

853
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:24,040
I've never done it intentionally.
And at the moment I've noticed I've done

854
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,810
it,
I've apologized for it.

855
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,243
The crucial sin here intellectually and 
ethically is misrepresenting the other 

856
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:37,160
person's views as a,
as a strategy for defaming them or,

857
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:38,290
or marginalizing them.

858
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,270
Right?
And this has been done repeatedly.

859
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,104
So in the example of Resident Glen let 
they've retweeted memes saying that you 

860
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:45,994
want to nuke the whole middle of all 
this stuff that we've been talking 

861
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:48,964
about.
So what I'm particularly interested in 

862
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:55,461
here is that I see this on the left too.
I'm on the left so I care more about the

863
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:58,990
left and to me the right went over the 
deep end already,

864
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:03,610
but I want to bring the left back into 
some sorta saying middle ground.

865
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,130
So what do you think is actually going 
on here?

866
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:06,964
I had a Dr Gadd sat on a couple of weeks
ago and he said that basically this is 

867
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:13,600
just the age old thing where you go for 
the intellectuals first.

868
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,080
So someone like Reza I think probably 
can't really.

869
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,960
I know you have debated in but can't 
really defeat you,

870
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,380
so to speak in a debate so that he has 
to go to this.

871
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:26,380
Because as you said at the beginning of 
all of this,

872
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,720
40 percent of this stuff just sticks,
right?

873
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:32,230
You say racist when our 40 percent 
automatically believe you're racist.

874
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,200
Yeah.
Well,

875
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,540
in,
to,

876
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,330
to bend over backwards to be charitable 
to these guys,

877
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,220
I can say that,
um,

878
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,013
we're all guilty of kind of a bandwidth 
problem and an impatience with views 

879
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,800
that were not sympathetic with.
And frankly we all are.

880
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,703
It's possible for any one of us,
no matter how scrupulous we attempt to 

881
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:58,634
be,
to not take enough time to understand 

882
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,780
the position we're criticizing.
Right?

883
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:03,614
And so you,
because you feel like if it's somebody 

884
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,200
like,
I don't know,

885
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,540
Glenn Beck or rush limbaugh or,
or,

886
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,374
um,
Ann Coulter or somebody on the right 

887
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,030
with whom I'm basically unsympathetic.
I basically,

888
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:20,720
I feel like I have the gist of what 
their opinions are or likely to be.

889
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,270
And then they say something,
my,

890
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,193
I have a shorter fuse with them.
Maybe I have less of a reason to really 

891
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,210
look into what their position actually 
is.

892
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:33,230
And that is,
that's a time bandwidth problem,

893
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,670
but it's understandable.

894
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,840
But it creates huge pr problems in our 
conversation with,

895
00:42:37,841 --> 00:42:40,160
you know,
left and right and on any given topic.

896
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,260
Um,
but the crucial problem is,

897
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,730
uh,
which I,

898
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,000
I,
I am now to a moral certainty.

899
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:50,834
Sure.
I've encountered in these guys is they 

900
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:57,020
know they're misrepresenting you and 
it's a strategy and I think it comes out

901
00:42:57,021 --> 00:43:02,021
of I'm just a feeling that it's a,
it's a very cynical,

902
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,980
a relationship to the truth.
It's a very cynical relationship to,

903
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,933
to the significance of ideas.
Have you started this segment talking 

904
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:12,500
about the distinction between ideas and 
people.

905
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Now these are people who really don't 
think ideas matter very much.

906
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,684
I mean certainly I don't think religious
ideas matter very much and the 

907
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,520
differences between religious ideas and 
so you know,

908
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,590
Razah is always talking about how,
you know,

909
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,280
religions are just,
you know,

910
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:31,750
so networks of symbols and metaphors and
there's this,

911
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,643
this kind of postmodernist nonsense that
comes out of his mouth when he was 

912
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,880
talking about the truth claims of 
religion.

913
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,890
And the punchline is nobody ever really 
does anything based on religion.

914
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:44,850
It's always some other reason,
right?

915
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,150
It's psychology is politics is 
economics.

916
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,393
I'm right.
I've heard him say that you actually 

917
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:50,804
believe in this stuff the most because 
that's why you quoted and he obviously 

918
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:56,010
knows that,
but he says things.

919
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,060
You know what he'll say,
and every time I come up he'll say,

920
00:43:59,061 --> 00:43:59,894
you know,
I get my view about religion from Fox 

921
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,953
News right now.
Is there any chance he believes that 

922
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,880
there is no chance?
I think if you've proven anything easy,

923
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,010
you look in the bibliography of,
of my first book,

924
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:13,844
right?
There's like a thousand references 

925
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:15,380
there,
right?

926
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,213
There's absolutely no chance he believes
that there's absolutely no chance he 

927
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,460
thinks I've called for a nuclear first 
strike on the Muslim world,

928
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:25,310
and yet he retweets a tweet that calls 
me a genocidal fascist.

929
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:25,870
Maniac,
right?

930
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:26,703
Yeah.
Um,

931
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,860
he's uh,
and Glenn Greenwald was in this category

932
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:32,370
and Jenkins as well,
and,

933
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:34,140
um,
Chris hedges all of them.

934
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,070
And um,
the problem with this is that it works.

935
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,070
It actually because,
because then for the rest of my life,

936
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,933
I'm going to be seeing people who are 
absolutely sure on every comment thread 

937
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:46,974
I'm ever going to see there.
I will see people who are absolutely 

938
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,124
sure.
I've called for a genocidal nuclear 

939
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,670
holocaust,
right?

940
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,230
Um,
and uh,

941
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,380
and many other things.
And so it's a,

942
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,330
um,
it's very,

943
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,380
it's very depressing,
but it works.

944
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:06,240
And there really is no way to respond 
adequately to it.

945
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:09,330
And so I've,
I've had on my blog for years now a,

946
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,303
a,
um,

947
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:11,883
post entitled response to controversy 
where I deal with each one of these 

948
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,550
things as they come up.
And then a year later I'll,

949
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,890
I'll revisit it and fine tune it.

950
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,010
And,
uh,

951
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,340
I think it's the number,
if you search response to controversy on

952
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:27,870
Google,
I think it's the number one result.

953
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:28,251
I mean,
so it's,

954
00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:28,911
it's,
it's a,

955
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:31,410
it's kind of depressing to associated 
with that phrase,

956
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:35,640
but it's the um,
but it still is not an addict.

957
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:39,480
It's like a 10,000
word letter to the editor essentially.

958
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:39,990
But it,
it,

959
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,823
it,
it's not an adequate way of addressing 

960
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:46,941
this and it's not adequate because a lot
of people just don't care what the truth

961
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:48,084
is.
They just liked the fact that your 

962
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,253
ready,
you can destroy your opponents 

963
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:54,810
reputation by calling him a racist.
Right?

964
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,673
So that's where I have to bring up the 
other person here that we've sort of 

965
00:45:58,741 --> 00:45:59,860
danced around.
Um,

966
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,680
and that's the personal part to me.
So jank obviously Janky.

967
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,300
Greg is the founder of the young Turks,
the CEO of the network.

968
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,213
I worked for him for two years.
I still play basketball with him every 

969
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:10,660
Sunday.
Um,

970
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,240
you sat with him for three hours,
for three hours unaided on his channel.

971
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,450
They put about five commercials in it.
It has over a million views.

972
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,284
I'm sure they made a lot of money on it.
You calmly explained to him at the 

973
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:25,620
beginning that basically he was 
repeatedly slandering you.

974
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:26,700
I don't know the,
use the word slander,

975
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,534
but that he was repeatedly 
misrepresenting your views and that you 

976
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:33,420
were there to clean up the mess and then
you sat there for three hours,

977
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:35,820
clearly laid out what you think about 
these things.

978
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,300
I was still working there at the time 
and then after that he only doubled down

979
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,230
on the.
It's about,

980
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:44,064
you not only doubled down,
but I see this all the time now on 

981
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,900
twitter.
People will take little video clips,

982
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:51,360
ten second video clips of him saying one
thing to you,

983
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,100
and then what he said when you're not 
around,

984
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,260
even after and things that he said to 
Reza,

985
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:57,780
knowing that that's not what you said 
and all of this stuff.

986
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,000
Um,
so the personal part to me,

987
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,220
I just have to say it because people 
have been asking me forever.

988
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,910
So it obviously had a good amount to do 
with why I left.

989
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,570
So I just want to put that out there,
sort of a more for my audience.

990
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,030
But in terms of the three hours sit 
down.

991
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:13,560
I mean,
that's a long time to sit with somebody.

992
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:14,940
We're not,
we're not going to go three hours.

993
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,610
You did three hours with one glass of 
water.

994
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,713
Did you ever,
in your wildest imagination think that 

995
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,370
it was going to get worse after that?
Because in my opinion,

996
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,204
at least it did.

997
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:24,981
Yeah.
No,

998
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:25,201
I,
I,

999
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:26,001
it's,
it's,

1000
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:31,001
um,
I could see he was following me entirely

1001
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,033
so I could see that he was just,
there was a kind of a fundamental 

1002
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:40,660
disinclination to have his opinion about
me changed by anything.

1003
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:41,800
I was going to say,
right,

1004
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:44,170
so when you encounter that in someone,
you see that it's not,

1005
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,740
it's not functioning by the usual rules 
of conversation.

1006
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,760
I mean,
this is,

1007
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,070
this is the thing that's so poisonous.
It's the.

1008
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,421
And again,
uh,

1009
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:54,760
unfortunately I encountered this more on
the left than,

1010
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,700
than elsewhere.
There's a,

1011
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,663
every one on the left,
at the moment seems to be a mind reader 

1012
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,323
right there.
What they're trying to detecting you 

1013
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:11,650
evidence of a view which you claim you 
don't hold,

1014
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,980
but the moment they can,
they can string together anything you've

1015
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:18,490
said that seems to align up with 
something they want to find in you.

1016
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,060
They will hold you accountable to that 
misunderstanding.

1017
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:26,110
And no matter how much you try to take 
their foot out of your mouth,

1018
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,370
they,
they did.

1019
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:29,243
The mirror effort itself is going to be 
counted against you if you're just 

1020
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:35,080
someone who's in denial or you don't 
really understand how racist you are,

1021
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:36,100
or,
um,

1022
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,220
and it's a,
uh,

1023
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,510
uh,
I mean,

1024
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,960
so for instance,
so the classic example on twitter,

1025
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:46,330
I,
I often see that,

1026
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,863
um,
whenever I say something critical about 

1027
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:51,910
Islam,
I will get back,

1028
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:52,744
you know,
why don't you ever criticize 

1029
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,350
Christianity or Judaism,
which obviously I do my book,

1030
00:48:56,351 --> 00:49:01,351
but now I recently said something very 
disparaging about Orthodox Judaism and I

1031
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:03,574
saw on twitter people claiming that I 
was just covering for my racism with 

1032
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:11,140
respect to the Islam.
So that made sense.

1033
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,290
Um,
and this is just a token way of,

1034
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:16,600
of just misdirection,
right?

1035
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,130
I don't really feel this about Orthodox 
Judaism.

1036
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,540
There is no way to dig out from this.
I mean,

1037
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,810
really think how perverse that.
And they're all mind readers,

1038
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:27,640
they're all psychics who,
who are plumbing the depths of your con,

1039
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,480
detecting things in you that you don't 
even know about yourself.

1040
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,000
Do you wish your mind,
was that da?

1041
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,000
Well,
I mean it's,

1042
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:34,800
I,
I,

1043
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,060
yeah,
I wish it was amazing to me is,

1044
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:41,650
I mean this is such a confused moral 
position because they're claiming.

1045
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:43,870
I'm saying all these horrendous things,
right?

1046
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,400
I say we should racially profile.
I say we should nuclear the,

1047
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,150
the,
the,

1048
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,380
the Muslim world.
I'm no great.

1049
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,510
Now say they're going to select the edit
that I say it right.

1050
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:55,480
I say we should torture people,
right?

1051
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,410
These are my claims.
And then when I say no,

1052
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,690
this is not actually what I,
what I said.

1053
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:04,030
Um,
they,

1054
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,440
I mean,
I say I,

1055
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,353
I say incredibly controversial things if
you actually honestly engaged with what 

1056
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:14,170
I'm saying.
These are very,

1057
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,004
I take controversial positions.
I'm never hiding what I actually 

1058
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:18,620
believe,
right?

1059
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,440
It's just like I'm walking right up to 
the line.

1060
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,274
Like I'm going to say though,
it's though it is politically 

1061
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:23,704
impossible.
I want to talk about the ethics of 

1062
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,290
torture publicly.
Now.

1063
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:29,900
I mean this is a thankless job if there 
ever was one.

1064
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,710
Right,
and yet they're claiming to detect in me

1065
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:38,750
commitments that I'm disavowing and 
there's just no way you can disavow them

1066
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:39,530
once,
once they,

1067
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,131
they,
they,

1068
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:41,240
uh,
insist there.

1069
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:41,350
Yeah.

1070
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,510
Right.
So you want to have the battle of ideas,

1071
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:47,050
which is exactly what liberalism should 
be for and they don't seem to want to do

1072
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:47,884
that.
So I just want to wrap this up with one 

1073
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:49,893
final question.
This,

1074
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,560
this portion of it.
Um,

1075
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,403
so just putting it flat out there.
I have tweeted at Jank publicly and 

1076
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:55,804
respectfully several times since I've 
left the network to engage him on this 

1077
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:00,640
and I sort of laid out some things and 
showed out,

1078
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,790
showed some evidence of,
of this or that and he just ignored me.

1079
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,960
So I just think I just have to say that 
and you know,

1080
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:10,060
everyone can think what they want,
but my final question on this is what do

1081
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:13,210
you think we should do about these 
people?

1082
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,300
Do you think that your engagement at 
this point,

1083
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:17,134
were you,
when you've seen someone lie repeatedly 

1084
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,703
misrepresent your views,
all of those things when you've seen 

1085
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:23,950
this happen repeatedly?
Repeatedly.

1086
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:26,770
And then I started seeing it bleed into 
other things.

1087
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,953
Do you keep engaging or at some point do
you just put your hands up and I'm 

1088
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,104
guessing you struggle with this yourself
because you were sort of ready to put 

1089
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:35,350
your hands up and then you got sucked 
back then.

1090
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:36,610
But where,
where do you stand on that now?

1091
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,463
And I wish I had an algorithm for,
for how to deal with this because 

1092
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,510
there's no,
uh,

1093
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:43,880
it's very haphazard on my side.
It's just,

1094
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,000
you know,
sometimes I'll,

1095
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,030
I'll just see a tweet that I just can't 
let go,

1096
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:47,864
you know,
and then I'll go for weeks or months or 

1097
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,490
in some cases,
even years,

1098
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,970
not dealing with this directly.
But I think in so far,

1099
00:51:56,971 --> 00:52:00,740
if someone has a big platform you have 
to deal with,

1100
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:03,600
it's somewhat some of the time because 
he,

1101
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,510
because I see the consequences of their 
successfully misleading people.

1102
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:09,344
And so either the people who I will 
never mentioned it never deal with 

1103
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,520
because they're kind of smaller fish in 
this,

1104
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,330
in this murky pond.
But someone like Reza Aslan,

1105
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:18,050
you know,
he's,

1106
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,030
he is a kind of a public figure now and 
he,

1107
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,913
he's a darling of a certain segment of 
the media and so what he says actually 

1108
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,610
matters because it is,
you know,

1109
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,660
he's promulgating genuine falsehoods 
about the,

1110
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,593
the connection between religious ideas 
and I'm a very dangerous behavior and 

1111
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:42,194
he's does it it with a apparently clear 
conscience and I think he knows enough 

1112
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:48,230
to know that he's actually line.

1113
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,590
So he's a,
he's a,

1114
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,000
I view him as a truly bad actor.
Um,

1115
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,590
and yeah,
I,

1116
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,423
but it's incredibly boring to keep 
poking fun at funded him or to keep 

1117
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:00,710
pushing back against what I said

1118
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,663
and then ultimately you're just getting 
them clicks and in some cases actual 

1119
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,930
money too.
So it sort of,

1120
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,060
I guess there is no answer yet,
but

1121
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,580
maybe I'll just do it,
you know,

1122
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:13,790
I do it when I can't do otherwise,
but then I move on to other things.

1123
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:14,883
Um,
I want to get back into some of the 

1124
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:17,650
religious stuff.
Um,

1125
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,693
so I think partly what a lot of your 
detractors would say is that you have 

1126
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:24,034
this focus on Islam that you don't,
that you've already illustrated and 

1127
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:27,444
you've written a book about Christianity
that whole half first half of 

1128
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,153
interfaith.
You talking about the Crusades or all 

1129
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:34,530
this kind of stuff.
As you said just a moment ago,

1130
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,680
you said all kinds of things about the 
orthodox Jews.

1131
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,670
So I think we get a sense that it's not 
just that,

1132
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,180
but they're not all the same.
I think that a lot of these,

1133
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,190
a lot of the progressives,
a lot of these people on the left,

1134
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,323
they want,
they believe in this idea that 

1135
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:50,544
everything is equal.
There's just this sort of base equality 

1136
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,490
except the fact is by definition these 
things are different.

1137
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:57,324
If I was to right now draw the Jewish 
god of Yahweh or Moses or something and 

1138
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:07,161
then draw Jesus in a weird sex act and 
then draw Mohammed and I'm talking stick

1139
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,520
figures.
I'm not a good artist.

1140
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,340
Only one of those would cause a threat 
to my life.

1141
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,410
So those things are not equal.
Right?

1142
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:14,890
I know they like that proposition.
But it's,

1143
00:54:14,891 --> 00:54:16,350
it's a faulty proposition,
right?

1144
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:16,620
Yeah.

1145
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,530
Oh No.
Probably brought out in the,

1146
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,070
the most elegant way by that onion 
cartoon.

1147
00:54:23,071 --> 00:54:23,904
I don't know if you saw that the title 
was no one was murdered over this 

1148
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:27,980
cartoon and it's,
you know,

1149
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,651
it's just,
you know,

1150
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:31,020
uh,
the Buddha stickiness,

1151
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,530
you know,
blowing Jesus.

1152
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:35,341
I mean,
it's so like everyone,

1153
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:39,090
but Muhammad is in there and um,
but the point is made perfectly.

1154
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:39,661
It's just like,
you,

1155
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:40,494
you can do that and yet you cannot draw 
a stick figure of Mohammed without 

1156
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,090
having your life deranged thereafter by,
you know,

1157
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,840
conversations with the FBI about how to 
keep your,

1158
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,940
your you and your family safe.
Right?

1159
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,680
That's the reality of the world.
We're living in the West right now.

1160
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:56,514
Forget about what's happened,
what it's like to live in Pakistan or 

1161
00:54:57,721 --> 00:54:58,554
Bangladesh or any of these countries 
where you are literally going to be cut 

1162
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:06,690
down by your neighbors on the mere rumor
that you have mistreated a Koran or that

1163
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,760
you don't believe that it's the perfect 
word of the creator,

1164
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,260
of the universe.
Um,

1165
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,550
so,
uh,

1166
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,733
yeah,
so this,

1167
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,343
I mean,
the crucial piece is that beliefs 

1168
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:20,310
matter,
specific beliefs matter,

1169
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:23,420
the differences between beliefs matter,
the doctrines,

1170
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,633
a religious doctrines are not all the 
same and therefore the behavioral and 

1171
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:32,100
political and moral commitments born of 
those doctrines are not all the same.

1172
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,780
How has media really failed this year?
The,

1173
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,440
the mainstream media?
Because I did a video a couple of months

1174
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:37,801
ago,
you know,

1175
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:38,634
there was this exhibition,
I think it was somewhere in the middle 

1176
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,980
of the country where they had the pope 
made out of condoms.

1177
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:46,710
Now I can see that being offensive to 
some Christians,

1178
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,544
right?
You could turn on family guy on any 

1179
00:55:49,081 --> 00:55:53,550
given night or South Park and see Jesus 
doing all sorts of crazy things.

1180
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,350
I posted a clip of Jesus bathing naked 
in front of Stewie,

1181
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,010
a baby,
a male baby,

1182
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,780
and they're playing porn music in the 
background.

1183
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,030
No,
there's no threat of anything.

1184
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:03,923
So is this where sort of the media has 
sort of helped the narrative because 

1185
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,340
they have no problem publishing the 
picture of the pope in condoms,

1186
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,510
but at the same time the New York Times 
didn't,

1187
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,373
for example,
post the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and is 

1188
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,074
this also where secular people,
we've sort of maybe we've 

1189
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,220
underestimated,
not been kind

1190
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,053
enough to the mainstream Christians 
because they get crap all the time as 

1191
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:31,480
I'm illustrating right here.
Nobody's being shot for things.

1192
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,510
Yeah.
Well I think we just have to acknowledge

1193
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,650
publicly and loudly and incessantly that
free speech has to win.

1194
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:43,830
So if anyone who in the wake of the 
Charlie Hebdo massacre wondered,

1195
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:46,781
well,
wait a minute,

1196
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:49,480
where are those cartoons at all racist,
because that,

1197
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,820
that was going to make me feel 
differently about it.

1198
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:52,803
That opening that door is just a kind of
moral blindness that we should have 

1199
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:00,700
immediately a later itself against me.
That was just.

1200
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,860
And people like Glenn Greenwald,
that's,

1201
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,030
that's the door they open.
It's like,

1202
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:04,720
oh,
these were.

1203
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,210
These were not kosher cartoons.
These were racist.

1204
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,760
Of course they weren't.
In fact,

1205
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:11,860
if you understood anything about French 
politics,

1206
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,000
yeah,
and these were,

1207
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:13,834
these were,
these people were on the right side of 

1208
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,680
all these liberal questions in France,
if you,

1209
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,800
if you understood and by the culture 
focusing on Islam more than any more.

1210
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,710
We're about Christianity,
plenty of stuff.

1211
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,940
But even the cartoons that's on their 
face seemed racist and they were kind of

1212
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:30,820
a racial caricature.
They,

1213
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:31,654
in fact,
if you understood the context weren't 

1214
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:33,634
racist,
right?

1215
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,390
Um,
but nevermind that the,

1216
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,150
the sense that it,
it,

1217
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,073
it's the sense that there's a tension 
between freedom of religion and freedom 

1218
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:43,204
of speech is a total moral and political
illusion is that there's absolutely 

1219
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:48,814
nothing you and I could say in this 
conversation that infringes upon 

1220
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:56,260
somebody else's freedom of religion.
We can disparage religion all we want.

1221
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,790
That doesn't affect someone else's 
political rights to practice it.

1222
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,470
They can raise their kids however they 
want.

1223
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,313
We simply need to admit that religion 
should be subjected to the same kind of 

1224
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:12,320
criticism and scrutiny and satire,
uh,

1225
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:14,560
as any other set of ideas.
As you point out,

1226
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,423
we do this for something like mormonism 
so that you can have a play like the 

1227
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:20,580
book of Mormon and no one gets killed.
Sure.

1228
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,483
It's unthinkable to have an analogous 
play about Islam and we have just 

1229
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:27,670
acquiesced to that difference we have.
Just so you know,

1230
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,211
it's just,
yeah,

1231
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:29,044
it's too dangerous.
And the problem is not that it's too 

1232
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,850
dangerous.
The problem is that anyone like me would

1233
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:34,720
want to do it.
Right.

1234
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,120
Anyone liked someone like Trey Parker,
Matt Stone,

1235
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,040
the,
those assholes,

1236
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,380
they shouldn't,
shouldn't go after Islam.

1237
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,243
Right?
That's where the moral sense that the 

1238
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,610
sensibilities of liberals seem to be 
right now.

1239
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:46,444
Whereas we should be acknowledging how 
excruciating it is that there is this 

1240
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,144
difference even in our own societies 
between Islam and something like 

1241
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:56,290
mormonism.

1242
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:59,580
Whereas at one point,
um,

1243
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:01,223
in one of my blog posts,
I pointed out that the Mormon response 

1244
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:06,400
to the book of Mormon was,
was adorable.

1245
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:09,550
They took out ads for mormonism in 
playbill,

1246
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,190
right?
That's exactly as it should be.

1247
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,781
Right?
And I,

1248
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:17,140
and I say just incredibly withering 
things about mormonism,

1249
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:19,800
but that no one is no more,
man.

1250
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:20,643
It's going to kill me for it and that,
and that is a difference that we know 

1251
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,703
the people,
people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza 

1252
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,950
Aslan are maintaining the status quo 
actively,

1253
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,843
energetically,
and we have the moderates and you talk 

1254
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,114
about this and end of faith that 
actually the supposed moderates in this 

1255
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:38,361
case,
right?

1256
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:39,194
And they're in their liberal apologists 
and their secular liberal politics who 

1257
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:44,090
are not even religious.
Glenn Glenn is a gauge you,

1258
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:45,800
I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go that well
for him.

1259
00:59:45,801 --> 00:59:47,930
It was already walking down the street 
to Saudi Arabia.

1260
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,080
I think so.
I think a Gad your previous guest,

1261
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,080
uh,
once tweeted in response to something,

1262
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:57,320
Glenn Greenwald tweeted about me know,
defending Islam.

1263
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,610
He said,
um,

1264
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,070
I think this was good.
It he'll correct me if I'm wrong,

1265
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:03,320
but he said,
do me a favor,

1266
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,173
Glen,
get a shirt made saying I'm gay and I 

1267
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:08,970
don't believe in God.
And,

1268
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,290
and travel around the Middle East and,
and report back on your adventures.

1269
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,450
There's one place he could do that.
And,

1270
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:15,284
uh,
we'll get to that place in a second 

1271
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:16,874
because we're going to go,
we're going to go controversial if you 

1272
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:18,824
don't think we've gotten there so far.
I thought what we could do here for a 

1273
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,380
second is because I know that people are
gonna.

1274
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,540
Say you guys are focused on Islam,
you're focusing on Islam.

1275
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:31,280
Can you just give me a bunch of bad shit
about Christianity and Judaism?

1276
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:32,540
I mean,
just rip it apart.

1277
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,850
Just Gimme I know you can do it because 
I read the books,

1278
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:37,670
but just as telling me some really 
terrible stuff.

1279
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,260
Well,
at the level of the text,

1280
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,810
at the level of what's just in the Old 
Testament,

1281
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,990
that is the worst book.
It is worse than the Koran.

1282
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:45,500
It's,
it's,

1283
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,333
it is the,
the most barbaric and theocratic a 

1284
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:56,950
recipe for human unhappiness talking 
about Old Testament Judaism and clear to

1285
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:00,080
some degree Christianity.
But yes.

1286
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,930
Um,
and uh,

1287
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:04,183
if you,
if you as a Jew wanted to live out of 

1288
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:08,510
leviticus and Deuteronomy,
uh,

1289
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,310
you are,
you know,

1290
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,480
just,
you know,

1291
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:15,500
write of Mullah Omar in terms of your 
theocratic commitments right now.

1292
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:16,334
It just so happens there are reasons why
even ultra orthodox Jews aren't 

1293
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:21,980
committed to the letter of the law.
They're,

1294
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:23,640
but they're not good reasons.
They're just,

1295
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,270
they're just kind of accidental 
historical reasons.

1296
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,710
I was,
this is actually a,

1297
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,603
a,
um,

1298
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,650
a encounter I brief briefly relate in my
new book with the Majid Nawaz.

1299
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,130
Um,
while we're talking,

1300
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:37,663
I was talking to him about how I'm 
always worried when I see sort of 

1301
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:45,521
carefully worded seemingly moderate 
claims from religious people because you

1302
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:46,484
sensed that there's,
there they're doing some kind of 

1303
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,033
theological correction in their brains 
where it's covering for other 

1304
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:55,070
commitments that they're not,
not being so forthcoming about it.

1305
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,430
And I wants discovered this with a 
Orthodox Jew at a wedding.

1306
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,170
He was a friend of the groom and,
and,

1307
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:01,004
um,
we were introduced and then the groom 

1308
01:02:02,451 --> 01:02:06,770
walked away and I said,
so I just kind of launched into my spiel

1309
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:07,210
and I said,
listen,

1310
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:10,410
just tell me what about all the barbers 
things and leviticus and Deuteronomy and

1311
01:02:10,411 --> 01:02:13,250
how do you reconcile those things?
And he said,

1312
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:13,611
well,
you know,

1313
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:16,880
it was very interesting that all of that
was just in the context of the time.

1314
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,420
It doesn't apply now.
There is no sand hedren,

1315
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,620
you know,
there's no body of elders who,

1316
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,430
who would make all of that,
uh,

1317
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,420
effective.
And I said,

1318
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,640
and I could see,
I could hear what he was doing there.

1319
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:30,130
And I said,
okay,

1320
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:30,721
well,
yeah,

1321
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:31,554
but when the Messiah comes back,
as you think he will and you reconvene 

1322
01:02:33,961 --> 01:02:37,440
the Sanhedrin in the temple is rebuilt,
then what you know,

1323
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:38,293
then are you stoning people to death for
adultery in witchcraft and 

1324
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:42,120
homosexuality?
And,

1325
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,681
and he said,
well,

1326
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:44,850
you know,
that's fair.

1327
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:47,970
It's a very hard question.
And He,

1328
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:48,930
and then he said,
you know,

1329
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,380
you don't,
I don't think you can appreciate how,

1330
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:53,214
what a sacrilege those behaviors would 
be in the presence of the Messiah and a 

1331
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,230
properly concentrated,
consecrated,

1332
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,360
Sanhedrin.
Um,

1333
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:02,461
and I said,
yeah,

1334
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:03,420
you're right.
I can't,

1335
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:03,961
you know,
so like,

1336
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:06,270
aware,
what part of your body should I vomit on

1337
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:06,480
now?

1338
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:06,901
I mean,
it's like,

1339
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:08,170
it's like,
it's like the.

1340
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,500
So the,
that was the know,

1341
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:15,210
if you just push long enough you can 
find the theocrat in those people.

1342
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,720
Um,
but as a matter of fact,

1343
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,973
there they have theological reasons why 
they don't have to be stoning people to 

1344
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:27,030
death for homosexuality and adultery.
Right now we're working on the sabbath,

1345
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:29,160
right.
Though those rules are,

1346
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:32,010
are mandated in,
in the Old Testament.

1347
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,950
But there are,
yes,

1348
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:39,020
there are possible circumstances where a
religion like Christianity or Judaism is

1349
01:03:41,131 --> 01:03:43,850
more dangerous than Islam.
It's just we don't happen to be as,

1350
01:03:43,851 --> 01:03:44,684
as a global matter,
we don't happen to be in those 

1351
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,123
circumstances.
But if you take something like stem 

1352
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,110
cell,
again,

1353
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,820
this just comes down to the specific 
consequences of specific beliefs.

1354
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:56,460
So Islam is totally off the hook with 
embryonic stem cell research.

1355
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:57,294
They don't,
they don't think that the soul enters 

1356
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:01,080
the Zygote at the moment of conception.

1357
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,950
They think it enters that.
I think it's day eight or day 1:20,

1358
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,630
depending on what you believe,
which had either you believe.

1359
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,771
So,
you know,

1360
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:08,604
when I go on and on about religious,
the religious impediment to lifesaving 

1361
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:15,510
medical research and on,
in embryonic stem cell research,

1362
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:16,763
I'm never thinking about Islam right as 
it's just as long as it's compatible 

1363
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:20,964
with Islam right now.
Isis could be doing embryonic stem cell 

1364
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:24,520
research if they wanted to.
Um,

1365
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,153
so you just have to,
you have to be honest about who is 

1366
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:28,910
culpa,
what,

1367
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:33,630
what ideas and what and what advocates 
if those ideas are culpable for specific

1368
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:34,523
problems.
Yeah.

1369
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,950
So I'm pretty sure you're saying we just
proved your an anti Semite yes.

1370
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,361
Oh,
I,

1371
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,510
I got that.
I got,

1372
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,453
I've been blamed a,
there's a passage in the end of faith 

1373
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:47,451
that if you read it on charitably seems 
to blame the Holocaust on the Jews.

1374
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,391
Right.
You know,

1375
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:50,250
uh,
I brought that as I do.

1376
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,560
I'm a,
no,

1377
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:53,350
but I,
you know,

1378
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,183
it's an honest fact that you have,
you have a 2000 year history of 

1379
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:00,204
antisemitism,
which to some degree Jews have 

1380
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:08,361
collaborated in by being an incredibly 
insular culture,

1381
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:09,594
religious culture that dogmatically 
define themselves in opposition to the 

1382
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,840
rest of the world.
You know,

1383
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,970
the non Jewish culture,
it's two sides of a coin,

1384
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,660
doesn't,
it doesn't excuse the Holocaust,

1385
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:21,850
doesn't blame Jews for the Holocaust 
obviously,

1386
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:22,684
but um,
well then I saw the conception of Jews 

1387
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:28,780
as Jews,
as a race is shared by Jews,

1388
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,710
right?
It's not,

1389
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:30,543
it hasn't been foisted on them by the 
outside world and that's why it's a 

1390
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:34,391
problem.
Why?

1391
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:37,650
You know,
why you have to get out of this game of,

1392
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:42,710
of defining ourselves tribally based on 
imaginary in a fictitious ideas.

1393
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:44,763
Um,
and we have to realize that the way 

1394
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:50,890
forward is recognizing our common 
humanity.

1395
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,753
It were a single species on a single 
planet trying to build a single viable 

1396
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:56,314
global civilization.
And there are a thousand different ways 

1397
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:01,720
we can screw this up and not so many 
ways where we can,

1398
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:05,380
we can build paradise on earth,
which should be our common project.

1399
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:06,020
Yeah.

1400
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,853
Unfortunately,
I think our definition of paradise and 

1401
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,530
some of the people that we're talking 
about me,

1402
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:10,364
yes,
well that may not be exactly the same 

1403
01:06:11,181 --> 01:06:11,360
thing.

1404
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,760
Well that's,
that's the problem you have.

1405
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,880
I mean,
hence the power,

1406
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,753
the,
the crucial matter of criticizing bad 

1407
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,860
ideas.
The thing is,

1408
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:25,370
most people think there's a lot of bad 
people running around in the world.

1409
01:06:25,371 --> 01:06:26,870
I,
there aren't a lot of bad people.

1410
01:06:26,871 --> 01:06:27,704
There are,
there are a lot of bad ideas and bad 

1411
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:32,720
ideas are worse than bad people because 
bad ideas are contagious.

1412
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:35,240
Bad ideas get good people to do horrible
things.

1413
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,890
No,

1414
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:36,723
you wrote what I think,
or I think it was on your podcast 

1415
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,880
actually,
but I read the transcript,

1416
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:45,750
what I think is the most tepid defense 
of Israel that has ever been said ever.

1417
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,940
But because of it,
people think you're a Zionist.

1418
01:06:48,941 --> 01:06:51,160
You're secretly,
as you said earlier,

1419
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:51,651
every,
you know,

1420
01:06:51,651 --> 01:06:53,470
you're manipulating things and blah,
blah,

1421
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:55,630
blah.
Even though you've talked about dragging

1422
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:58,930
settlers by their beards out of the West
Bank and all of this stuff.

1423
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,240
I'm sorry,
can we only have about 10 minutes?

1424
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:03,130
Um,
so in about five minutes,

1425
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:07,300
can you just sort of sum up that what 
you were talking about?

1426
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,990
And I didn't even really view it as a 
defense in a weird way.

1427
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:12,460
Um,
but it was,

1428
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,323
I didn't even,
I didn't agree with all of it by any 

1429
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,550
stretch.
I defend Israel.

1430
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:17,740
It's the one tiny little democracy in 
that part of the road,

1431
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,160
which you sort of alluded to.
Um,

1432
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:21,880
so can you just sort of sum that up and 
then,

1433
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:26,881
and then also why then even the most 
tepid defense means you're automatically

1434
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,200
on design.
Design is Nazi,

1435
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:29,940
whatever.

1436
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,773
I mean,
it was the worst titled Blog Post 

1437
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,650
podcast ever because people read it as 
my,

1438
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,140
the title was,
why don't I criticize Israel?

1439
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,013
Yeah.
Question mark a and immediately I 

1440
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:46,010
reminded my readers and listeners that I
do criticize Israel,

1441
01:07:46,011 --> 01:07:47,720
right?
But it was read as,

1442
01:07:47,721 --> 01:07:48,441
you know,
this is,

1443
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:51,320
I am committed to not criticizing Israel
because of x,

1444
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:52,154
Y,
and z.

1445
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,290
So I do criticize Israel.
Um,

1446
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:58,740
I say in that piece that I don't think 
it should exist as a Jewish state.

1447
01:07:58,741 --> 01:07:59,574
And I think I've been,
if I think the idea of estate organized 

1448
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:02,894
around a religion is just intrinsically 
of noxious and divisive and 

1449
01:08:05,451 --> 01:08:06,530
unsustainable,
uh,

1450
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,573
with the one caveat that the only thing 
that justifies the existence of Israel 

1451
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:11,354
as a Jewish state is the fact that the 
rest of the world has rather reliably 

1452
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,900
his willingness to murder the Jews 
outright.

1453
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:18,620
For being Jewish.

1454
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,840
So I mean there's,
there's no other people who are,

1455
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:24,140
um,
coming out of this legacy of having been

1456
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:29,141
hunted and hounded for generations until
antiquity,

1457
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,530
uh,
by,

1458
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,030
uh,
uh,

1459
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,620
the rest of the world.
So it's understandable that many,

1460
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:39,740
many Jews think we need a Jewish state.
Um,

1461
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,420
and I don't deny that.
It's also,

1462
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:43,910
it's not a state that's,
you know,

1463
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,010
there's,
there's an ethnicity that is.

1464
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:48,120
Judaism is not,
it's not just a religion,

1465
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:48,954
so it's not,
it's not a Jewish state and quite the 

1466
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:53,870
same way that the Saudi Arabia is a 
Islamic state.

1467
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,930
I'm not religious in any way,
but yeah,

1468
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:58,220
I like bagels and I watch curb your 
enthusiasm so I get.

1469
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,970
So I'm you guys,
I'm on precisely that sort of Jew.

1470
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,310
Um,
and I like Israel.

1471
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:05,420
I been to Israel and it's,
it's a,

1472
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:06,820
um,
uh,

1473
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,030
I've loved my time there.
Uh,

1474
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,930
but if all the Jews woke up tomorrow and
said,

1475
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,010
you know,
this isn't worth it.

1476
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,270
Let's just assimilate.
Let's just,

1477
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,700
let's just blend into the rest of the 
world.

1478
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:17,563
This is just,
this godforsaken piece of land is let's 

1479
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,200
give it to the Muslims.
Um,

1480
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,300
in my view,
that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing

1481
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:27,134
if the Jews were the first religious 
congregation on earth to admit that 

1482
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:33,180
religion as a variable,
a,

1483
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,063
as a device,
divisive variable was just defunct and 

1484
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,910
we're just going to be human beings.
That would be a,

1485
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,720
as a closing chapter to Judaism,
I think that would be the,

1486
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,920
I'd be honored to be among those Jews.
And the Poles are sort of showing that,

1487
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:46,754
right?
I mean most Jews are secular or 

1488
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,210
religious in any.
No,

1489
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,110
I mean that's the,
that's the other thing about Judaism now

1490
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:51,944
is that it's very hard to find Jews who 
believe anything superstitious in the 

1491
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:56,144
service of their Judaism.
I've debate conservative rabbis who 

1492
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,353
don't even believe in God.
Apparently they believe or the God they 

1493
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:03,310
believe in is just like,
you know,

1494
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,840
quantum mechanics or just pure energy or
ms dot.

1495
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:09,770
It's not a god who can hear prayers,
I believe in the force with.

1496
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:10,870
Yes,
that's.

1497
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,100
I've met,
I've met that rabbi.

1498
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:12,953
Yeah.

1499
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,410
So it's a,
a uh,

1500
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:19,220
but,
so my bias toward Israel,

1501
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,173
whenever you're talking about the 
conflict between Israel and her 

1502
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:23,834
neighbors,
my biased towards Israel is really a 

1503
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:26,744
bias against suicide bombing and the use
of human shields and an explicitly 

1504
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:37,910
genocidal aspiration which Hamas has in 
its charter and many,

1505
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:42,990
many of Israel's antagonists.
Ha,

1506
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:46,310
have just in the way they talk about the
fate of the Jews.

1507
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,720
I mean,
it is prophesized that,

1508
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,451
you know,
the,

1509
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:49,284
the end times will come when the very 
earth cries out against the Jews were 

1510
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:56,690
the,
were the trees and the rocks say there's

1511
01:10:56,691 --> 01:10:58,250
a Jew behind me,
come kill him.

1512
01:10:58,251 --> 01:10:59,084
I mean,
that is,

1513
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:03,050
that is the center of the fairway 
Islamic Prophecy,

1514
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,350
right?
Um,

1515
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,890
and it's in the charter of Hamas,
right?

1516
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:10,280
So how can,
how can Israel expect to deal with these

1517
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:11,030
people?
Right?

1518
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:14,040
So I think you illustrated in that piece
that if the

1519
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,873
weapons were reversed,
if the Israelis had the weapons that 

1520
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:20,270
Hamas has and Hamas or the weapons he's 
really had,

1521
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,383
well this thing would be over tomorrow 
because there would be a genocide 

1522
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:26,650
tomorrow,
which to me sort of sums up the white

1523
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,800
yes conversation that's so silly.
That is the,

1524
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:29,640
the,
the,

1525
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,103
the moral disparity that all of Israel's
critics have to admit to be 

1526
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:35,784
intellectually honest here and just says
Israel is showing what they would do if 

1527
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:41,424
they could kill all their enemies 
tomorrow because they could kill all 

1528
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:44,304
their enemies tomorrow.
They could go into Gaza and kill 

1529
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,800
everyone.
Now they're not doing it.

1530
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,000
You might cynically think,
well,

1531
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:48,973
they're just not doing that because the 
rest of the world would be so horrified 

1532
01:11:50,731 --> 01:11:53,760
and treat them like even more like a 
pariah state.

1533
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:54,763
Um,
so they're not being restrained by any 

1534
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:58,860
commitment to human rights or anything 
else notable.

1535
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:03,360
They're just as pure self serving a 
calculation,

1536
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,770
but still they're not committing 
genocide.

1537
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:08,604
And yet you have have people on the left
claiming that what they did in Gaza was 

1538
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:12,174
a genocide right

1539
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,030
there.
Their population goes up every year.

1540
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:14,864
I mean,
I tweet that people all the time when 

1541
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:16,454
they're.
You're saying someone tweeted at you 

1542
01:12:16,881 --> 01:12:17,900
saying about,
well,

1543
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:19,220
why don't you call it genocide?
And he wrote,

1544
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:20,163
well,

1545
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,710
yeah.
So you know it's,

1546
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,563
it's they're,
they're in a horrible and increasingly 

1547
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:31,580
untenable situation,
but they're dealing with people.

1548
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:32,623
Some set,
some significant subset of whom support 

1549
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,753
the targeting of innocence through 
suicidal terrorism in defense of 

1550
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:44,630
religion.
Not In,

1551
01:12:44,631 --> 01:12:45,464
not in this is this has flown the perch 
of mere politics and mirror claims upon 

1552
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:52,763
a know scarce resources.
We're talking about religious 

1553
01:12:55,161 --> 01:12:56,780
attachments to holy site,
if,

1554
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:58,310
if,
if the dome of the Rock,

1555
01:12:58,311 --> 01:12:59,210
if the,
if the Alex,

1556
01:12:59,211 --> 01:13:04,211
a mosque was destroyed as some crazy 
Christians and crazy Jews want to figure

1557
01:13:04,641 --> 01:13:05,890
out how to accomplish.
I mean there are,

1558
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,610
there are people who want to bomb that 
building,

1559
01:13:07,611 --> 01:13:10,430
right to usher in the second coming of 
Christ.

1560
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,303
Or if that building were destroyed,
you would see just an all out a attempt 

1561
01:13:18,891 --> 01:13:21,410
at genocide from the,
from the Muslim world.

1562
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:23,480
Um,
again,

1563
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:26,630
based entirely on the religious 
symbolism of,

1564
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:31,040
of just a pile of rocks.
That's the situation we're in.

1565
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,650
I really,
I put a lot of thought to it.

1566
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,240
How do I want to end this?
And,

1567
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,950
uh,
I read your other Book Waking Up,

1568
01:13:35,951 --> 01:13:39,370
which is a guide to spirituality without
religion.

1569
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:41,620
And as I've sat across from you for an 
hour and a half now,

1570
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:45,820
you seem to be extremely at peace.
I said to you,

1571
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:47,110
you know,
in your interview with Jake,

1572
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,273
there was a lot of ranting and raving on
his side and papers flying everywhere 

1573
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:51,403
and you sat there pretty much like 
you're sitting here right now and you 

1574
01:13:54,461 --> 01:13:57,970
commonly approach all these things I 
think in a very admirable way.

1575
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,660
Um,
so I,

1576
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,593
I've read the book,
but what are some of the tactics that 

1577
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:04,234
you use to,
to tap into that spirituality side to 

1578
01:14:07,301 --> 01:14:08,134
get all this?
Because we've talked about a lot of 

1579
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,760
noise and once we post these,
I know what twitter is gonna look like.

1580
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:14,380
And I know what the comments are going 
to look like,

1581
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,190
how do you find some peace within all 
this,

1582
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:19,024
and then within everything else that is 
going on in your personal life and 

1583
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:24,040
everything else,
how do you sort of get to that space?

1584
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,470
All right.
Practice Meditation,

1585
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:29,520
which is just paying close attention to 
your experience in the present moment.

1586
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:32,670
So if you do pay close attention to your
experience,

1587
01:14:32,671 --> 01:14:33,504
you'll notice that you have this 
condition of consciousness which is 

1588
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,863
subjectively speaking,
whatever we'll learn about it at the 

1589
01:14:41,551 --> 01:14:44,490
level of the brain at a certain point,
subjectively speaking,

1590
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,333
it's intrinsically mysterious.
You don't know what this is or how this 

1591
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,880
is arising subjectively.
I mean you can't,

1592
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:51,714
you know,
in fact you don't even know you have a 

1593
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:54,170
brain subjectively.
Um,

1594
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,403
so you have this space of light and 
shadow and color and energy and in that 

1595
01:14:59,641 --> 01:15:00,474
space,
thoughts and emotions keep arising and 

1596
01:15:03,361 --> 01:15:04,194
changing and passing away.
And the difference between being at 

1597
01:15:08,311 --> 01:15:09,144
peace and being starkly miserable,
there's always a difference between a 

1598
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,283
being kind of free of identification 
with thought and being totally captured 

1599
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:21,893
by your thought.
The next thought just comes up and you 

1600
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:25,794
don't,
you didn't notice it as a thought and 

1601
01:15:27,241 --> 01:15:28,950
it's just all of a sudden,
it seems to become you,

1602
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:29,910
you know,
so if I'm,

1603
01:15:29,911 --> 01:15:31,680
if I have a thought that arises and you 
know,

1604
01:15:31,681 --> 01:15:33,000
that fucking raise Isilon,
right?

1605
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:36,540
If that trims down consciousness too,
you know,

1606
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:39,150
that's the entirety of my being in that 
moment,

1607
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:39,984
right?
So the toxicity of our lives is really 

1608
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:43,464
mediated by thought and the moment you 
recognize it really your mind as the 

1609
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:52,500
level of experience and the level of 
your functioning in the world,

1610
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,420
your mind is all you have,
you know,

1611
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:57,450
and,
and it's every relationship you have,

1612
01:15:57,451 --> 01:15:58,284
every experience you have is going to be
as good or bad as your mind is in that 

1613
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,530
context.
Um,

1614
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:08,730
and we all have these experiences where 
we just kind of slammed into the present

1615
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:11,220
moment in a very satisfying way based 
on,

1616
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:12,690
you know,
some heightened experience,

1617
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:15,380
whether you know your bungee jumping or 
uh,

1618
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,780
you know,
we're having sex.

1619
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,110
So we've taken a drug or the some peak 
experience,

1620
01:16:19,111 --> 01:16:23,200
that seat that overrides all of our kind
of habitual mediocrity.

1621
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:24,600
Um,
and,

1622
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:28,830
and gets us to recognize that life can 
be beautiful and profound,

1623
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:35,360
but you can actually take charge of that
process and just train your mind to find

1624
01:16:35,521 --> 01:16:36,354
that profundity in each moment.
And meditation is just that technique 

1625
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,133
and that the book waking up is my effort
to describe that process and that 

1626
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:45,983
possibility very much in the context of 
science and without any religious Mumbo 

1627
01:16:49,741 --> 01:16:50,360
jumbo.

1628
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,193
I sense you'd rather spend more time 
talking about that than some of these 

1629
01:16:53,121 --> 01:16:53,954
other stuff too.

1630
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,350
Yeah,
I mean the irony is so that,

1631
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,273
that,
that Ben Affleck collision completely 

1632
01:16:57,861 --> 01:16:58,694
hijack my book tour.
I was on a book tour talking about 

1633
01:17:00,981 --> 01:17:05,981
meditation and spirituality and I'm 
restricted from that instant thereafter.

1634
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:07,341
They would,
it was just,

1635
01:17:07,341 --> 01:17:08,420
it was just all,
you know,

1636
01:17:08,421 --> 01:17:10,910
racism,
Islam all the time.

1637
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,950
Um,
but yeah,

1638
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:13,491
no,
I do.

1639
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,110
I mean I just feel like I,
I view,

1640
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,410
I really do most of my career,
certainly most of my,

1641
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,480
everything I've said about religion as a
massive opportunity cost.

1642
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,314
I mean,
I shouldn't have to say any of these 

1643
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:26,960
things.
None of us should have to say or hear or

1644
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:28,490
contemplate any of these things.
I mean,

1645
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:31,180
we just were talking about the,
the,

1646
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,193
the,
the legacy of these ancient books that 

1647
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:37,700
people think we're not written by human 
beings,

1648
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:39,500
but we're dictated by the creator of the
universe.

1649
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:43,790
And,
and hence they want to throw gays off of

1650
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:44,624
rooftops and,
and force women to live in bags or 

1651
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,673
prevent gay marriage in our context or 
preventive embryonic stem cell research 

1652
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:53,750
or whatever it is.

1653
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,583
And so we're,
we're fighting these ancient battles 

1654
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,710
which we should have outgrown centuries 
ago.

1655
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,720
And,
um,

1656
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:02,961
I,
I do,

1657
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:05,080
I see it as a personal opportunity costs
because yeah,

1658
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,070
there are more interesting things to 
talk about,

1659
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,273
but I just see civilizationally we have,
we have this one opportunity to make 

1660
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,270
this life beautiful,
you know,

1661
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,760
and we have a short life.
You know,

1662
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,920
I have a friend who just died.
I just,

1663
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:20,000
I just learned today,
right?

1664
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:21,590
He was my age,
you know,

1665
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:23,750
and um,
uh,

1666
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,050
you know,
his life was whatever he made of it,

1667
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,010
you know.
And then he had been,

1668
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:28,844
he had a final hour and,
and we were all in that same 

1669
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:31,994
circumstance personally,
and we're in that circumstance as a 

1670
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,780
species.
And when you look at how we,

1671
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:39,801
you know,
I mean,

1672
01:18:39,801 --> 01:18:40,634
there,
there are real challenges that make 

1673
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,210
that,
that make it make that a hard project.

1674
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,043
I mean,
there's disease and there's no 

1675
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,353
scientific things we don't understand 
that really would help us to understand 

1676
01:18:50,251 --> 01:18:52,990
and we have environmental problems and 
we can't,

1677
01:18:52,991 --> 01:18:53,824
we don't understand economy as well 
enough to really figure out how to 

1678
01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:01,760
prevent bad.
I'm recessions and depressions,

1679
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:06,180
but we have these other,
this other area of our lives where we.

1680
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:10,190
So obviously creating needless human 
misery.

1681
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,170
Uh,
and when you look at something like,

1682
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,670
you know,
isis or,

1683
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,623
or,
um,

1684
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,360
uh,
the extreme forms of religion takes.

1685
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:18,194
It's just,
it's just like we're just like lighting 

1686
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:23,420
fire to the wealth of the world for no 
good reason.

1687
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:24,254
And,
and um,

1688
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,770
yeah,
so it's a no,

1689
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:30,800
I appreciate the opportunity to talk for
a few minutes about something else,

1690
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:31,634
but it's just a fact that I do view us 
in the midst of a kind of political and 

1691
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:37,334
moral emergency.
And so I do find myself talking about 

1692
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,140
bad ideas more than I talk about good 
ones.

1693
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,170
Yeah.
Well I,

1694
01:19:43,171 --> 01:19:46,660
I feel the same way and I don't know how
many opportunities people get in life to

1695
01:19:46,661 --> 01:19:49,270
talk to somebody that they truly admire.
And that's what I got here today.

1696
01:19:49,271 --> 01:19:52,400
So I beyond that,
the first,

1697
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,220
it's a pleasure.
And uh,

1698
01:19:54,221 --> 01:19:55,054
and I hope that at the end of this that 
may be something good happened and if 

1699
01:19:57,551 --> 01:19:58,530
not,
uh,

1700
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,240
maybe we'll do it again or it was,
it was fun.

1701
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:02,260
It was fun to do so.
Yeah.

1702
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,393
Maybe next time we'll just do,
do you have a room that you do the 

1703
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:08,760
meditation and you have like don't,
don't at the moment they can go there,

1704
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:09,594
but I could,
I could find a flights out appropriate 

1705
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:11,940
spot.
All right,

1706
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,691
