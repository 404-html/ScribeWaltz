1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Joining me today is the Democratic 
nominee for Senate from the Great State 

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,370
of Utah.
Jenny Wilson.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,660
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Well,

4
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,980
thank you.
It's great to be here.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,070
I am glad to have you here.
I was reading your bio and it said that 

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,781
you were a fifth generation,
Utah u t a h n.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,280
There you go.
I didn't know it was spelled that way.

8
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:28,650
I wasn't sure it was even pronounced 
that way,

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,180
but I did it right.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,210
You did write down.
Don't throw the Aan.

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,140
What would that even though you're not a
Utah?

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,820
Well that's why I thought

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,480
Utah or something.
But you are a fifth generation use.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,740
I said to you right before we started,
I've actually never been to Utah,

15
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:51,080
so I only know the things of Utah that 
sort of get out there

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,090
like John Stockton,
Karl Malone,

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,780
the jazz,
the aren't doing well right now,

18
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:01,160
but that's a moment of this.
Yeah,

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,910
but you know,
for all the world's best skiing,

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,010
incredible snow,
beautiful mountains.

21
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:12,190
I leave my front door and in eight 
minutes I'm in remote wilderness on a 

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,960
run or hike or with my dog.
It's really great.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,740
Great State.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,840
So tell me,
we're going to talk a little bit about 

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Utah generally,
but tell me just a little bit about your

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,690
family and upbringing.
FIFTH-GENERATION UTAH.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,750
Yeah.
Well,

28
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,200
I,
my ancestors go back to the first person

29
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,780
to even make it into the valley ahead of
Brigham Young.

30
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,990
He was a scout for Brigham young snakes 
at Orson Pratt and he was head of the 

31
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:38,570
pioneer trail and I looked into the 
valley and said,

32
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:43,280
this is the place even before officially
Brigham Young said this is the place.

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,620
So he had actually started planting and 
irrigating before Brigham young and the 

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:48,620
rest of them came in.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,950
Yeah.
And tell me just a little bit about your

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,400
upbringing and family and that's it.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,270
Yeah.
So I,

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,340
uh,
kind of fell into politics,

39
00:01:55,341 --> 00:02:00,341
not by choice.
My Dad was the mayor of Salt Lake City 

40
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,011
in the seventies and eighties and I was 
a kid of the mayor that would go with 

41
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:05,810
them around town and to visit the banker
and you know,

42
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:07,670
the local religious leader,
whomever.

43
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,590
And I guess I have the five kids.
I ended up being the one that stuck with

44
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,780
this affliction affliction,

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,650
so like for a kid,
I mean I know it's just as you as a kid,

46
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,310
it's just your life,
but as a child of a,

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,130
well my dad was a people person still is
and I think that helped a bed.

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,160
It's a busy life to have a parent who's 
running and on the ballot and I think my

49
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:35,040
kids are now living that with me and 
there's a little bit of,

50
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,650
I think stress with that because it's 
not a typical life,

51
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:42,651
but it's a good one.
I feel really lucky to have had that 

52
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:42,960
experience and got to know the 
community.

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,620
My Mom's a small business owner and 
artists and gallery owner,

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,860
so I was able to kind of go to her 
business too as a kid growing up and was

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,790
really a great life.

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,190
Yeah.
And we were,

57
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,520
we were talking right before,
you've had a bunch of jobs,

58
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,970
also politics that have sort of led you 
to this.

59
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,390
Can you give me,
give me a couple of those that you've,

60
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,050
you've bounced around,
you've done some stuff.

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,790
Yeah.
So,

62
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:06,340
uh,
you know,

63
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,530
back to the day that my dad was running 
was always thrown into the campaign and 

64
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,611
then in 1988 he ran for governor and 
that was my first real job and they 

65
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,180
actually paid me.
I was the press secretary.

66
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,410
So I thought,
wow,

67
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:23,411
I can make a living doing this.
And it sort of helped in 1988 a define 

68
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:28,121
my politics a little,
I think some of the relationships I had 

69
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,130
on that campaign.
And then I ended up

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,260
a little bit about that.
Like what were some of the four major 

71
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,260
formative?

72
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,260
Yeah,
I think,

73
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,270
um,
well Utah's a very homogenous state.

74
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,940
So I think we were the Democrats,
right?

75
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:40,730
So we were sort of the calendar to what 
was out there.

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,750
And so I think,
uh,

77
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,770
environmental preservation,
a balancing government is important I 

78
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,631
think.
And that was one of the principles of 

79
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:52,631
that campaign.
And uh,

80
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,120
so anyway,
I just kind of fell into it.

81
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:58,121
Ended up on Capitol Hill.
I worked initially for a congressman 

82
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,330
from Oregon,
less a coin and 90.

83
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,390
And then in [inaudible] 92,
he was running for the US Senate.

84
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,630
I joined that race in Oregon.
He was defeated and I ended up working 

85
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,770
after that for Congressman from Utah,
uh,

86
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,920
initially as press secretary and then I 
became his chief of staff.

87
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,510
His name is Bill Orton and unfortunately
he was a blue dog,

88
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:19,040
Democrat,
Democrat,

89
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,020
democrat.
Yeah.

90
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,460
What does happen

91
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,510
been to the old school of Democrats 
because obviously we're going to talk 

92
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,510
about your politics and I did a little 
digging here and I think there,

93
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,600
there's some stuff.
There's some points of agreement that we

94
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,930
have for sure.
What I wish out of the Democrats is that

95
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:39,931
the old school Democrats still existed.
What I've seen consistently is that as 

96
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:44,521
the progressives have gone further left,
and I would say it's really out there 

97
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,360
now.
They've sort of taken the whole party in

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,420
any of the moderates are the blue dogs 
or whatever you want to call that wing.

99
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,150
I don't know.
They're either silent or they're gone 

100
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,430
altogether.
Do you think that's a fair estimation 

101
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,311
or,
or how would you even define some of 

102
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:02,311
these things?
Like a blue dog,

103
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:02,311
Democrat versus progressive?

104
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:02,970
Wow.
What a.

105
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,980
In the nineties,
my memories of Bill Orton and 

106
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,890
unfortunately he passed away a few years
ago,

107
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,490
but I'm used to pretty young a 
congressman in the day and I worked with

108
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:17,491
him for about four years and he was on 
the budget committee and the Banking 

109
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,700
Committee and very concerned about the 
deficit.

110
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
So that had a great impression on me.
I learned a lot about title might reform

111
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,491
about discretionary spending,
about our choices and I do think that as

112
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,080
we see the deficit and the debt go up an
APP,

113
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,480
um,
and it,

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,710
you know,
their deficit as you know,

115
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,890
is tied to economic prosperity.
When we do well,

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,670
our deficits are not as high.
Our overall debt keeps increasing.

117
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,970
So I really feel that we need to get 
back to some discipline and I think that

118
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,540
that has been missed,
uh,

119
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,590
in recent years.
And I work on a Salt Lake County 

120
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,680
Council.
I'm an elected now and we do balance the

121
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:02,681
budget every year and it's much tougher 
in years where we have economic decline 

122
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,440
and those are the years we can't,
um,

123
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,780
do maybe some of the nice to haves.
So I think we need to get back to more 

124
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:15,440
of a fluid budget process where congress
recognize,

125
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,400
recognizes,
hey,

126
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:20,210
this isn't such a good year,
can we find a different way of budgeting

127
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,310
so that we don't always give away things
that we can afford?

128
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,130
Is that possible

129
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,050
perhaps at the local level,
state level,

130
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,060
city level,
etc.

131
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,090
And just not possible anymore on the 
federal level because when you sit,

132
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:40,091
talk about fiscal responsibility,
that sounds so foreign to me as a 

133
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:40,610
democrat,
but by the way,

134
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:42,650
the republicans are horrible attitude 
and you know,

135
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:43,360
look at the,
the,

136
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,280
the,
uh,

137
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,040
the omni bus that was just passed and 
all that.

138
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,070
So I'm not even defending Any of them.
They have some of the principles that 

139
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,311
should make sense.
And so in a way they deserve more 

140
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:54,650
criticism because it's part of their 
package where it's a little less.

141
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,820
So for democrat,

142
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,180
well I think the division in Washington 
is forced budget reconciliation rather 

143
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,021
than true budgets.
And how can you reprioritize when you 

144
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:05,870
are just on the fly saying,
hey,

145
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,180
another two weeks,
let's go two more days.

146
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:09,980
So let's come back next week and fix 
this.

147
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,250
So that's my concern is that we're at 
the point with so much division that 

148
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,121
we're not having real conversations and 
I do think there's a baseline budget if 

149
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,080
we were to go maybe even to a two year 
budget cycle,

150
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,580
we're really find a way to force 
congress into actually true debate about

151
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:30,581
what are our priorities because we all 
are frustrated with the federal 

152
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:30,590
government.
It's not serving us,

153
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,140
it's not serving us at the local level.
And you know,

154
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:36,500
I'm not someone who wouldn't say that we
need to spend.

155
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:41,501
I think we do need to invest in our 
communities and there's so many things 

156
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:46,271
that the federal government can do to 
support us at the local level and 

157
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,151
should.
but when it's just rubber stamping what 

158
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:50,270
was done the year before,
I'm at last minute.

159
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,220
It's chaotic and it's not efficient.

160
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,970
Yeah.
What do you think is the right amount of

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,330
power for the federal government to have
over the states?

162
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:02,650
A lot of my audience that leans a little
more libertarian or classical liberal or

163
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,610
conservative,
whatever it is.

164
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,940
This is one of the key issues for them 
that we have to get this stuff back to 

165
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,000
the local municipalities and I'm pretty 
much,

166
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,340
yeah,
I mean I feel really good about the role

167
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,310
that,
uh,

168
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,930
I have at the local level.
I do think that there are certain things

169
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:21,931
that I'm really matter to us as a nation
that we have to have in place.

170
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:24,280
One,
of course being defense,

171
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,510
our interstate system and our highways 
and our connectivity and commerce.

172
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,720
There's so many things that if we were 
to be isolationists state to state 

173
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,381
really jeopardize our,
our ability to act as a super power,

174
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:41,650
the one that we are to be really.
I think I'm the best of our nation,

175
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,410
but there are a lot of things that we 
should do locally.

176
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,350
I mean,
I worry a little about too much,

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,290
um,
diversion when you look at education.

178
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,860
Um,
I don't want there to be a decision that

179
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,620
we would go four days a week in one 
state and not have basic standards.

180
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,850
So I think a basic level of standards.
But then let states decide.

181
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:07,851
I mean,
we've got California here being very 

182
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:07,851
different than Utah,
very different than,

183
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,720
you know,
a southern state or New York.

184
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,120
So I'm basically there on that.
To me,

185
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:12,720
I always say,
no,

186
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,090
I would want to kick all of education 
back to the states.

187
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,160
But then people ask have totally legit 
question,

188
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:18,210
which I think is what you're saying.
Well,

189
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,990
what if states start really doing very 
drastically different things?

190
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,330
What I would say is that maximum 
freedom,

191
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:29,331
the ability to leave a state you don't 
like if you don't like what they're 

192
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:29,331
doing.
I think that that's the better answer.

193
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:33,801
But I guess getting some,
some baseline I think is a is a sound 

194
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,670
or.
Absolutely.

195
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:40,671
And I do think though,
we look at the unique character of each 

196
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:43,680
of our states and we need to foster that
and find a way to,

197
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,060
you know,
really enable a state to do well on its 

198
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,060
own.

199
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Uh,
and you know,

200
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,880
we could start over would do it 
differently,

201
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:55,881
wouldn't we?
But we have to understand that in 2018 

202
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:56,730
there are certain things that are in 
place that,

203
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,950
um,
you know,

204
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,300
the conversation needs to be,
how do we reform,

205
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,510
maybe not dismantle.
I don't know if we would do it 

206
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:05,510
differently if we starteD over.
I wish we would get back to some of that

207
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,920
stuff.
I would do many things differently if we

208
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,420
start over here.
Like what Virginia.

209
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,450
Well,
like I think there is a better way to 

210
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,140
fund medicaid and medicare and some of 
our big programs.

211
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,350
I do believe as a democrat and I believe
strongly and fairness and compassion and

212
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,760
the government being a tool that we can 
and should invest.

213
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:31,761
It's just,
I think we've ended up building year 

214
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:35,450
after year after year on something that 
was created maybe for a good purpose at 

215
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,451
one point in time,
but is not as efficient as it needs to 

216
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:38,451
be.

217
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:39,630
And I'm,
I consider myself a reformer.

218
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:44,631
that's one of the reasons I like what I 
do is I have the opportunity to step in 

219
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:49,121
and look at how to make something better
and try and figure out a way to enact 

220
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,520
change.
View worry as someone that you're saying

221
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:54,180
you're pretty content with the work that
you're doing now and you've been able to

222
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:54,540
say,
no,

223
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:59,541
we can't do this if we can't budget it 
and it all kind of make sense and you 

224
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,971
let the chips fall wheRe they may that 
you could end up going to the swamp 

225
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:07,250
where it seems like nothing changes and 
that it doesn't sell that fun to me to 

226
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:07,250
be.
There might be,

227
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,111
you know,
it's nice to maybe be on the national 

228
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:12,270
stage and play with more high rollers 
and that kind of thing,

229
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,450
but that you lose the real sort of 
ability to,

230
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,520
to govern the way you would want it.

231
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,830
It's a good point.
I really believed the senate can change,

232
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,460
can change and that change will make a 
big difference.

233
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:31,020
I'd like to get back to the days where 
orrin hatch for my state and ted kennedy

234
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,820
work together and solve problems and we 
were seeing too much polarization.

235
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,520
We don't have enough conversation on my 
council.

236
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:43,521
We have five republicans,
four democrats and we worked together 

237
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:46,800
and I know that I have to go find that 
first vote right.

238
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:48,630
I'm not a mathematician,
it's,

239
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,810
yeah,
the collegiality matters and listening 

240
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,511
and trying and compromise.
What's the tenor of politics in Utah 

241
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:58,570
right now is what's going on nationally 
with just this endless craziness.

242
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,640
Is that happening to you guys at the 
local level?

243
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,250
We tend to be a to five to 10 points.
Uh,

244
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,710
the,
the president's numbers and profile and 

245
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,660
polling tends to be about 10 percent 
higher in favor in Utah.

246
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,580
So we still have a lot of people who 
were pro trump.

247
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,970
I'm the core downtown salt lake,
which is our kind of more progressive 

248
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,111
area.
you're going to say the reverse of that 

249
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:25,600
and our urban areas,
probably 50 slash 50,

250
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,720
so we're like a lot of states where you 
have a very progressive kind of core 

251
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,270
city and suburban area 50 slash 50,
and then you get to very conservative 

252
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,970
area.
So as a state that generally runs red,

253
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,270
um,
and that leans more conservative for 

254
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,270
sure.
As someone that's running as a democrat,

255
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,380
what's,
what's the primary process like first as

256
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:52,381
a democrat?
Like what kind of people are you 

257
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:52,381
reading?
Where are you wearing?

258
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:52,381
Well,
interestingly,

259
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:56,341
um,
two years ago there was a very much a 

260
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:57,600
strong bernie sanders presence in our 
state because,

261
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,830
you know,
the lds church has a lot of dominance.

262
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,960
there are a lot of people who speak out 
forcefully against the one party system,

263
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,000
which is generally what we have in the 
state.

264
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,630
And so you get some pretty progressive 
people.

265
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:15,631
And we were an 80 slash 20.
I'm bernie sanders state to hillary 

266
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:15,650
clinton.
Yeah.

267
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,590
Which is kind of surprising.
But um,

268
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,620
things have sort of calmed down.
I would expect that just because of the 

269
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,370
nature of a democrat at that point 
because the state liens so far.

270
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,650
The other way that if you're going to 
say you're a democrat,

271
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,950
you may as well go all in on that.
Generally,

272
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,630
I think so.
And we alsO,

273
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:36,631
like every state,
we have our own nomination process and 

274
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:38,120
the republicans have a closed a 
republican system,

275
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,770
so you have to affiliate with the 
republican with an r on the voter file.

276
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,100
And so therefore there are actually are 
a lot of independence who are actually 

277
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,840
filing as republicans because they want 
to vote that way.

278
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,510
And with that party,
what's your policy on that?

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,980
For the open or closed prison?
Yeah,

280
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean,
I don't know.

281
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:00,001
We've debated it on the democratic side 
and because the democrats are few and 

282
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,480
far between in my state we register at 
20,

283
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:06,481
25 percent,
but we do pull independence as I 

284
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:06,481
mentioned.
Um,

285
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:10,310
you know,
we're not in the driver's seat and some 

286
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,181
of those policies,
so we just sort of work with whatever 

287
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,540
makes sense because we're not in the one
able to do anything.

288
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:18,541
But that always strikes me as one of 
those things where it's like the closed 

289
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:22,440
primary does make sense to me because 
that's to nominate who you want out of 

290
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:24,760
that party.
And if you just have an open primary,

291
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:29,761
well you could get all sorts of people 
who will never vote for any of those 

292
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:32,911
candidates purposely getting into help 
candidates that they think are going to 

293
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:33,460
be more handicapped ultimately.

294
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,630
So I don't have.
I know a lot of people think that the 

295
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,441
closed primary thing is somehow a 
conspiracy or anti democratic or 

296
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:41,150
something.
But I don't have a problem with.

297
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,800
The problem is what do you do with 
independence because most people tend to

298
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,650
affiliate independent.
I mean people I know,

299
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,540
I mean there are people like you and me 
and,

300
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,610
and elected or in meeting or whatever 
that tend to be the insiders who 

301
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,230
obviously follow this and get very 
deeply entrenched and every step of the 

302
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,400
way.
And uh,

303
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,870
I think most utahns are sort of in the 
middle and uh,

304
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,871
so I don't know,
that gets a little confusing because if 

305
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:10,301
we close,
both them weren't as an independent 

306
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:10,301
government.
IndependenT does nothing.

307
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:11,510
Or you can see the independents can vote
in either,

308
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,210
but then why wouldn't anyone voted 
register as a,

309
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,450
as an independent,
right.

310
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,330
I guess there's no easy answer on that 
one.

311
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,350
Yeah.
Our big battle in the republican party 

312
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,420
right now is whether or not we're going 
to do away with the caucus system and go

313
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,840
to the conventions rather and go to a 
direct primary.

314
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,960
So that's our battle right now.
We have a two tiered system you can pick

315
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:34,760
either now and that's under review.
What are some of the other issues?

316
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,070
Is there anything else in Utah that you 
just see as like,

317
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,270
just like the technical stuff,
the technical problems related to voting

318
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,720
or districting gerrymandering,
that sort of thing,

319
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,850
but someone that's on the other side,
gerrymander,

320
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,030
it's a very big problem.
And then we have wacky maps like a lot 

321
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,220
of states.
Um,

322
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,440
there's a ballot initiative,
so share one is a,

323
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:59,450
um,
redistricting commission ballot 

324
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,051
initiative that should likely passed.
They got the required signatures to get 

325
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:02,051
on.

326
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:02,720
It seemed so,
um,

327
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,750
that would require that the legislature 
listened to a redistricting commission 

328
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:12,761
that makes the recommendation,
but the decision does lie in the hands 

329
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:13,810
of the legislature in our state.
Right.

330
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,580
So whAt are some of the other democratic
principles,

331
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:21,581
layout,
some democratic good old democratic 

332
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:21,581
principles in you nash?
I mean,

333
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,530
just personally for me,
some of the things that you believe in.

334
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,630
I've affiliated with the democratic 
party because I think that the party has

335
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:34,631
been the party.
The one has battled for fairness and 

336
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:34,631
compassion over the years.
I mean,

337
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:37,220
I have been pro lgbtq rights from day 
one.

338
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,010
I was the first time I council to move 
forward,

339
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,040
um,
local policies we did even before my 

340
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
election to the county council years 
ago,

341
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,430
four years ago,
um,

342
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,480
housing nondiscrimination,
but we didn't have medical fairness in 

343
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:52,480
terms of our,
um,

344
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,260
health care plans at salt lake county.

345
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,590
So when I was first elected in 2004,
I moved that and I couldn't get a 

346
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,911
republican vote.
so it took several takes trying to 

347
00:17:03,911 --> 00:17:08,050
redefine the benefits and ultimately we 
ended up passing it six three with a 

348
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,550
republican supporting us.
So,

349
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,770
uh,
I think issues like that have been key.

350
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,440
I think we have a very.
One of the reasons I think I'm so active

351
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:21,230
in politics in my state is that we don't
have balance,

352
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,750
uh,
back in my dad's era in the seventies,

353
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,990
we did have a republican governor.
We had a democratic governor rather.

354
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,310
Uh,
it's been since the seventies since we 

355
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,420
had a democrat in the us senate from the
state of Utah.

356
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,760
And that's the person that orrin hatch 
defeated.

357
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,030
So I really believe that good government
is a balanced government and we live it 

358
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,990
and see it on my county council again 
with that,

359
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,190
can I have five,
four?

360
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,460
We have a democratic county executive,
we call it a mayor and so we're,

361
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,860
I feel like we're in a really good 
position in my day job now to bring 

362
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,491
about fairness and balance,
but we're 80 slash 20 and our 

363
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:02,751
legislature,
we are republican governor and so on 

364
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:04,680
down.
So part of what I fight for is balance.

365
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,840
I think it makes sense for good 
government.

366
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,290
It's interesting too to stake out 
positions that,

367
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,810
you know are not the popular ones there 
too,

368
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:17,760
just so that the system doesn't become 
too corroded or,

369
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,430
or too stiff.
But what about.

370
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,440
So it sounds sort of like you're,
you're socially liberal and fiscally 

371
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,960
conservative.
BaSic.

372
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,000
I would agree with that.
I think.

373
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,860
So.
Where were you at on abortion?

374
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm pro choice.
Um,

375
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,130
I believe that that women should have 
that right to choose.

376
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,400
One of the reasons I really,
the more I've learneD about younger 

377
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,400
women,
um,

378
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,300
you know,
my own years with friends growing up,

379
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,720
I see at times women who don't have the 
security that I've had my entire life 

380
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:52,280
with good parents and support are often,
um,

381
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,380
pray to being victimized.

382
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,380
And so I think that a woman's right to 
choose is very much critical because of 

383
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:03,300
that.
And I know that,

384
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,350
um,
you know,

385
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,380
in a very conservative state,
I've had situations to support my sister

386
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:13,530
who carried her child,
I've been friends with.

387
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:18,531
People have made different decisions and
I just fundamentally believe that women 

388
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:22,250
need to be in the driver's seat on that 
decision and we can't go back to the 

389
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,070
days of real,
real tragedies.

390
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,750
Um,
prior to roe versus wade.

391
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,290
Do you see a cutoff point on it or were 
you on that?

392
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,570
Um,
well,

393
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:35,571
I think that that's a decision for 
science and I think the courts have 

394
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,510
landed through roe versus Wade.
And so I,

395
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,320
that's the best I can do,
but follow what we have in place now.

396
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,310
And I just don't think in 2018 we can go
back in time.

397
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,070
It's interesting because that's one of 
the ones where I've heard,

398
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,090
you know,
obviously there's a lot of mormons in 

399
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,601
Utah,
but I hear a lot of people that talk 

400
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:56,601
about the flyover states and they say 
that,

401
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:58,020
you know,
a lot of the christian conservatives are

402
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,090
just voting on that no matter what.

403
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,090
So again,
it's,

404
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,250
it's a position where you as someone not
telling the conservative line on that,

405
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,040
that that's a serious uphill battle.
Yeah,

406
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:13,041
I think so.
But I think the lds church is 

407
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,080
fundamentally a very compassionate 
religion and I think that,

408
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,470
um,
it is compassion I think kind of can 

409
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,400
mitigate that a little bit.
And it has actually the lds church,

410
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,800
its position,
rape,

411
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:30,801
incest,
life of the mother is actually a little 

412
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,250
more progressive than some religions.
What do you make of,

413
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,280
uh,
how involved they've been in with gay 

414
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,280
marriage?
It's not really talked about anymore.

415
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,430
It's the law of the land.
I get it.

416
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,830
It's sort of a boring topic for me at 
some level.

417
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Uh,
but they did have certain influence in 

418
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,220
the whole national debate about over the
years.

419
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:53,221
it's interesting.
I think the lds church has come along 

420
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:56,420
way in terms of basic rights,
but marriage is obviously a death,

421
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,430
a,
you know,

422
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,670
a defining line.
Um,

423
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,210
and in this era,
given we have marriage equality 

424
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,380
nationally,
we'll see how they step up and you'll,

425
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,470
it's interesting,
there tend to be very,

426
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,870
uh,
open right now to more um,

427
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,920
lgbtq people involved in church services
and really sending a message of love thy

428
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:22,630
neighbor.
And I appreciate that.

429
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,300
Yeah.
Well,

430
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,080
it's interesting to me because it's like
people,

431
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,370
it's so easy to bash mormons and you see
it in comedy all the time.

432
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,950
And look,
broadway had the book of mormon.

433
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,400
I didn't even see the book of mormon 
actually.

434
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:32,690
I heard it was great.
I would love to see it,

435
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,930
but it's like you can make that show 
very easily.

436
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,250
There are certain books you're not 
allowed to talk about that we'd never 

437
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,451
make it on broadway.
So I always find like this need to bash 

438
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:44,870
mormons all the time where it's like the
easy joke all the time.

439
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:49,871
It's like maybe they're actually not the
intolerant people because you have a 

440
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:50,380
very easy time.
A joking.

441
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:50,440
Yeah.

442
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,800
Well you can.
I'm baptized lds and um,

443
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,880
I have a great relationship with my 
friends who were still going to church 

444
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,570
regularly and my family members who are.
And I think it's a,

445
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,820
I love any religion that lifts people up
and there are times where I disagree 

446
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,700
with churches,
politics.

447
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:14,701
I would very much defend separation of 
church and state and there are times 

448
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,750
where I might raise an eyebrow and go,
wait a minute.

449
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,820
This seems like it's overstepping a 
little bit,

450
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,210
but I do appreciate the lds churches,
incredible force for good in the youtube

451
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:29,301
community by um,
services and by creating a lot of 

452
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,270
support within our salt lake city area 
with,

453
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,530
um,
you know,

454
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:40,531
there's a food bank for members and they
make it open to people who are in 

455
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,660
general need.
And I think there's a,

456
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,780
again,
at times I would have some differences 

457
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,541
certainly,
but I support the role in that and the 

458
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,660
commitment and anybody who chooses to 
practice religion and it lives up their 

459
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,230
lives.
That's a good thing.

460
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,400
Yeah.
So would you,

461
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:00,460
so because you're talking about all the 
good things that the church does,

462
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,820
would you kick some of those social 
services back to churches and synagogues

463
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:08,980
and mosques and everything else if,
if you had the power to do so?

464
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,570
Because to me I,
again,

465
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:15,571
as a small government guy,
that's what I would see at it sounds 

466
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:15,571
like some of that's happened.

467
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:15,700
Well,
I think we do that.

468
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:20,701
I mean,
I worry about the tax bill now because 

469
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:20,701
we're not going to get a ride off 
anymore.

470
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:22,150
We're going to see how charitable people
really are,

471
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,230
you know,
who knows?

472
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,750
But we do that now.
I think we always,

473
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:26,770
I mean,
I love,

474
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,230
um,
the work that I'm able to do on the salt

475
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,860
lake county council when we have,
um,

476
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,280
a business leader step up and support 
something a little bit of county dollars

477
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:41,281
as well.
And we have a public private 

478
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:41,290
partnership.
So I think we see a lot of that now.

479
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,160
Could we take it further perhaps,
but I think we get that then get into,

480
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:50,410
you know,
incentives and benefits and what I want 

481
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,771
to see in the community and what drives 
me is problem solving and I don't think 

482
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:56,060
the government is always the best 
vehicle for solving those problems.

483
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,940
I mean,
we do have businesses,

484
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:00,560
individuals,
government,

485
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,420
the web of all of that to solve a 
problem and do it creatively.

486
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,520
Um,
I enjoy doing that at the local level 

487
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,530
and I think the federal level we can do 
that better and do more.

488
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,880
What kind of support or not support are 
you getting out of the dnc?

489
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,530
They got a whole slew of problems,
right?

490
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,620
Yeah.
Well,

491
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:19,540
so I just got the nomination

492
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,530
by the way,
just for the record a little bit after 

493
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:26,530
when we're taping it,
so.

494
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:26,530
Okay.
Yeah.

495
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,031
So I just recently received the 
nomination so I have not had anybody.

496
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,050
The doorbell rang and a big check from 
the dance see by any means.

497
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,110
But um,
I've had conversations with the dscc.

498
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:43,410
I've been invited to tour the city here 
in la and san francisco and seattle with

499
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,160
some of the us senators,
women.

500
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,340
Uh,
and that was a very educational for me 

501
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,221
and a great benefit to have some time 
with our three or four or five of our us

502
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:59,230
senators on the democratic side of the 
aisle.

503
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,190
And so I think just the conversations 
that connection,

504
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,640
I mean fundamentally I think the 
democrats are trying to take back the 

505
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,701
senate and we'll see how things play out
over the next six months or so in my 

506
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:15,931
race.
And I'm hopeful that we'll get some 

507
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,840
significant national support.
I think,

508
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,700
um,
I feel though my,

509
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,090
uh,
support should come from Utah and it is 

510
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,300
and uh,
I just get up every day and see what I 

511
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,500
can do to bring a check in and get low 
dollar contributors to,

512
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,790
to get what they can and day to day and 
we'll see what happens.

513
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Yeah.
It's interesting to me because it seems 

514
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:37,840
like you're really in a unique position 
where you're,

515
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,380
you really seem to be fighting both 
sides.

516
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,870
Maybe you don't want me to totally 
presented that way,

517
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,810
but you're obviously fighting.
You're fighting the republican side as a

518
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,550
democrat in a,
in a,

519
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:51,790
in a red state,
but also what I mentioned earlier about 

520
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,130
the,
it seems to me that the dnc and the 

521
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,130
entire leadership from,
you know,

522
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,360
bernie and Elizabeth Warren and Keith 
Ellison and tom perez,

523
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,550
like those guys seem way more left.
Some of the things you've talked about 

524
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:02,760
here.
So I don't.

525
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,970
It's almost like why would they want to 
support you?

526
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:08,050
Like your sort of against the stuff that
they're kind of.

527
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,120
No,
actually tom perez has visited a couple 

528
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,791
of times.
He's pretty committed to playing in 

529
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,180
every zip code and I think he's building
towards that.

530
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,510
I mean the republican party and the 
democratic party have different 

531
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,520
influences within its governance 
structure.

532
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,680
So I haven't given up on the dnc paying 
attention to you.

533
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,780
I think they've done a good job in the 
past year and really engaging and 

534
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,021
listening.
What's most important to me is that we 

535
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:41,921
get to the point where I'm both parties 
actually recognize that there cities and

536
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:48,870
there are communities and they're all 
small small towns aside from,

537
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,700
you know,
los angeles,

538
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,460
New York city,
big cities in Florida,

539
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:55,290
etc.
Chicago were,

540
00:26:55,291 --> 00:27:00,291
I mean,
there are people on the ground in my 

541
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:00,291
state in need with,
you know,

542
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:04,380
the,
the need government to lift them up or 

543
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,330
need some support in some way from,
um,

544
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,890
community based networks.

545
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,730
And I think that we have become both not
as,

546
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,940
and this isn't just the parties,
Washington and how we govern,

547
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,490
um,
you know,

548
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,620
a little too focused I think on urban 
centers.

549
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Do you think we're just too reliant on 
government in general that the answer 

550
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,010
always seemed for both parties at this 
point?

551
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,330
I mean,
there's a couple outliers.

552
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:28,800
I think rand paul,
I always bring it up.

553
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,680
He's trying either you obviously have 
disagreements with him on the,

554
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,970
on the amount of government,
but I see him as someone that's 

555
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,381
earnestly trying to fight for what he 
believes in and usually falls short 

556
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:40,440
because the system doesn't allow it that
much.

557
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,840
Um,
but,

558
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,190
but that argument of how much 
government,

559
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:49,191
we always,
the answer seems to always be more 

560
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:49,191
unfortunately.
Well,

561
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:53,241
I think that we have to get back to some
pretty major changes back to reinventing

562
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:58,281
things because what I do when I look at 
government and what's possible,

563
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,050
let's look at what we have on the table.

564
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:06,050
Unfortunately,
I learned in the nineties when I worked 

565
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,320
for a congressman that things don't 
happen quickly and I wish we could,

566
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,350
you know,
get out the etch a sketch and shake it 

567
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,350
and start over.
Right.

568
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,630
But,
you know,

569
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:17,631
I,
and I think sometimes around paul and 

570
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:17,631
others,
it's,

571
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:17,910
it's,
we have to accept that,

572
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,970
um,
we do have challenges with a lot of 

573
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,030
people in need.
We do have income inequality and we have

574
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,280
to address those issues.
It would be nice,

575
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I think to,
to Simply,

576
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,380
you know,
um,

577
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,360
have a smaller federal government,
but on the other hand,

578
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,450
what are we to do?
I think we would take a step back in 

579
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,100
terms of progress for us all.
I think we all want the same thing.

580
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,920
So we want people to do well.
We want them to get up every day,

581
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,420
um,
have a,

582
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,820
have a step towards self sufficiency or 
get out,

583
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,230
make a living,
not commit crime,

584
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:55,830
be happy.

585
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,090
I mean,
we all want the same thing.

586
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,220
The question is how do we get there?
Right?

587
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,320
So that is the question because the 
latter part of that,

588
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:06,321
of course,
I believe all of those things and I 

589
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:08,241
don't,
I really try not to impugn the motives 

590
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:08,241
of the people that I disagree with in 
general.

591
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:08,850
Not talking about you but just in 
general.

592
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,960
But to me the answer to,
to solve those problems would be just 

593
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,680
the government keeps scaling back,
keep scaling back,

594
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:21,681
keeps coming back.
Hopefully private enterprise comes in 

595
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:24,890
and you give people more self reliance 
as opposed to creating a system that 

596
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,301
they kinda can't move out of because I 
think there's a lot of evidence for 

597
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,231
that.
And that's the great debate and that's 

598
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,140
the great.
Should we just have to look at,

599
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,940
you know,
I've worked for a little while at a 

600
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,010
hospital that did an incredible amount 
of ophthalmology research and I learned 

601
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:48,781
a lot about research and development and
how the federal government works through

602
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:54,631
basic science and supports researchers 
and I look at our innovation and our 

603
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:57,310
nation and what we've done because we've
invested in that.

604
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,920
So when you talk about smaller 
government and you have to say,

605
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:04,921
okay,
where and what is the next step by the 

606
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:05,710
pure funding of science by the,
for the record,

607
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:08,400
either got a lot of books of scientists 
who had been on the street.

608
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,750
We have to.
And then there's a lot of businesses 

609
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,550
that receive benefits and support small 
businesses on up.

610
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,710
Um,
you know,

611
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,500
we just allowed for a one point 
$5,000,000,000,000

612
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,540
corporate tax cut without any 
requirement that people return it to 

613
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,861
wages and to growing companies.
And I see a lot of federal policies that

614
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:34,231
have overly supported business.
And I think especially now in this era 

615
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:36,520
with that,
I mean I looked at and did a back of the

616
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:40,450
napkin on our own taxes.
I did quite a bit of assessment when the

617
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:45,451
tax bill came out at the end of the year
to see what it would do for a family of 

618
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:45,610
four,
a family of six,

619
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:48,280
a larger Utah family and they're not.
Many of uS are.

620
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:52,960
We're going to get a big benefit from 
that and now the mitt romney's and a few

621
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:57,700
others will and I think why in this era 
we've got to find a way to,

622
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,680
if we are going to do tax reform,
tax simplification.

623
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,980
That was a principal we talked about 
with her.

624
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,950
I'm like,
ah,

625
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,290
you know,
call her,

626
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,330
you know,
call your tax accountant because he or 

627
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:12,330
she is gonna.
Make double now.

628
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:12,330
is there any

629
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,050
reason to believe that the government 
can do these things?

630
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Like,
like if you take just the general 

631
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,551
stagnation we talked about in Washington
and most of the congressmen who do 

632
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:26,611
nothing in the senators who've been 
there forever and accomplish nothing or 

633
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:30,661
it's just endless fighting or all that.
The idea that these people who often 

634
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:35,200
have never created any jobs and it never
really made anything happen.

635
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:36,940
I mean,
I conclude bernie in this for sure.

636
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,780
The idea that they,
that they are the ones that are gonna,

637
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,800
figure out how to get the economy going 
when it really comes from the people 

638
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,360
that comes from the local businesses,
the small businesses,

639
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:46,680
etc.

640
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Well,
congress should be listening to its 

641
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,260
constituents and to it specialists and 
that's why there's nothing that offended

642
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:58,261
me more than what happened with the 
healthcare bill and the tax bill last 

643
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:02,341
time with no debate.
I mean there were some efforts for to 

644
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:06,131
have a bipartisan discussion around both
and one of the offenders was orrin hatch

645
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,540
who was trying to take and up down now 
get outta here.

646
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:13,170
We gotta get home and that that's the 
worst.

647
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:13,990
Oh,
government to me,

648
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,630
because we should have that.
We should have specialists in.

649
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,810
We should have a debate.
We shouldn't have lobbyists lined up and

650
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:24,811
we should actually have methods and 
systems to do what I do on the county 

651
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:25,320
council,
work with my colleagues,

652
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:30,321
bring specialists in,
listen to information and make good 

653
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:30,321
decisions.
Yeah.

654
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:30,321
I

655
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,750
think you could probably draw a line 
from the obamacare debate and how insane

656
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:37,620
that guide to everything that has led us
to where we are at now.

657
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,670
Even during that.
Yeah,

658
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:43,671
the wouldn't sit down and we're goIng 
crazy the whole time and obama kept 

659
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,900
saying in the reelection campaign,
we're going to do it on cspan.

660
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:49,901
It's going to be open door cspan and 
it's like just the odd amount of 

661
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:56,051
congressmen and senators that were 
retiring in the middle of it after they 

662
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:56,051
would make a decision or we need 
something.

663
00:32:56,051 --> 00:32:56,530
Just seemed

664
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,530
about the whole thing and let's go fix 
it.

665
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Let's go fix it and let's get back to 
our real conversation and I,

666
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,270
I guess I feel maybe from going back 
maybe a full circle now to talking about

667
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:12,550
my father again.
I think in the seventies,

668
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:15,400
in the eighties,
those things were more likely to happen.

669
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,560
The collegiality,
the discussion,

670
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,800
and one of the things that led to my 
interest in this race was it like,

671
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,460
I am a reformer.
I,

672
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,470
I like you want to fix things.
So I want to go back and have a voice in

673
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,470
the system wherever I can find an ally 
in,

674
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:35,260
in doing some of the things you're 
suggesting that we get down.

675
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:37,000
We worked through these things.
Um,

676
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,070
but I actually think that,
uh,

677
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,310
if that's too big a deal initially,
at least that I can serve my state.

678
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,270
And that was my major interest in 
running is I think that um,

679
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,480
we need a democrat from our delegation.
We have six ours.

680
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,340
Um,
we have six zero votes on everything and

681
00:33:57,341 --> 00:34:00,610
there are a lot of people in my 
community and in my state that are being

682
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:01,420
served by that.

683
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,650
Yeah.
I just quickly to reverse back to say,

684
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:08,651
we talked about before about,
and you were saying about being able to 

685
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:09,580
sit down with people have crossed the 
iron ore that you mentioned right before

686
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:14,581
we sat down that we have a mutual friend
in rick grinnell who I think as we're 

687
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:16,900
taping this today,
we think he just left for Germany.

688
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:21,901
He was finally confirmed after over a 
year of waiting to be the ambassador of 

689
00:34:21,901 --> 00:34:22,530
Germany.
So we're both thrilled.

690
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,410
You guys were were old roommates,
but he's a republican.

691
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:28,930
He's a trump supporting republican or a 
democrat from Utah.

692
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:30,280
And guess what?
you guys are friends.

693
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,380
It's all good.
It's all good.

694
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,570
Yeah.
That does seem to be the thing that is 

695
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:37,570
last.
These.

696
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:37,570
Yeah.
And I,

697
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,570
I just don't get that and I,
I have enough sense of my own 

698
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,391
convictions that I'm not threatened by 
going to dinner with republicans.

699
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:49,000
So are working with them on a county 
council and I'll tell you,

700
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:52,990
there are times when the four democrats 
look over at the other side of the aisle

701
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:53,980
and we're like,
we're done.

702
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:57,160
We're out.
But we have those conversations.

703
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:02,161
We work through our budget together.
We have some votes that are crossed 

704
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:04,060
party lines and others that are,
they typically are,

705
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,860
you know,
some are some days.

706
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,430
Um,
and you know,

707
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I think that's the reason that local 
people or people who've worked at the 

708
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,030
local level like myself,
need to get to congress.

709
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:21,330
We need to get more and more people who 
get government to have worked in 

710
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,730
government who solve problems and come 
in with that commitment to,

711
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,290
to,
you know,

712
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,430
putting the time,
effort,

713
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:29,710
energy,
and to moving things forward.

714
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Alright.
So let's talk about the race you were 

715
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:34,900
involved.
Fair to say this is an uphill battle.

716
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,840
I think so a little bit.
Yeah.

717
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,230
Just say

718
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,410
just numbers.
It's,

719
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,160
it's a tough

720
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,700
one.
Okay.

721
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,530
So at the republican convention,
everyone thought,

722
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,531
I think,
or at least at the national level and 

723
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:48,531
thought mitt romney was going to walk in
and clean this thing up.

724
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:52,821
Right.
The guy was the republican nominee for 

725
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:54,981
president not too long ago and has all 
the media behind him and all the money 

726
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:55,230
and all that.
uh,

727
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:58,290
but my kennedy one,
I don't know much about Mike Kennedy.

728
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:03,291
So could you just briefly tell me a 
little bit about him and then we'll 

729
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:03,291
focus more on the romney.
Fascinating.

730
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:07,980
He's a legislator.
He is kind of himself as conservative,

731
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:12,100
more conservative than romney.
Romney sort of been all over the place.

732
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:13,780
So I don't know.
I really,

733
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:16,120
truly do not know mitt romney's 
politics.

734
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:21,220
So my kennedy ran to the right of romney
and did pretty well at the convention.

735
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,430
Romney came in second,
so the two of them will go to a late 

736
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:26,430
june primary.

737
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:26,430
Right.
So it was pretty close.

738
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,430
I think it was 51 slash 49.
So they will do a primary soon enough.

739
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:30,730
Yeah.

740
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,280
You would,
you'd have to claire,

741
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,950
60 percent at your convention to avoid 
the primary,

742
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,590
which I did.
And so I,

743
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:42,591
yeah,
I've cleared my with 81 percent and then

744
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:48,141
there I've got it.
The primary now you worked for romney a 

745
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:49,210
dead?
Yeah.

746
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,490
Tell me about that.
Um,

747
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,670
I worked for him.
He just said you don't know his 

748
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,670
politics.
Well,

749
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,491
I thought I did at the time.
So I worked for the olympic games of 

750
00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:01,461
2002.
We had three or four of us who ran the 

751
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,510
volunteer program,
recruitment retention training,

752
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,990
a 26,000
employees and volunteers on those games.

753
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,140
That made it a success and a.
Yeah.

754
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:15,141
So he was our chief executive and I was 
senior staff and I saw quite a bit of 

755
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:20,340
him and I was always a little bit 
nervous when we had the quarterly budget

756
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:25,341
review with mitt romney was a big day.
What was that like a businessman right 

757
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,160
as a now we went end with our budgets 
and how to defend our programs and he'd 

758
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,230
give us a up or down and I will say mit 
did a good job of stabilizing the budget

759
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,080
and fundraising and that was,
he was good at.

760
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:39,060
That is a good,
good person to work for.

761
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,810
But when you say you don't know what his
politics are like,

762
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:42,860
what,
what does that mean?

763
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,150
Well,
he laughed right after the olympic 

764
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,150
games,
um,

765
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,290
to Massachusetts to run for governor,
uh,

766
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:53,370
he had run against ted kennedy in 
Massachusetts for the senate years 

767
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,000
before.
So thIs was his,

768
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:59,001
um,
jump into political life again and he 

769
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:02,760
won that race and I started to watch and
was interested because I knew him and it

770
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,330
seemed,
you know,

771
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:07,060
he was going in as a progressive 
governor,

772
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,370
republican governor,
uh,

773
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:14,371
he signed an assault weapon ban.
He was pro choice and uh,

774
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:19,891
he got ruined in Massachusetts and then 
not long after he ran for president was 

775
00:38:19,961 --> 00:38:23,230
defeated and then president and again,
and he ended up moving more and more and

776
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:24,760
more.
I'm going to the left,

777
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:25,900
but it was actually to the right,

778
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,470
right,
exactly what people would say.

779
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,400
People would say,
well,

780
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:31,210
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

781
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:35,630
Didn't he kind of start obamacare with 
romney carried Massachusetts then was.

782
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:35,970
And then it

783
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,920
was also running.
Yeah,

784
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,820
it.
Yeah.

785
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,090
And then we have the history with trump 
where he was,

786
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,720
um,
I think delivered all wooded would agree

787
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,650
the most scathing,
um,

788
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,860
speech against trump,
talking about his lack of values,

789
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:53,350
his inability to govern and was very 
much in the amt.

790
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,950
Anybody but trump camp.
And then,

791
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:01,951
you know,
we saw the sit down when there was some 

792
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:02,730
talk of secretary.
Yeah.

793
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,970
He did not look happy and then it seems 
he's back with trump or.

794
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,530
Yeah.
So that's what we're left with right now

795
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:10,450
to kind of work through that in the 
state.

796
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:15,510
Do you think when he had that moment,
I remember when he gave that press 

797
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:15,510
conference,
it was late.

798
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,010
It looked like trump was gonna win no 
matter what,

799
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:21,330
but he gave that press conference.
I read it more as and I think perhaps 

800
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,210
the electorate did to that.

801
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,540
It was kinda like,
have you lost this thing?

802
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:30,541
So why would we listen to you?
Like the whole thing with trump was 

803
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,421
about winning.
So it was like anyone that liked trump 

804
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:33,421
wasn't going to be like,
oh,

805
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:34,750
he is making a couple of good points.
It's like,

806
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:35,740
no,
you were the loser.

807
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:38,830
They're trotting out the loser.
We tried it with mccain,

808
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,820
we tried it with romney,
we tried it with more centrist people.

809
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,500
Even though I actually think trump is 
sort of interesting,

810
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,220
his own bizarre way,
but that's a whole other topic.

811
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,610
I'm like,
the idea of that just doesn't work 

812
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:53,610
anymore.
It doesn't fly anymore.

813
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:53,610
Right,
exactly.

814
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:58,231
So I don't know.
I mean I look at romney and I feel like 

815
00:39:58,231 --> 00:40:00,670
I'm.
My biggest concern about a romney in the

816
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:05,671
senate is I think we just need somebody 
from Utah fighting for Utah and I think 

817
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:09,220
he's a national figure and I don't want,
I mean,

818
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,410
if romney does,
when the senate race,

819
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,470
people will notice now that many have 
said,

820
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,330
well,
romney is going to get a chairmanship,

821
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,460
or what is that realistic?

822
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,420
I don't think so.
I meAn,

823
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:24,421
I can't imagine a republican senator 
stepping aside for romney to come and 

824
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:24,421
take,
you know,

825
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,130
It also gets to the heart of what you 
think the problem is.

826
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,010
It's like you're trying to get a guy to 
get in there for Utah and it's like,

827
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:30,820
oh,
congratulations.

828
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:31,300
He,
yes,

829
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:33,070
it's nice to get those powerful 
positions,

830
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:36,130
but that's not the position now to help 
your state the most.

831
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,050
Yeah.
So I'm from your tie.

832
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,510
I know you tie work in the state.
Uh,

833
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:41,650
I,
I love it.

834
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,710
I've lived there except for my time in 
graduate school and my time working on 

835
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,010
the hill and the nineties.
I've lived there my entire life.

836
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:51,850
I'm raising two children there.
I'm first generation your time,

837
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,670
uh,
and I recreate there.

838
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,560
I enjoy it.
I love the state.

839
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,710
Do,
do you think that feeling was what 

840
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:01,710
caused him not to win the,
uh,

841
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,770
the convention?

842
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,850
Well,
it um,

843
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,240
because carpet bagging it kinda,
you know,

844
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:12,241
hillary was,
if we're going to use it was a guard 

845
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:12,900
beggar.
She was from Arkansas and you know,

846
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,990
when he got in I did.
I didn't actually thought warren hatch 

847
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,001
would run again because he loves the 
senate and he doesn't know anything 

848
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,930
else,
so I thought he might run again and um,

849
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:27,931
when he didn't,
it just didn't make sense to me knowing 

850
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:29,800
that I'm at the sunset of his career,
he's had,

851
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,950
you know,
a very successful career financially and

852
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,950
got kids and grandkids and I figured,
hey,

853
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:40,880
at that point in my life I'd be like 
looking to relax a little bit.

854
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:45,881
So it didn't seem to make sense.
And I think people when I worried a 

855
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:47,570
little as a candidate like,
oh my goodness,

856
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,150
it was mitt romney,
am I even going to keep the lights on in

857
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:51,380
the campaign headquarters?

858
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,800
And what I found is that people are 
asking that question.

859
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:55,560
Yeah.
How,

860
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,400
how long has he lived here?
People are even saying,

861
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,440
does he meet residency,
which he does.

862
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:03,650
He's been in Utah long enough now again.
Um,

863
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,680
but I,
I do think that there are people 

864
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:08,680
wondering,
you know,

865
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,050
what is,
why,

866
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:14,170
why the mitt romney candidacy and that 
may have been part of the reason that 

867
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,460
this division occurred within the 
republican party.

868
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,620
It's an interesting place as a democrat 
because he's so successful as a 

869
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,051
businessman and generally democrats want
attacks businessman more,

870
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,990
which is something you've already 
alluded to here.

871
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,430
And yet at the same time you're also 
saying that he ran the olympic thing and

872
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:39,431
the budget's pretty well.
So it's like there's some piece that 

873
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:43,631
makes that a ton more.
I just don't want to give away more.

874
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,650
I mean,
going back to this tax bill,

875
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:48,920
if we had the one chance to reform,
I wanted it done differently,

876
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,470
but I do think that,
um,

877
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,410
you know,
it's,

878
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,740
we'll just see if the public,
if you tie aligns with mitt romney 

879
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:01,340
candidacy.

880
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,720
I fundamentally believe in balance in my
state and that's what I've been fighting

881
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:06,860
for and I,
you know,

882
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:11,861
in my day life as a county elected,
I'll work on canyon protection or you 

883
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:17,381
know,
advancing a development or protecting 

884
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:19,070
our water and our air.
I'll do all of those things,

885
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:23,810
but I fundamentally am really fighting 
as a democrat for balance and it because

886
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:26,930
I think it's really critical to,
um,

887
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,800
a less corrupt system,
a more even playing field.

888
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,760
All voices heard in the system.
We don't have a lot of women in politics

889
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:35,920
in Utah,
um,

890
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,660
when a lot of women in politics anywhere
including the us senate.

891
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,960
So I think getting more diversity,
more diverse voices in is really 

892
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,101
important.
Those are the things I care quite a bit 

893
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:50,621
about and we'll see if the,
my vision for the state resonates with 

894
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:54,641
people versus romneys.
And I'm glad you mentioned that because 

895
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:57,671
one of my biggest issues right now with 
the democrats and with the left and 

896
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:01,661
especially with the progressive than my 
whole audience know this because I beat 

897
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:01,730
this thing endlessly is identity 
politics.

898
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,590
That you shouldn't be voting for a woman
just because she's a woman.

899
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,600
You shouldn't be voting for a black 
person just because they're black or 

900
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,270
white prison because they're white or 
any of those ridiculous things.

901
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,490
When you talk about that sort of 
diversity,

902
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:15,530
I think you sort of said it both ways.
They're like,

903
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,600
you want some more women,
which ended up itself.

904
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:21,680
Of course it's not a Bad thing,
but that one I think always gets lost in

905
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:26,681
that is diversity of thought and that's 
what I'm more concerned about and I 

906
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:29,780
don't see anyone talking about that on 
a,

907
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,060
on the left anymore.
Well,

908
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,940
I don't know that I'm put jenny wilson,
democrat in x county council seat.

909
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,350
Take my colleague,
jim bradley.

910
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:39,990
I don't know that jim's better edison 
elected than.

911
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:44,991
I wouldn't say he.
He or I are better because of our 

912
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:45,540
gender,
but I do judge you on your ideas.

913
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,770
I mean that's the point,
right?

914
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,800
But I do think what is preventing when 
women make up 50 percent of the 

915
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,490
population,
women from being in the pipeline,

916
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,820
that's what we have to get out and we 
have to figure out why we don't have 

917
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,750
that.
I mean,

918
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,780
because ideally in a given body we would
see 50 slash 50.

919
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:08,160
now we are seeing a lot more women step 
up in this era and we saw it in Utah and

920
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:09,820
they weren't all progressive.
Um,

921
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,040
we have a new mayor,
female of provo,

922
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,530
Utah,
which is the heart of a very,

923
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:18,920
very conservative conservative area.
The hummer,

924
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,930
brigham young university.
We have a woman at a small town not far 

925
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,010
from salt lake city where I'm from,
to wIlla,

926
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:27,780
Utah.
And I think that's great,

927
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,440
but you hadn't seen that as often in the
state of Utah,

928
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:34,140
which is um,
mainly caucasian,

929
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,900
caucasian men typically over 60.
Right?

930
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:42,230
So I think that the voice of our 
community is beyond that one segment.

931
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,290
So that's where I want to see people 
say,

932
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:51,291
hey,
what is it that would get me to step up 

933
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,980
to be considered within the system?

934
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,650
Do you think some of that is not just 
that it's just like old crusty white men

935
00:45:57,651 --> 00:46:01,090
doing it because I just think that's a,
I just think it's too sort,

936
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:06,091
sorta too easy to lay it on that,
that perhaps also that women are 

937
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:06,140
interested in other things at some 
level,

938
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,180
like the idea that we'd ever get it to 
50 slash 50 or that it should be 50 

939
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,100
slash 50.
That seems lIke very strange engineering

940
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:18,101
of things like if,
if these women are qualified and have 

941
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:19,130
the right ideas and all that and it ends
up being 70 percent women,

942
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:21,000
30 percent men.
I think that's it.

943
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,450
I just don't care what it is other than 
the ideas.

944
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:26,990
But there's something that when you,
when people talk about what we should,

945
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:28,580
you know,
it's like we should have this represent.

946
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,650
They represent this amount of the 
population.

947
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:35,651
If you're talking about an ethnicity,
they should have this amount of 

948
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:37,931
representation in politics that seems 
incredibly dangerous and actually 

949
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:38,030
prejudice to me.

950
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,960
Well,
I just think that you have to look at,

951
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,510
um,
barriers for participation.

952
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:48,511
I mean,
the good news is we're seeing a lot of 

953
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:48,511
women have graduated from college now 
for the first time,

954
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:50,530
so maybe that will change over time.
Right?

955
00:46:50,531 --> 00:46:55,531
We're,
but I do think there's something to be 

956
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:57,421
said for reform and change and um,
I think maybe we just disagree on this 

957
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:01,240
point,
but I love to see more people reflecting

958
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,920
the percentages of our community serving
in government because I think I'm having

959
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,560
more voices for people who have lived a 
certain way or have,

960
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,330
have some understanding of the,
um,

961
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,360
you know,
individual or kind of collective need 

962
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,360
within a given community.

963
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,360
Yeah.
So that,

964
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,540
that part I think We probably have to 
disagree.

965
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,850
Agree to disagree on.
I'm the sort of collective need,

966
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,860
hey,
like I want it to be very clear that I 

967
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,151
don't,
not every woman in the state of Utah 

968
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:33,151
needs to want to run for the us senate 
for goodness sakes.

969
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:37,861
Right.
I value women who choose to raise her 

970
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:39,910
children at home and have that option 
within their family and that,

971
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:40,730
you know,
I,

972
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,440
my kids kind of tease me because I 
missed sort of half a cook.

973
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:49,441
I'm not a very good and I looked at this
woman who I had are making like their 

974
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:50,570
home and,
and,

975
00:47:50,571 --> 00:47:53,560
and their,
their environment for their family,

976
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:58,561
just incredibly rich and interesting 
through the commitment they make and 

977
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:03,481
that way and I don't for a minute take 
anything away from that because I 

978
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:07,291
haven't taken a different path and I try
my best and we have an abandoned my 

979
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,240
children by any means.
But yeah.

980
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,670
Yeah,
I mean I,

981
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:12,880
I,

982
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,560
I understand that for sure.
I mean my mom,

983
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:21,130
I have two siblings so we have three 
kids in my family and my parents were 

984
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,280
married over 40 years.
My mom worked before she had kids,

985
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:27,281
but then in all of our formative years 
she didn't and my dad was the sole 

986
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:30,701
breadwinner,
but then after my sister who's the 

987
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:30,920
youngest got to a certain age,
my mom went back to work.

988
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,950
I look back on those years of my mom 
being around and cook.

989
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,570
We know we always had dinner at 6:00
and all that stuff.

990
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:43,571
Like I look at that as great and yet 
there's a certain segment of society 

991
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:43,571
that kind of looks down on that and I 
think that's so,

992
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,730
yeah,
and I think it's impressive and 

993
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,390
wonderful if stats,
but I think that the point is that every

994
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:55,391
child,
he or she should grow up being whatever 

995
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:55,760
they want to be and have,
you know,

996
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:01,510
have a right to the american dream.
And if in the american dream is staying 

997
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,190
home and raising your kids and you're 
able to do that financially,

998
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,560
then that's amazing.
If it's like me,

999
00:49:06,561 --> 00:49:08,480
you know,
I want to make a difference in politics.

1000
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,510
I've had that advantage in my life to be
given,

1001
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,500
um,
you know,

1002
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,140
a platform to get there.
And I think that's great.

1003
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,530
So I would hope that for a young woman 
who,

1004
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,650
uh,
is high school or getting into college,

1005
00:49:21,651 --> 00:49:24,770
who aspires to do that,
that there won't be barriers in her way,

1006
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:29,771
that she will be able to sit here with 
you and a few years and you'll be able 

1007
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:30,670
to say,
I remember that jenny wilson,

1008
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:32,420
she,
she was written for you cracking.

1009
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,680
That's what it's all about.
Believing in equality of opportunity 

1010
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,780
that everyone has the exact same 
opportunities.

1011
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,280
I am completely on board with you.
Um,

1012
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,560
anything else we should know about Utah?
We briefly tAlked about just the sort of

1013
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,210
demographic

1014
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,330
we have to come visit.
I told him,

1015
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:50,890
I know I've never been to.
I can,

1016
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,400
I can't believe that.
Like most people that I meet to have 

1017
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,740
been there a good skier to ski.
We have five national parks.

1018
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:04,770
you can access our national parks 
through vegas or Arizona or salt lake 

1019
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,280
city,
four or five hour drive south.

1020
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,070
Um,
we have amazing national parks.

1021
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,450
We have an agricultural area north up by
the Idaho border,

1022
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,280
which is pretty amazing.
A lot of um,

1023
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,780
somewhat barren land around the great 
salt lake area.

1024
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,080
Um,
you need to fly over the lake because 

1025
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,791
it's like,
you think you're on mars and there's 

1026
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:26,860
some water.
It looks very,

1027
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,010
very different.

1028
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,400
The landscape.
Yeah.

1029
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:29,960
Cool.
Well,

1030
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,490
it's been a pleasure talking to you.
I wish you luck.

1031
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,520
As we said,
you've got an uphill battle here in a 

1032
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,231
state that is not the color that you are
because everyone's obsessed with this 

1033
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:39,200
silly,
a blue and red stuff.

1034
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,260
