1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,503
One of the reasons I like doing long 
form interviews is that I can really 

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,220
focus in on important issues with my 
guests.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,030
In many cases,
the issues are inextricably connected,

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,250
making it easy to go from topic to 
topic.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,440
If we're talking about political 
correctness,

6
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,720
that's a pretty easy jump to free 
speech,

7
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,870
which is then another easy jump to the 
regressive left.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,170
Sometimes these jumps just appear when 
I'm not looking for them,

9
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,004
and that's usually when the 
conversations get really good is the 

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,300
spaces where you have to think that are 
the breeding ground to spark new ideas.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,183
My guest this week is civil rights 
attorney and legal expert or Reba 

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,233
Martin.
I've done the Dr drew show on Hln 

13
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,740
several times with Reba and always find 
her to be incisive,

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,180
thought provoking,
and passionate.

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,430
While we've appeared together several 
times.

16
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,264
This will be the first time we really 
get to flesh out some ideas in a long 

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,430
form way without worrying about a 
commercial break.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,600
A rib and I are going to dive into a ton
of hot topics and big ideas.

19
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,434
This week we're going to discuss 
everything from the black lives matter 

20
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:03,030
movement to the war on drugs to the 
Oscars,

21
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,864
so white controversy as a Harvard 
educated black woman who founded and 

22
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,570
manages her own very successful law 
firm.

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,613
I don't think I could find a better 
person to tackle so many important 

24
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,930
issues with and arriva.
You see what just happened there?

25
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,420
I just played some identity politics,
didn't I?

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,690
Arriva happens to be black and happens 
to be a woman,

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,763
but in reality,
how is that important to our 

28
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,770
conversation?
Actually,

29
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,604
I don't really think it is.
I assume some of her views are based on 

30
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,630
her own personal experiences,
but what I care about are her ideas,

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,900
not the color of her skin or her gender.
We really have to get over the idea that

32
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,224
by looking at someone,
you can figure out what they're all 

33
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,810
about.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,643
I literally could not care less about 
someone's skin color or their religion 

35
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,660
or their sexuality.
What I care about is their ideas.

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,910
What do they believe?
Why do they believe it?

37
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,410
Are they right?
Are they wrong?

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,300
What kind of world are they trying to 
create?

39
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,570
That is simply all that matters to me.
There are black conservatives out there,

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,683
there are Mexican Libertarians,
there are Lesbian Christians and there 

41
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,364
are cis gendered,
blue haired video game playing bisexual 

42
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,644
quakers,
and if you care about all those labels 

43
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,930
more than the ideas that the people 
themselves believe in,

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,570
then you are actually part of the 
problem.

45
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,703
If you truly care about minorities,
then you have to care about minorities 

46
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,310
within those minorities.
If you truly care about diversity,

47
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,540
then you have to acknowledge diversity 
within diversity itself.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,320
We should be defined by what we believe,
not prejudged by people's assumptions as

49
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,650
a wise man.
Once said,

50
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,860
when you assume you make an ass out of 
you and me,

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,540
my guest this week is a civil rights 
attorney,

52
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,374
legal expert,
and you may have seen us on Dr drew's 

53
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,250
couch together,
or Eva Martin.

54
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,084
Welcome to the show.

55
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,530
Good to be here.
You know,

56
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,710
from sitting next to each other to 
sitting across from each other.

57
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,993
This is,
it seems that we're going to be 

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,070
adversaries because we're

59
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,080
usually on a couch right next to each 
other.

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,160
We get some legs touch.

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,793
It helps with some of the crazies that 
come on that show and really make it 

62
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,124
difficult for people.
I think like you and I who have really 

63
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,840
intelligent and smart things to say,

64
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,201
wow,
we're,

65
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,080
we're,
uh,

66
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,150
building each other up just as we start 
here.

67
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,450
But that's exactly what I wanted to have
you on the show because we've been on Dr

68
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,230
drew a couple of times together and I 
always find you,

69
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,240
you're extremely passionate and you know
your stuff.

70
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,030
And I find there's so many people in 
television,

71
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:35,770
especially in Cable News and on the 
cable channels that are just yelling and

72
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,590
screaming about stuff but aren't really 
experts.

73
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,120
I can tell you,
and not to brag about my background,

74
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:46,220
but you know,
when you think of an expert,

75
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,240
you really want the person.
I have some credentials that really make

76
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:51,074
them an expert and I can't tell you how 
many times on these shows I've sat next 

77
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:55,970
to someone.
I'm having a conversation,

78
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:56,661
I want to go,
you know what?

79
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm sorry.
I am fifth grade.

80
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,070
It just drives me crazy.
But yes,

81
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:01,904
there's been this proliferation of quote
unquote experts because there's so many 

82
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:05,954
shows and it seems like if you are 
willing to say something so outrageous 

83
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,790
and to say it very loudly,
you can get booked on a show.

84
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,660
And that's what we see pretty routinely 
on a lot of these shows.

85
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,110
Yeah.
And that is again,

86
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,973
I mean that's why I love working with 
you because not only do you know your 

87
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,270
shit,
but you get right to it.

88
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,950
So then I'm sitting next to you and I'm 
thinking,

89
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:28,620
man,
if I just had that kind of just incisive

90
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,010
way of going at it.
So we're going to get into some stuff.

91
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,853
Well,
I've been working on TV for a while and 

92
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,434
I've had to perfect the soundbite 
because oftentimes you get 30 seconds 

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,820
and I tell you,
I start checking the news at five.

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,713
I read seven,
eight newspapers throughout the day and 

95
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,054
I'll get a call.
And it's some complex issues that I've 

96
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:49,684
got to go on and talk to millions of 
viewers to make them understand 

97
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,723
sometimes very technical legal stuff.
And the reality is what's happening to 

98
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:58,484
the courtroom and a a difficult case,
a murder trial doesn't really play well 

99
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,180
when you're trying to reduce it to a 
32nd sound bite.

100
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,014
So you got to get kind of skilled and 
how to bring that very complex 

101
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:13,480
information to really digestible 
television viewers.

102
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,493
Yeah.
And that's exactly why I like doing the 

103
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:16,864
long form interview because now we have 
an hour or maybe a little bit more even 

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,140
to really get into some stuff,
really exchange some ideas.

105
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:23,570
So

106
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,403
for it,
because some of these topics are so big 

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,633
theater we spend all day talking about,
but yet you've got to reduce it to a 

108
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:32,900
sound bite.
So I love long form conversations

109
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,670
and we're,
we're in the right spot.

110
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:35,504
But before we get to the issues,
I want to do a little bit on your 

111
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:37,700
history.
So you are.

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,560
You're from St Louis originally,
right?

113
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:39,630
It

114
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,360
was right next to Ferguson,
Missouri.

115
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,860
So when we were all eyes on Ferguson 
with the Mike Brown shooting,

116
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:47,694
it was really personal for me because 
not only did I grow up in that 

117
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:50,664
community,
I knew so many of the people that were 

118
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,660
involved on the front lines doing the 
protest.

119
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,673
So when that happened,
that explosion in that community 

120
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,250
occurred really personally for me.
So yes,

121
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,590
from St Louis and went to college in 
Chicago,

122
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,010
University of Chicago.
Love Chicago.

123
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,490
Glad I'm not there this weekend though,
given the blizzard that's been just,

124
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,450
you know,
ravishing the comp a country,

125
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,390
you move the right direction.
I moved it right.

126
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,990
It's in the sunshine and then went onto 
Harvard.

127
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,820
Uh,
so I lived in Cambridge.

128
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,743
Uh,
unfortunately the patriots aren't going 

129
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,890
to.

130
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,690
Yeah.
And my husband's like

131
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,130
the Patriots,
but uh,

132
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,811
anyhow,
yeah.

133
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,644
So I went to Harvard,
then I actually worked in a corporate 

134
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:36,084
law firm.
I worked on Wall Street and I was in 

135
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:39,954
this major corporate law firm 
representing big fortune 500 companies 

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,850
and doing a lot of corporate law and I 
just got tired.

137
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,960
I just stuck.
It.

138
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:53,440
Didn't fit with my background,
didn't fit with you know,

139
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,280
who I had grown up to be and the people 
that had influenced me.

140
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,380
So I left.
I left is really,

141
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:59,460
really,
really,

142
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,061
really,
really,

143
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:01,410
really,
really good job.

144
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,263
Yeah.
Are you saying the corporate lawyers 

145
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,390
make a lot of money?
Is that what you're saying?

146
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,330
I left a good job with a lot of money 
and a lot of perks

147
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,810
and an office like on the 40th floor,
big.

148
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:17,230
It was amazing.
So imagine me calling St Louis family.

149
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,064
That's like just over the moon with 
happiness that first generation college 

150
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,520
graduate,
first generation Harvard lawyer,

151
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,743
big corporate law firm.
And now I'm leaving to go work with one 

152
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:34,280
other lawyer in this tiny little office 
on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.

153
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,680
Yeah.
Give up this huge salary.

154
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,240
Uh,
it didn't go over too well.

155
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,113
I can,

156
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,063
you must have felt incredible pressure 
because you had sort of accomplished a 

157
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,234
lot.
Not,

158
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,360
not that advanced in age.
And then you say,

159
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,980
all right,
I'm going to step away from it.

160
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,280
Isn't that sort of what it's all about 
really what life is all about?

161
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,810
And I think it is,
and I think that

162
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,890
folks who find the most happiness in 
their careers is because they've taken a

163
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,990
risk and they really follow their 
instincts.

164
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,824
They follow their intuition,
they don't do what's on the kind of the 

165
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,783
path that's been laid out for them.
And if you go to Harvard and you're in 

166
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,173
the top of your class,
your path is supposed to be either you 

167
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:15,911
become a supreme court clerk and you go 
on to be a judge or you go and you run a

168
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,030
corporate law for.
You start off as an associate,

169
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:23,720
you become a partner and you make a ton 
of money and that's a great life.

170
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,360
And having lots of friends that do that.
So I'm not saying there's anything wrong

171
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,194
with that,
right?

172
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,540
They have a great lifestyles,
but it just wasn't who I was at my core.

173
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,970
I wanted to have more control of who I 
represented.

174
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,163
I wanted to represent little people.
I want it to be involved in issues that 

175
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,514
really mattered to me.
And I just wanted something different 

176
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,690
for my career.
So I had no husband,

177
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,063
had no mortgage and no kids.
So you could walk away from a big job 

178
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,410
like that when you don't have all of 
those responsibilities.

179
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,140
Yeah.
And now you have a husband.

180
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,003
Oh my God.
You have a law that you run with your 

181
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,754
husband,
correct?

182
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,613
Yes.
And you have three kids and all of this 

183
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,550
stuff.
So you're doing a lot of fun.

184
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,713
But I'm happy about it.
And about seven years ago I decided I 

185
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,740
wanted to step away from my courtroom 
practice.

186
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:07,574
I was a trial lawyer and I wanted to 
have a greater impact and I had this 

187
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:11,534
amazing case,
a amazing because I was representing 

188
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,950
these great families.
Horrible thing had happened to them.

189
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:19,510
Their kids had been abused of the 
classroom,

190
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:24,511
some nonverbal autistic kids abusing the
classroom by this just criminal teacher.

191
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:26,790
Really.
Uh,

192
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,380
and they called me from Las Vegas and 
asked me to come and represent them.

193
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:33,260
And I did that.
And Dr Phil was very interested in their

194
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,094
story and invited my clients and then me
as a result of representing them onto 

195
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,490
his show.
And I got there.

196
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,324
I loved having an opportunity to raise 
awareness about an issue I cared about 

197
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:46,940
and break down,
you know,

198
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,853
what had happened legally and why this 
teacher was being prosecuted and that 

199
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:52,484
began my TV career and I've been working
in TV ever since that one appearance on 

200
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:57,910
Dr Phil.

201
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,721
Yeah,
and even that,

202
00:09:58,721 --> 00:09:59,860
we're going to get to this a little 
later,

203
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:04,270
but even having a case involving autism,
you've written a book about autism.

204
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,104
Your your son has autism.
I don't like saying is autistic because 

205
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,820
it seems very defining versus has 
autism.

206
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,170
It's just a piece of who he is a so that
even that right there,

207
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,004
it's a nice way to start your adventure 
sorta because it was something that was 

208
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,823
very important to you.

209
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,890
Yeah,
and you're right.

210
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:23,750
I did write a book because I was 
frustrated.

211
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,643
I didn't like what was out there.
I was too hard to figure out how to you 

212
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,190
get the best education.
How do you get the best healthcare,

213
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,810
and I said,
this is crazy.

214
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,410
I'm a Harvard trained lawyer and I'm 
having such a difficult time.

215
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,030
What about the mom who has four or five 
kids at home,

216
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:41,864
maybe working two jobs and doesn't have 
the time to sit on the Internet all day 

217
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:47,120
like I did,
and search for this information.

218
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:50,450
So I wrote a book called the everyday 
advocate standing up for your child with

219
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:51,284
autism and other special needs to really
bring a lot of the information that I 

220
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:55,934
had learned as a parent and as an 
advocate and as a lawyer into one place 

221
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,363
that apparent a professional could go 
and get the help that they need for 

222
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:04,844
their child or grandchild or whatever.
So really just tried to make that 

223
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,890
journey a little easier for parents.

224
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,651
Okay.
All right,

225
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,630
well we're going to dive a little deeper
into that in a bit,

226
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,130
but let.
Let's knock out some issues.

227
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:14,964
Okay.
So you already brought up the first 

228
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,970
thing that I wanted to discuss with you,
which is black lives matter.

229
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,550
So as you said,
you're from St Louis,

230
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:23,250
right next to Ferguson.
You know this area.

231
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:25,740
A couple of weeks ago I had larry elder 
on who is,

232
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,110
who is the eye roll already.
Was that side eye or eye roll?

233
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:31,820
It was

234
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,690
fit on his radio show.
We've debated these issues a lot.

235
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,570
Uh,
I don't understand Larry,

236
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,740
to be honest with you.
Bright Guy,

237
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,810
lawyer,
a turn,

238
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,153
talk show hosts radio talk show host.
But his views are the most extreme 

239
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:50,360
views.
I can't even imagine where he got them.

240
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,710
So,
so I don't wanna I don't wanna make this

241
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,460
about him.
It's not necessary,

242
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,200
but the reason I mentioned it is because
a why I liked doing the shows.

243
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,043
I want to talk to people that believe 
one thing and somebody that believes 

244
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,164
something else.
So that's a great place for us to start 

245
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,550
because basically his take,
I don't want to put words in his mouth,

246
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,384
but to paraphrase him was he felt that 
there really is no more systemic racism 

247
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:12,424
in the United States and that,
that really the struggle for the black 

248
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:18,700
community is because of the breakdown of
the family.

249
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,953
So if you want to address that a little 
bit and then we can dive right into 

250
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:25,520
really the nuts and bolts of the stupid.
I thought

251
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,060
really it can be more articulate about 
it,

252
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:28,894
but I'm just going to say that's stupid 
a to say there's no longer systemic 

253
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:38,740
racism.
Just ignore so much data,

254
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,740
so many statistics,
so many reports,

255
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,420
uh,
just,

256
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,490
it ignores the fact that ignores the 
reality and conservatives like Larry,

257
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,713
like to deflect from those issues 
because if they can blame it on the 

258
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,204
family,
if they can blame it on the victims and 

259
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,750
they don't have to accept any 
responsibility.

260
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,470
But the reality is the criminal justice 
system,

261
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:03,304
let's just start there.
Disproportionate number of African 

262
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,623
Americans and Latinos,
but particularly blacks who are 

263
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,620
incarcerated who have longer sentences,
who are treated differently,

264
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,454
everything from driving while black.
So who are racially profiled even when 

265
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,404
they drive their cars.
And we've seen so many examples of this 

266
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,540
from high profile people like Chris 
Rock.

267
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,490
Oh,
James Blake,

268
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:31,370
the tennis player who all have had some 
negative experience.

269
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:34,300
The President Eric holder,
when he was attorney general,

270
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:37,390
talked about him and his brother being 
stopped in,

271
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,100
in Washington.
So

272
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,220
Danny Glover,
something happened with Danny Glover.

273
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,080
He couldn't get a cab or something.

274
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,760
I don't think we could identify a black 
man serious,

275
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,653
whether they're high profile celebrity 
professional or just the guy on the 

276
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:53,754
street that hasn't had some negative 
experience with the police simply 

277
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:00,540
because of their race.
So when folks like Larry Talk about,

278
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,360
you know,
we're post racial society,

279
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,460
the facts are off.
There's this wrong.

280
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,410
So what would you say about the family 
part though?

281
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,570
Because there,
it seems to me that as I say on the show

282
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,340
all the time,
two things can be true at once.

283
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,640
So everything that you've said,
they're fully make sense to me,

284
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,850
but also that the breakdown of the 
family in general,

285
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,230
black,
white,

286
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,610
Asian,
green is,

287
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,050
is a problem that we have.

288
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,933
Well,
I don't know what he means when he says 

289
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:26,630
the breakdown of the family.
I think families have change.

290
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,190
So let's talk about two gay,
uh,

291
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,020
individuals who are now parents because 
they can't get married,

292
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,950
they can adopt the kid.
Don't go to depot.

293
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,550
Well,
okay.

294
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,000
Well the reality is the family today 
isn't the family of the 1950.

295
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,620
So when they say the breakdown of the 
family,

296
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,663
what family are they talking about?
Single moms are as common as two family 

297
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:51,770
households and are we to say that that's
a better structure?

298
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,783
So I'm not sure if even I buy into that 
assertion that there's been some 

299
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,320
breakdown.
I will agree.

300
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,190
There's been an evolution and families 
look very different today.

301
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,510
Interracial families couldn't exist for 
the 50 years ago.

302
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,643
Is that the breakdown of the family?
Because now you and I could be married 

303
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:09,644
and have kids.

304
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,740
Is that no longer?
Well,

305
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,460
you know what,
that could be the new thing,

306
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,060
but you and I could decide to have a 
child together,

307
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:20,894
right?
Sure.

308
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,590
Even though we're not married you in 
vitro.

309
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,470
I mean there's so many ways that 
families are created.

310
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:30,710
So when they say the breakdown,
what are they talking about it.

311
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,570
So I don't buy into that.
Alright,

312
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,920
good.
That's good to hear.

313
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,443
Alright,
so let's dive really into black lives 

314
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:39,710
matter.
As a movement,

315
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,180
what do you make of the General Movement
itself?

316
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,980
Do you feel that it's,
it's hitting the right tone.

317
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm going to say this and I'm going to 
get just slaughtered on social media.

318
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,783
Oh my God.
Somehow I become like the spokesperson 

319
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:55,940
for black lives matter,
even though,

320
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,100
you know,
they haven't enlisted me,

321
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,050
they haven't called me on the phone and 
asked me to do it,

322
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:03,650
but I find myself trying to give some 
context.

323
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,270
I think what black lives matter has done
has been nothing short of brilliant,

324
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,320
the issue of race and race politics in 
this country,

325
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,203
very complex and all hands on deck.
So I play a role as a civil rights 

326
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:18,674
attorney that represents families who 
have been the victims of any kind of 

327
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,504
police violence or they've had their 
rights violated their constitutional 

328
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:26,834
rights.
So I stepped in as a lawyer and I 

329
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,140
represent those people.
But then I,

330
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,900
I have this platform,
it gives a talk on television every week

331
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:36,890
about these high profile cases.
So I get to lend my voice to that.

332
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,110
Then there are these people who go out 
and they march and they protest and Hook

333
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,620
as a result of that.
So folks in the courtroom,

334
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
folks using their platform on 
television,

335
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,973
uh,
folks like Al Sharpton using his voice 

336
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:51,854
and then these protesters.
So now the issue of police profiling a 

337
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,253
police shootings of African Americans,
it's been elevated to this national 

338
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,630
level,
uh,

339
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,710
black lives matter have had audiences 
with Hillary Clinton,

340
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,210
Bernie Sanders.

341
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,253
It's come up in the presidential debate 
and I think we've got to give those 

342
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:15,650
protests or some credit for that 
because,

343
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,484
but for their activism,
this issue would not have become a part 

344
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:21,344
of the national dialogue that we're 
having about how do we make communities 

345
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,620
safer?
What did,

346
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,230
what did you make of the instance when 
the two protesters went up to Bernie's a

347
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,160
podium and basically grabbed the mic 
from him?

348
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,710
He sort of let them do it because a lot 
of people felt that that was like,

349
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,930
you know,
I talk about identity politics a lot and

350
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:39,764
that my problem with identity politics 
is I find everyone has to figure out 

351
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:44,540
who's the most aggrieved.
So your autumn,

352
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,960
Bernie is an ally obviously of the black
lives matter movement.

353
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,130
He's an ally of the other always.
But

354
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,950
if everyone is always looking out just 
for themselves,

355
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,090
then you have the right in your mind to 
grab the mic away from him.

356
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:59,040
Who even though he's as left as it's 
gonna,

357
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,720
get in politics in America

358
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,573
now to say that I support what black 
lives matter has done in terms of 

359
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,980
elevating this conversation to a 
national level.

360
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,620
It doesn't mean I agree with everything 
that you do.

361
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,430
What I like for them to approach Bernie 
differently.

362
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,323
Yeah.
Did I feel good about watching him try 

363
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:21,540
to figure out what do I do,
do I call security,

364
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,110
do I have them escorted and then kind of
what's unfair about that.

365
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,900
He didn't have secret service 
protection.

366
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,853
The reality is they wouldn't have even 
gotten here that microphone or a stage 

367
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:34,284
had that been Hillary Clinton or Donald 
Trump or any of the other candidates 

368
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:41,510
that trump has secret service,
but he has plenty of have security.

369
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,860
So the reality is Bernie in allowing 
himself to be open,

370
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,713
kind of left himself open to these hyper
protest or so I didn't like that bottom 

371
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:51,990
line.
I didn't like that,

372
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,020
but it doesn't take away from the 
overall efforts that they've had and the

373
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,650
successes that they've had.

374
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,143
But I do think that we have to get 
comfortable with this concept of 

375
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:09,651
disruption and that's what I think is so
upsetting to a lot of people.

376
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,004
Even African Americans,
even traditional African American civil 

377
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:17,130
rights leaders,
they want black lives matter to fit into

378
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:20,250
this box.
They want them to follow the mode of the

379
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,760
19 fifties and 19 sixties protestors.
And they're like,

380
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,670
hell no.
That's not who we are.

381
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,540
We're not looking for Martin Luther King
to come and save us and to lead us.

382
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,673
This is a movement of the people from 
the people and it's being done totally 

383
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,291
different.
So they.

384
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:41,291
They're not looking to organize in a way
that John Lewis and a lot of those civil

385
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,144
rights leaders did.
And I think that's a little unsettling 

386
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:45,270
for people.
They don't get it.

387
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,243
Yeah.
So that's an interesting sort of 

388
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:47,924
generational struggle.
Obviously John Lewis and Martin Luther 

389
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,890
King and Malcolm x and many other people
did things at different levels,

390
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:57,740
some on the ground,
some via speaking and all that.

391
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,670
And I find that this movement hasn't 
quite figured out what it is yet.

392
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,460
But I think your point is that that's 
part of,

393
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,383
that's part of it,
part of the magic that's the part of 

394
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:07,964
this new paradigm that literally you can
go on twitter and organize a thousand 

395
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:12,704
people to show up at a rally and 
sometimes at that rally it and my 

396
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:16,994
daughter has been so there was a big 
rally last year after Thanksgiving in 

397
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:22,610
Los Angeles and she says,
mom,

398
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,600
some people had this sign.
Some people had that sign.

399
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,463
There was really no organization.
I'm not even sure if people knew why 

400
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:32,440
they were there,
but he caught fire on facebook.

401
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,050
It caught fire on twitter and thousands 
of people showed up and I says,

402
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:37,920
well,
you have to get used to that.

403
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,893
That's a part of the unorganized nature 
of it is what makes it special and what 

404
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,140
makes it unique.
And yes,

405
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:48,220
some people were there for gay rights,
some people were for human rights,

406
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:49,750
some people were there for sex 
trafficking,

407
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,760
some people were there for police 
brutality.

408
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,120
I said,
but they were all people who were at the

409
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,240
end of the day just trying to make their
lives,

410
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,940
their communities,
the people they care about have a better

411
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,860
quality of life.
So for that I have,

412
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,203
so interestingly there could be sort of,
this could be the genesis of setting 

413
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,160
sort of much bigger because when you 
take all those people,

414
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,420
and again this is where my thing with 
identity politics is sort of interesting

415
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,254
because everyone's got their issue and 
yet they're coming together so that's 

416
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,450
good in itself,
but I'm afraid that that it allows for a

417
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,284
lot of issues to then just jump on top 
of each other when some of these things 

418
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:28,060
aren't necessarily connected,

419
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,410
but,
but what's the alternative?

420
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,000
And that's what I say to people.
Okay,

421
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,010
you don't like how black lives matter 
has address this police brutality issue,

422
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,773
which by the way,
you have to give them some credit for 

423
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,194
all of the legislation that's happening 
at the federal level and state by state 

424
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,063
requiring body cams.
California just passed a law now that 

425
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:54,130
says a special prosecutor has to be 
appointed if there is a police shooting.

426
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,173
So we,
we have seen the fruits of their labor 

427
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,670
and I say to people,
give me an alternative.

428
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,633
What,
what in your worldview at or if you 

429
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:07,660
could wave a magic wand,
how would it look?

430
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,583
Yeah,

431
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,401
I hear.
Yeah,

432
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:09,881
I,
yeah,

433
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:11,300
I don't think you're asking.
No,

434
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,350
I'm with you.
I find they're philosophically.

435
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,393
There's something to me that seems a 
little dangerous if everyone sort of 

436
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,340
jumping on the social,
the social justice things,

437
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,660
but I do hear you.

438
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,620
I don't,
I don't see anyone else.

439
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,480
And the black lives matter protesters 
that you talk about generation.

440
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,830
They said Al Sharpton and some of these 
other civil rights movements,

441
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,850
uh,
leaders,

442
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,150
what they do is fine.
They really are about grassroots there,

443
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:45,030
about local people,
indigenous leadership.

444
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,864
So people in their own communities 
standing up and demanding that they get 

445
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,300
a voice at the table when decisions are 
being made.

446
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:55,134
Like who's going to be the police chief?
Who's going to be the district attorney 

447
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,490
now,
what I would say is what I hope to see,

448
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:05,130
and I was disappointed in the midterm 
elections last time.

449
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
How do we translate all of this social 
activism into electoral politics?

450
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,010
How do we get those thousands of people 
that showed up for a rally?

451
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,760
How do we get them to vote in the 
election and beyond?

452
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,670
Yeah,
and you talk a lot about local politics.

453
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:20,504
So I can backing up for a sec.
I can't give you an example where I 

454
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,290
think it's a bit of a problem.
So for example,

455
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,303
what we're seeing on college campuses 
right now with free speech now I get 

456
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,860
that the,
the thrust of what they're doing,

457
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:33,530
they're standing up for social justice 
and they want equality.

458
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,240
We're not just talking about the black 
community,

459
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:39,140
the gay community where whoever it is.
So I understand the idea there.

460
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,330
Uh,
but then when you see the instances like

461
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:45,850
at Yale where they're shouting down this
professor and that they're,

462
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:47,870
you know,
they're demanding professors be fired.

463
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,823
It seems to me that we've created a 
situation here where the students are 

464
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:53,084
now dictating the policy,
which it seems a little backwards and I 

465
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,790
know that there's a lot of people in 
academia that are,

466
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,650
that are really afraid of where this is 
headed.

467
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,730
But they're 18,
they're 19,

468
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,340
and think about what,
what,

469
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,750
what should you be doing at college?
I think what those students are doing,

470
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,600
well you should exchanging ideas but not
demanding that professors be fired.

471
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,420
Why not?
If the professors are are racist and the

472
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:19,260
professors are not sensitive to the 
issue of inclusion and diversity,

473
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:20,670
why not them that they'd be fired.

474
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,170
Did you feel that that professor at 
Yale,

475
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,930
the,
the he,

476
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,763
he was the dean of that college and his 
wife had written the letter about the 

477
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:29,530
Halloween costumes.
I mean,

478
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,030
to me it was just,
you know,

479
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,440
if they don't want to.
Okay,

480
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,730
here's the problem for me

481
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,470
and any

482
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,803
transition,
anytime you're trying to transform an 

483
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:41,194
organization that has had systemic 
racial inequality and injustices for 

484
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:47,434
decades,
is somebody going to get somebody going 

485
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,300
to be sacrificed that perhaps really 
wasn't the person?

486
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:57,520
Are they going to be scapegoated?
Probably.

487
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,863
Yeah.
But why is a university like University 

488
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,370
of Missouri that all predominantly black
football team,

489
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,700
if they hadn't stood up and stood with 
the guy,

490
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:10,534
Johnathan Butler,
who went on the hunger strike if they 

491
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:15,220
hadn't stood up with those students?
I doubt

492
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,220
if Jonathan was still be on that hunger 
strike,

493
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:20,170
I'll be dead by now.
I doubt that unit.

494
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:23,320
Right.
So in that case nobody responded so but,

495
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,780
but why is it a public,
university of Missouri,

496
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:27,490
like seven percent,
five percent,

497
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,400
such a low percentage of African 
American students.

498
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,413
Why does it take us to get to the point 
where the students have to shout down 

499
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:35,794
the professors for the universities to 
look at themselves and say there's 

500
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,673
something wrong with this picture is not
reflective of the community where this 

501
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:43,534
school is.
And you remember that University of 

502
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,840
Missouri,
a president,

503
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:47,674
he's in his parade and he was so 
arrogant and he wouldn't even address 

504
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,940
those students.
So did he.

505
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:54,600
Did he end up stepping down?
They forced him out.

506
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,300
Absolutely.

507
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,600
So interestingly,
the Missouri and the yellow ones,

508
00:25:57,601 --> 00:25:59,100
which happened basically at the same 
time,

509
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,980
I see as to what,
to me at the Yale thing was,

510
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,540
was far worse than Missouri thing.
Yeah.

511
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:04,374
Had the mostly black football team not 
got involved then nothing would have 

512
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:09,420
happened.
So I do hear that.

513
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:11,490
But even in that instance,
you know,

514
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,710
there was that professor or a part time 
professor,

515
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:14,544
that woman who came out and got caught 
on camera saying we need some muscle 

516
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:20,160
here and then that isn't.
That is a free speech issue.

517
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,980
So I guess that goes to your earlier 
point,

518
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,640
which is you can be for a movement and 
that doesn't mean you agree with every,

519
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,893
every tech,

520
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,760
some of the tactics are not well thought
out.

521
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:32,080
But again,
that's why I said they're 18,

522
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:34,000
they're 19 years old.
This is their first.

523
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:38,410
Some of them first experience with any 
kind of unrest or any kind of protest.

524
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,483
So I wouldn't expect their thoughts to 
be as developed by their tactics to be 

525
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:48,270
as developed as you know,
somebody is 30 or 40 or beyond.

526
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:52,830
So I think we have to just accept that 
these are teenagers just kind of finding

527
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:57,060
their way in and young adults who were 
finding their way on some pretty complex

528
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,923
issues.
But I think more importantly for me is 

529
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,490
if I'm a university president,
why,

530
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,820
why I'd be more proactive on these 
issues.

531
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,743
Why aren't I addressing issues of 
diversity and inclusion before it 

532
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:12,414
bubbles up and now I have the kind of 
protest that we've seen on campuses 

533
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:15,954
across this country,
so I just don't think a lot of these 

534
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,100
folks have been very smart about the 
issue of diversity,

535
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,880
a diversity and inclusion,
and we could segue into the Oscars.

536
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,990
Very good example of that.

537
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,770
Let me throw in one other thing and then
we'll go ask,

538
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,913
but this is exactly why I wanted to talk
about this because I think that 

539
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:35,424
basically the bulk of the same people in
the middle of this country pretty much 

540
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:40,254
see these things in a similar way,
but even just what we're doing right 

541
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:44,520
now,
it shows that there are,

542
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,940
there are different ways of looking at 
it doesn't mean someone else's racist or

543
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:48,774
someone else's automatically a bigot or 
something that we're so used to using 

544
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,700
those words.
So that's,

545
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,970
that's why.
That's why I wanted to unfurl somebody

546
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,580
times.
Unfortunately we can't sit down.

547
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,503
Yeah.
Well that's what kind of dialogue 

548
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,540
because those words that you use just 
shuts the conversation down.

549
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,413
Yeah.
So one of one other piece on this and 

550
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,870
then we'll move to the Oscars is my 
guest last week,

551
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:10,240
Michael Shermer,
who is a thinker and a skeptic.

552
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,270
He made an interesting point about the 
college thing where he said to me,

553
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,070
you know,
if these kids at Yale,

554
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:15,904
if at this point what they're protesting
about his halloween costumes that might 

555
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:20,704
offend them,
then that actually shows great progress 

556
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:24,364
in society because of the things that 
they would have had to protest 30 years 

557
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:27,994
ago.
And I thought that actually gave me a 

558
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:30,244
little bit of a.
It was a nice feeling to sort of take 

559
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:35,950
away from this that it doesn't mean that
problems don't exist,

560
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,750
but it means that we actually have moved
forward in society and we don't.

561
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,643
We don't.
I think sometimes we don't stop and 

562
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:42,970
acknowledge.

563
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,803
Yeah.
And I think Obama did a great job of 

564
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:50,191
that when they had the march on the John
Pettus bridge in Selma and he says,

565
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,350
as much work as there is to do on the 
question of race in America,

566
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:00,640
we cannot lose sight of the tremendous 
progress that has been made.

567
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:03,460
So I would agree with Michael on that 
point that yes,

568
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,593
they weren't protesting because they 
couldn't eat in the same cafeteria or 

569
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:10,780
drink from the same water fountain as 
the white students.

570
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,270
Now the issues of race and they've 
changed.

571
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,560
They are there,
they're more subtle.

572
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,693
Uh,
they're more in some ways in city is 

573
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:18,274
because they're not overt.
So the colored only signs made it real 

574
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:23,950
clear what our mission was,
you know,

575
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:26,740
there wasn't much dispute about that.
But now you're right,

576
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:27,574
because even again,
African Americans are often divided on 

577
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:30,754
this question and I've sat on drew's 
couch with some conservative African 

578
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,270
Americans who say like,
Larry,

579
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,110
what are they complaining about?
They,

580
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,630
they were in the college,
uh,

581
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,760
work hard,
get good grades and everything will work

582
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:47,560
out.
So the people aren't,

583
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,320
you know,
speaking from one voice on this issue of

584
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,870
race because it's important.

585
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,140
Yeah.
So I know I said last thing,

586
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,730
but I'm gonna throw in one more.
Just jumping off that.

587
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:57,030
So what,
what do you make in general of,

588
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,953
of black conservatives?
Because I'm friends with a few black 

589
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:00,820
conservatives,
David Webb,

590
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:04,720
who's a Sirius xm host,
who is a Fox News contributor,

591
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,703
is a good friend of mine.
We worked together at Sirius and I know 

592
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,520
that he,
I know him extremely well and I,

593
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,680
you know,
we've had drinks together.

594
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:14,920
We make dinner together.
I know that he believes what he's saying

595
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,760
and,
and when I see what people say about him

596
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,840
online,
you know,

597
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:23,770
uncle Tom and we could go through the 
list of things that people say,

598
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,260
um,
wh,

599
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,160
what do you make of people like that?

600
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,780
First of all,
I think David and any black Republican,

601
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:32,730
conservative,
however they identify themselves,

602
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,553
they're perfectly within their right to 
have the opinions that they have about 

603
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,833
race and politics and,
and to identify with the GOP party or 

604
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,524
the independent party or whatever party.
So I don't come from a place that 

605
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:50,100
because you're black,
you have to agree with everything that I

606
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:55,101
believe in or because you're gay or you 
know that there is no monolithic thought

607
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,093
in any of these communities.
That people have different points of 

608
00:30:59,101 --> 00:30:59,934
views.
And I like a conversation where all of 

609
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:06,030
those points of views have an 
opportunity to present themselves and to

610
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:06,864
be a part of the conversation.
I don't think that because David or 

611
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:10,944
Larry or any of those conservatives have
their view about the family that that 

612
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,810
view is any less significant than my 
view because I don't see it the way they

613
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,790
see it doesn't mean that their points on
important.

614
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,990
So I like debating those guys.
I like talking to those guys and I think

615
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:29,340
it's a mistake to try to shut their 
speech down or to try to silence them.

616
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,170
The silence who,
you know,

617
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,080
some people call these lefties,
these super progressive.

618
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,543
So no,
I,

619
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,110
yeah,
I'm not thrilled with those guys either,

620
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:38,944
but bring it on a whole other topic.
This is a perfect segway now to the 

621
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:46,990
Oscars so white situation because Fox 
News had stacey dash on who is black and

622
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,480
she was saying to the black community,
she was just like,

623
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:51,850
get over it that this is not an 
important thing.

624
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:55,620
So that we have decided that we all take
a deal and give.

625
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,490
We will take you.
That's a fair trade.

626
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,340
Basically our number one white person 
right now,

627
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,730
and you're good.
You can take.

628
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,700
Stacy was in one movie,
I think in 1995.

629
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,290
Clueless.
That's what we're getting.

630
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,640
Can we get a draft pick or we want to 
Dale,

631
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,870
you know,
everyone wants a deal that was

632
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,493
on black twitter.
So just the power of social media space 

633
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,063
is entitled to her opinion.
And I don't necessarily put stacy in 

634
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,240
this category.
I don't know her personally,

635
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,074
but there are people of every race,
every persuasion that have branded 

636
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,640
themselves as we started this 
conversation as experts,

637
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,773
they like the attention that they get 
from saying outlandish things that they 

638
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:48,590
like to be provocative on topics.
I don't know if this is her,

639
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,850
like I said,
I know her personally,

640
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,360
but I do know because I sit in this 
chair and I sit on these shows,

641
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,253
you know,
four or five times a week and some of 

642
00:32:56,091 --> 00:33:01,091
these folks I know that they're 
intentionally trying to be provocative,

643
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,780
but she may believe that African 
Americans should get over it.

644
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,614
I say again to her.
She's misguided in her thoughts and her 

645
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:10,160
statements.
Uh,

646
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:13,190
and you have to look at the history.
None of this happens in a vacuum.

647
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,880
And for those folks who say,
or what about the naacp image awards,

648
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:19,310
they're all black.
And what about bt?

649
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,144
It's all black.
Why are white actors complaining about 

650
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:23,941
that?
And I say,

651
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:25,820
well,
his look at the history,

652
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,800
why is there an NAACP?
Why are there Naacp Image Award?

653
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,551
Right?
I mean I,

654
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,384
look,
I have no problem with her saying 

655
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:33,681
whatever she,
I,

656
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:34,840
if she believes it,
look,

657
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,010
even if she's just saying it to say it 
because she's on television,

658
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,740
that's part of the game at some level as
you're saying.

659
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,780
And if she believes it,
then she believes it.

660
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,943
I thought the one part that was a little
odd really was that she said that we 

661
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:50,330
shouldn't have a black history month,
which every part of our culture,

662
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:52,070
everything.
We should have a black history month and

663
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,490
we should have a Latino history month 
then probably going to get history,

664
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,590
do away with everything that identifies 
or a celebration.

665
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,620
Yeah.
One's culture.

666
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,940
Let's start with Columbus Day.
Alright.

667
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,050
So Oscar,
so white here.

668
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:07,900
So here we go.
So there is a big Brouhaha right now,

669
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:09,550
we got a Hashtag on twitter,
gone,

670
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,673
uh,
and a lot of the black community is not 

671
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:14,340
happy about this.
Um,

672
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,150
I should say right up front that Chris 
Rock,

673
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:16,984
the guy who's going to host the thing,
we said he's still going to host it is 

674
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:21,080
black.
The president of the academy is Black,

675
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,600
but I think 94 percent of the voters are
white.

676
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,540
I hope I'm getting that 94 percent of 
the academy.

677
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,374
The academy,
Seventy seven percent of the voters are 

678
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:32,330
white male.
Yeah.

679
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,660
So okay.
So there are some numbers now.

680
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,494
I also saw some numbers that were that 
since 2000 that pretty much it's been 

681
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,344
about a that the black community America
is about 10 percent or about 12 percent 

682
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,920
and they've gotten about 10 percent of 
the nomination,

683
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,320
so that since 2000 that it basically 
works out.

684
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,360
So I'm just throwing out some numbers to
start.

685
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,440
How do you feel about that?
So

686
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,380
I think that again,
I love protests.

687
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,350
Let me just start here.
You can tell that you're telling because

688
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,750
it works.
So Cheryl Boone Isaacs came out and said

689
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,480
change needs to happen,
but it needs to happen faster.

690
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,340
She was frustrated,
she was heartbroken.

691
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,103
A Jade Pinkett Smith did her facebook 
video to her 7 million viewers a and we 

692
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,460
have spike Lee make his statement and 
guess what happened?

693
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,413
There was an emergency meeting on the 
agenda was this issue of diversity for 

694
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:26,944
the academy and out of that emergency 
meeting came some commitments that were 

695
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:31,654
pretty significant.
Like we're going to diversify our 

696
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:36,970
membership by 20,
20,

697
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,823
we're going to add more women,
we're going to add more minorities and 

698
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:41,694
we're going to make the issue of 
diversity a bigger issue for the 

699
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:47,340
academy.
And it makes sense.

700
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,301
You know,
I didn't tell you this,

701
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:52,140
I went to Harvard for law school,
but my major in college was economics.

702
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,870
So some of this stuff just boils down to
money.

703
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,620
So you want it to be an actress.
I'm an economics major.

704
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,454
So look at the facts here.
Last year they said the ratings down 16 

705
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:05,394
percent and a lot of that was attributed
to last year when there were no black 

706
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,230
nominees.
And that Hashtag trended Oscar.

707
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:14,220
So White,
the Oscars Cheryl,

708
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,750
they got a job to do it at the end of 
the day,

709
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:20,640
they got to sell a television program to
one network and the network has to bring

710
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:23,670
in sponsors and advertisers to make a 
lot of money.

711
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,813
So imagine if that 16 percent grew to 25
percent because high profile African 

712
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:30,484
Americans like Spike Lee and will smith 
and Marlon Wayans and Jaden Pinkett 

713
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,770
Smith all said,
I'm not going to watch.

714
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,810
I'm not attending.

715
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,663
And to that point,
if there were more black people 

716
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:41,974
nominated,
it's not like suddenly white people 

717
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:43,051
would be like,
oh,

718
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:43,884
I'm not watching this.
There were some more black nominees is 

719
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:46,984
ridiculous.
But do you think there's a little risk 

720
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:49,324
though in that this is forgetting the 
politics side of it and we know there's 

721
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,900
plenty of politics in Hollywood,
but that these are subjective award,

722
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:58,180
so it is possible.
Do you think it is possible?

723
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:03,160
I should say that the people voted and 
they just happened to the votes?

724
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:03,994
Just bullshit.
They just don't think that that's a 

725
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,363
possibility.
Really?

726
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,553
Absolutely not.
Because what we're hearing is that the 

727
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:11,424
membership,
they get to watch whatever movies they 

728
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:16,440
choose to watch.
So if I'm a 78 year old white guy,

729
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,170
okay,
and I got all these movies to watch,

730
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,870
what are the chances that I'm going to 
watch straight Outta Compton?

731
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,733
It's just not likely.
And here's what African Americans 

732
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:26,620
wanted.

733
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,120
So That's interesting.
So that's not necessarily.

734
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:28,954
So that's almost,
you would say that sort of racist by 

735
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:31,500
omission.

736
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,420
So there a bias.
That's why the city,

737
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,140
that's why diversity matters.
And some of us as well,

738
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,000
we don't want affirmative action for the
awards.

739
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,620
No,
we don't want affirmative action.

740
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,770
We just want the academy to reflect the 
reality of movie goers.

741
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:51,341
So 46 percent of all tickets sold at the
box office from minorities.

742
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,160
So if the people buying your product,
by and large,

743
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,550
all we're saying is let the academy 
reflect those people.

744
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,560
And at the end of the day,
if an African American or Latino decides

745
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:07,230
to straight Outta Compton,
isn't a movie that they want to vote for

746
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,850
it to be best picture of the year.
Okay.

747
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,120
We can live with that.
We're not asking them to get any special

748
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:12,954
treatment.
All we're asking for is diversity so 

749
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:18,810
that at least there's some confidence 
that the process is fair.

750
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,140
Even the plainfield don't give us any 
greater advantages.

751
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,023
You know,
Viola David says is best the difference 

752
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:29,070
between black women in TV and white 
women are the opportunities,

753
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,993
so we're really just talking about 
opportunities and spike Lee I think was 

754
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:37,270
spot on saying this way before we get to
the award seasons.

755
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,103
This is happening in the c suites at 
studios because when we look at who can 

756
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:45,770
green light projects,
that's where we've got to start.

757
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,830
There's no diversity is no Africa.
I think he told me that.

758
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,943
I think he said there's one African 
American that has the power to green 

759
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:52,924
light a project.
So it starts with a major studio 

760
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:57,040
project.
A major studio,

761
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,810
yes.
Obviously not independent films,

762
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:02,590
but it starts with those.
The number of and will be Goldberg,

763
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:06,280
talked about this on the view as a 
director and an executive producer,

764
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,180
is that the black directors and writers 
and producers,

765
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,920
they cannot get their projects through 
mainstream studios and when they do,

766
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,053
their budgets are smaller and the 
opportunities for success on those 

767
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:20,380
projects,
but just again,

768
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,030
I'm going to go back to my economics,
right,

769
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:23,110
so yeah,
go to that.

770
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,770
You'll have straight out of compton 
making $200,000,000.

771
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,980
You have ride along three pushing star 
wars out of the top slot.

772
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,680
I think somebody ought to take note.
The bean counters,

773
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:39,160
the accountants,
the money people ought to be taking note

774
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,910
of that and and ought to do what TV has 
done to recognize,

775
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,660
hey there's,
there's some money in these urban movies

776
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,553
and that's,
to me that's the interesting part 

777
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:49,474
because if I know one thing about now 
living in La and being part of the 

778
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,743
Hollywood or whatever this is,
is that this town I think basically is 

779
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,290
just run by people want to make money 
that,

780
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,440
that it's a capitalistic town.
It's not like.

781
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,430
So your argument though,
would would prove if they said,

782
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,870
all right guys,
we're looking at the numbers here,

783
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:11,800
46 percent of the people that are coming
to movies are minorities.

784
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:15,040
Then we should be trying to increase 
that percentage of the pie.

785
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,340
It's not going to come at the cost 
necessarily have your white viewers that

786
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:21,730
I think the town would be would go for 
that because they want to make money.

787
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,770
But I think that's the fear.

788
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,793
You hit on something really important 
and we're seeing that in the 

789
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:29,300
presidential election,
this fear that if,

790
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,590
if I make way for you African American 
minority,

791
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,590
somehow that means there's no way for 
me.

792
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,663
So your,
your success comes at my expense and 

793
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,410
this is also what you should have 
learned.

794
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:44,740
I'm sure you have about this town is 
very relationship driven.

795
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:45,963
So if you,
if I don't have that relationship with 

796
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:50,650
you,
I'm not necessarily even going to get in

797
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,484
the room to have the meeting and again,
to spike Lee's point if we don't have 

798
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,283
more diversity in the top jobs and upper
level management in the decision making 

799
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:04,030
positions than maybe I've never even in 
the conversation.

800
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,471
Yeah.
You know,

801
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:06,270
it's funny,
I saw our friend Larry Elder,

802
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:08,340
who we've mentioned a few times here,
uh,

803
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,730
I saw he was tweeting at spike and 
basically was saying,

804
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,541
come on,
Spike.

805
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,040
You've made,
you know,

806
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,874
hundreds of millions of dollars.
You're selling your mansion in New York 

807
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,380
for $35,
million bucks.

808
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,363
It's a little disingenuous for you.
Now I think I know what you're going to 

809
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,253
say to this,
but I think it's interesting that it's 

810
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,990
good at least that any community is 
having those internal fight that.

811
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,040
But again,
look how ridiculous that argument is.

812
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,280
You can sit here and say,
Eva,

813
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,220
come on.
Your son

814
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,053
has autism.
So when you're standing up fighting for 

815
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,860
more autistics are services for people 
with autism.

816
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,170
That's just about enriching your own 
son's life.

817
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,273
Oftentimes it's people's own personal 
experiences that causes them to become 

818
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,343
advocates or activists,
and it is because of spike Lee's 

819
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:51,704
position inside the movie industry that 
he has the voice and the credibility to 

820
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:56,564
speak to it.
I surely don't have any credible voice 

821
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,100
about making a movie.
I've never made a damn movie.

822
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,400
So who wants to hear from me about that?
You want to make a movie?

823
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,850
No,
I don't want to make a movie.

824
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:08,420
I want to talk about the folks that make
that better,

825
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,613
but I think his argument is disingenuous
and I think spike Lee is in the best 

826
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:17,690
position and he's been on this point.
He's not new to this party.

827
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:22,010
If you look at the history of spike Lee,
Spike Lee will tell you lots of projects

828
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:22,844
he didn't get because he's always been 
outspoken about this issue of race and 

829
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:28,274
diversity and inclusion and yes,
he's made a lot of money and make more 

830
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,054
of it.

831
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,073
Ironically,
spike is fighting the same fight in 

832
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:37,640
reality that a lot of his movies were 
about fighting made.

833
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,100
His moves are like,
he's coming out of nowhere with this and

834
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:40,934
he's hired,
and this is a statistic I didn't even 

835
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,530
know until he got this a honorary Oscar 
himself.

836
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,740
He's hired more African American actors 
than any studio bar none.

837
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,110
So here's one guy who has not had,
you know,

838
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,043
a slew of blockbuster movies,
but yet he has made it a point to hire 

839
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:04,010
more African American actors and he 
accepted that award with Sam Jackson and

840
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:06,320
Denzel Washington or top actors,
black,

841
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:06,831
white,
green.

842
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:07,664
No matter what or you know,
and they were there because they have 

843
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,980
been in so many of his movies.
You know,

844
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,700
it just hit me as we're talking about 
this,

845
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:17,840
that it's so sad that so much has to be 
framed within,

846
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,703
within the racial lens because we 
haven't gotten it there because I've 

847
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:21,914
had,
hey harry on my show who was the first 

848
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,790
black woman to ever win an emmy.

849
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:26,923
And I remember watching when I was like,
I was probably 10 or 12 and I remember 

850
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:35,360
thinking this woman is absolutely 
hysterical.

851
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,100
I didn't look at her and think,
oh,

852
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:37,934
there's a black woman making me laugh.
I just thought this woman is hysterical 

853
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,020
and I guess,
you know,

854
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,190
talent ultimately is what has to reach 
the top,

855
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,950
but that doesn't mean that some of these
systemic things can't be.

856
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,180
And that's again,
that's where people were not talking per

857
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:57,620
se about affirmative action,
but people I think get that wrong.

858
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,110
We're not asking that you lower the 
standards.

859
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:02,300
We're asking that you even the playing 
field.

860
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:04,940
And that's a very big difference.
What would you say to the people,

861
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,800
I've seen this bubble up a little bit 
lately,

862
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:07,790
that people are saying,
well,

863
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,030
if you look at the Latino community 
there,

864
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:14,120
there are numbers in America versus 
their nominations or the Asian community

865
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,210
really,
uh,

866
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,360
that they,
they never get nominated basically.

867
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,280
So I see a lot of people saying,
well,

868
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,590
the black community is fighting the 
wrong fight here.

869
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,630
They're fighting something that makes 
everyone else go.

870
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,693
You're fighting about Oscars.
Nobody cares about Oscars while the 

871
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:30,990
Latino community is way less represented
in.

872
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,690
That is a fantastic

873
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:35,210
question.
And I knew I'd get one right.

874
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,570
Look at the history.
What do black people do?

875
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,290
We break the damn doors down.
So everybody else,

876
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,090
the gays,
the Latinos,

877
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:47,360
the Asians,
women can walk through the door.

878
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,530
So watch what happens when diversity 
happens is,

879
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:55,340
and I got to just be about black actors.
It's going to be about diverse actors.

880
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:57,410
It's going to be Latinos,
Asians,

881
00:44:57,411 --> 00:45:00,710
people with disabilities.
They will all benefit.

882
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,040
Somebody has to lead on this,
and if you look historically,

883
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,470
it's been African Americans who've been 
willing,

884
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:07,304
even though you're right,
disproportionately our numbers are much 

885
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:09,944
smaller than Latinos,
but we have a much more organized and 

886
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:15,014
developed a system of protesting and 
raising issues of racial inequality in 

887
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:24,710
this country than Latinos and Asians.
And Trust me,

888
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:26,870
when we break the doors down,
nobody else is saying,

889
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,750
oh my God,
they broke that damn door down.

890
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,800
I'll watch that door is too broken.
Watch everybody run through that door.

891
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:38,000
So I would say to Latinos,
Asians stand up with us.

892
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,253
We all benefit from this.
We're not saying that it's all black 

893
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:42,381
actors.
I want us,

894
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:44,630
I'm a woman.
I want to see more females.

895
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:47,420
I want to see I'm a disability rights 
advocate.

896
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:51,920
I want to see more individuals with 
disabilities portrayed in movies.

897
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:52,754
And television,
so I think nothing but good from any 

898
00:45:55,581 --> 00:46:00,581
marginalized group comes from the 
efforts of what we see happening on this

899
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,550
Oscar.
So white.

900
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,453
Yeah,
in a way it shows the strength of the 

901
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:04,044
black community actually because because
a lot of what we care about culturally 

902
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:08,964
and the music we listened to and all of 
that stuff comes from the black 

903
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:13,614
community.
So it's like in a way that the black 

904
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:18,110
community has the lead on this for the 
other minorities.

905
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,020
So it does kind of make sense.

906
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,150
And for those folks that say,
Oh my God,

907
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:22,890
you know,
this is a bunch of millionaires fighting

908
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:24,660
about a gold statue.
Who Cares?

909
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,033
The Oscars are a very important 
institution and the entertainment 

910
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:31,074
industry,
particularly in a state like California 

911
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,290
is huge.
And again,

912
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,140
if we're buying 46 percent of the 
tickets at the box office,

913
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:40,200
this is an issue that we need to be 
aware of.

914
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,270
Does it mean that we don't care about 
hunger?

915
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:43,104
Does it mean that we don't care about 
poverty and the poverty and the fact 

916
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:46,794
that,
you know,

917
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,060
one out of three black kids live in 
poverty,

918
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,903
you know,
and what our capacity is large enough 

919
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:59,330
that we can fight the fight on poverty 
as well as address issues at the Oscars.

920
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:01,590
I don't see them as mutually exclusive

921
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,350
at all.
Yeah.

922
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:02,881
All right.
Well let's,

923
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:05,370
let's go with the poverty thing for a 
little bit because,

924
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,263
uh,
one of the things that I've seen lately 

925
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:08,484
is that a lot of numbers are showing 
that the black community has not gotten 

926
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:17,040
any better economically under the seven 
years of Obama.

927
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,750
And you know,
people felt,

928
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,584
you know,
he wanted to sort of be a post racial 

929
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:22,710
president.
I don't think we've quite got there.

930
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,440
Not necessarily his fault.
Um,

931
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,590
but what can the black community do to 
get those numbers?

932
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,543
Well,
don't necessarily agree with those 

933
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,230
statistics.
I think they're there.

934
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,270
If you,
depending on what you read,

935
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,960
the economy overall is much better under
Obama.

936
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,390
Millions more.
However,

937
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,820
the economy itself at the economy itself
is,

938
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:47,821
but that the black community still 
behind in that sort of regroup the black

939
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:51,250
community has made some gains under 
Obama.

940
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,110
So again,
I disagree with and,

941
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:53,944
and I reject those statistics that say 
blacks are worse off under Obama than 

942
00:47:56,981 --> 00:48:00,450
they were under George Bush.
Hello?

943
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,320
I don't think so.
Uh,

944
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,380
do we still have a ways to go in this 
country?

945
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,273
Absolutely.
Are we still a disproportionately 

946
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,410
impacted by a criminal justice system?
Yes.

947
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,500
Are we still lagging behind in wages,
a in asset accumulation?

948
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:20,200
Absolutely.
So there is a lot of work to be done,

949
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,034
but that doesn't dismiss the great work 
that President Obama has done on 

950
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:27,100
healthcare.
A look at the jobs,

951
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,880
the unemployment rate lower than it's 
been in a decade.

952
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:31,751
Uh,
so I,

953
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:34,610
I think we have to celebrate those pro,
you know,

954
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:34,950
the,
the,

955
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:35,783
the advances that have been made and 
keep fighting and just overcoming 

956
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,450
hundreds of years of systemic racism.
Obviously what we are now seeing doesn't

957
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:47,284
happen overnight.
It is a long and entrenched fight that 

958
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,570
is,
I think,

959
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,960
what we learned more attractable than 
perhaps what we thought.

960
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:59,860
I don't think anyone thought that 
Obama's legacy,

961
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,310
you know,
the hope we were all high on hope.

962
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,603
Here's a were on hold and no one could 
have predicted that the rancor and the 

963
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,480
adversarial nature of what he has faced,
particularly in these last three years.

964
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:17,171
I,
I know,

965
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:20,470
I couldn't imagine that and saw that and
it's hard to say.

966
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,270
Is that,
is that racial,

967
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,750
is that that our system is just warped 
wood.

968
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,210
Would the Republicans have been more 
willing to work with a white president?

969
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,120
I hate bringing everything down to that.
To that point.

970
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,310
There may be some element of it.
I don't.

971
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:35,380
I don't think we really know.
I don't think we know.

972
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,590
I don't think we can ever.
And again,

973
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:39,424
I get so beat up about this,
but it's just what I know just 

974
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:42,700
historically,
I'm,

975
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:43,534
I'm a student of history.
A race matters in this country and no 

976
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,250
matter whether you're the president of 
United States or you're the president of

977
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,950
the Oscars,
the fact that we're still fighting these

978
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:56,570
battles have to tell us that race still 
matters.

979
00:49:56,571 --> 00:49:57,930
So.
All right,

980
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,410
well let's go.
How about we get away from Raytheon?

981
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:02,643
It's just,
it's such a shame that we have to spend 

982
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:05,780
so much time talking about it,
but that,

983
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:07,210
that is the point,
I suppose.

984
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,273
Uh,
so let's talk about politics because 

985
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,310
politics thing too.
You are supporting Hillary.

986
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,623
I am supporting Hillary Clinton.
I'm also supporting a slew of 

987
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,490
progressive and some female,
mostly female candidates.

988
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:23,770
I'm a big proponent of,
of inclusion,

989
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,750
not just for race,
for women,

990
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,130
for lgbt,
for Latino's.

991
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:31,160
I just think this country works better.
Our state,

992
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,210
our city,
our county,

993
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,343
when we have diverse voices.
So I support a lot of candidates at the 

994
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:41,030
local,
state and national level that don't look

995
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:42,090
like traditional candidate.

996
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,510
So what do you make of the Hillary 
campaign?

997
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,344
Because I've,
I'm not sure who I'm supporting at this 

998
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:48,320
point.
I'm really still,

999
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:49,154
I've become a really at this point.
I see myself as a real centrist and I'm 

1000
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:53,414
just not sure now,
it seems to me that Hillary and Bernie 

1001
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,440
are way better than any Republican 
debates,

1002
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,640
uh,
have been about substance,

1003
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,570
you know,
they've really,

1004
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:04,520
even with the gun thing,
you know,

1005
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,370
Hillary's trying to pin Bernie as the 
gun guy.

1006
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:11,000
Meanwhile he got a d minus from the NRA,
but so it's really been about substance.

1007
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,680
The Republicans,
it's trunk,

1008
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,140
it's silliness.
We can talk about that too.

1009
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,510
Um,
but one thing I have seen with Hillary's

1010
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:19,190
that to me,
this campaign,

1011
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,590
because of the email stuff and then 
guys,

1012
00:51:22,591 --> 00:51:23,660
he,
which finally that's going away,

1013
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,550
but whatever it is,
but there is no,

1014
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,040
there hasn't been a point where it's 
been like a run,

1015
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:28,903
like a nice,
like month long run where this is about 

1016
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:34,130
really feeling good and maybe that's the
media doesn't like her.

1017
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,650
I don't think the media really likes or 
something.

1018
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:38,720
But how do you feel about the campaign 
in general?

1019
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:39,603
So here's what I think.
I think the trump and the outsider 

1020
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,373
voices that have dominated the news 
media isn't just impacting glp and the 

1021
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:50,104
Republicans.
It's also impacting dims as well in 

1022
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:56,050
Bernie is lining up as that outside 
voice,

1023
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,010
and Hillary of course is the mainstream 
establishment candidate.

1024
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,430
When you listen to what Bernie and 
Hillary are saying,

1025
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,480
knowing what we now know about Obama,
Bernie's policies,

1026
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:11,350
they just don't have a snowball's chance
in hell of ever coming to fruition.

1027
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,590
He's talking about a 90 percent tax rate
on the rich.

1028
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,313
Hello,
rich guys in Congress as Senate are 

1029
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:19,474
going to vote for 90 percent tax rate on
that snow jumping because I know people 

1030
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:23,284
are going to be yelling at you over that
because I've mentioned that and people 

1031
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:28,060
have said to me what he's saying is that
it will be a progressive tax,

1032
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:28,894
so it's not that you're being taxed 
fully on the 90 percent increase on the 

1033
00:52:33,371 --> 00:52:35,440
rich.
It doesn't play well to Congress

1034
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,720
because most of those guys are rich 
guys.

1035
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:43,680
He's talking about eliminating obamacare
as single source,

1036
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:45,303
single payer source healthcare system.
We couldn't get that voted in even when 

1037
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:53,680
the congress was controlled by Dims,
so I like his fire.

1038
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:58,570
I like his progressive politics,
but I'm a pragmatist at heart and I just

1039
00:52:58,571 --> 00:53:03,571
don't think any of those things he could
get accomplished and we don't need eight

1040
00:53:03,761 --> 00:53:07,180
more years of not being able to get 
anything accomplished.

1041
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:10,450
What I like about Hillary is she setting
me on fire.

1042
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:15,451
Am I as high as I was eight years ago 
when I don't have any of that,

1043
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:20,770
but at the core of me I like getting 
stuff done.

1044
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:21,693
I think the woman can get shit done and 
you talk about the in Gaza and the 

1045
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:27,270
emails.
To me,

1046
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,360
the crowning joy of her campaign was 
sitting at those hearings for a moment.

1047
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,043
The way they attacked her,
it would have taken Mother Teresa 

1048
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:41,694
herself to too restrain some of these 
junior just got to Congress five days 

1049
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:52,420
ago,
don't know where the bathroom is.

1050
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,553
People yelling at her about the most 
ridiculous and unimportant details and 

1051
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:01,780
she just sat there.
I so I'm with you 100 percent.

1052
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:04,040
That that was not only was her best,
that to me was like,

1053
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,070
you should be the president.
Just for that.

1054
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,860
I posted a really funny line.
Did you see there was a moment where she

1055
00:54:08,861 --> 00:54:11,580
did this little thing,
she was like,

1056
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,100
it was like drop the mic and it was like
vote.

1057
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,473
That's the kind of level headed 
toughness that you need an office and 

1058
00:54:21,251 --> 00:54:22,330
that's what,
to me,

1059
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:23,730
Bernie,
when Bernie is doing all that,

1060
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:24,221
I'm like,
dude,

1061
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:25,810
okay,
you got to bring it down a notch.

1062
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:27,730
You yelling,
I can't really understand you.

1063
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,260
You're making it.
You're giving me a headache.

1064
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:34,220
So it's interesting because I know so a 
lot of my audience loves Bernie and I've

1065
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:37,550
said several times that me and my heart,
I like Bernie the best.

1066
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:39,890
I liked the ideas the best,
but I also,

1067
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:43,520
because I consider myself a pragmatist 
when he saying these things,

1068
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:46,670
sometimes I see what he tweets these 
really lofty things about,

1069
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,020
you know,
it's all about changing the system.

1070
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:48,854
I'm all for changing the system and 
getting money out of politics and all 

1071
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:51,104
those things.
But we just had Obama tried to change 

1072
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:57,791
the system pretty intensely too and we 
were all higher than seven years ago.

1073
00:54:58,521 --> 00:54:59,660
Right.
So that's,

1074
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,710
that's why at this point I sort of think
I'm mostly begrudgingly

1075
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,890
supporting hillary too,
because here's the problem with that,

1076
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:10,050
and I tried to tell people this with 
Obama.

1077
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:13,230
Nobody would listen to me.
Then he says to me that that's okay,

1078
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:14,064
that's fair.
That's why my clients pay me a thousand 

1079
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,280
dollars,
but no,

1080
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,540
we have a two party system and the 
president is here.

1081
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,273
He can do nothing.
She can do nothing without the congress 

1082
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:29,260
and the Senate.
You can be the most Charisse,

1083
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,080
you cannot bend more charismatic than 
Obama.

1084
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:32,914
The guy is like swag on steroids,
but that doesn't mean anything in 

1085
00:55:36,881 --> 00:55:37,714
Washington DC.
And that's the problem with all these 

1086
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,210
people following trump.
Trump is not going to be a dictator.

1087
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:46,120
We don't have a dictatorship in our 
government.

1088
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:46,954
Our government is about,
it's a collaborative and if you're not 

1089
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,880
able one to understand that and then to,
to navigate that,

1090
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,740
you get nothing done.

1091
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,593
So that's the crazy part and where it 
goes to in this I think is probably a 

1092
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,763
throughline of everything we've said 
here is that education is the most 

1093
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:04,620
important part.
We have.

1094
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,023
We have three branches of government.
People forget that we have a judicial 

1095
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,350
branch.
They decide what's legal.

1096
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,243
We have a legislative branch.
They decide to make laws and then we 

1097
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:16,240
have all these policies,
these,

1098
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:16,890
these

1099
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,723
glp candidates are talking about.
They're gonna build a wall and they're 

1100
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,980
going to hell how exactly you're going 
to do that.

1101
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,020
So that to me is the most dangerous part
of this for a second,

1102
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,720
because I saw him say a week ago or two 
weeks ago,

1103
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,730
he said something like,
when I'm president,

1104
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:32,564
you know they're going to put a merry 
Christmas back on starbucks card or 

1105
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,800
something like that.
Now I get it.

1106
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:37,634
It's just a stupid.
He's just throwing stupid red meat out 

1107
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,830
to some morons,
but like even that it shows,

1108
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:43,723
it shows a inclination to not even 
really understand what the role of the 

1109
00:56:49,461 --> 00:56:50,540
president is

1110
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,630
dummied down.
If you watch those gop debates,

1111
00:56:53,631 --> 00:56:55,120
I'm sitting there,
they're foreign.

1112
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,460
When Ben Carson said,
see my mother,

1113
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,570
she used to drive a car until the car 
wouldn't drive anymore.

1114
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,970
Then she would take her pennies and 
she'd buy a new car.

1115
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,253
Well,
he is supposed to translate to economic 

1116
00:57:11,211 --> 00:57:16,211
policy of the world hard.
Her pennies do well on ice as well.

1117
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,253
They said,
well you one of the questions like when 

1118
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:23,930
you can't bomb these,
these,

1119
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,540
these vehicles,
because they have civilians.

1120
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,510
Well just tell them if they ride in the 
car,

1121
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:31,590
they're going to get bombed so they 
shouldn't get in the car.

1122
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,040
So that's the,
that's the piece.

1123
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,600
That's a piece.
Yeah.

1124
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:37,434
I mean look,

1125
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,680
that's not a policy.
What Isis is stupidity.

1126
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,520
And that's the piece that goes across 
both sides because.

1127
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:46,500
So you hear that right?
Did you hear Ben Carson?

1128
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,380
And it's like you clearly know nothing 
about foreign policy.

1129
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:52,680
Like he just uses a couple of buzzwords,
Caliphate Jihad.

1130
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,663
He just puts a couple words together,
but then I'll hear Bernie talk about it 

1131
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,563
and I'm not for war.
I'm certainly not for nation building 

1132
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:01,500
and all of that stuff.
But I hear him say,

1133
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,760
well,
you know,

1134
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,010
we're gonna have to work with our 
allies,

1135
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,610
do this.
But.

1136
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,890
But he,
he also will say I'm never for war,

1137
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,410
which means that there's no threat of 
anything too.

1138
00:58:10,411 --> 00:58:12,400
So it's like both sides are playing.
Okay.

1139
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,323
That's the scary part.
And that's what I think the worst thing 

1140
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:17,344
about the trump reality show is it has 
dummied down the conversation so that 

1141
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,670
we're starting to believe that these 
bluster is,

1142
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:26,933
you know,
blow horns can go in with these 

1143
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:33,180
simplistic solutions to these complex.
I mean the,

1144
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,570
the problems are so complex.
So his whole Muslim policy,

1145
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,670
do you know that the people who are 
fighting isis the most are Muslims?

1146
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:47,850
So when you insult for Muslim community,
you insulting our outside.

1147
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,740
But if you don't know anything about 
foreign policy,

1148
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:51,574
you don't know that.
And now what's really scary me as 

1149
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:58,030
they're saying,
when trump becomes the gop nominee,

1150
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,290
he's got an now somehow figure out how 
to reverse himself.

1151
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,240
You know,
he's insulted African Americans,

1152
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,074
Latinos and Muslims,
just about every group that you need to 

1153
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:09,640
win the general election in this 
country.

1154
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,120
So now he's got to walk that.
But how do you walk that back?

1155
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:15,670
And here's his dilemma.
If he walks it back,

1156
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:21,330
those white lower middle class men 
mostly who were supporting him,

1157
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:23,114
they're going to be,
they're going to be passed because the 

1158
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:27,590
reason they like him is because he's 
standing up to make America great.

1159
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,513
I eat white again.
So how do you embrace the immigrant 

1160
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:36,020
population in the Muslim population 
without alienating your base?

1161
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:39,260
And that's the stupidity of the GOP 
party did me?

1162
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:39,841
Yeah.
You know,

1163
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:41,670
it's interesting.
This is where I've been very critical of

1164
00:59:41,671 --> 00:59:45,270
the left because I think that the 
progressive's because they.

1165
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:48,060
So their intentions usually are very 
good,

1166
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:53,280
but they're so their knee jerk responses
to yell bigot or racist or homophobic or

1167
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:55,920
sexist or whatever it is at everybody 
that they.

1168
00:59:55,921 --> 00:59:56,754
In a way they've enabled trump because 
they've silenced so many centrists and 

1169
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:01,694
so many liberals that I think they've 
enabled will then trump just comes in 

1170
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:07,590
with answers instead of saying instead 
of a real debate where we say,

1171
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,080
what are we really doing with 
immigration right now?

1172
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:13,080
What are we really doing about refugees 
and migrants?

1173
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,690
Trump just comes in and says,
Hey,

1174
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,500
I'm banning everybody and then that 
sounds good.

1175
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:20,880
So I partly do blame our side of the 
aisle on that because we haven't,

1176
01:00:20,881 --> 01:00:21,980
we haven't dealt with it well,

1177
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,080
a narrow group of people that he plays 
too.

1178
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:25,914
But I.
One of the things I find most 

1179
01:00:26,611 --> 01:00:31,611
interesting about the glp election,
remember after Mitt Romney lost,

1180
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:37,350
they went and did this exhaustive audit.
How did we lose?

1181
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,213
So let's dissect it,
let's analyze and figure out what 

1182
01:00:40,361 --> 01:00:44,380
happened.
And what they concluded was they did not

1183
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,280
Garner enough votes from the minority 
voters,

1184
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:51,790
particularly Latinos,
and that they had to become the party of

1185
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,400
inclusion.
And so,

1186
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,293
and in all their big money donors said,
we're no longer supporting any of these 

1187
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:01,900
kooks.
We want candidates that can win.

1188
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:02,763
We're going to put our money behind 
candidates that can win and we're going 

1189
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:05,224
to go out and become the party of one.
And they've done the exact opposite 

1190
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:16,130
front runners,
not runner runners have made the concept

1191
01:01:17,191 --> 01:01:19,020
of inclusion like a joke.

1192
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,400
Yeah.
And that's clearly why trump is.

1193
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,080
The party is against trump.
Alright.

1194
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:23,943
So one last thing before we wrap up.
I do want to talk a little bit about 

1195
01:01:26,861 --> 01:01:27,694
your son and your activism in with 
autism and the things that you've 

1196
01:01:31,211 --> 01:01:34,450
written and things like that.
So we hear a lot about autism,

1197
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:39,630
but I don't think people really 
understand what it is or how many people

1198
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,800
are now affected by autism.
Not only the,

1199
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:43,630
the kids that have it,
uh,

1200
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:46,240
but the families and all that.
So in just a couple minutes,

1201
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:47,740
can we just do like a autism one?
Oh

1202
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,661
yeah.
Quickly.

1203
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:53,661
So autism is a neurological disorder 
impacts three major areas.

1204
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:57,120
Your communication,
your ability to learn.

1205
01:01:57,121 --> 01:01:59,520
So your cognition and then your social 
skills.

1206
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,650
One in 64 children.
Some say that number's understate.

1207
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,030
It could be as high as one in 34,
one and 35,

1208
01:02:06,031 --> 01:02:06,864
but the CDC number is one in 64 children
have autism boys four times more likely 

1209
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,074
than girls to have autism.
So it impacts the fastest growing 

1210
01:02:16,861 --> 01:02:17,694
childhood disorder in America.
Probably not possible for you to not 

1211
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,220
have a friend,
a coworker,

1212
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:27,080
a family member of someone in your 
circle that's been impacted by autism.

1213
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,310
My best friends.
So spectrum disorder.

1214
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,380
So that means you meet one person with 
autism,

1215
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,950
you've met one person with autism,
because every child,

1216
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:39,780
every adult is impacted differently from
some very high functioning folks who you

1217
01:02:39,781 --> 01:02:42,000
might've heard the term asperger's 
disorder,

1218
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:42,923
a false side,
Bill Gates allegedly have asperger's 

1219
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:48,450
disorder to people who are so low 
functioning that term low functioning,

1220
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:53,451
and I don't mean it in a pejorative way,
but who have no verbal skills have to be

1221
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,510
in some kind of group home or very 
restrictive environment.

1222
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:02,190
A huge,
huge push was made in the last decade to

1223
01:03:02,191 --> 01:03:06,150
address issues of adequate diagnosis and
intervention.

1224
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,000
Again,
statistically African Americans,

1225
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:13,020
Latinos diagnosed two to four years 
later than their typical peers.

1226
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:16,260
Really difficult time accessing 
services.

1227
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,190
Now the focus and the push is on the 
aging out.

1228
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:23,010
So a lot of the kids that were diagnosed
10 years ago,

1229
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:26,010
20 years ago,
are becoming teens and young adults.

1230
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:30,510
So the question of college employment 
and independent living.

1231
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,523
So there's been kind of a shift in the 
community or there's this slowly the 

1232
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:35,703
shift is happening to focus on what do 
we do with this population of teens and 

1233
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:41,910
young adults.
So if people want to find out more,

1234
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:45,420
where can we find out quick about my 
work?

1235
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,201
Uh,
uh,

1236
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,034
Riva,
Martin Dot Com and then the nonprofit 

1237
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:50,310
that I started,
especially with these network,

1238
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,290
especially news network,
that org.

1239
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,360
All right,
well it's been an absolute pleasure.

1240
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,283
We did the long form thing.
I mean I literally didn't pick up my 

1241
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,720
notes so that,
that is a good conversation.

1242
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,363
All right,
so I want to thank her eva Martin and 

1243
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:04,284
you can check out more of her work as 
you just said at Arriva Martin Dot Com 

1244
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:09,300
and we will do it again next week.
Thanks guys.
