1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,570
One of the occupational hazards of doing
a show like this is that my friends,

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:09,404
my family,
people who come up to me at the grocery 

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:11,924
store and at Ikea and pretty much 
everyone that I encounter on a day to 

4
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,820
day basis wants to talk politics with 
me.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,893
Fortunately,
I love talking about politics and 

6
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:20,084
talking to people about politics,
so I'm usually happy to engage with 

7
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:26,780
people even when I'm picking out an ice 
cream or testing out the pivot couch,

8
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,180
which is surprisingly comfortable and 
easy to put together.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,613
One of the things I've noticed lately 
about our political climate is that 

10
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:36,200
people are having a harder time tuning 
out of politics.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,243
Even briefly to talk about other things.
This is somewhat anecdotal in my case 

12
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:41,684
particularly,
but I bet that it's happening to you in 

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:44,624
your life to suddenly.
It seems like every conversation is 

14
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:47,990
political.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,410
Every discussion somehow gets back to 
trump and yes,

16
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:54,350
your aunt knows exactly how to solve 
America's healthcare crisis.

17
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:58,100
Even though she can't figure out how to 
sync or IPAD on face value.

18
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,290
None of this is a problem.
I love.

19
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,124
The people who were largely apolitical 
are now becoming more politically 

20
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:04,934
engaged.
People are not only talking about 

21
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:06,944
politics,
but in many cases reevaluating what 

22
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,980
their beliefs are because of the upside 
down world that we live in right now.

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,110
While everything may seem crazy,
I really do believe this time that we're

24
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:18,944
in right now is a rare special moment 
when so many people are all doing the 

25
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:26,900
same introspection about their beliefs 
all at the same time.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,183
Whether this will lead to more or less 
freedom to more or less tolerance or to 

27
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,110
more or less peace all remains to be 
seen,

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,153
but without question.
We're in some pretty fertile ground for 

29
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:37,244
change right now,
and by change I mean real societal 

30
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,170
change,
not just hoping change.

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,573
One problem I do see attached to all of 
this opportunity for change and 

32
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:46,994
reevaluation is that people are becoming
consumed by politics in a way which 

33
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:51,644
doesn't strike me as particularly 
healthy for humans mental state or for 

34
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:55,904
societies at large.
It's one of the reasons I'm a small 

35
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:00,470
government guy.
I want a government small enough that we

36
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:01,304
don't have to talk about it that much 
because it doesn't even have the power 

37
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:08,420
to do too much good or too much bad.
There's a built tradeoff there.

38
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:12,320
Small government can only do so much.
The rest is up to the people,

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,540
so if you want government to do 
everything,

40
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,740
you really can't complain when it does 
all sorts of things that you don't like.

41
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,933
Well actually of course you can complain
about it at least until that big 

42
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:25,430
government comes and takes away your 
right to do just that.

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,960
So my message to you this week is let's 
keep talking about all of these issues.

44
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:33,680
Let's keep staying engaged and trying to
change things for the better,

45
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:38,210
but at the same time let's not let it 
consume us to the point where it changes

46
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,044
who we are.
Social media can be an awful catalysts 

47
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,194
to the endless focus on politics,
which is why I've been trying to take 

48
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:45,344
the weekends off and focus on the world 
that exists in front of my face instead 

49
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,780
of the one that exists in 140 
characters.

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,033
When you are online though,
try to find some nuance between trump 

51
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,760
derangement syndrome and Nazi frog 
obsession.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
Most people

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,010
are good and what pretty much the same 
things that you do,

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,060
so let's keep growing that new center 
and as long as you're here right now,

55
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,894
we're once again partnering up with 
Learn Liberty this week and we've got 

56
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,984
author and director of the philosophy,
politics and Economics Department at 

57
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,810
Duke University,
Dr Mike Munger.

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,580
We're going to talk politics,
philosophy,

59
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,414
economics,
and much more watch and learn unless 

60
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,324
it's the weekend.

61
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,093
We're continuing our partnership with 
the fine folks over at learn liberty 

62
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:31,064
today and joining me is an economist and
author and a professor of political 

63
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,650
science at Duke University.
Dr.

64
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,690
Mike Munger,
welcome to the Rubin report.

65
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,943
It's great to be here.
That introduction just makes it sound 

66
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,310
like I'm confused.
I think it's probably right.

67
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,320
I thought it made you sound very 
professional.

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,801
Well,
I.

69
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,410
I have.
I have several disciplines that I try to

70
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,470
contribute in.
Yeah.

71
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,040
What we're going to talk about those 
several disciplines,

72
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:52,874
but first let's just talk about 
political science because I was a 

73
00:03:56,091 --> 00:04:00,200
political science major.
Explains a lot of good or bad.

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,250
Oh good.
Oh good.

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,390
Oh good.
Okay.

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,720
I like to think that I'm one of the few 
people that's using political,

77
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:06,554
a political science degree actually to 
talk about politics and political 

78
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,800
philosophy.
So my first question to you would be,

79
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,143
do you think that political science 
right now is sort of needed more than 

80
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,224
ever just to understand the basic 
philosophies behind so much of the 

81
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,110
craziness that we see in public 
discourse these days?

82
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,100
Well,
for two reasons.

83
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:27,440
One,
political science studies engineering,

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,333
but it studies engineering of rules and 
we tend to have this idea that what we 

85
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,004
need is better people.
We're probably not going to get better 

86
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:39,100
people,
but we may need is better rules.

87
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,943
The question is how to try to do that.
The other thing political science does 

88
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,363
is look at some of the ethical questions
that have plagued human beings for the 

89
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:46,544
last 3000 years.
So I see political science as being a 

90
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:54,200
kind of ideal liberal arts degree that 
combines an analysis and ethics,

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,640
but so of course I think,
and I,

92
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,474
I would,
I'm a political science professor that 

93
00:04:58,761 --> 00:04:59,594
we need more political science,
but I really do worry that people just 

94
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:03,291
think,
well,

95
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,124
we can ignore the constitution of the 
living constitution will change it to 

96
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:08,684
interpret it the way that we want it.
We don't understand enough about rules 

97
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,900
to be able just to change it willy nilly
and have it turned out well.

98
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,560
So I like what you said there about,
uh,

99
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,463
that we can't change people that much.
A lot of people seem to think that 

100
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:23,350
that's what politics should be,
right?

101
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,223
We should actually change the way your 
opinions are about very personally held 

102
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:31,730
things through public college or choose 
the new Messiah.

103
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,210
Every time Barack Obama was going to be 
the new messiah.

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,380
He got a Nobel peace prize after he'd 
been in office for seven months.

105
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,723
So the emphasis on this next person's 
going to be the one and you see it 

106
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,074
worldwide.
But it's a little surprising to see the 

107
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,710
u s that come to it also.
Yeah.

108
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,830
So as a,
uh,

109
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,640
you do consider yourself a libertarian,
right?

110
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:53,474
You ran as a libertarian,
we're going to get to that and I am 

111
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:58,370
certainly a libertarian and in the that 
I am not a Republican.

112
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,593
Okay.
And I want to unpack the differences 

113
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:04,730
between that and talk about sort of the,
the ever changing label thing,

114
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,560
which is sort of becoming meaningless at
the moment.

115
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
Um,
so with all the political philosophies 

116
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,313
out there,
do you sense that some of the freedom 

117
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,840
stuff is taking root right now?
Because I think to me,

118
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,550
things are going crazy right now,
but I sense that liberty reason,

119
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,170
getting back to some of the 
constitutional stuff,

120
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,004
I do sense people talking about it a 
little bit more now than perhaps two 

121
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,580
years ago.
Well,

122
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,653
right.
I had a bunch of colleagues who after 

123
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,384
trump was elected or colleagues at Duke,
so political science professors and 

124
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:39,620
other people on the left who would come 
into my office and sheepishly say,

125
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,150
you know,
you were right.

126
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,523
All this stuff about we need to worry 
about the constitutional powers of the 

127
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,290
president.
When George W Bush was president,

128
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,750
they were worried with Barack Obama.
They say,

129
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,480
you don't mind so much as long as my guy
is in charge.

130
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,840
That's the point.
Guy Won't always be in charge,

131
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,850
so what you might want best is a 
dictator that you can pick.

132
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,470
Right?
That's not how it works.

133
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,260
That means that we have to have rules 
and it's very frustrating.

134
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,303
The constitution builds in conflict,
and Barack Obama in many ways was a 

135
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:15,860
terrible president in trying to 
negotiate things with the congress.

136
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,610
He would prefer to go make speeches.
He liked that Messiah thing.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,773
So I.
I do think that a lot of people on the 

138
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,384
left are much more worried now about 
sort of traditional constitutional 

139
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:31,820
protections of freedom of speech and 
about the separation of powers.

140
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,950
So the number of them have actually 
said,

141
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:34,784
you know,
those federalists papers really 

142
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,760
interesting,
aren't they?

143
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,200
Yes.
Welcome back.

144
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,153
Yeah.
So when George W dot Bush was signing 

145
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,140
executive actions,
I assume you were basically against them

146
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,990
when when Barack Obama was signing my 
assume you were basically against them.

147
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:48,824
I assume.
I assume you're not thrilled right now 

148
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,590
with the amount that that trump has 
done.

149
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,490
But that's really interesting to me that
your colleagues on the left are suddenly

150
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,061
gone,
oh,

151
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,050
now I get it.
You know,

152
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,884
we have people on the left now fighting 
for states' rights because they don't 

153
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,900
want the feds coming in and closing 
sanctuary cities,

154
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:03,734
which I think is what a phenomenal flip.
I can't help but gleefully reminding 

155
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:07,401
them,
you know,

156
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,234
you told me that was code for racism,
but now you're for state's rights 

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,700
because you're worried about medical 
marijuana.

158
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,180
You worried about same sex marriage,
states' rights.

159
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,690
It's true.
Was misused by advocates of segregation.

160
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,240
That's absolutely right.
Hitler was a vegetarian.

161
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,150
It doesn't mean that all vegetarians are
Nazis.

162
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,140
It doesn't mean that all state's rights 
people are racists.

163
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,423
States' rights is an important part of 
federalism and it means that we can 

164
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,264
accomplish some things in the states.
So I have this conversation all the 

165
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:39,440
time.

166
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,273
On the show,
but also privately because I'm a big 

167
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,224
states' rights guy and and what people 
will say to me sometimes even just the 

168
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,980
conversation that is happening this 
weekend,

169
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,120
someone was saying to me,
well,

170
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:50,840
I just don't trust that the states will 
do the right thing,

171
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:51,674
that the southern states will do all 
these backwards social things or all 

172
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,370
that stuff.
Now had many people on here,

173
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,290
including a Randy Barnett who I'm sure 
you're familiar with.

174
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,124
You talked about the foot vote and that 
you should leave states and take your 

175
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,454
economic value and your personal value 
and your family and move somewhere else 

176
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:06,880
in that.
That's wonderful.

177
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,820
And your ability.
That's the beauty of America.

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,810
Do you think that's a sound enough 
argument for states' rights?

179
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,003
Well,
it,

180
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,500
that you can just pick up and go it.
It has,

181
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,410
it helps a lot.
It takes a while to do that.

182
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,643
Um,
I guess I would argue for the way that 

183
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:28,311
we've elaborated states' rights,
which is we take the first 10 amendments

184
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,180
to the constitution,
the bill of rights,

185
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,410
and we apply those also to state laws 
through incorporation,

186
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,244
through the 14th amendment.
So there are limits on what the states 

187
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,760
can do,
but other than that,

188
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:39,594
yes,
the states can have all sorts of 

189
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,184
different things and the ninth and 10th 
amendments both reserved a bunch of 

190
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,624
powers to the states and that I think 
the expansion through the commerce 

191
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,900
clause and we really sort of getting 
down into the weeds,

192
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,734
but the expansion of federal powers at 
the expense of the states has been one 

193
00:09:56,491 --> 00:10:00,030
of the catastrophes in constitutional 
jurisprudence,

194
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,890
and I hope we'll go back in the other 
direction,

195
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,933
but it doesn't seem like that president 
trump's appointments seemed to be more 

196
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:08,400
like a 10th amendment skeptics.

197
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:08,791
Right?
Well,

198
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,020
even just in the last week,
you know,

199
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:10,854
there's some.
It's a little confusing what the truth 

200
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:13,740
is,
but it sounds like sessions may go after

201
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:14,574
the states because of medical marijuana.
These are the things that I just simply 

202
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,444
don't understand.
If the Republicans or conservatives or 

203
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,860
the trump people,
whatever that is,

204
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,110
wouldn't you want to take a stand that 
would.

205
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,030
That would make some logical 
consistency.

206
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:29,820
You get decent liberals to go,
yeah,

207
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,230
you're doing the right thing.
Well,

208
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,064
because that would mean that you would 
be operating on principle and not 

209
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:35,604
politics,
and I guess I had hoped and I'm now 

210
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:41,010
disappointed that our republican friends
have not done that.

211
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,620
All they've done is what they decry it 
in others,

212
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,230
when Obama was president,
okay,

213
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,064
now we're in power.
We'll do all this stuff that we rightly 

214
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,770
criticized Obama for doing.
That means that you have no principal at

215
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:53,010
all.

216
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,500
What does that tell you about power in 
general like that?

217
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,334
The second day get this and it's still a
little unclear to me what sessions is 

218
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,574
doing about the medical marijuana thing,
but if he was to do anything other than 

219
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,400
respect states' rights,
it shows me that once you have power,

220
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:08,830
you just some more power.
I think it's.

221
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,183
It isn't inevitable.
There used to be a norm of deference to 

222
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:17,991
the constitution and to some extent of 
forbearance or toleration,

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,273
so you know I'm Catholic.
Clearly I think that that's the correct 

224
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,370
religion.
All others are mistaken.

225
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,090
I also think that you get to want 
whatever you get to believe whatever you

226
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,210
want.
It's that,

227
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,073
that second norm of toleration that's 
being wiped away and we're going to end 

228
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,930
up just being a bunch of competing 
interest groups,

229
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,140
so I don't think it's inevitable that 
power is so seductive,

230
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,100
but there if if other people,
it's like standing in line.

231
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,383
If a bunch of us come up to something 
and there's more of us than can get 

232
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,160
through it,
we just automatically stand in line,

233
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,980
but if somebody cuts in line,
you say you can't do that.

234
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,930
What if a bunch of people cuts in line 
the line breaks,

235
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
so our are the norm of toleration that 
we actually require that this sense that

236
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,240
it's wrong to do this just because it's 
wrong.

237
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,103
Even though I have the power that's 
breaking down and I don't think that 

238
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,600
institution can easily be rebuilt.
Yeah.

239
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,250
Do you see that breaking down in sort of
every facet of public life right now?

240
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,084
Like for a moment before we started,
we were talking about the media and it 

241
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,990
seems that mainstream media and norms 
are crumbling and we have activists,

242
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,900
activists that are now masquerading as 
journalist.

243
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,880
This is a huge problem.
Well,

244
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,863
for a very long time in a number of 
different professions that were sort of 

245
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:32,134
guild rules,
that is I have to act as a professional 

246
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,064
or,
or I will lose the respect of my 

247
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:42,361
colleagues and that respect comes from 
doing things the right way.

248
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,390
Not taking positions that are correct 
according to the liberal or Conservative

249
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,880
catechism.
It's doing things the right way.

250
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,680
It's actually doing real reporting.
Uh,

251
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,970
instead,
both sides are substituting what Stephen

252
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,870
Colbert called truthiness,
which is there's an essential truth that

253
00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,704
exist irrespective of the facts.
And the facts are not evidence there 

254
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,970
examples that makes a world of 
difference.

255
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,610
You're coralling with my examples.
I have other ones.

256
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,230
Well,
no,

257
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,670
if you say something that's not a fact,
that means you're not a professional.

258
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,280
You should be embarrassed.
That's what we're losing.

259
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,114
Is those norms of professionalism.
Where do you think that started or when 

260
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:20,704
do you think it's fair to the most 
famous incident was dan rather and some 

261
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,454
producers at CBS with the letters from 
the Alabama national guard about George 

262
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,403
W dot Bush.
And the letters were provided by 

263
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:38,170
someone.
He said he'd found them in some files,

264
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,453
but when you looked at him,
it was pretty clear that they couldn't 

265
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,490
have been done on an IBM selectric 
typewriter there,

266
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,460
proportional font.

267
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,810
They had the wrong size footnotes and 
they should've backed off.

268
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,880
They don't made a mistake.
They didn't.

269
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,310
They doubled down and said,
well,

270
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:59,020
but there's an essential truth here,
and so what happened was,

271
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:01,840
and this is the origin of the pajamas 
media,

272
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,033
the CBS producers said something you 
thought was true that turned out to be 

273
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,680
true in a way he didn't expect,
which was,

274
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,514
who are you going to believe?
CBS News or some guy in his basement 

275
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,690
wearing pajamas?
Well,

276
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:14,524
it turns out that the guy in the 
basement wearing pajamas is pretty good 

277
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:20,230
at fact checking and so that it didn't 
start there,

278
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,410
but that was a catalyzing moment where 
people said,

279
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:25,480
I mean,
CBS News,

280
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,930
Edward r Murrow,
this is as,

281
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,843
as professional was.
It gets and they substituted their own 

282
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:35,140
ideological judgment for any sort of 
concern about facts.

283
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,040
The guy in the basement seems to be 
getting more powerful these days.

284
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,470
Do you view that as a,
as a net good.

285
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:45,160
The powers asymmetric,
we cannot discover truth.

286
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:45,994
What we can do is impeach false hood,
so the guy in the basement is pretty 

287
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,124
good at checking and seeing if there's 
something contradictory to a claim that 

288
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:54,854
you've made and what that means is that 
no one can believe anything now because 

289
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,570
there's always someone who's checking on
it and saying maybe making this up.

290
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,500
They're,
they're,

291
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,333
they're,
they,

292
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,550
there's a quote in a tweet and then it's
to a link and they just assert something

293
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:11,220
and it becomes a fact.
This is,

294
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,720
this is a problem.
So it's a terrible,

295
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,923
a terrible problem.
So then how do you as as a political 

296
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,690
science professor at someone that's 
trying to frame this for young minds,

297
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,793
how do you give them something that they
don't walk out of your class at the end 

298
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,160
of the semester and go,
Oh man,

299
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,360
we're,
we're screwed.

300
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,463
Or maybe they do.
And that's how you eventually fix 

301
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,953
things.
Well,

302
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,053
I,
I want them to walk out of class saying 

303
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,613
we could be screwed.
We have an obligation to try to act 

304
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:36,944
against this.
And one of those obligations is to do 

305
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:41,930
the right thing even when it's not in 
our self interest.

306
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,690
And so,
uh,

307
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,683
one of my students from a while back 
from duke is a guy named Brendan Nyhan 

308
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,440
at Dartmouth College who writes a lot 
about this sort of problem.

309
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,260
And so I think if you,
if readers are interested,

310
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,094
if you look at Brendan Lyons work on 
this question of I think there is some 

311
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:02,654
hope in this direction,
but if it's gonna we're gonna have to 

312
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:08,060
enlist the aid of more of the mainstream
media.

313
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,260
And the problem that you have is you may
just lose.

314
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,400
The ratings were,
yeah,

315
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,710
if you're not interesting and 
provocative is,

316
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,420
have we already crossed that point?

317
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,373
It seems to me that the election got us 
to sort of parody between the online 

318
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:22,964
media and the mainstream media.
And like that night it sort of became 

319
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,670
equal.
And now at this point I think the online

320
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,671
media actually has more influence and 
that's sort of why the click style and,

321
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:37,580
and some of the stuff that we've seen 
with CNN over the last couple of weeks.

322
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,990
That's why it's gotten crazier because 
they're.

323
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:43,310
They're just grasping for.
For the last bit of relevancy,

324
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
let's put a more hopeful spin.
This,

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,273
it is true.
Remember we talked about states rights 

326
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,440
were misused by segregationists.
Well,

327
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,274
it's true that some of the power for 
curation of the mainstream media was 

328
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:58,550
misused and when we no longer trust 
them,

329
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,260
but it's much easier now to produce 
content and I it self serving,

330
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,094
but your show is a sign that people are 
actually willing to spend more than 

331
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:11,960
three or four minutes or 140 characters 
and try to understand things.

332
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,770
So there is this desire to know if not 
the truth,

333
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,800
at least the nuance of the different 
claims and the ability to leap frog.

334
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,510
You can just put something up on 
Youtube,

335
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,080
you get subscribers and to some extent 
that's going to determine something like

336
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,344
ratings.
So you don't have to go through these 

337
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,524
institutions that until now have meant 
that only a relative few people could 

338
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:40,790
participate in the conversation.
But do you fear the wild west factor?

339
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,400
The I do the best job I can,
but people sometimes say to me,

340
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,570
Dave,
you're the only person I trust,

341
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:45,300
and I go,
man,

342
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,133
this is a huge problem.
I'm I'm doing the best that I can truly 

343
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,260
ready to transition.
Yeah,

344
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,480
and the wild west actually wasn't that 
bad in a way.

345
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,490
There's a book by Terry Anderson and PJ 
hill called the knots of wild wild west.

346
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,693
If they talk about the California gold 
fields and the fact that people came up 

347
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:07,920
with ways of allocating property rights 
and adjudicating disputes,

348
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,060
so for a little while,
yes,

349
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,920
it was bad,
but people realized,

350
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,940
wait,
this sucks.

351
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,330
We can do better than this,
and they organize themselves.

352
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:18,150
So I think within five years we're going
to look back on this.

353
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,720
Time is a time of transition,
but not as a time of catastrophe.

354
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,883
New institutions are going to emerge 
because the ability to curate and 

355
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:26,934
provide news that people can rely on as 
much fun as it is just always to be 

356
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,134
outraged.
I think we're going to come up with new 

357
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,430
institutions because the stakes are too 
high.

358
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,290
Yeah,
and I hope we do.

359
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,124
I mean,
as someone that's an outsider for that 

360
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,820
crumbling thing,
which I think it should crumble,

361
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,654
I do want some new institutions to exist
because otherwise we're just going to 

362
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,920
filter ourselves into,
into total distance from each other.

363
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,550
We're in a way the the catastrophe that 
is the trump administration,

364
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,263
it means that a whole lot of people.
It happens that the editor for the 

365
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,190
weekly standard,
Bill Crystal is a friend of mine.

366
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,770
His daughter went to Duke.
I know a fan of trump.

367
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,280
Not really a fan of trump in terms of 
conservatism.

368
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,310
That should be great.
He's got a Republican Congress,

369
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:15,270
Republican president,
but he's saying no principals.

370
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:19,170
More important than power.
So for a libertarian,

371
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,950
and obviously you can bill is not a 
libertarians but he's not.

372
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:25,950
He's not a libertarian but.
But for a libertarian,

373
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,800
do you do think trump has been a 
disaster?

374
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,873
Because I can see arguments that make 
some sense libertarian wise in terms of 

375
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,960
some of the state stuff and some of the 
taxes,

376
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,843
stuff that kind of makes sense on a 
traditional libertarian or even 

377
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:38,964
conservative side,
and then some of the bigger government 

378
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:41,394
things that don't make sense.
I think jeff session is the worst 

379
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,110
presidential appointment of my lifetime.
Wow.

380
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,830
He's a disaster.
And that alone,

381
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:53,280
the sort of the no state's rights,
no fourth amendment.

382
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,890
Jeff sessions is terrible.
Uh,

383
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,173
I have some friends including Walter 
Block at Loyola University in New 

384
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,200
Orleans who is hoping that trump will be
something good on foreign policy.

385
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,130
I think you could make that argument.
I don't think that.

386
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,983
I think trump's inability even to 
consider rule of law and the 

387
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,650
constitutional restrictions on the 
presidency.

388
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,993
It make even worse.
The slide that we've been in for an 

389
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,960
expansion of an imperial presidency.
So I,

390
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,833
I worry that all of those bonds are now 
going to be broken and we're going to 

391
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,260
look for the big man,
the Messiah,

392
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,100
and we're just going to trade back and 
forth between different visions of that.

393
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,810
And that can never work.
Yeah,

394
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:40,644
and that goes exactly to where we 
started this conversation about looking 

395
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:43,644
for that and say,
do you think that our institutions are 

396
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:46,680
actually strong enough?
I mean,

397
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,533
I'm believer that these institutions 
still have enough power that if trump 

398
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:55,090
was to do something truly illegal or 
truly overstepping executive authority,

399
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,460
but even though the Republicans Control 
Congress,

400
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,294
that there were,
that we still have enough juice left in 

401
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,230
the system to take care of that.

402
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,640
So that I think would sort of mitigate 
some of my fears about him for sure.

403
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,310
Absolutely.
The system is pretty strong in a way.

404
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,144
So James Madison in federalist 51 said 
that the structure of the government 

405
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,750
should be such that ambition is made to 
counteract ambition.

406
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,330
So you can be Republican member of the 
Senate,

407
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:21,340
but you look in the mirror,
you see your God,

408
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,830
man,
I am a bad ass.

409
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,260
I have the power of the Senate here or 
the president is trying to use executive

410
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:30,094
orders.
I don't like that much because it makes 

411
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:36,931
me less powerful as a senator and so a 
number of people in the Senate,

412
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:42,841
I think we'll use madison's ambition 
must be made to counteract ambition,

413
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,990
insight to limit trump at some point.
Yeah.

414
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,660
So as a guy that I,
I can tell,

415
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:54,661
obviously you're not a big trump fan,
but you still trust in the system.

416
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,313
What do you make of when you hear 
someone like maxine waters constantly 

417
00:21:58,721 --> 00:21:59,554
saying,
we're going to figure out a way to 

418
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:01,390
impeach him,
you know,

419
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,310
like we don't know what it is yet,
but we're going to get there.

420
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,323
That to me,
that is almost more undermining of the 

421
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:07,474
system than the excesses that trump may 
or may not have or may or may not be 

422
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:12,904
doing at the moment.
I agree with everything you said except 

423
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,080
almost.
Oh alright.

424
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,983
It is more undermining of the system so 
we don't have a parliamentary system 

425
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:21,304
where a vote of no confidence is enough.
It takes high crimes and misdemeanors 

426
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:29,200
and I was actually proud of the American
system in 1998 were for no good reason.

427
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:30,034
Bill Clinton.
There's a lot of problems with Bill 

428
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,570
Clinton,
but he was impeached and the sentence of

429
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:35,290
this is stupid.
Well,

430
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,000
I think that that would happen again.

431
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,863
There's the Democrats were very upset 
when there was a movement among 

432
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:45,940
Republicans to say we should impeach a 
Barack Obama.

433
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,320
So I think that this may just be 
background and the,

434
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,323
the nice way to interpret it is it's a 
way for Democrats to raise money from 

435
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,460
their base.
They don't actually mean it,

436
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,910
but it's just red meat out there.
Right.

437
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,660
Which is also pretty horrible.
But just saying it.

438
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,523
Yeah.
Means that you're undermining the rule 

439
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:08,494
of law.
You're actually doing what you say 

440
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:13,540
you're upset at trump for doing.
Yeah.

441
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,403
So is there anyone in politics right now
that you look at and you go these guys 

442
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,780
basically on board with,
with the principles that I believe in.

443
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,730
I mean,
it won't surprise you to learn that.

444
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:28,870
I admire Rand Paul and I actually liked 
the Gary Johnson.

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,833
I really.
Let's talk about him for a little bit 

446
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:32,580
lower.

447
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,680
Let's just talk about him within the 
framework of libertarian politics.

448
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,514
I've had him on the show.
I spend time with him about a half hour 

449
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,514
before we were on air.
I think he is a totally lovely guy 

450
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,710
really,
and I enjoyed talking to him and I could

451
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:49,490
see us being friends actually,
but the candidacy was pretty terrible.

452
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,940
It was the greatest ever.
It was three times as much as we've ever

453
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,310
gotten before.
We got three percent.

454
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,523
That's amazing.
That's enough for ballot access in many 

455
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,370
states.
But do you think that might've just been

456
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:03,170
a function of disgust with the other 
two,

457
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,004
that sort that gary himself,
that unfortunately just seemed ill 

458
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:06,554
equipped to be up there and have enough 
of a command of the issues and by the 

459
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:10,694
way I say that with total sympathy for 
him because there was nothing he could 

460
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,450
do to get in the news except flood.

461
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,770
They would only talk about it when he 
floods,

462
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:16,604
so he was in an unwinnable position.
He is so much better than anything else 

463
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,590
that we have had and I mean I'm actually
a libertarian partisan.

464
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:27,020
I ran for governor of North Carolina in 
2008.

465
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,170
I did not win.
What we're going to get to that.

466
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,690
Well,
I campaigned with Gary Johnson.

467
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,280
I got,
I got to know him pretty well.

468
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,180
Yes.
He flubbed that.

469
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,043
He was tired.
He made a bunch of mistakes and that's 

470
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,734
what the media emphasized.
It was really important that he got 

471
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,660
three percent and in fact,
if you were to look,

472
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,330
suppose you strip away the party labels 
and you're a visitor from Mars.

473
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,223
Yeah,
well there's this person who has been a 

474
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,720
secretary of state and has experienced 
as a senator,

475
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,883
and then there's these two people who 
were multiterm governors have pretty 

476
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:03,290
mixed states and then some psycho person
in real estate.

477
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,990
You don't think.
All right,

478
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:08,240
those are the libertarian candidate.
So I.

479
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,340
my question would be compared to what I 
thought,

480
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,660
Gary Johnson did a great job.
He does.

481
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,543
He did the best libertarian candidate 
has ever done and he gave us something 

482
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,670
to build on.
Did I cringe at the Aleppo incident?

483
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,080
Of course,
yeah.

484
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,850
Well that's the thing I.
In August I,

485
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,783
I endorsed him basically with the idea 
of let's get the guy to 15 percent so 

486
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,144
that at least for one debate,
because we know the Democrats and 

487
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,144
Republicans control the debates at least
for one debate because they'd never let 

488
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:37,190
them in in second line,
but at least for one,

489
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,090
let's hear some of these law limited 
government ideas and unfortunately there

490
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:41,924
just wasn't enough juice there.
But you know what I'm hearing you and 

491
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,163
maybe I will ease off him.
A little question is compared to what 

492
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,950
you got three percent.

493
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,040
The best we ever did was one percent.
All right.

494
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,990
So then what does that mean to you?
Is the,

495
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:54,824
is the future for the Libertarian Party 
and do you think that a third party 

496
00:25:58,851 --> 00:25:59,684
actually,
ah,

497
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,550
if,
if that three percent means something to

498
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:03,800
you,
do you think that that means it could be

499
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,570
six percent in 20,
20?

500
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,400
Could it,
could it be really impactful in 20,

501
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:11,690
23rd parties in a system of first past 
the post,

502
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:12,524
which is what we have.
You're always going to have two main 

503
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:16,544
parties in a first past the post system,
but the positions of the parties will 

504
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:22,394
depend partly on the pressure that's 
bought brought to bear and if you have 

505
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:28,580
someone who can participate in debates,
particularly at the state level,

506
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:29,414
you can remind the two state sponsored 
parties of the things that are in their 

507
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:33,854
platform that they're leaving out,
so I don't think a third party is going 

508
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:39,290
to win,
but what I care about is the policies,

509
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,470
not the face of number.
I care about rules and not the people.

510
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,763
So if the two state sponsored parties 
are obliged by opening up to the 

511
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,383
scolding wins of competition and they 
have better policies that that's what I 

512
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:53,700
hope that the third parties can do.

513
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,663
Yeah.
I hear people on the right all the time 

514
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:56,021
say,
well,

515
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:56,854
if we back a libertarian,
what you end up doing is splitting the 

516
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:01,570
vote on the right and then you help 
people on the left.

517
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,763
How would you explain to somebody that 
may not matter and maybe that has to 

518
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:06,600
happen?

519
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,433
Well,
you only get one vote and sometimes 

520
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:13,830
people do advocate what political 
scientists call voting.

521
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:18,210
The Lote lesser of two evils.
If you vote for the lesser of two evils,

522
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:19,690
you're certainly going to get an eval,
right?

523
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,083
The only way to waste your vote is to 
vote for a candidate you don't actually 

524
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:26,550
want,
and if you vote for a candidate that you

525
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:29,400
do want,
that's going to give a signal to the two

526
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:30,234
state sponsored parties that we don't 
find this to be acceptable so that all 

527
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,930
your votes are wasted.
They don't determine the outcome.

528
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,063
Now,
what I get then is conservatives 

529
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:42,090
particularly saying,
what if everyone thought that way?

530
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,190
Ah,
agenda,

531
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:48,030
you are so your vote affects thousands 
of others.

532
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,040
No.
You have one vote.

533
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:50,874
You can choose to waste it,
or you can vote what you actually 

534
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:56,880
believe and try to send a signal.
Yeah.

535
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,723
Which I think would be more important 
than just throwing it away or I would 

536
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:03,974
think that there.
I think we've gotten stuck in this 

537
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:09,590
lesser of two evils as the two parties 
have gotten more and more evil.

538
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,633
Yeah.
Do you think part of that also is that 

539
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:15,200
the whole system now,
when I say the system,

540
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:17,210
I mean our political system and our 
media system,

541
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,540
there's only a certain type of person 
who would run that and now we can talk a

542
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:25,070
little bit also about your 2008 
campaign,

543
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,600
but that it would take,
you know,

544
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,434
the idea,
the idea of having to deal with what 

545
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:29,354
your family will have to deal with.
They're going to track down every email 

546
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:36,020
that you ever had an affair or whatever 
it is.

547
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:36,854
Just all of that nonsense.
You're only gonna get a certain type of 

548
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:41,270
person that wants to do this and adding 
that.

549
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:45,200
Basically.
Good decent people will self select out.

550
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,034
I hear this all the time.
Every time I see somebody I talked to 

551
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,760
somebody that I think should be in 
politics,

552
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,620
they wouldn't want to subject myself to 
that,

553
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,600
but many guests here that privately.
I've said,

554
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,500
you want to run for something and 
everyone.

555
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,740
Nope,
never.

556
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,253
There's really two problems.
One is the process of running is very 

557
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:03,244
difficult,
takes a lot of time and you constantly 

558
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:10,150
have your motives questioned and it's 
psychologically very difficult.

559
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,253
The other problem is if you win,
you have to serve and a lot of people 

560
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:17,800
that are really good at things are 
really good at things.

561
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,120
They're doing something else,
so you have to be the sort of person who

562
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,333
that.
I don't want to say too much about 

563
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:27,880
Donald Trump,
but who just thinks of yourself as being

564
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:32,290
essentially infallible.
And the problem is we as voters validate

565
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,124
that.
So I found often in debates and talking 

566
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:36,934
to people,
voters would ask a question about some 

567
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,920
policy and I said,
well that's actually complicated.

568
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,754
That's something experts disagree about.
Here are the two arguments and you can 

569
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:48,250
see their eyes glazing over and my 
opponents would say,

570
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,800
I know exactly the right thing to do and
here it is.

571
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,510
And then they would say something 
stupid,

572
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,640
but that wins.
I know what to do is always going to win

573
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:58,810
over.
This is heart.

574
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,220
Yeah.
Which is also a great argument for small

575
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:06,370
government to admit it.
Every now and I don't know what to do,

576
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,180
so maybe we shouldn't be,
uh,

577
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,023
you know,
passing just things that are going to 

578
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:10,624
completely change the system because the
truth is nobody knows what comes out on 

579
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:15,160
the other side and the fact that 
something is a problem doesn't mean that

580
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,290
there's a solution.
So the,

581
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,000
I,
I call that the,

582
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,970
we should do something problem x is a 
problem.

583
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,560
You're right,
we should do something.

584
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,640
Why is something therefore we should do 
y?

585
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,660
It doesn't follow the fact that 
something should be done,

586
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,441
but then they'll say,
well,

587
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:33,274
you don't care about x,
so of unemployment and poverty are 

588
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:37,654
problems.
And so there are these things that we 

589
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:40,320
should do.

590
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,051
Right?
And I said,

591
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:41,980
well,
those things won't work.

592
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,860
Oh,
you hate pork.

593
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,770
And it's almost impossible to,
to extricate yourself out of that.

594
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,250
Right.
Sorry.

595
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,250
So you ran as libertarian candidate for 
governor of North Carolina in 2008.

596
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,680
So first off,
within a year,

597
00:30:56,681 --> 00:31:00,640
I can tell you're a real politic person.
Why not just run as a Republican?

598
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,440
Which would have perhaps given you a 
better shot,

599
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:05,920
just just start.
Just in the reality of,

600
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,350
I live in North Carolina.
Yeah.

601
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,560
Are Democrats or Republicans or 
Republicans or Taliban?

602
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,960
They're there.
They want Sharia law.

603
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,600
Now it's Christian Sharia law.
So this is the real Christian,

604
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,434
right?
I would have come in eighth in a seven 

605
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,090
person primary if I had run as a 
Republican.

606
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,100
So there,
there really is no constituency in North

607
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,850
Carolina among the Republicans for my 
view of conservatism.

608
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,100
But if the,
if the Democrats or Republicans,

609
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:41,050
why not run as a Democrat then the,
I considered running as a Democrat,

610
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,913
but the Democrats have had a machine 
that controlled the state and it was 

611
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:49,030
clear who the nominee was going to be.

612
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,463
I also,
my the reason that I ran was my 

613
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,870
objection to North Carolina's ballot 
access laws.

614
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,690
We have some of the most restrictive 
ballot access laws in the country.

615
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,083
Uh,
if coke and Pepsi could decide on any 

616
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:02,410
soft drinks,
there should be.

617
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:05,620
They would say to the Republicans and 
Democrats actually get to do that.

618
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:09,270
And they think two is the right number.
So all I,

619
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,760
we,
it,

620
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,070
it,
we had to raise about $300,000

621
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:12,904
to get on the ballot and then we could 
never get enough votes to stay on the 

622
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:16,144
ballot.
So eight times we'd spent all this 

623
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:20,020
money,
all this collection of signatures.

624
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,630
Yeah.
I figured that I could get two percent.

625
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:24,730
It takes two percent to stay on the 
ballot.

626
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:28,000
We'd never done that.
So if you set your goals really low,

627
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,850
you can be a success.
I got more than two percent,

628
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,140
so I figured I could do that.

629
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,983
An idea that was my objective is to get 
the two percent and I got two point 

630
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:36,484
eight percent.
Do you think that some of those ideas 

631
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:41,450
that you are running on 2008 have taken 
root in North Carolina?

632
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,523
They were at least mentioned by the 
other candidates and sometimes the 

633
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,390
newspapers would even point this out 
also.

634
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:50,780
I was in for televised debates and in 
some ways I'm their worst nightmare.

635
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,123
I have a phd in economics.
I'm a certain superficial glibness and 

636
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:57,190
no chance of winning so I could answer 
the questions.

637
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:58,490
Yeah,
I haven't got the superficial.

638
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,910
Maybe it'll come or maybe you're very 
effective at it and I've,

639
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,180
I've missed it.
Thank you.

640
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,533
What do you think is the reason that the
libertarians haven't done more at the 

641
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,360
state level?
When people talk about the libertarians,

642
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:12,194
they go,
well,

643
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,510
Gary Johnson or whatever it is,
and yes,

644
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:16,490
there is ramp all but technically he's a
republican.

645
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,200
Absolutely.
There was Justin Amash.

646
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,034
There's a couple people,
but why haven't they done more just on 

647
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,480
the local level?
This seems like a major,

648
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,150
uh,
opening for them coming over here.

649
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,790
I was promising myself.
I wasn't gonna answer this question,

650
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,653
but what the heck go crazy.
I'll say here's what happens at 

651
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,460
libertarian meetings.
The first one,

652
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:35,294
20 or 30 people show up and they're all 
enthusiastic and at the second meeting 

653
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,980
10 people show up and the,
the 10 say,

654
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm really glad those others didn't come
back.

655
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,034
They weren't real libertarians because 
what they're mainly concerned about is 

656
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:50,564
checking each other's papers.
So you can tell if it's a real 

657
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:57,650
libertarian meeting by how long is it 
before there's an argument about whether

658
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:59,810
individuals should be able to own 
nuclear weapons.

659
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,350
Nobody cares about that.
When I was running for governor,

660
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,240
people would say,
would you end the Fed?

661
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah,
I'm running for governor.

662
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,770
Actually this is not set yet,
but I want to know.

663
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,213
So what we really care about is 
ideological purity because if you cared 

664
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,374
about actual policy or winning,
you would suck it up and be a Democrat 

665
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:19,184
or Republican.
So the problem that we have as 

666
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:21,824
libertarians is that I don't think 
people can see themselves as being part 

667
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:28,100
of a political process.
They think of themselves as,

668
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,283
oh,
trey as being outside and truth tellers 

669
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,710
that the keepers of last flickering 
remnant of truth.

670
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,520
And that's just not a very effective 
political strategy.

671
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,503
That's interesting because to me,
after doing this show for about two 

672
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,190
years and having,
you know,

673
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,390
a lot of classical liberals on a lot of 
libertarians,

674
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:48,224
and I've had progressives and 
conservatives and everything that to me 

675
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,753
basically the difference that I see 
between classical liberal and 

676
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:57,980
Libertarian is a little more realistic 
utility for the state.

677
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,650
So when someone comes in with that 
question and says to you,

678
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:01,484
well,
you're going to get rid of the Fed and 

679
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:02,534
you got running for governor.
And also that's a really high level 

680
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:07,130
philosophical thing that we know that to
me it's just,

681
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:10,370
it's just a more realistic approach to 
how to change things.

682
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:11,900
Do.
Do you think that's a fair assessment?

683
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,763
Yes,
and I've made a distinction in a couple 

684
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:15,344
of things that I've written between 
directional and destination as 

685
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:18,464
Libertarians destination.
This libertarians have a particular 

686
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,350
liberty OPA in mind and anything that's 
not like that is out.

687
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,143
Analysts would want to say,
are there policies that we could choose 

688
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,270
that would be cheaper,
lower deficits,

689
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,433
lower the power of the state,
and increased personal responsibility 

690
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:36,704
and liberty.
So an example would be when I was 

691
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:42,690
running for governor,
my educational platform was vouchers and

692
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,800
a lot of people means tested vouchers.

693
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,820
So the poorest 40 percent would get more
school choice.

694
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,260
Many of the wealthy habit.
Now,

695
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,393
uh,
let's have more school choice for the 

696
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,780
very poor and a lot of people on the 
left,

697
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:55,614
we're kind of interested in that.
There's a lot of African American 

698
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:59,820
citizens that are just desperate to get 
their school,

699
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,683
their children into better schools.
Libertarians almost without exception 

700
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:03,601
said,
oh no,

701
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:04,434
the state would be involved in that.
The only acceptable libertarian policy 

702
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:09,750
is the immediate elimination of all 
taxes.

703
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,820
Right?
Again,

704
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,743
this is the part that is not the 
realistic part because they're direct 

705
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,263
their destination lists,
so the destination lists are always 

706
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,960
going to be there.
The Libertarians are,

707
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:23,794
they're going to have any success.
Are gonna have to appeal to the 

708
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:28,200
directionalist in both parties that say,
look,

709
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,034
the government has too many powers.
We may disagree about how far back we 

710
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:32,754
want to move it,
but let's move the train in the other 

711
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:35,310
direction.

712
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,130
We're going the wrong way,
but I think there's a consensus.

713
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:40,380
We should move it back where we get off 
the train.

714
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,950
That's a different question.
Yeah,

715
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,360
but let's change the direction.
What would you say is the easiest way to

716
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:49,530
explain state power?
A state,

717
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,493
local or federal to the person that 
doesn't quite get this to the person 

718
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:57,120
that when you talk about government 
power in government or reach,

719
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,220
they don't.
They just think it's like you're talking

720
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:01,470
about some sort of ephemeral thing that 
doesn't really exist.

721
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,453
What do you think the best argument to 
get them to start understanding the 

722
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:07,080
ideas of why?
Of what liberty really is?

723
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,970
Well,
this is obviously something I've thought

724
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:11,250
about a lot and I haven't really 
succeeded,

725
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,930
so you're asking what the best argument 
it is,

726
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:13,764
but it's very frustrating because people
have a conception of a thing called a 

727
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:19,590
state,
so something I've written a lot about is

728
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:21,240
the unicorn conception of the state.

729
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,733
So imagine that I have a,
a mass transit proposal and what we'll 

730
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:28,884
have is these large carts that are 
pulled by Unicorns and Unicorns are 

731
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,960
great for mass transit because they eat 
rainbows.

732
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,240
There are very strong and their 
flatulent smells like fresh strawberry,

733
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,200
so there's no emission.
He's not know that part.

734
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,640
It's.
There's no emissions problem.

735
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:46,380
That's really great.
Now you could object.

736
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,503
Well,
I think there's a problem with this 

737
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,790
actually because Unicorns don't really 
exist.

738
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,360
Close your eyes.
You see one,

739
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,020
so why they totally exist in the sense 
that I can imagine them.

740
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,423
That's how people think of the state.
When I say here's the state is messing 

741
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,620
up,
well,

742
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:05,454
right,
because we are bad people or we need to 

743
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,920
do is get the right depth better because
I can imagine a state that's doing these

744
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,440
things.
It's very difficult to fight that.

745
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,274
So the argument that I tried to make,
having given that caveat that it's hard 

746
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:18,504
to fight unicorns because that's what 
people want is something they can 

747
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,980
imagine,
not something that exists.

748
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,333
Uh,
but the argument that I actually tried 

749
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:30,630
to make is that every flaw in consumers,
and there are many,

750
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,710
is worse in voters.
So you think consumers are too stupid to

751
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:40,510
be able to choose what size to buy or 
which car to buy.

752
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,333
Voters have all those problems and more 
so my colleague Dan Arielli at Duke who 

753
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,580
writes about rationality and consumer 
problems,

754
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,370
uh,
and once the state to intervene,

755
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,070
there's no such thing as the state.
There's just people.

756
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,263
If we're going to have voters choose 
what these experts are going to make 

757
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,460
people do,
it will be even worse than the market.

758
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,413
Right?
So it's a.

759
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,060
So basically we are the flaw in the 
system in a,

760
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:04,894
in a really perverse way that the best 
system is one that recognizes that and 

761
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:13,120
doesn't try to do too much because if we
give voters enough power,

762
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,390
they'll do what they did in the south 
and afflict minorities.

763
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,250
They'll,
they'll or they'll say no.

764
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:22,084
Same sex marriage.
There's no reason to think that if you 

765
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:29,260
take one person who's too stupid to make
his own choices at the grocery store and

766
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:33,940
put them together into an angry mob,
they can then choose a good precedent or

767
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,610
a good f,
the food and Drug Administration.

768
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,803
So let's talk about that mob for a 
second because I sensed that both sides 

769
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,130
right now are being led by their mob.
I see it more on the left,

770
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,630
but I do see it on the right as well.
That just the hysterical people who have

771
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:52,960
all the magical answers who have.
If it was only their messiah.

772
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:53,794
So the hysterical people on the right,
they have their messiah in office right 

773
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,394
now,
but the hysterical people and on the 

774
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,040
left that if they only had Bernie,
it would all be okay.

775
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,833
The middle,
it's hard to get that middle of mob to 

776
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:04,420
get going.

777
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,253
Right?
It was very difficult to be deeply 

778
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:12,391
committed to moderation,
so I'm yates has that poem where he says

779
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,500
the worst are full of passionate 
intensity,

780
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,010
while the best lack all conviction 
because you're thinking,

781
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,180
well,
this is actually hard.

782
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:23,680
There's a bunch of people that think 
it's not hard.

783
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:26,920
They know exactly what to do and 
politics,

784
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,130
if it's gonna work needs to have rules,
institutions,

785
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,080
constitutions that prevent them from 
being able to control the government,

786
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,560
and that's the genius of what our 
Constitution has done.

787
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,813
That separation of powers.
I understand it's really frustrating 

788
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,503
because it means that you feel strongly.
There seems to be majority in favor of 

789
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:50,350
it and yet we still can't do it because 
the president doesn't go along.

790
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:51,184
The Supreme Court doesn't go along.
It means that a lot of times the status 

791
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:59,290
quo is privileged,
but the alternative is to have a mop and

792
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,393
Plato,
when he thought of democracy actually 

793
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,610
talked about too much.

794
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:08,610
Liberty means that you've got the 
butlers that are drunk on,

795
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,990
on liberty's heady wide,
right,

796
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,853
and that they'll say if,
if they find a leader who doesn't give 

797
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:16,360
them too much,
they'll,

798
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:18,670
they'll call them blackbirds and 
oligarchs,

799
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,040
that you should do exactly what we want.
Well,

800
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:25,330
they don't actually know what they want.
So we have a real problem in,

801
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,610
and this is an interesting paradox in 
democracy.

802
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,343
Um,
there was a famous Englishman that said 

803
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:31,924
the reason that we put our leaders' 
heads on stamps is that we can thumb 

804
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:36,644
their noses and lick their hunter park.
So we have both of those attitudes 

805
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,040
towards leaders.
We want them to be better than us and to

806
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:43,874
do what we say is part of this also,
that we think that we need to get our 

807
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:48,194
morals from our leaders too.
And maybe that's changing a little bit 

808
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:53,540
with trump,
but that we thought that,

809
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,440
you know,
they always want you to.

810
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,340
You're going to be married,
you're gonna,

811
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,170
have the perfect family,
we're going to show you the kids.

812
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,153
We know that it's always a fraud and 
they're all cheating on their wives and 

813
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,483
doing all sorts of awful things,
but that we've tried to make our 

814
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:04,724
politicians into be perfect humans,
which again is the Messiah thing you're 

815
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:07,631
talking about,
but it's,

816
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,410
it's just,
it's just show.

817
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,410
Sure.
It's difficult.

818
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,820
We have other things,
you know,

819
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:16,160
there's basketball to watch,
there's,

820
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,100
there's baseball,
there's picnics to go on.

821
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,203
We don't really want to have to watch 
politicians very closely and so we 

822
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,280
substitute.
I was really surprised at this,

823
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:30,281
how little voters knew or cared about 
actual issues and the issue that I,

824
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,790
as a political scientist,
I want to talk about that,

825
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,030
you know,
they're going to drive.

826
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,253
I got it,
girl.

827
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,370
I'm really not interested in that at 
all.

828
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,570
Oh,
but it's an important issue.

829
00:42:38,571 --> 00:42:39,050
Yeah.
I'm,

830
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,010
I'm out.
I'm sorry.

831
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,130
Um,
what they're interested in stead is your

832
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:43,964
character.
So if your character is very much like 

833
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:48,104
them,
it means that you'll go off and when 

834
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:51,950
they're not watching,
they'll do what they would have done.

835
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,640
You will do what they would've done.
Right?

836
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,160
And so they want you to know are,
are you like me in terms of core values?

837
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,803
And that's why family and things like 
that matter is that you're a good 

838
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:03,740
person.
Now,

839
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,430
the problem is that trump is a strange 
misnomer in that is any.

840
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,570
He said the things that many white 
people believed,

841
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,853
trump won a majority of white women.
I think that's the single most 

842
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:20,030
astonishing fact about this election.
Trump won a majority of white women.

843
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,103
And the reason is that the Democrats,
for reasons that I have a hard time 

844
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,620
understanding,
mostly campaigned on a platform of white

845
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:28,490
people suck.

846
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,850
You guys are privileged,
uh,

847
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,163
you.
And there's all sorts of reasons why 

848
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:37,700
actually you can say that that's true.
But as a political strategy,

849
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,130
it didn't work.
And so Clinton,

850
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:41,450
when she said,
why,

851
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,313
how am I not ahead by 50 points,
it's amazing that they didn't recognize 

852
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,240
that they had actually to appeal to a 
majority of Americans,

853
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,343
not to try to put together a coalition 
of disparate interest groups that are 

854
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:58,580
united by nothing except the promise 
that they're going to get paid off.

855
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,680
So that goes directly to social justice.
Which I talk about all the time,

856
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,993
I assume you see this as a as a pretty 
big threat to the way our political 

857
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:09,740
system should work,
right?

858
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,140
It sounds good.
Social injustice,

859
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,333
but in in reality,
it's creating these competing interests 

860
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:18,500
that have to sort of knock each other 
down a peg.

861
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,900
We're all in favor of justice and social
justice means that we have a system that

862
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:24,734
works.

863
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,473
I see social justice as the claim that 
there shouldn't be any unearned and to 

864
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,880
the extent that people think they've 
been denied something,

865
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:40,290
that's where this social justice warrior
impulse comes from and it's particularly

866
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,124
interesting being on college campuses to
see what social justice warriors have 

867
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,020
done where they won't even allow other 
people to speak.

868
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,273
So there's A.
There's a broad problem of free speech 

869
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:53,754
and social justice and then the problem 
on college campuses that I have to deal 

870
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:58,974
with often personally,
the the social justice warriors and 

871
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:02,724
academic freedom,
which is a little bit different from 

872
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,240
free.
Freedom of speech.

873
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:08,420
Academic freedom is a different concept,
[inaudible],

874
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,263
but the,
the,

875
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,410
the,
the social justice impulse to the extent

876
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:18,330
that it's a number of people have said,
but I think Milton Friedman said it.

877
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,420
If you take money from a and give it to 
be,

878
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,520
it's likely be will vote for you.

879
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,673
That doesn't mean that it's the right 
thing to do just campaigning with other 

880
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:31,170
people's money.
And so all of us are clever.

881
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,004
We can come up with reasons why you 
should get something and you should get 

882
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:35,490
something in,
you should get something,

883
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,830
but at some point you run out of other 
people's money.

884
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,870
Yeah.
And you've just split.

885
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:44,190
Now this thing into a gajillion things.
So discussing this on,

886
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,800
on the campus front,
um,

887
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,083
how bad is it on campuses right now?
I talked to professors all in all sorts 

888
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:55,380
of different disciplines and almost 
everybody says it's pretty terrible.

889
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,753
I'm really spoiled because I'm at Duke.
So I mean you've probably heard about 

890
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:02,820
how bad Charles Murray's visit to duke 
was.

891
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:07,170
Probably didn't because it was fine.
We had Charles Murray in.

892
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,060
Oh wait,
which was the one that got me there,

893
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,120
which was the one that was the whole 
thing.

894
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,320
There was a,
uh,

895
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,670
a number of places that Charles Murray 
tried.

896
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:17,370
Oh,
okay.

897
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,960
Okay.
I've turned out really badly.

898
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:19,823
He came to duke.
There were three idiots with booboos 

899
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:25,380
alien,
and the room was quite.

900
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,720
You couldn't even hear it.
Yeah,

901
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,070
it was fine.
People asked some questions.

902
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:29,904
In fact,
I asked that they ask more rude 

903
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:33,150
questions.
He's a grownup,

904
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,810
is happy to answer aggressive,
rude questions.

905
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:42,170
So I think that the answer is I have an 
odd view probably.

906
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,640
I'm a big fan of safe spaces.
Yeah.

907
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:45,860
So you wrote,
I wanted to ask about it.

908
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:46,694
So you wrote a piece on,
on learn liberty in defensive safe 

909
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:50,760
spaces,
which as I read it,

910
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:53,700
you parse it to a point that actually 
makes some sense to me because I'm not a

911
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:55,530
safe space guy.
So take it away.

912
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,270
Well,
it's an attempt at judo,

913
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,563
obviously I'm using safe space in a way 
where people who were in favor of safe 

914
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:02,881
spaces,
they go,

915
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:03,420
yeah,
yeah.

916
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,260
Wait,
what?

917
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,390
Right.
So you,

918
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:06,343
you kind of flip it.
So can you explain to me the main 

919
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:12,570
principle universities are operating on 
is not freedom of speech.

920
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:15,330
We can say anything you want,
but academic freedom,

921
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,193
which means that you can go off into 
little groups and be insulated from 

922
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:23,640
people that you disagree with so you can
work on something.

923
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:28,020
So the political scientists are working 
on something in a particular way.

924
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,940
Sociology is working on something in a 
particular way.

925
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:31,803
We have communities of scholars that 
work on things and in our talks there's 

926
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:37,180
a bunch of things that are shared 
premises,

927
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:41,860
shared assumptions and we're going to 
try to advance without constantly having

928
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:46,450
to confront all of the other possible 
ways of thinking about this.

929
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,270
Right?
So,

930
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,750
so you're describing that as a safe 
space.

931
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,690
But I,
I feel like that's not exactly what the,

932
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,490
uh,
like I don't know that many people would

933
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:56,440
argue that that isn't okay.

934
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,670
Right.
Even the people that are a safe space,

935
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,280
but the,
then we can go on to,

936
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,800
to,
to raise the question.

937
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:03,783
And Van Jones has this amazing video 
where he makes exactly the right 

938
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:10,054
argument.
I think what you cannot do is annex the 

939
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:15,820
entire university as a safe space.
You cannot say,

940
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,940
I want to be all across the university 
safe from anything that I disagree with.

941
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,953
So the,
it's the very fact that there's these 

942
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:25,024
different safe spaces that nearly ensure
there's going to be somebody working on 

943
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:32,800
things you totally disagree with and 
they have to be safe within that space.

944
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,320
You don't get to,
uh,

945
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,453
prevent them from doing that.
So I think we need safe spaces for 

946
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:42,660
examples for fraternities and that's 
the,

947
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,481
you know,
the safe space.

948
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:47,110
People are near the fraternities,
you know,

949
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,040
people need to be able to come up with 
associations.

950
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,400
So there's five freedoms that are 
guaranteed in the first amendment and we

951
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,234
forget freedom of association.
Freedom of association means I get to 

952
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:59,134
choose the people that I hang out with 
and if I want to have a club or 

953
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:05,230
organization and we have rules and we 
want to talk about the stuff,

954
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:06,290
we want to talk about,
inhibin,

955
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,950
the speakers that we want,
even if it's Milo.

956
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,230
Okay?
But people seem to be lost and confused.

957
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,093
I see.
Even with the guests that we choose 

958
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:17,524
here,
if I choose one person to love me for a 

959
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:20,943
year,
then I put on one person who they don't 

960
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:25,210
like.
Suddenly they they prescribe all of that

961
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,310
person's beliefs onto me.
I go,

962
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:29,480
well,
I was just asking them questions and and

963
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,160
listening to the answers and you can 
either turn it off or maybe you'll learn

964
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:33,994
something.
So John Stuart mill has this great idea 

965
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:37,294
of education where he says it requires 
collision with error and the way I try 

966
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:41,314
to explain it to people is,
and I think this happens much more on 

967
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:44,614
the left,
that a lot of the young students on the 

968
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,990
left have just learned one move chess 
openings.

969
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,393
They moved upon in front of their king 
out two spaces and then their patted on 

970
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:55,864
the head until good liberal and somebody
knows a five move chess opening in 

971
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:03,040
response.
They're really upset.

972
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,200
Can you do that?
Well,

973
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,303
you must be a bad person and in fact 
we're going to prevent that because I 

974
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:10,444
don't know why your argument is false.
The only possible explanation is that 

975
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,180
it's evil,
is that you're a racist bigot.

976
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:17,014
Homophobic Saturday because they've 
never actually had to confront people 

977
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:20,374
that they disagreed with,
so collision with error means that 

978
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:24,034
you're constantly trying to improve your
own views because if you find someone 

979
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,680
you disagree with,
one of two things is true.

980
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,173
Either you are right,
but you don't know the reasons and you 

981
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:34,874
should think about it because not 
knowing the reasons is a lot like not 

982
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:38,804
knowing the truth.
Memorizing some catechism of truths is 

983
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:43,850
not what college is about.

984
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,270
It's learning reasons and being able to 
reason critically.

985
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,230
You can't do that unless you know the 
best argument against your position.

986
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:53,600
So one of the things that I'm pretty 
judgmental about this,

987
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,080
I'll ask people that's an interesting 
claim.

988
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:59,030
What do you think is the best counter 
argument to that?

989
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,081
And if they say,
well,

990
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:02,840
there isn't one we're done,
you don't know anything.

991
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,310
But if they say,
you know,

992
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,144
there's actually two that I have a real 
problem with and I think I can answer 

993
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:09,230
them.
But they're interesting arguments.

994
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,860
That person's an intellectual.
Yeah.

995
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,013
It's funny because some of my best 
moments you can see the way I interview 

996
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:15,410
with them.
I'm really,

997
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:16,244
I haven't looked at it the notes once 
and I'm trying to hear you and just go 

998
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:18,794
where it feels natural,
but some of my best moments on the show 

999
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,750
I think are where someone has pinned me 
into thinking,

1000
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:24,650
wait a minute.

1001
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,560
I really have to reevaluate something 
and I.

1002
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:27,394
and that's how.
That's how you evolve and that's how 

1003
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:29,354
most of us are.
And yet we've so that go with that in 

1004
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:34,970
the public and I think some of it's 
generational.

1005
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:35,804
A lot of the young students just have 
never thought about the problem of 

1006
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:41,924
having to learn by arguing.
So one of the things that I do in class 

1007
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:50,840
and it's it worked better than I thought
was I divide the students into pairs and

1008
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,940
they have to choose a question.
They're going to debate.

1009
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,003
And then on the day of the debate and 
the debates or 30 minutes on the day of 

1010
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
the debate,
both of them hold up big ass yellow dice

1011
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,650
because there's not enough ritual in our
lives.

1012
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,090
So you have to hold the dice over your 
head and you roll it.

1013
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:05,924
And whoever gets the higher role gets to
choose which side that know which side 

1014
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:11,810
you're arguing until that moment.

1015
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,430
Yeah.
How does that go?

1016
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,343
It they love it because they actually.
They pay much more attention now to 

1017
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:21,110
things they disagree with because they 
wouldn't understand it.

1018
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:24,740
They may have to argue it.
Do you find that sometimes the ones that

1019
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:25,574
are arguing things they don't believe 
actually do a better job because of 

1020
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:29,470
that,
because they're actually there.

1021
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,620
Do they have to do more intellectual 
work and they're not so emotional?

1022
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:37,130
Where I have an attachment to a 
particular position,

1023
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,670
it's hard for me to explain it because I
just know it's right.

1024
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,563
Yeah.
Whereas if it's an argument I don't 

1025
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,784
agree with,
I'm thinking of it logically step by 

1026
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:48,770
step and I'm presenting evidence.
So in a lot of times they end up saying,

1027
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:49,130
well,
yeah,

1028
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:49,963
I kind of got to change my mind.
That's not really what I believed after 

1029
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:53,054
all.
Or at least I can see why someone would 

1030
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,010
believed the opposite.

1031
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,410
That's what education is.
Yeah.

1032
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,130
So it sounds like your situation at Duke
is pretty good and maybe they've.

1033
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,293
They've managed to figure out the free 
speech thing a little bit better than 

1034
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:06,914
most universities.
Duke is really committed to it and the 

1035
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,280
thing is it's not very hard thing to 
commit to.

1036
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,620
So our previous president,
Namco hands,

1037
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,480
the best college president I've ever 
seen,

1038
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,853
and there was an incident where David 
Horowitz had bought this ad about how 

1039
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,650
reparations for slavery were racist and 
you know,

1040
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:28,170
it was pretty incendiary and I didn't 
like the ad.

1041
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,510
I thought it was out of line,
but the newspaper,

1042
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:35,511
the Duke Chronicle had allowed the David
Horwitz to purchase a one page ad.

1043
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,120
Now he had done that in a number of 
newspapers.

1044
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:41,910
You did it at Brown University at Brown 
University.

1045
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:42,744
They had a ceremonial burning of the 
newspapers on the steps of the admin 

1046
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:49,080
building in which the president 
participated.

1047
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,780
That's horrible.
At Duke,

1048
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:54,570
what Nan Cohan said was,
it's a newspaper.

1049
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,490
You want to buy an ad?
Go ahead.

1050
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,880
Right.
That's not a very hard position to take.

1051
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,600
It's a newspaper.
I might not have taken that as editor.

1052
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:07,650
I'm not editor.
You want to contested by Annette,

1053
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,430
so do you think that the students or the
faculty or whatever it was at Brown when

1054
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:12,264
they do that sort of thing,
do you think they realized that they 

1055
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,710
ultimately strengthen the ideas that 
they're going up against?

1056
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,780
So for example,
I've had David Horowitz on the show.

1057
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:20,910
I think he's a decent guy.
I agree with them on some stuff,

1058
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:21,360
you know,
he,

1059
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,193
he was a former leftist and I think 30 
years ago was struggling with a lot of 

1060
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:27,090
the issues that I'm thinking about these
days.

1061
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,610
Um,
but basically I sat across from him.

1062
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:30,900
I thought he's a decent guy.

1063
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,003
I didn't think he was some right wing 
maniac or all the things that they say 

1064
00:54:34,111 --> 00:54:36,800
about him so that when they then,
you know,

1065
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,643
burn the newspapers or whatever,
and then now you have people doing a 

1066
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:42,420
little research on him and then they may
go,

1067
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,320
well,
this isn't all crazy what he's saying.

1068
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,890
They'll look at the reaction to him that
all the one alternative would be looking

1069
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,470
in the newspaper and said,
oh Geez,

1070
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,900
that would be the same.
Wasted all that money because you're not

1071
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:56,780
persuaded by it either though,
boy,

1072
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,940
as if people are paying that much 
attention to newspaper ads,

1073
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:00,451
you know?
Well,

1074
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:03,750
they did after the administration at 
Brown burned it,

1075
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,800
that got so much attention.
So if nothing else,

1076
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:10,530
it certainly does validate two claims,
one,

1077
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:15,890
the university is not capable of holding
legitimate discussions or confrontations

1078
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:17,370
with ideas you disagree with.

1079
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,563
And the other is,
I'm going to look at this ad and see 

1080
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:21,900
what it says because it's pretty 
controversial.

1081
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,370
Yeah.
So,

1082
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:25,110
uh,
we've got about 50 minutes and we really

1083
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:26,760
haven't done that much on economics.
So I do,

1084
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:28,450
I want to shift a little bit,
um,

1085
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,753
because to me it seems that economics,
if we could get the economic system to 

1086
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:36,090
work right,
whatever that means,

1087
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,580
that it does resolve a lot of the 
political things.

1088
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,480
Basically if people have jobs and can,
you know,

1089
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,000
buy some stuff and feel that they own 
property and things of that nature,

1090
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,030
that those other things will become less
important.

1091
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:48,571
I,
I,

1092
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:49,404
that's my basic belief.
Do you think that's a fair premise to 

1093
00:55:51,571 --> 00:55:53,930
start off with?
It's interesting that so many things are

1094
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,940
going on at once because uh,
the most recent reason magazine John Nih

1095
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,990
at George Mason University has this 
brilliant article about inequality.

1096
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,900
So it is true that if you look at income
levels,

1097
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:10,830
there's more inequality and the reason 
is there's more rich people and the rich

1098
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:14,190
have gained by more than the poor,
but the poor have gained a lot.

1099
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,970
So,
but let's compare this to 1800 and 1800.

1100
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,760
The mode of transportation of the 
wealthy.

1101
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:23,620
It was very different from the poor.
Now,

1102
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,603
if I'm really rich,
maybe I have a tesla and you have a 

1103
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,650
dodge minivan.
Chevy Equinox leased it,

1104
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,980
it,
it's not that different really.

1105
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:35,170
It has air conditioning works pretty 
well.

1106
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:37,630
It gets the,
of the tesla gets good gas mileage,

1107
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,070
but if there's some sort of status 
difference,

1108
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,630
but,
but we're basically doing the same thing

1109
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,750
the same.
Yeah,

1110
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,920
we've got an internet connection at 
home.

1111
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:50,300
We've got a nice television.
Uh,

1112
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,630
we've got a computer,
we've got a laptop,

1113
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:56,290
we've got a cell phone.
There are some differences in status,

1114
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,363
but there's never been more equality in 
the basic way that people live their 

1115
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:01,054
lives and the the difference in if you 
look at the difference in life 

1116
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:09,280
expectancy between the wealthy and the 
port used to be enormous child mortality

1117
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:10,240
rates,
it was enormous.

1118
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:14,020
It's converged.
Our biggest problem is not starvation.

1119
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:14,854
It's obesity,
so there has never been a time of 

1120
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:20,140
greater equality.

1121
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,380
Now I know some people are going to hear
that and go,

1122
00:57:22,381 --> 00:57:23,550
ah,
you libertarians.

1123
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:26,490
What he's saying is you people on the 
bottom habit tv,

1124
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:27,640
have a cell phone,
have a.

1125
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,030
What about the people that don't have 
that stuff?

1126
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:30,864
Now again,
what you're saying though is that most 

1127
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:32,844
of the,
the bottom has sort of moved up to have 

1128
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,900
a decent level,
but what about that other?

1129
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,350
What's the libertarian view of how you 
help or not help the,

1130
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,090
the people that don't have that

1131
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:45,440
baseline?
Two things.

1132
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:46,274
One,
when historians look back at the period 

1133
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:49,964
between 1945 and 2010,
the great story is the worldwide 

1134
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,650
elimination of policy of poverty through
capitalism.

1135
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,330
Every country that has chosen markets 
has dramatically improved.

1136
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,910
Not just the average but the least.
Well off China,

1137
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:08,744
India,
poverty is disappearing around the 

1138
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:11,690
world.
If by poverty,

1139
00:58:11,691 --> 00:58:12,524
use some objective measure.
If you have a subjective or comparative 

1140
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:16,340
measure,
yes,

1141
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:18,550
it's a problem because there's always 
going.

1142
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:22,250
There's always going to be one fifth of 
the people in the bottom 20 percent.

1143
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,860
Just the definition.
I'm not a mathematician,

1144
00:58:24,861 --> 00:58:25,730
but I can go.
Yeah,

1145
00:58:25,731 --> 00:58:26,564
that.
Yeah,

1146
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,733
so that's one thing is the allowing 
markets solves poverty in a way that no 

1147
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:34,394
government program ever could.
It's better to have a job than a 

1148
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:38,330
handout.
On the other hand,

1149
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:43,040
I have written quite a bit about my own 
support for universal basic income.

1150
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:44,743
So I think universal basic income is a 
better solution than the hodgepodge of 

1151
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:50,810
different intrusive programs that we 
have now.

1152
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:56,470
And let me explain briefly why.
So what we have is a system,

1153
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,810
and I wrote a pretty incendiary paper 
about this.

1154
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,793
The state is just is a bad polygamist,
so if you're a single mother and you 

1155
00:59:06,321 --> 00:59:09,380
have three children,
if you do one of two things,

1156
00:59:09,381 --> 00:59:10,214
you'll lose your support from the 
polygamist if you get a job or get 

1157
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:14,594
married.
If you actually do something that 

1158
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,700
achieved some independence for yourself,
your husband,

1159
00:59:19,701 --> 00:59:22,070
the state will,
we'll we're getting a divorce,

1160
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,120
right?
I don't care.

1161
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,370
I mean you can have more children,
you can have affairs,

1162
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:28,670
but you have to be committed to me.
You can only get support from me,

1163
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:33,320
which means that you can't do any of the
things that normally we would expect.

1164
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,420
And this is a conservative position.
I suppose.

1165
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:39,650
Family and jobs are good things.
Being married and having a job as a good

1166
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:40,484
thing,
we have what many people even on the 

1167
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:48,341
left have called the cliff effect of a 
benefits.

1168
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,570
If I'm in section eight,
housing and I,

1169
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,890
I get subsidies for food,
I get subsidies for school.

1170
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,360
The first $10,000
that I earned costs me $12,000

1171
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,970
in benefits.
So the poor aren't lazy.

1172
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,230
They're rational.
Right?

1173
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,280
So there,
there really,

1174
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:06,730
it's just a realistic gay,
I don't want,

1175
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,510
I don't want to say game.
They're not playing a game,

1176
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:09,344
but it's a.
they're making calculations in that 

1177
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:13,000
technical sense.
Yes.

1178
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,600
The,
they have choices.

1179
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,250
They have strategies.
Those have payoffs.

1180
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,660
Yeah.
It's unsurprising.

1181
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:20,600
They pick the ones that make them better
off because they're desperate.

1182
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:24,050
They can't afford to lose this money.
So for example,

1183
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:29,051
if you're living in subsidized housing 
in a decent area with a decent school,

1184
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:32,210
and even if you don't want those 
handouts,

1185
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,140
well then you realize,
wow,

1186
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,440
I'm gonna have to work in a third job 
now and then,

1187
01:00:35,441 --> 01:00:36,860
and they're going to force me to move.

1188
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,830
I see a much worse place to live.
I can't afford childcare,

1189
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:45,030
so the state is a bad polygamist let's 
stop doing that and let's say,

1190
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:47,960
and another problem as I see it as 
minimum wage now,

1191
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:51,260
the effects of minimum wage on overall 
employment economists debate,

1192
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,430
but it's almost certainly true that it's
very difficult for people to get a first

1193
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:56,264
job or require the experience that 
allows them to start the staircase to 

1194
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:00,674
the American dream.
So the unemployment rate in some urban 

1195
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:08,180
areas for like 15 to 25 year old,
so there's 40,

1196
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,014
50 percent there.
There's no way for people to find a 

1197
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:12,620
first job.
Why do we do that?

1198
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:15,620
While we want to say people should be 
able to live on this,

1199
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:16,454
it's not clear why your first job should
be something you should be able to live 

1200
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:19,430
on.
Yeah,

1201
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,960
and if any,
if you even bring that up,

1202
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:21,860
people get upset.

1203
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,810
Well,
except I say,

1204
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,560
you know,
you're right.

1205
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,393
Let's make sure that they can live.
Let's give them universal basic income 

1206
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,693
and if they want to get a job at $3 an 
hour because that's how you get 

1207
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:32,720
experience in Europe.
In Germany,

1208
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:33,913
if you serve an apprenticeship,
you're making two or $3 an hour after 

1209
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:37,364
two years you have enough experience,
you can now get a job that makes $30 an 

1210
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:42,560
hour.
So it's an education.

1211
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:43,394
So to me,
universal basic income that's given 

1212
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,123
without strengths.
We take the money that we're spending 

1213
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:51,980
now,
which is enough to give at least $12,000

1214
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:52,814
per poor people.
So you take the amount that we spend 

1215
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,810
divided by the number of where are taken
that from.

1216
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,243
Well all of these different subsidy 
program to all of the subsidy programs 

1217
01:02:00,831 --> 01:02:04,040
then go to.
So we including social security.

1218
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,810
So we eliminate all those.

1219
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,663
Yeah.
Use that money to give everyone a 

1220
01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:12,050
universal basic income and if they get a
job,

1221
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:13,460
they don't lose it.
If they get married,

1222
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,470
they don't lose it.
They can use it for childcare.

1223
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,603
One of the problems that people have now
is it's very specifically tied a 

1224
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,124
location,
so I can't go somewhere where there's a 

1225
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,810
job because I won't be able to establish
myself.

1226
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,550
Universal basic income if it's federal 
means that if I'm living in Cleveland,

1227
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,010
Ohio,
I can't find a job.

1228
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,930
There are jobs in Texas or North 
Carolina.

1229
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:36,960
When I get there,
I get universal basic income.

1230
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,160
I can establish myself,
I can pay for childcare,

1231
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,013
I can look for a job,
and they actually are jobs in those 

1232
01:02:41,971 --> 01:02:42,804
places.
Do you find a conflict between your 

1233
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:45,324
libertarian self and your economists 
self on this because it seems like the 

1234
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,990
idea of a libertarian going to state 
should give people money?

1235
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,510
Probably seems like there's some fight 
there.

1236
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,340
Sure.
If you're a destination list,

1237
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,470
if I'm a direction list,
I say,

1238
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:00,270
dude,
we're giving them the money now.

1239
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,350
Right?
We're already doing it.

1240
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,690
We're already doing it.
Let's just give the money.

1241
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:06,180
In a way that's cheaper and increases 
liberty.

1242
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,430
That's the basic directionalist 
argument,

1243
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:09,264
which is why Milton Friedman,
Charles Murray are both in favor of 

1244
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:12,534
universal basic income,
but it has to be a directionless and 

1245
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,220
we're already doing that.
Now you're saying,

1246
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,110
we shouldn't do that.
Great,

1247
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,850
good for you.
We are,

1248
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,540
and unless you have some plan to end 
that and improve things,

1249
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,910
I'll listen to that.
That's not what they say.

1250
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,021
They just say,
well,

1251
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:29,520
the government shouldn't be giving out 
any money.

1252
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:30,383
It already is.
Let's do it in a more efficient way and 

1253
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:33,624
in a way that increases liberty because 
I can then spend that money on what I 

1254
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:38,550
actually want.

1255
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:43,110
We give these vouchers for food,
which I don't really want to buy that.

1256
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:46,140
I want to buy something else.
I sell my food stamps for fifty cents on

1257
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:48,300
the dollar.
If I get money,

1258
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:49,950
I already have one hundred cents on the 
dollar.

1259
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:50,784
Now,
the one objection that people on the 

1260
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:55,080
left when people on the left make is,
well,

1261
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,630
those poor people,
you know how they are,

1262
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,890
they'll spend it on the wrong stuff.
So what I want is that the argument that

1263
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:03,030
people on the,
on the left make,

1264
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,980
I think that isn't that usually from the
right where they'll say,

1265
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:05,814
well it's,
they're going to spend it on for some 

1266
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,453
people,
but a surprising number of people left 

1267
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:10,560
belief that.
Yes.

1268
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:11,603
So one of the things I like about this 
is it sort of divides the usual 

1269
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,370
political split by how paternalistic 
they are.

1270
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,383
There's a whole bunch of people on the 
left that really think experts and 

1271
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,333
honestly rich white people should be 
saying here's how these poor people 

1272
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,050
should be spending their time and money.

1273
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:34,500
Yeah.
Which is probably not.

1274
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,490
Well that shows you that a lot about 
paternalism and authoritarianism and all

1275
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:39,690
that.
So your next book,

1276
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,310
which is called tomorrow,
three point.

1277
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,144
Oh,
this is sort of partly what it's going 

1278
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:44,461
to be about,
right?

1279
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:45,294
Because that we're going to about to go 
into another revolution which is going 

1280
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:49,404
to be a shared economy and technological
revolution and that all sort of plays 

1281
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:54,234
into,
I suppose basic income and just the way 

1282
01:04:56,071 --> 01:04:57,930
technology,
you know,

1283
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,030
ipads and replacing people at 
Mcdonald's.

1284
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:02,880
This is just a fact.
It's interesting,

1285
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:03,803
so Marc Andreessen in November 2011 
wrote a piece for the Wall Street 

1286
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,813
Journal in which he said software eats 
the world and what he meant was that 

1287
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:18,460
software is to serve as jobs as robots.
Automation are to production,

1288
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,323
so we're used to thinking of factories 
as being a transformation from a bunch 

1289
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:25,300
of people,
putting stuff together to machines,

1290
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:27,580
putting stuff together and it's more 
efficient,

1291
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,020
but it means there's fewer jobs.

1292
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:30,303
So capitalism almost always reduces jobs
by increasing productivity as a trump 

1293
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:38,710
was wrong and saying that we're sending 
jobs to China.

1294
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:39,544
The whole world is losing jobs to 
productivity and that's good because 

1295
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:46,570
consumer products are reduced in price 
and it means that we're all wealthier.

1296
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,553
The reason that everyone,
almost everyone can afford a car and a 

1297
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:54,760
cell phone is that the price of those 
things has fallen so much.

1298
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,100
Problem is until now we've said,
well,

1299
01:05:57,101 --> 01:06:00,850
there's always the service economy.
People can always get service jobs.

1300
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:02,103
They can't.
And that's being hastened by the push 

1301
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:08,020
for increased minimum wages.
So in Seattle,

1302
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,300
for example,
if you have a fast food restaurant,

1303
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:11,134
you're probably investigating kiosks.
So you don't have to pay $15 an hour to 

1304
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:19,030
have some guy who really isn't worth $15
an hour at the front desk.

1305
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:19,883
Right.
So the the service jobs are going to be 

1306
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:22,630
taken over by software.

1307
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,603
It's not clear to me that we're going to
be able to take people who are not 

1308
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,443
sufficiently well trained by the state 
education system to be able to work in 

1309
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:38,170
the new economy to make that transition 
very quickly.

1310
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,830
So I think universal basic income,
you can make a static argument.

1311
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:46,090
We're spending the money already so we 
might as well spend it more efficiently.

1312
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,253
But then there's a dynamic argument to 
over time the move to the sharing 

1313
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:52,654
economy probably benefits most of us 
because we can rent rather than own a 

1314
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,940
prices are going to fall dramatically.
We'll need a lot less stuff.

1315
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,220
The sharing economy,
just just so people,

1316
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,590
for the people that don't fully get it.
So basically that you wouldn't even have

1317
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:08,080
to necessarily own your car.
That all of the.

1318
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:11,130
All of the things that we kind of have 
wood,

1319
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:13,330
we'd figure out better ways to use them.

1320
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,163
So you wouldn't have to fork out as much
money for them in the first place and 

1321
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:17,134
we'd figure out,
well I'm going to use it on Tuesdays at 

1322
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:21,210
this time and you're going to use it 
then and the exam that.

1323
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,093
Is that the base?
Sure.

1324
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:25,450
The example that I always use and I 
think people recognize it,

1325
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:26,284
is I have a black BMW 3:30
and I'm just the sort of person you 

1326
01:07:31,721 --> 01:07:34,500
think I am,
that drives a black BMW 3:30.

1327
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:37,990
I zooming in and out.
It's a very expensive car.

1328
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:41,950
I park it at a special shrine at my 
house and I approach it.

1329
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,784
The door opens now it's a garage,
but that's pretty expensive storage and 

1330
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,910
since I worked as an administrator at 
Duke for a long time,

1331
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:51,050
I have the parking space of God.
Yeah,

1332
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:52,053
I can park in a great space.
So my car is really expensive and it's 

1333
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:58,210
always taking up two pieces of real 
estate,

1334
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:01,210
the garage and my parking space at Duke,
which is reserved for me.

1335
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:02,703
When you multiply that by the.
I drive my car 30 slash 40 minutes a 

1336
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:07,264
week.
All the rest of the time it's just 

1337
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:10,384
sitting there.
I think what's going to happen 50 years 

1338
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:13,024
from now is that people are going to 
look back and be astonished at the 

1339
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:16,934
extent to which we were so selfish that 
we wanted to keep stuff so other people 

1340
01:08:20,871 --> 01:08:21,704
couldn't use it and spend a lot of money
storing it so other people couldn't use 

1341
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:26,330
it.
Now,

1342
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,120
to some extent that gives us status.
I'm an old guy.

1343
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:31,960
I probably have pictures of my pathetic 
car on facebook.

1344
01:08:31,961 --> 01:08:33,440
Okay.
Young people don't do that.

1345
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,710
They're more interested in accumulating 
experiences than they are stuff,

1346
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:37,953
so I think that there's a cultural shift
towards a sympathy towards not having 

1347
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:45,440
such a big impact on the environment,
reducing your footprint.

1348
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,083
So if a car is constantly in use instead
of sitting in my garage or a parking 

1349
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:51,704
space all the time,
we'll need far fewer of them will be 

1350
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:56,990
able to have bike lanes because we won't
need to have all this parking space.

1351
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,093
We won't need to have closets or storage
units where we have all this crap that 

1352
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:04,190
we don't even need.
Storage units are pretty amazing.

1353
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,970
We have all of this stuff that you're 
not using it and you never go there.

1354
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,120
Well it,
but somebody else could be using it.

1355
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:11,954
The reason that they're not using it is 
that it's too difficult for you to find 

1356
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,184
that other person software is going to 
change our ability to find someone to 

1357
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:20,534
share it with.
Do you find a little bit that that can 

1358
01:09:22,461 --> 01:09:25,290
be at odds with a individualism that 
you're.

1359
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,450
You're not saying that you wouldn't have
the right to own things right in,

1360
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:29,903
that's not the end conclusion.
Most people I think want the use of 

1361
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:34,664
something and in our current system,
owning it is the cheapest way to have 

1362
01:09:39,831 --> 01:09:43,640
something available to use,
but it's fairly common for.

1363
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,930
I don't.
I have a Tuxedo.

1364
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,690
I don't wear it very often.
Um,

1365
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:50,690
many women have gowns that they wear 
maybe once now.

1366
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:54,650
The reason that they don't rent the gown
is that it's too difficult to find it in

1367
01:09:54,651 --> 01:09:55,484
exactly their size,
but suppose you had an app that could 

1368
01:09:58,461 --> 01:09:59,294
take computer,
laser measurements and get exactly the 

1369
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:02,534
right measurement and it's delivered to 
you two days from now and instead of an 

1370
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:10,660
$800 gown that you wear once it's $100 
rental and it's a designer gown.

1371
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,760
That would be great.
Yeah,

1372
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,320
so everything's changing I think is the 
theme of this hour.

1373
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:19,154
There's a lot changing politically.
There's a lot changing economically and 

1374
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,503
we just gotta be smart enough to 
hopefully not go totally off the ditch 

1375
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:28,280
as we're navigating it.
I'm.

1376
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,173
I'm mostly optimistic because I think 
our institutions are pretty strong and 

1377
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:36,380
people recognize that there's a problem.

1378
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,610
The social media,
the Internet,

1379
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,180
access to software all create 
disruptions,

1380
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,523
but when you look at human history,
a lot of the best things have happened 

1381
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:49,634
after a period of disruption,
but the period of disruption can be 

1382
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,760
pretty bad.
The 18,

1383
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,643
forties and fifties in Europe,
cities were on fire because of the 

1384
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:00,650
industrial revolution.
The result was mostly good,

1385
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:01,843
so the.
It's not clear to me what's going to 

1386
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:04,310
happen,
which again,

1387
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:06,800
is one of the reasons I'm for universal 
basic income.

1388
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:12,100
Let's make sure that those who are least
well off and who are through no fault of

1389
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,010
their find

1390
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,760
themselves not able to work in the 
traditional manufacturing jobs that they

1391
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:18,594
expected to be there.
Let's make sure that there's some 

1392
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:24,090
minimum on how,
on how bad off they are.

1393
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:25,060
Yeah.
It said,

1394
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:25,963
I love the framing of that because it 
really is an argument that transcends 

1395
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,784
the left right thing because you're,
you're hitting them both at their soft 

1396
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,020
spots.
So it's got a nice,

1397
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:34,854
uh,
a nice ability to get some people to 

1398
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:40,851
come together where we'll see that's an 
issue for more Dr Monger.

1399
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,220
Follow him on twitter.
Maybe I'll respond.

1400
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:44,491
Right?
Oh,

1401
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:45,900
you,
you do respond.

1402
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:46,734
So then you wrote a nice piece on learn 
liberty about how when every now and 

1403
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:52,890
again you have an experience that 
actually changes.

1404
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,170
And I'm positive.
There you go,

1405
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,120
uh,
follow Dr Mugler on twitter.

1406
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:58,200
It's at Mongo.
