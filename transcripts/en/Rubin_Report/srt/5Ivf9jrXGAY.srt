1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,903
We're live on location at Stanford 
University and joining me today is an 

2
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:09,810
economist,
author,

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,644
scholar,
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution 

4
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:16,530
and living legend Dr Thomas Soul.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,171
Well,
thank you.

6
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:18,004
Good to be with you.
I feel I have to get the gushing out 

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,050
first.
That way we can focus on the book.

8
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:22,884
I don't know that there is anyone on 
this mortal coil who's writing and 

9
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,860
thinking has influenced me more than 
you.

10
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,990
So this,
this is truly an honor for me and I just

11
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:33,000
have to get that out right at the 
beginning.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,300
I just hope I have ms dot Lazar.
We'll find out.

13
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,770
I'll let you know at the end.
Um,

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,010
so first I thought I wanted to do a 
little bit on your history and I want to

15
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:46,011
focus on your new book,
but I was curious if you have a sense of

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,094
the sort of renaissance that your 
writing is having right now with young 

17
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,310
people because when I tweeted out that 
we finally had you on the show and we've

18
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,440
been trying to make this happen for 
quite some time.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,550
I mean,
thousands of responses and I had tons of

20
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,980
people just say,
please tell him this,

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,390
tell him this.
My awakening was because of Dr.

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,950
how all of this are you noticing 
something happening right now because of

23
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:08,784
the unique place where I only know what 
people tell me that's even true at 

24
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,680
Stanford.
Uh,

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,350
I only know what my,
my research assistants told me.

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,580
Alright,
well I'll certainly accept that.

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,414
Will take my word for it than a.
So I want to talk a little bit about 

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,770
your history for a bit and then we'll,
then we'll move on to your new book.

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,843
A born North Carolina.
Grew up in the bronx to Harlem in 

30
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,131
Harlem.
Sorry,

31
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,420
in Harlem.
Uh,

32
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,060
tell me a little bit about some of your 
formative years.

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,080
Well,
you know,

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,913
I thought about is I was doing the 
research for the first chapter where I 

35
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:47,040
get into birth order thing now had my,
uh,

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,520
my parents,
uh,

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,570
loot a normal lifespan.

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,880
I would have been the sixth trial in the
family.

39
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,140
They died young.
And so I was adopted in infancy,

40
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,523
a family as an only child,
raised as an only child in a home with 

41
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:03,564
four adults.
And in terms of what I found in the 

42
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,400
other researcher on birth order,
clearly that was a huge advantage,

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,913
uh,
until their misfortune was my good 

44
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,040
fortune.
And Moreover,

45
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,130
the family in which I was raised,
moved to New York,

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,540
which at that time had a far superior,
uh,

47
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,440
educational system for that in North 
Carolina and foster period of what it is

48
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,990
today.
Were you always interested in education?

49
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,970
I mean,
even as got to kill it,

50
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,043
a little kid,
there was nothing in my background that 

51
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:38,830
would put me there.
Uh,

52
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,213
but fortunately when in Harlem,
there was a kid named ready that the 

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,153
members of the family had run into 
before I ever arrived from North 

54
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,070
Carolina.

55
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,280
And he was,
he came from a highly educated family,

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,423
uh,
and they immediately saw the 

57
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:56,670
implications if they could get him to,
uh,

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,130
to,
to sort of mentor me.

59
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,380
And now I had,
I had met Eddie on my own chances.

60
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,980
I would never have seen any 
significance.

61
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,000
He was one of the people I pass by,
but of course the,

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,033
the,
the adults understood what the future 

63
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,264
was like and then thinking about things 
that kids don't think about despite the 

64
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:21,340
great worship of a child talkers these 
days.

65
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,500
Uh,
and so,

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,920
so he,
he took me to a public library and I had

67
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:27,754
no idea what a public library was when I
was eight years old and I saw all these 

68
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:32,854
books and I had no idea why we were 
there when I didn't have any money to 

69
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,704
buy one book.
And so what am I going to do with all 

70
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,160
these hundreds of books out on the 
shelf?

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,370
And he very patiently walked me through 
the whole thing.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,593
And again,
I was very reluctant to take out a 

73
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,050
library card because I didn't know what,
what all this is about that.

74
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,163
But he talked me into it and I,
and I bought a couple of books and 

75
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:55,804
really had I not encountered him,
the entire rest of the story could not 

76
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,730
have been the way it was.
I mean,

77
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,450
at some point I would have learned what 
a public library was,

78
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,190
but by that point it would be too late.
Yeah.

79
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,950
I mean,
when,

80
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,310
when you start getting in the habit of 
reading when you're eight years old,

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,753
uh,
that's a different ballgame than if you 

82
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:17,590
had to wait till you're a teenager and 
it's too late now.

83
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,683
Dare I ask if you have any recollection 
what you might've taken out of the 

84
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,090
library at eight years old?

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,670
Uh,
one of the books was adopted.

86
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,830
Do little books.
Uh,

87
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,330
I don't know if you even know what those
are.

88
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,150
He could talk to the animals,
Alice in wonderland and uh,

89
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,000
the rest of them.
But,

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,300
uh,
I came in on May and there wasn't.

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,143
School wasn't open until September,
so I had no one to play with and I was 

92
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,444
just bored to tears.
And so I started reading really for the 

93
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:46,150
first time and I got the habit of 
reading and on that,

94
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,940
you know,
that made the rest possible.

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,873
Yeah.
Were there any other formative things 

96
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,770
that happened to you over those,
those younger years?

97
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,930
Yes.
The same fellow.

98
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,140
It was a very knowledgeable about the 
school system,

99
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:03,430
so when I finished elementary school and
they assigned me to a junior high school

100
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:06,320
in a very bad neighborhood and he told 
me that you,

101
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,540
you can get transferred.

102
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,200
And I in fact got transferred to a much 
better school.

103
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,150
I had,
I gone to that other school.

104
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,200
Uh,
I again,

105
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,670
the story would have been entirely 
different.

106
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,230
Uh,
and I,

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,513
one of the,
one of the themes or the early part of 

108
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,794
the book here is that there are a whole 
number of things you have to come 

109
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,310
together and if you don't have all of 
those prerequisites,

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,090
then whatever good qualities you have 
don't matter.

111
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,670
And I mentioned illiteracy that uh,
you know,

112
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,504
in the middle of the 20th century,
something like 40 percent of the adults 

113
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,860
in the world was still illiterate.
And so it doesn't matter what the native

114
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,020
talent or any of that came along,
you can't read there a whole lot of,

115
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:46,930
uh,
occupation.

116
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,790
You just simply can't get into.
So.

117
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,090
And it's pretty clear from all the 
reading of yours that I've done,

118
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,110
you put basic education basically is 
number one,

119
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:56,410
right?

120
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,300
I mean,
is that the one thing that you can do as

121
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,380
a human being?
Get educated,

122
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,873
I guess,
although I wouldn't carry it too far 

123
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,603
because some of the most disastrous 
notions in the world who come from 

124
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,700
highly educated people with,
I'm sure high Iq.

125
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,780
So perhaps critical thinking with a 
little education.

126
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,650
I am,
I will settle for almost any kind of.

127
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,790
Yeah.
It's so rare these days.

128
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,100
It is oddly rare.
So,

129
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:24,934
uh,
one of the things that I found out that 

130
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,740
was sort of amazing about your history,
you briefly mentioned it right before we

131
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:30,574
started,
you were a Marxist at one time in your 

132
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:33,844
life.
Most people will find this hard to 

133
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,580
believe,
but it is true,

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,300
but it's not that unusual.
Uh,

135
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,740
most of the leading conservative 
thinkers of our time,

136
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,090
uh,
did not start off as conservative.

137
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,300
You've got a couple of like a Bill 
Buckley and George will,

138
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,950
but I'm A.
Milton Friedman was,

139
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,080
it was,
it was a liberal and a Keynesian.

140
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,503
A High Eq was a socialist.
Ronald Reagan was so far left at one 

141
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:01,720
point the FBI was following him,
you know,

142
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,841
uh,
so,

143
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,674
uh,
the,

144
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,300
the,
there's a huge movement from the left to

145
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,340
the right as people get older.
Yeah.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,820
I'm,
I'm well aware,

147
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,460
as I mentioned to you earlier,
as a former progressive,

148
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,980
I understand that,
that movement in the modern sense.

149
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,080
Do you remember sort of what you were 
thinking?

150
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:21,080
What appealed to you at that time about 
artism?

151
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,380
Yes.
I mean,

152
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,440
there was no alternative being 
discussed.

153
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,813
Um,
my first job was as a Western Union 

154
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,310
Messenger and uh,
I would come home on some nights.

155
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:35,940
I would take the fifth avenue bus which 
cost all of fifteen cents in those days,

156
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,300
but I figured I splurge now and then and
I would drive,

157
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,134
it would go all the way up fifth avenue 
past always Lord and Taylor and all 

158
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:48,801
these fancy places,
and then cross 57th street past Carnegie

159
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,670
Hall and down Riverside Drive.

160
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,100
And that was sort of the Gold Coast 
area.

161
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,590
And then yes,
I came across this long viaduct and that

162
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,493
turned into 135th street.
Suddenly there were the tenements and I 

163
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,980
went into why is this?
I mean,

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,211
it's so,
it's so,

165
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:11,211
it's so different and nothing in the 
schools or most of the books,

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,920
uh,
seem to deal with that and walks,

167
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,480
dealt with that.
Uh,

168
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,290
so it's,
it's,

169
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,260
it's like winning an election when 
there's only one person running.

170
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,813
So then what was your wake up to?
What was wrong with that line of 

171
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,350
thinking?
A facts?

172
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,283
Facts.
We could probably end the interview 

173
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:30,400
right there.
Specifically.

174
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,700
My first professional job,
I was a,

175
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:33,534
a,
a summer intern at the US Department of 

176
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,403
Labor and I realized from dealing with 
these people that the US Department of 

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,833
Labor,
I'm one of my biggest concern was about 

178
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,810
minimum wages.
It has been for a long time.

179
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,810
And so my,
my.

180
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,003
At first I thought,
well this is good because all these 

181
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,330
people are poor and it'll get a little 
higher income and so that,

182
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,560
that'll be helpful.
And then,

183
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,420
uh,
as I studied economics,

184
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,980
I began to see,
well there's the downside.

185
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:02,250
They may lose their jobs completely.
So as that.

186
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,710
And so I try and I,
when I was at the Labor Department,

187
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,544
I tried to talk about that to them and 
eventually I came up with some test of 

188
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,060
it and uh,
uh,

189
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,370
when I came up with this test,
how we might test this,

190
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,353
I was waiting to hear congratulations,
you see that it had this and I can see 

191
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,804
these people were stunned as oldest 
idiot has stumbled on something that 

192
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,590
will ruin us all.

193
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,800
And I realized the US Department of 
Labor had its own agenda and interests.

194
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,903
Uh,
and that didn't necessarily not 

195
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,874
necessarily mean that the were the four 
people lost their jobs for minimum wage 

196
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,480
and it got higher pay was their highest 
priority.

197
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,314
Yeah.
How much longer did you last after that 

198
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,480
was?
No,

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,313
that was really the turning point.
And then I began to see that all these 

200
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:46,554
government agencies were not,
they have their own institutional 

201
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,913
incentives and you cannot say that the 
government will step in and do what's 

202
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:54,534
right for these people and whatnot 
because they'll do what's right for 

203
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,580
themselves.
So I think a lot of people watching this

204
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,000
and I know because I've been so open 
about my own sort of awakening,

205
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,013
are going through this right now,
they're realizing that the things that 

206
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:11,010
they've been taught for so long are not 
the truth and are not based.

207
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,843
In fact,
when that happened to you and you 

208
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:13,944
started telling other people,
not just the people you were working 

209
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:17,220
with,
be it family or friends,

210
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,413
what kind of pushback did you get 
because it was sort of radical ideas in 

211
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,410
a way that you were talking about that.
Well,

212
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,310
I actually,
I didn't,

213
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,180
I didn't feel any need to,
uh,

214
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,311
uh,
do a lot,

215
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,930
a lot,
a lot of proselytizing.

216
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,720
Uh,
it was enough for me that,

217
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,554
uh,
that I was now beginning to understand 

218
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:35,470
things I hadn't understood before.
And uh,

219
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,323
you noted that in the book I have,
I mentioned minimum wage studies and 

220
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,940
really they are incredibly flawed.
There's a whole chapter on numbers,

221
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,130
uh,
uh,

222
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,430
and,
and the other thing,

223
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,210
getting back to my personal development.
I mean,

224
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,930
I left home when I was 17.
Uh,

225
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,210
no high school diploma,
no skills,

226
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,740
no job experience.

227
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,913
And I discovered that there was not a 
huge amount of demand for people like 

228
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,900
that,
uh,

229
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,780
but in retrospect,
decades later when I do research,

230
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:07,614
I realized that in 1948,
the unemployment rate for black 16 and 

231
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:17,910
17 year olds was nine point four for 
whites,

232
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,620
the same.
Asia was 10 point two,

233
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,720
and those numbers are much smaller than 
we were used to in recent decades.

234
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,943
Uh,
and there's no serious racial 

235
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:28,710
difference.
In fact,

236
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:31,950
the blocks in my age bracket we're doing
just slightly better.

237
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,660
Uh,
and of course,

238
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:34,494
one of the things that the minimum wage 
law does is that it creates 

239
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,060
unemployment,
raised it to multiples of what it was.

240
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,283
Nineteen 48 was,
it was a special time because the 

241
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:46,914
minimum wage law was passed in 1938.
And in the intervening 10 years there 

242
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:53,070
was huge inflation in the law,
hadn't gotten.

243
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,220
And so for all practical purposes,
there was no minimum wage law.

244
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,750
But had we had these wonderful liberals,
uh,

245
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,000
insisting that I be paid a living wage.
They were supportive.

246
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,520
Family of four,
I would have been unemployed.

247
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,713
And I don't,
I don't know what that would've looked 

248
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,543
right.
It wouldn't probably would not have led 

249
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,270
up to everything else.
So when you,

250
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,133
when,
when you think about these wonderful 

251
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,980
liberals as you just said,
you know,

252
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:19,330
I think there's sort of two lines of 
thinking.

253
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,350
One is that,
you know,

254
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,390
the road to hell is paved with good 
intentions.

255
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,900
I try not to a highway.
It's a super highway.

256
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,390
Exactly.
I try not to besmirch their intentions,

257
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,720
but then I think there are people that 
are either can have confused thinking or

258
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,554
have ulterior motives or what else?
What do you think it is as someone that 

259
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,270
is so based,
in fact,

260
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,340
and we're going to get to a plenty of 
that fact in a moment.

261
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,710
What do you think the thinking is the 
flaw in that thinking?

262
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,193
Oh,
I think it's the idea that you don't 

263
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:50,020
have to check a good sounding idea 
against what actually happens.

264
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,950
Uh,
the whole 90 zero people to this day who

265
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:58,120
thinks that the 19 sixties was just a 
great period and a,

266
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,213
and I'll send them.
Do you realize how many good trends 

267
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,350
there,
the,

268
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,500
the murder rate among black males had 
gone down,

269
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,910
it had been going down for two decades,
you know,

270
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:16,060
by 18 percent in one decade,
22 percent in the next decade,

271
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,040
and in 1960 is suddenly it takes a uturn
straight up and that was not peculiar to

272
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:25,240
blocks or even to the United States.
A pinker's book about,

273
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,020
about,
uh,

274
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,520
violence that,
you know,

275
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:32,521
that throughout what the Western world,
the homicide rates did a uturn in the 19

276
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:38,080
sixties.
So the question is what actually happens

277
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,970
when you put your wonderful ideas to 
work?

278
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,043
Do they produce the kind of thing you 
thought they were going to produce or 

279
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:43,594
the produce all the opposite and many 
errors and they produce lots of 

280
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:46,930
opposites.
Yeah.

281
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,803
I'm glad you mentioned Steven pinker.
I had him on the show a few weeks ago 

282
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,800
and I think he's,
you know,

283
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:53,350
he's one of the clearest thinkers we 
have and you know,

284
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:57,220
his new book enlightened me now is that 
things are trending more positively,

285
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,670
but even hearing that is,
is very hard for a lot of people.

286
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,090
Well,
it depends on what your baseline is,

287
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,240
a pancreas much more optimistic than I 
am.

288
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,670
Uh,
I,

289
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,543
uh,
I happen to be very pessimistic about 

290
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:13,040
the future,
but I hope the optimists are right.

291
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,060
Do you think you're a pessimist by 
nature?

292
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,603
No,
but I think having studied with so many 

293
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,260
things that sounded so good and ended up
so bad,

294
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,470
uh,
it makes me a doubt,

295
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,043
especially when there are people who are
anxious to spout off with very little 

296
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,080
study of what,
of what they're talking about.

297
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,090
Yeah.
We've got a lot of that these days.

298
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,970
Do you think that has ramped up or.
Yeah,

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,080
I think social media seems to amplify 
things,

300
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:41,914
but do you think it's always been that 
way about just sort of this endless 

301
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,140
pontificating of people that really 
don't know what they're talking about?

302
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,153
Well,
there's always been that as long as 

303
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:49,604
there have been human beings,
but the question is magnitude of it and 

304
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,950
the ability of various institutions to 
shut out on any other viewpoint of which

305
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,500
the universities are the worst examples.
Yeah.

306
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,491
That,
uh,

307
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:02,570
I mean,
when I,

308
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:05,150
when I,
when I see the riots with Charles Murray

309
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,660
shows up and I have a notion I was 
blurry.

310
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,523
I mean,
if you can demonize wherever you can 

311
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,430
demonize anybody.
Yeah.

312
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,370
I mean,
and uh,

313
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,960
and I,
I listened to see what are they going to

314
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:15,794
quote that he said,
I've never heard a single quote of all 

315
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,430
the books the man is written.

316
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,110
They,
they never caught anything he said.

317
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,990
And a lot of what he said is the direct 
opposite of what they claim.

318
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,150
He said that tells you a little bit 
about state we're in right now.

319
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,150
So,
so this,

320
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,793
this thing that's happening on college 
campuses right now that everyone seems 

321
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,400
to think it's freezing free speech and,
and it seems to be speeches,

322
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,500
speech that's generally thought of as,
right?

323
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,450
So it's conservatives,
Libertarians,

324
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,673
further people on the right than that.
You're saying that's really not a new 

325
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:46,461
phenomenon,
you,

326
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,110
you were kind of.
Well,

327
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,180
it was not that bad in the 19 fifties 
when I was a Marxist.

328
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,220
And when Senator Joe McCarthy was Kara 
was tracking down anybody on the left.

329
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,203
But uh,
I said whatever I felt like where I 

330
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:01,734
arrived,
felt like it and I got no such blow 

331
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,060
back.
That's really interesting.

332
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,770
So McCarthy's talking about all this 
stuff,

333
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:10,010
but you had no problem being an open in 
Washington.

334
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,980
I was in Cambridge,
so be it.

335
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,213
Yeah.
So you do think of something has gotten 

336
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:15,800
worse now?
Oh No,

337
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,130
there was a number of things.
Venereal diseases,

338
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:22,670
for example,
we're going down a very steep worried it

339
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:23,504
was either syphilis or gonorrhea that 
was one half or as prevalent in 1960 as 

340
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:29,074
it was in 1950.
That brilliant idea was to bring in sex 

341
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:33,710
education,
you see,

342
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:38,711
to avoid unwanted pregnancies and so on.
And a venereal diseases skyrocketed.

343
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,030
Unwanted pregnancies,
teenage pregnancy skyrocketed.

344
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,523
It's amazing that so many people on the 
left are able to just ignore any facts 

345
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,800
that go against their theory.
Yeah,

346
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,750
it just does not.
Uh,

347
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,543
my uh,
my old mentor at the University of 

348
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,020
Chicago,
a joy stigler argued however,

349
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:04,180
that economists have early influence and
what they,

350
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,810
what they say makes very little 
difference.

351
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,350
And he was giving a talk at the hoover 
institution wants.

352
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,213
He said,
thanks to years of dedicated work by 

353
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,430
Tom,
so,

354
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,573
uh,
the next minimum wage increase will be 

355
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:18,290
five cents an hour less than it would 
have been otherwise.

356
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,923
Well,
that's what's interesting to me is 

357
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,520
because,
as I,

358
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,354
as I prefaced this with you,
I think that the writings that you've 

359
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,104
done all these years and these books,
they're becoming culturally relevant 

360
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:32,450
maybe in a way that they weren't,
I don't even want to say it this way,

361
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,300
but maybe in a way that they didn't,
weren't economically relevant.

362
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,153
Why do you understand the point there 
that I think there's a cultural 

363
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,554
relevance to all the things that you've 
done for these last 40 some odd years 

364
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,300
that seems so actually powerful and 
impactful to me right now,

365
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,343
which is incredible when it comes to the
impact that that's a different story 

366
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:53,070
entirely.
I mean,

367
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,133
long ago I stopped accepting invitations
to testify before a congressional 

368
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,760
committees.

369
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,593
It's an absolute waste of time.
They have made up their minds and they 

370
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,254
just want to be able to say they've 
heard all points of view and then it 

371
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,510
pretty much stops there.
That's right.

372
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,020
And I,
I remember once or Kenneth Clark was,

373
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,310
I was debating him and he was beside 
himself because of the mindset,

374
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,243
supposed sinister influence in 
Washington during the Reagan 

375
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,810
administration.
I told him if my,

376
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,480
if my influence in Washington is all you
have to worry about,

377
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,320
very fortunate,
bad because I've had,

378
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,333
I can't think of anything that happened 
any different than if I had never said 

379
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:36,540
anything to anybody that you're being 
very humble sir.

380
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,150
No,
I'm realistic.

381
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:38,701
I mean,
I,

382
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,550
I can't,
I can't find it.

383
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:45,100
I can remember testifying before one 
committee and uh,

384
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,173
the audience was so rowdy that the 
chairman had to bang the gavel to keep 

385
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:51,430
them shut.

386
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,430
The shut them down and they put some 
little tiny thing in the law.

387
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:00,270
They were building a.
and I would bet their rent money that,

388
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:04,670
that provision is gone now because there
was so many people who did,

389
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,490
who didn't,
why?

390
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,770
I was saying that if you're going to 
help up for kids,

391
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,310
then give the money to the kids.
You know it.

392
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,450
For where,
where were they go.

393
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,553
Don't turn it over to the institution 
because they will then use it in an 

394
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,304
entirely different way.
Are there any examples where the money 

395
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:22,890
is turned over to the institution?
Whatever the institution might be,

396
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,590
where it really does work?
Are there any aberrations?

397
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,713
There must.
There must be somewhere by the law of 

398
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,660
averages,
but a is not prevalent.

399
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,913
Yeah,
so a couple of times you've mentioned 

400
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:33,654
liberals and one of the things that I 
talk about on my show offing because I 

401
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,770
wa,
I was a progressive.

402
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,270
I was,
I was a lefty.

403
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,373
I now call myself a classical liberal 
and I've tried to make the point that 

404
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,530
being a liberal in the traditional sense
has very little,

405
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:49,770
if anything to do with the left anymore.
Yes.

406
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,693
Are there any,
do you see any sort of meaningful 

407
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:57,360
distinction between classical liberal 
and Libertarian at this point or,

408
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,520
or DC even?
I'll ask you a couple things at once and

409
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:01,100
you can go any direction.
Um,

410
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,310
do you see any,
are there,

411
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,800
do you see a difference?
Of course between liberals and the left.

412
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,220
I mean the words have all sort of 
afraid.

413
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,910
When I used to always say that he was,
he was a liberal Senator Hyatt,

414
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,043
and of course in different countries,
the word means different things in 

415
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,020
Australia.
Uh,

416
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,470
if you said you were a liberal that they
would understand what you saying,

417
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,573
but in a liberal and is Australia is 
different from a liberal in the United 

418
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,000
States.

419
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,700
So when you say liberal,
you mean leftist basic.

420
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,930
The American sense of the word.
Yeah.

421
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,173
Um,
what do you think there's any sort of 

422
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,273
real distinction that needs to be made 
between classical liberal and 

423
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,184
libertarian that that's one of the 
things that people ask me all the time 

424
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,120
and I know you're not big on labels 
generally,

425
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:43,770
but I did read something where you said 
that the closest thing that you could be

426
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,604
labeled as his libertarian,
is that still where you're at accept a 

427
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,760
course in foreign policy?
We can talk about that too.

428
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,703
And I mean,
I guess also the Libertarians seem to 

429
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:56,704
have this atomistic view of the world,
which I think is a completely 

430
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,120
unrealistic.
Yeah.

431
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,790
So it's a good because not only in my 
life,

432
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,160
but in the lives of people around me,
uh,

433
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,490
the surroundings might make a huge 
difference.

434
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,863
Uh,
one of the things I get into a lot in 

435
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,803
the book is this,
the disparities imply either either 

436
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,440
discrimination on the one hand or 
genetic differences on the other.

437
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,430
And disparities are the norm.
I mean,

438
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,310
I was just reading something the other 
day,

439
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:30,911
you know,
that,

440
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:31,744
uh,
Latin America has eight percent of the 

441
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:34,534
people in the world.
They commit 38 percent of all the 

442
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:40,960
murders and in Latin America at 80 
percent,

443
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,670
no 30,
38 percent for that.

444
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,803
But in Latin America,
80 percent of the murders occur on two 

445
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,650
percent of the streets.
Wow.

446
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,830
So,
but you find that when you look,

447
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,823
look up facts,
that's what you find over and over 

448
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,050
again.
Uh,

449
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,263
and,
and in all the discussions of a income 

450
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,200
differences,
they acted that day.

451
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,780
They never take into account.
Age and age is huge.

452
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,614
I mean,
Japanese Americans have a median age of 

453
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,680
50 Hispanic Americans has immediate age 
of 26.

454
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,233
Now,
when you see a Hispanic Americans 

455
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,150
greatly overrepresented among baseball 
stars and not a single Japanese American

456
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:24,640
baseball star and the major leagues,
I don't believe in the entire history.

457
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,440
Well,
we had each hero on.

458
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,520
No,
no,

459
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,540
no,
no.

460
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,403
That was.
There are people of Japanese ancestry 

461
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:34,750
who've come baseball stars.
All of them are from Japan.

462
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,030
None of them are Japanese American.
Okay.

463
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,721
Fair enough.
Right.

464
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,190
He played,
he was a star in Japan for that.

465
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,120
That's right.
Yeah.

466
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,081
Uh,
so,

467
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:43,840
so,
so how many 50 year old men are going to

468
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:46,020
be baseball stars?
Uh,

469
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,120
and by the same token,
how many 20,

470
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,700
26 year old men are going to be surgeons
or ceos,

471
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,190
uh,
any other kind of job that requires long

472
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,640
years of study or,
and slash or long years of experience.

473
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,773
And so even if they were the same,
the two groups were the same in every 

474
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,064
other way.
And if there was absolutely no 

475
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,550
distinction though,
discrimination and whatnot,

476
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,870
they still would be a huge difference in
income simply because of age.

477
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,330
And that really is what this book is 
about.

478
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,440
And you know,
the book itself,

479
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,990
it's about 160 pages,
but what I loved,

480
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,163
you know,
how many pages of notes you have in 

481
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,240
there,
do you have,

482
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,170
do you know,
off hand veins,

483
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,770
127 bay pages are texts and the rest of 
it as notes.

484
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,843
So you had about 30 some odd pages and 
notes and I actually started going 

485
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,860
through the notes because I thought this
is,

486
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,470
this is exactly what we need now.
We,

487
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,640
you know,
like when I was reading it,

488
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:34,474
there were pages that I had to read more
than once because you're obviously 

489
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,114
giving a lot of numbers and facts and 
you have to look at these things from 

490
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,970
different angles and we're not very good
at that these days.

491
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:43,491
Right.
We're,

492
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:44,324
we're sort of from one angle and then 
you start the screaming and I think 

493
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,820
that's what you're,
you're really a master up here.

494
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,050
Yeah.
Well thank you.

495
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm trying,
I try to but we'll see.

496
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,920
We'll see how it works out.
We'll see.

497
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,843
Um,
do you make any meaningful distinction 

498
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,150
between sort of a classical liberal and 
a libertarian?

499
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,110
Is that,
is that just sort of a,

500
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:04,940
that's a wholly peripheral as far as I'm
concerned.

501
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm just trying to get a few simple 
facts that crosses a full time job.

502
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,011
Yeah.
All right.

503
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,900
So now let's talk about some of the 
facts that you learned in the back.

504
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:14,150
You talk about two types of 
discrimination.

505
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,990
Uh,
could you,

506
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,740
could you lay those out in the world has
almost opposite meetings.

507
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,773
I mean the first meeting when they say 
you have someone has discriminating 

508
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:22,920
tastes,
you mean he,

509
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:27,560
he can tell what is a good wine from a 
bad wine,

510
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,660
what is a good camera from a bedroom and
so forth.

511
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,913
And that's almost the exact opposite of 
the meeting and the law where you mean 

512
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,074
someone who judges someone by what group
he comes from irrespective of the 

513
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:43,250
individual's actual personal qualities.

514
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,850
So those are two very different things.
Uh,

515
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:51,110
ideally you would like every person to 
be judged as an individual,

516
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,483
but as a practical matter,
that becomes impossible because the 

517
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:56,700
costs are prohibitive.
Yeah.

518
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,980
I use the example where if you're 
walking down the street at night and you

519
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:04,130
see a shadowy figure in,
in an alley up ahead,

520
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,203
I mean,
do you judge him as an individual or do 

521
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,490
you cross the street and go across on 
the other side because,

522
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:11,760
uh,
the cost of,

523
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,680
of judging him as an individual can be 
very high including your life.

524
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,100
So,
uh,

525
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,703
so we make that distinction,
but then I say that I call that 

526
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:24,580
discrimination discrimination.
One one is when you just have a,

527
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,433
a,
a very good understanding of what the 

528
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:27,614
facts are.
And so if you judge these persons and 

529
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:30,064
individually I call that discrimination 
one a and then if you judge them by the 

530
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,270
group they belong to,
that's not as good,

531
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:38,690
but that's discrimination wouldn't be,
but it's still based on some facts,

532
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,180
uh,
discrimination tool,

533
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:41,014
which is one reason we have anti 
discrimination laws is that you don't 

534
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,260
worry about that at all.

535
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,200
And he's someone that you don't like for
whatever reason.

536
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,910
Uh,
then you,

537
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,140
uh,
you know,

538
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,770
you're biased against them.
Yeah.

539
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,390
Are you shocked when you look at what's 
going on right now?

540
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:59,570
And see so much talk about race all the 
time.

541
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,630
So much talk about all of the things 
that separate us,

542
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,673
the very things that you've been arguing
against based in fact for so many years 

543
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:08,804
that seemed in an odd way more.
I don't think there's more racism now 

544
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:15,260
than ever or more of dividers,
but there's more talk about it.

545
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,630
Yes.
And it's devastating.

546
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:22,631
I mean a was in general a much easier to
start than they ought to stop.

547
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,060
I mean,
when,

548
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,900
when,
when that a fellow in,

549
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:27,734
in,
uh,

550
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,560
in Serbia shot the archduke,
I mean,

551
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,920
who knew that that was going to millions
of people around the world,

552
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,340
including people from the United States 
about to about 10,000

553
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:41,840
miles away and I called with and start 
shooting the great war and you can't get

554
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:41,960
in.

555
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,060
You get an a and worried about the 
current trade war.

556
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,480
You start a trade war.
You may never be able to stop it.

557
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,314
And then in the next decade,
because there are too many people 

558
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:54,270
involved,
too many cross currents of interests and

559
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,000
so on.
Well,

560
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,030
what would you do about our school 
systems?

561
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,630
Oh my goodness.
I'll try,

562
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,950
I'll try to be rational.
Do try.

563
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,790
They are so awful.
Uh,

564
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,033
the public has no idea what I'm reading 
a book about the schools and the woman 

565
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,534
who writing a Diane Ravitch is talking 
about how teachers have due process 

566
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,600
before they can be fired.
Now know when you look into the facts of

567
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,120
it right down here,
and I think it was afternoon the,

568
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,790
it cost a half a million dollars to fire
one incompetent teacher,

569
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,170
uh,
you know,

570
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,940
you,
you,

571
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,100
you don't have a big enough budget.
You know,

572
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,710
New York,
he has something called the rubber room.

573
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,543
This is the teachers who is so 
incompetent that the principals don't 

574
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,890
want them in the classroom,
you know,

575
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,650
and they get paid full salary and they 
show up and they accrue a pension rights

576
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,173
and so forth.
And the last time I forget how many 

577
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:54,894
millions of dollars I spent a year in 
New York paying for teachers who don't 

578
00:27:59,101 --> 00:27:59,934
teach and in fact don't do anything but 
show up at at the same time as if they 

579
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,400
were teaching and they read magazines or
whatever.

580
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:09,680
They feel like doing a.
and this forest goes on a,

581
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,553
at a time when they don't have enough 
money to provide the kids with a decent 

582
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,440
supply.
So how do we scale back this?

583
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,220
I mean,
you can talk,

584
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,840
we can talk about it through the lens of
education,

585
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,674
but in any mna area where the government
has taken on a bigger role than it's 

586
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:23,934
supposed to do,
I think one of the things you hear all 

587
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:26,070
the time is it's sort of too late.

588
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,650
I think a lot of people think it's too 
late to take back.

589
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,600
No government power.
No,

590
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,440
you heaven's a during the Reagan 
administration.

591
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:39,441
That was the only time I know of when 
the Federal Register grew.

592
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,374
Smaller that where they compile all the 
laws that had been passed in a given 

593
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,800
time.
So it can be done.

594
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,870
It's not,
it's not,

595
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,770
it's not.
Uh,

596
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,440
it's not easy,
but it can be done.

597
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,483
Someone wants to.
There was some issue with Reagan was 

598
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:56,990
discussing and someone said,
you know it,

599
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,920
it's complicated.
He says,

600
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,680
not complicated.
It's just not easy to do.

601
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,290
I mean,
right now we,

602
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,200
I,
I,

603
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,093
one of the big forces out here or talks 
about affordable housing and they're 

604
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,203
appointing a blue ribbon committee is to
look into why there's no affordable 

605
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:14,814
housing and I think that that's,
that's like appointing of Blue Ribbon 

606
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,430
Committee to,
to,

607
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,700
to,
to explain why the ground is wet after,

608
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,690
after a rain.

609
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,853
I mean it's very simple.
If you prevent people from building 

610
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:26,754
housing and the population is growing,
you're going to have a housing shortage 

611
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,880
and you won't have affordable housing.
It's really,

612
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,010
you know,
economics one during the first,

613
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,023
first two weeks.
They're not very good at taking 

614
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,980
economics,
widow and I don't think so.

615
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,913
So when you're answering,
be in almost every case to just scale 

616
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:46,520
back government scale back regulation,
it depends on what they're doing there.

617
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,810
There were some things,
uh,

618
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,110
the government is necessary to do.
So what,

619
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:52,660
what are those types of things that you 
done for security?

620
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,490
First of all,
having,

621
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,800
having dependable laws up.
Some people think that if you're a,

622
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,873
a for free,
that means you don't think the 

623
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:03,320
government should do anything.
No,

624
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,110
you get the free markets don't operate 
except within a framework of laws that's

625
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:08,944
wholly different from having them 
operate with politicians jumping in 

626
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,610
unpredictable times to suddenly pass 
some new legislation.

627
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,960
Yeah.
What can we do right now?

628
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:20,794
I mean,
so really this would be about just sort 

629
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:25,750
of electing more libertarian minded 
politicians then.

630
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,733
I mean,
is that really the only way we can 

631
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,234
change things,
do you think?

632
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,103
No,
I think the main thing people have to 

633
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:32,170
know what the facts are themselves.
Uh,

634
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:33,004
if,
if everyone knew what all the facts 

635
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:34,894
were,
I think you'd have an Italian different 

636
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,670
set of set of people elected.
I,

637
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,710
I can't believe that either of the 
presidential candidates in 19 in 2016,

638
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,781
uh,
would,

639
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:45,614
uh,
would have been the candidates if you 

640
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:49,360
had an informed public.
We're not very good at that.

641
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,910
How much of this do you think is part of
the media's fault?

642
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,560
That's one of the things was the media 
are mostly uninformed.

643
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,130
No,
no.

644
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,050
They're not uninformed or misinformed.
Uh,

645
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,983
and,
and,

646
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,610
and they simply do not shut.

647
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,740
Check the facts on the large issues of 
small.

648
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,843
Yeah.
What,

649
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,350
what can we do to fix that,
do you think?

650
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,210
I mean,
I suppose this,

651
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,090
no,
but I buy books like this as well,

652
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:16,924
but I think more fundamentally the 
public that votes has to itself become 

653
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:21,474
informed and not be so easily stampeded 
by slogans in a few numbers thrown 

654
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:27,480
around.
Like,

655
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:28,314
you know,
women make x percent of what men make 

656
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,660
and so on.
Yeah.

657
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,693
Uh,
when I started studying that some years 

658
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,553
ago,
for example,

659
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,720
uh,
I found out that a young,

660
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,913
young female doctors made much less 
money than young male doctors not seem 

661
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,150
like a very odd.
And so I.

662
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:46,984
But when you're looking into it,
you discover that young male doctors 

663
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,584
work an average of 500 hours a year or 
more than young female doctors and they 

664
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:57,180
get paid for the 500 hours.
But,

665
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,083
but there,
there's no reason why the women and men 

666
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:01,050
should be doing the same thing.

667
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,903
Their circumstances are different.
So are there any laws that are in place 

668
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:05,794
right now that you believe are 
discriminatory one way or another 

669
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:10,534
toward,
towards any community or against any 

670
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:14,410
community?
I would have to write a much larger book

671
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:19,150
to cover them all the minimum wage laws,
absolutely devastating,

672
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,953
uh,
the policy of saying that you cannot 

673
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,823
have more kids from one ethnic group 
disciplined in the school and from 

674
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:28,534
another is nonsense.
I mean groups are different for each 

675
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:33,964
other and umpteen ways and then just 
have the presumption that they are the 

676
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:42,200
same except the way they're treated a is
nonsense.

677
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,034
It's never been true.
And I don't know why we would think is 

678
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:47,600
true here today.
So I do sense that some of what you just

679
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,434
said there is bubbling up into the 
national conscience because I get a ton 

680
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,900
of email from black conservatives now.

681
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,460
People that feel that they haven't been 
represented fairly or that the,

682
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,310
the,
you know,

683
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,940
the so called leaders of the black 
community that are on television all the

684
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:02,774
time are actually preaching the complete
reverse of everything that you've said 

685
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:07,304
here.
Do you sense that there is some sort of 

686
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,010
growing conservative movement,
black community?

687
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,870
There was a time when,
when,

688
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,733
uh,
that community with a consistent of 

689
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,780
million.
Walter Williams,

690
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,173
uh,
I know all these to say we were the 

691
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:26,490
tuition of a fly on the same plane,
otherwise a whole will disappear.

692
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,040
Disappeared,
goes down.

693
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,753
Well,
I mentioned to you before we started 

694
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,274
that Larry elder caused my awakening 
because I was a progressive and I said 

695
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:35,834
something to him about a systemic racism
on air and he beat me senseless with 

696
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:45,380
facts and I had to go back and reassess 
what was wrong with my thinking.

697
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,741
Well,
you know,

698
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:46,480
in one,
in one of the,

699
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,510
in one of the chapters,
the,

700
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,120
I have a little section about,
uh,

701
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,940
uh,
the era of apartheid in South Africa.

702
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,150
And I had that in there because there's 
so much argument.

703
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:56,984
How much racism is there,
soap when I say let's test this 

704
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:02,640
hypothesis in a setting where there's 
absolutely no doubt is a,

705
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,650
a Raga and that's apartheid in South 
Africa,

706
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,733
uh,
with the government where blacks were 

707
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,040
not allowed to vote,
so forth.

708
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,053
And you then apply the economic 
principles and you find that the 

709
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,880
economic principles apply in South 
Africa that,

710
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,720
uh,
there were some occupations.

711
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,883
See,
blacks weren't allowed by law to be in 

712
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,450
certain occupations,
is more than a certain percentage and in

713
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:24,284
some occupations couldn't be hired at 
all in some of those occupations where 

714
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,740
they couldn't be hired at all illegal to
hire them at all.

715
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,723
There were more blacks higher than the 
whites because there are economic 

716
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:35,264
factors that could come in and you don't
just pass a law and not automatically 

717
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,890
produces the results you want.

718
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,580
Yeah.
Can,

719
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,770
can you go into some of the economic 
factors that you mentioned there?

720
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:46,140
Because I thought it was sort of 
interesting about the types of jobs that

721
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,620
I had and why that would affect.
Well,

722
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,350
it's no,
it's the competitiveness of the industry

723
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,480
and the competitive industry.
A discrimination and then the,

724
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,940
in the sense that we use for entity 
discrimination laws,

725
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,023
uh,
it costs the discriminator as well as 

726
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:02,144
the others.
Now in so far as the price can be 

727
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:06,770
invaded by the discriminated,
he will,

728
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,940
he will describe,
for example,

729
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,390
minimum wage laws let,
when you have a minimum wage law,

730
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,123
you have more people applying for jobs 
in those categories than there are jobs 

731
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,140
available.
Because the raising,

732
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:20,974
the raising the wage rate cause more 
people to apply and employers to hire 

733
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:27,860
fewer because if more expensive and so 
you have a chronic surplus.

734
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,440
Now if you've got a chronic surplus in 
an industry,

735
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,780
it costs nothing to discriminate but it 
and but it.

736
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,623
But if you have a competitive market,
then of course it does cost something 

737
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,130
that for every person that you 
discriminate against those qualified,

738
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,973
you've got to hire somebody else and you
got to raise that paved cap rate in 

739
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:50,070
order to get people in.
So I show how how competitive industries

740
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,450
have much less discrimination than say a
regulated public utilities.

741
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,630
I was wondering when I was reading it,
if you were ever going to talk about how

742
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,464
now technology is also changing this,
so we see a lot of these movements for 

743
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:05,610
$15 minimum wage and I know why you 
don't think that's a great idea,

744
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,653
but even now where we see Mcdonald's and
some of these other places just 

745
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:12,760
replacing people with IBS and computers.
This,

746
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,740
this has been happening.
I don't know,

747
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,690
when I grew up in Harlem,
when you went into a movie theater,

748
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,770
this is a little neighborhood movies,
theater in Harlem.

749
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,023
There would be a kid who would walk by 
down the aisle with you with a 

750
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:28,340
flashlight and show you to your seat.
And so now,

751
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,453
now that we have so many compassionate 
people who want people to be paid a 

752
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,840
living wage,
you actually stumbled down this down the

753
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,763
aisle to your seat the best way you can 
because they're not going to pay that 

754
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,860
kind of money.
You know,

755
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,053
the that's unrelated to productivity.
What would you say to the people I hear 

756
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:48,200
a growing movement of people saying,
well,

757
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:49,034
this is why we need a universal basic 
income because technology is going to 

758
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,080
force for so many people out of the 
workplace.

759
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,293
Oh,
that has,

760
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,263
that is that the island has been made 
for centuries and has been proven wrong 

761
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,730
for centuries.
Uh,

762
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,340
I would ask the question,
what has happened?

763
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,930
We've moved in that direction already.

764
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,063
We have lots of people who can live off 
the welfare state and not and not and 

765
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:17,480
not have to be productive.
Uh,

766
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,013
and how,
how are they better people as a result 

767
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,530
of that?
Uh,

768
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,870
one of I saw some time back and have,
haven't follow this,

769
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,003
that a young pete,
the suicide rates among young people 

770
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:32,040
were among the negative consequences of 
the 19 sixties,

771
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,390
uh,
people,

772
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:34,710
uh,
you,

773
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,780
you,
you've taken all meaning out of people's

774
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:37,614
lives.
And so they find all kinds of crazy 

775
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,450
things to do drugs,
whatever.

776
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,910
Uh,
and again,

777
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:47,700
it's not peculiar to the United States 
and you find this in Britain,

778
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,090
other countries.
Uh,

779
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,160
and so again,
people who say this almost never look at

780
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,940
any facts about what's happened as we 
expanded the welfare state,

781
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,340
that people behave better.
No,

782
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,511
you know,
I mean,

783
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,340
when,
when one of the,

784
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:07,341
one of the things that one was that I 
remember very well when I was,

785
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,823
I was back in the school in Harlem for 
some reason maybe doing research and I 

786
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,490
looked out the window and I said,
said,

787
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,900
you know,
when I was a teenager,

788
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,570
I used to walk a dog,
my dog in that park.

789
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,380
And look,
it look so hard.

790
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,270
I came up with the students' faces 
because that was,

791
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:26,040
that was a different world.
And so,

792
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:27,110
uh,
and,

793
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,983
and when I tell them that I used to 
sleep out on the fire escape on hot 

794
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:30,984
summer nights,
but who,

795
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,960
who could afford air conditioning and 
they think I'm a man from Mars.

796
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,800
People did that all over New York.
They did it in Washington.

797
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:39,634
They did it in North Carolina.
Relatives in Washington used to go down 

798
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,573
and Haynes point down here,
the Jefferson memorial on hot summer 

799
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,780
nights and sleep there.
So sometime after midnight when,

800
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,653
when the,
when the heat wouldn't be so bad and 

801
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:54,654
he'd go home at that time,
it'd be out of your mind to do that 

802
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:00,080
today would be too dangerous.
Yeah.

803
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,203
So how do we sort of untie some of this?
So my sister right now lives on the 

804
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:05,764
upper west side in Manhattan,
not too far from Harlem and she's in a 

805
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,250
half a rent stabilized or rent 
controlled building and,

806
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,630
and half market price.

807
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,463
She's on the market price.
So she's paying to be in a bedroom in 

808
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:17,704
New York City.
I don't even want to tell you how 

809
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:21,430
expensive it is,
but then there are basically half of the

810
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,264
building that's paying next to nothing 
and that of course incentivizes people 

811
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,614
not to get off the Dole because if 
you're living in a nice area on the 

812
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,630
upper west side,
very cheap.

813
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:33,760
Why in the world would you ever get off 
the Dole?

814
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,820
How do we start solving these problems?
And I know,

815
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,570
I know facts is your is your bedrock ans
yes,

816
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,553
but,
but what can we do to get people to 

817
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:43,910
understand some of this stuff?
Because it's easy.

818
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,160
It seems so basic to understand.
If someone was giving you something that

819
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:51,370
you didn't earn this,
this again is,

820
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,470
this is common in Europe and England 
especially is a,

821
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:56,304
it's a,
it's a special problem because you have 

822
00:39:58,961 --> 00:39:59,794
the,
you have this place where your rent is 

823
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:06,511
subsidized and say you're in London and 
jobs are disappearing in London and they

824
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,780
opening up in Manchester.

825
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,400
Now,
if you go to Manchester,

826
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,010
you know,
you don't,

827
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,130
you get on a waiting list for that kind 
of,

828
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,480
uh,
uh,

829
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,270
as you stay in London,
you're unemployed,

830
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:18,420
which rent is low,
and so pete,

831
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:20,770
you,
so you slow down the movement of people,

832
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,590
you slow down the turnover of people in 
these apartments.

833
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,723
But again,
most people who talk about this don't 

834
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,890
even talk in terms of if this then that 
they talk about it is,

835
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,350
this is how the world ought to be.
Well,

836
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,490
heck,
I can think of all kinds of things we'll

837
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,040
have,
I think the world ought to be.

838
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,330
But unfortunately most of those things 
involve a cost trade off.

839
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,610
Do you think there is a system or a 
government that's doing it better,

840
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,100
doing freedom better than we're doing it
here for,

841
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,950
for all the flaws that we have in this,
in this system?

842
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,940
Is anyone doing it better than us?
Although there may be marginally solved,

843
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,920
but I think most of the Western world is
less free than it was,

844
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:03,190
say 30 years ago,
40 years ago by,

845
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,000
by what measurements do you view that?
Oh,

846
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,270
just the amount of regulations.
Uh,

847
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,180
things you could use,
and also by consequences.

848
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,343
I was reading a Milton Friedman,
he and his wife had a joint 

849
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:20,680
autobiography and she,
she's looking at one point,

850
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:21,514
she says,
looking back on the days when she would 

851
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:28,930
ride the ind subway in Manhattan and 
what a joy it was.

852
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:32,560
And she said it knows long gone days and
uh,

853
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,394
the ind subway goes through Harlem and 
Milton Friedman and his wife when they 

854
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:41,180
were still according used to go dancing 
at the savoy ballroom.

855
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,190
A very,
very few people want.

856
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,820
And you know,
the famous theme song of Duke Ellington,

857
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,200
take the,
a train the,

858
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,080
a train goes right through Harlem on the
I and D line.

859
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,220
And uh,
so Friedman who was only five foot two,

860
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:01,870
he had no fear of being mugged or even a
costume.

861
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,440
And go there.
There were.

862
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,140
And this was common,
there was a,

863
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,983
there was a black actress who used to 
get finished with Pele and her 

864
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,730
socializing afterwards at 1:00
in the morning.

865
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,564
She said she would be taking the subway 
up to 155th street and St Nicholas 

866
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,020
Avenue by herself.
And one walking home,

867
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,243
nobody does that these days.
And so you have to look one at what are 

868
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,100
the facts,
how did they change?

869
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,560
And,
and,

870
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,010
and he don't simply say the other thing 
is that the same,

871
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,520
the no child left behind thing with 
Bush.

872
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,750
There are kids who go to school to raise
hell.

873
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,650
And a handful of those can present the 
whole classroom learning anything.

874
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,750
Now the logical thing would be to 
separate those kids out.

875
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,480
And the ones who want to learn 
something,

876
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,373
learn something.
You can't do that because the ideology 

877
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:58,240
says no.
And he goes,

878
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,074
so and so you sacrifice whole 
generations of poor and minority kids 

879
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,770
for this ideology and this utopian 
notion.

880
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,750
Yeah.
And we.

881
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,560
And we ended up in an ID,
dystopia.

882
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:12,050
Probably Friedman used to say,
uh,

883
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:12,943
the best is the enemy of the good.
And of course it would be better if 

884
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:19,160
everybody could be educated at the same 
time.

885
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,383
It can't be done.
So as someone that has survived the 

886
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,250
arrows and,
and the venom that the left can throw at

887
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:30,200
you,
because I see a lot of this these days.

888
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:32,270
I see even when they,
they say to me,

889
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,433
um,
I find I get a lot of email from people 

890
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:35,640
saying,
well,

891
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,730
how,
how can I be brave enough to do it?

892
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:42,731
And I think it's particularly a unique 
situation for a minorities that consider

893
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:46,430
themselves conservative or libertarian 
or a little bit to the right.

894
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,503
So I mentioned Larry elder before and of
course you and my friend David Webb and 

895
00:43:50,481 --> 00:43:50,811
I,
you know,

896
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:51,644
there,
there are some more black conservatives 

897
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,790
than perhaps there used to be.
Um,

898
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:55,683
no question about what would be if 
someone's watching this right now and 

899
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:02,090
just needs that little extra bit of 
courage to start saying,

900
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:02,541
no,
no,

901
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,374
no,
no.

902
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,670
You have to look at the circumstances.
I mean,

903
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,200
I've advised some young people,
uh,

904
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,393
do not go into,
ended up teaching in public schools 

905
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,180
because,
uh,

906
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,103
the odds are so stacked against you and 
people can write bad references from 

907
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,730
you.
For you,

908
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,210
when you touch him,
when you're young and you,

909
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,580
and what they say about you is all of 
this someone sees now,

910
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:28,850
by the time I was a teaching at some of 
these schools,

911
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,010
I remember one place where the 
department,

912
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,210
she haven't used to threaten one of my 
colleagues who,

913
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,030
he wouldn't write good rob references 
for him.

914
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,650
I had,
I had,

915
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:38,250
uh,
you know,

916
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,560
I'd,
I'd published stuff while I was still in

917
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:43,140
graduate school.
I had Milton Friedman and enjoy joy,

918
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:43,983
stealing the right references for me.
What this guy said there as chairman of 

919
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,320
the department wouldn't,
wouldn't matter a bit,

920
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,530
but,
but most people don't have,

921
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,800
don't have that,
uh,

922
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,070
situation.
And so you have to pick you,

923
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,170
you have to pick your fights.
So I want to,

924
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:00,640
uh,
time is limited here.

925
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:03,970
I want to mention one thing that you say
right at the end of the book that really

926
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,840
what we need more than anything else 
perhaps is common decency.

927
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,540
And we've Kinda lost.
That isn't common anymore.

928
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,600
I mean,
uh,

929
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,380
when I was going to school and we'd have
fights on the school yard grounds,

930
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,493
when one guy was clearly a beaten,
whoever was the toughest kids in the 

931
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:26,370
crowd,
which simply step in and stop it.

932
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,080
The other guys said,
you want to fight,

933
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,060
you can fight me.
You know,

934
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,850
that's what we needed in the public 
square.

935
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:34,410
Now.
Yes,

936
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:35,360
yes.
But,

937
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:36,194
but what I mean the,
there's only so much the police can do 

938
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,083
if you,
if you don't have common decency that 

939
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:43,470
the cops are not,
not,

940
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:45,210
not going to be able to,
to handle it,

941
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,090
especially in when everyone is second 
yesterday.

942
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,210
I love it when people who have never 
fired a gun on their lives,

943
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,353
uh,
say,

944
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,423
why did the cops fire so many guns now?
At one time I taught pistol shooting in 

945
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,254
the Marine Corp.
It doesn't surprise me in the slightest 

946
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,700
shots fired so many things under those 
conditions,

947
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,043
but people,
people can't be knowledgeable about 

948
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:07,584
everything,
but they can be knowledgeable about the 

949
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:12,630
extent of their own ignorance or even if
they have phds.

950
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,713
Sarah,
thIs has been a true honor and a 

951
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:19,070
pleasure.
And I know I can see it in your eyes,

952
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:19,904
even the,
the sort of humility that you have in 

953
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,020
humbleness,
but you've,

954
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,873
you've affected so many people and are 
still continuing to affect so many 

955
00:46:25,341 --> 00:46:27,380
people.
And I hope that we might have just given

956
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:29,290
that a little extra bump today.
So I'm,

957
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,710
I'm truly honored that you took the 
time.

958
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,800
Thank robots.
