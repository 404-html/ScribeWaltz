1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,333
All right,
let's talk about college and education 

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:05,394
this week.
Perhaps the best way to dive into this 

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:10,020
discussion is to first tell you guys a 
bit about my own personal experience.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,183
I went to public school in Long Island 
from kindergarten through high school 

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:14,514
and then onto binghamton university.
New York actually has a pretty great 

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,730
college system for decades and since I 
was a resident,

7
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:24,660
tuition was discounted to just a 
fraction of what most colleges costs.

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,494
Now I got a solid education at an 
affordable public school and have used 

9
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,784
my degree in political science to do 
exactly what you all tuned in to see me 

10
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:33,984
do now.
It was my education that led me to 

11
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:39,810
guiding conversations about important 
topics with interesting people.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,270
I will spend a lot of time in college 
smoking pot and listening to fish.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,153
Uh,
but that's another story for another 

14
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,210
time.
This show has been devoted to discussing

15
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,050
ideas.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,460
That very concept is rooted in a good 
education in which you can question what

17
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:54,294
you believe.
This is the number one reason to go to 

18
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,950
college,
to learn how to think critically.

19
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,053
When we talk about a battle of ideas,
you can only have that battle when 

20
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:03,894
people know what their ideas are 
actually based on when we talk about 

21
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:08,064
free speech,
you can only really talk about knowing 

22
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:14,820
why free speech is important and what 
happens to societies that don't have it.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,300
When we talk about the dysfunction of 
our political process,

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,343
you can really only understand it if you
know the basic tenants of how it was 

25
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:22,974
designed to work in the first place and 
when we talk about the complex issues 

26
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:26,724
facing the Middle East,
you can really only understand them if 

27
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:31,230
you know the history of the countries 
and the people living there.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,540
I didn't learn all of these things in 
college,

29
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,374
but the foundation of having my ideas 
challenged and learning new things 

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,910
absolutely was built.

31
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,743
Their learning is something I try to do 
on this show each week and it's why I 

32
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,140
have no problem telling you guys.
I don't know everything and I don't have

33
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,270
all the answers.
At this very moment.

34
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,104
The American education system and our 
colleges in particular are under total 

35
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,304
assault from the backwards forces on the
left who don't want open discussion and 

36
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,284
would rather stifle ideas they don't 
like such as critiquing a certain 

37
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,154
religion or questioning the motives of 
the social justice movement because of 

38
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,384
the authoritarian crusade to shelter 
young people from ideas that might 

39
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,044
challenge them.
We've created safe spaces where we once 

40
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,434
had rigorous debate.
We now issue trigger warnings where we 

41
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,140
once were brave enough to hear ideas 
that would make us uncomfortable.

42
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,710
The attack on the honest debate has 
gotten so bad.

43
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,544
It is now hard to tell if this 
intellectual affliction is coming from 

44
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,414
the students or from the faculty between
the professor calling for muscle to 

45
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,484
remove press from a demonstration at the
University of Missouri to students 

46
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,564
demanding the dean be fired at Yale for 
defending the freedom of expression to 

47
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:40,734
my former guests,
Milo yiannopoulos being shouted down 

48
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,990
while talking about free speech at 
rutgers just two weeks ago.

49
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,730
The tentacles of intolerance are taking 
root at colleges all across America,

50
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,700
and it's the ideas which take root 
today.

51
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:56,070
That will be the ideas that lead us into
the future.

52
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:56,904
That's the real risk here.
We must be willing to exercise our free 

53
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,994
speech more thoughtfully than to only 
use it to prevent other people from 

54
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,134
exercising.
There's we have a right to free speech 

55
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,000
in this country.
Not a right to not be offended.

56
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,830
My guests,
just last week,

57
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,360
Ben Shapiro just had a speech about 
conservatism at cal State University,

58
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,590
canceled after leftist activist 
protested his presence on campus.

59
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,530
The school president said that Ben would
be invited back,

60
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,890
but as part of a panel,
when more diverse views can be heard,

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,040
well that concept doesn't sound terrible
in and of itself.

62
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,410
Let's really understand what happened 
here.

63
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,950
When the authoritarians be they on the 
left or on the right,

64
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,730
when they like your views,
you can speak freely and there's no need

65
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:40,840
for counter voices.

66
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,200
When they don't like your views,
well you will be screamed at or outright

67
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,034
canceled.
This is dangerous and it's happening 

68
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,780
more and more every day.
I sat here for over an hour with Ben and

69
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,960
although I didn't agree with him on an 
array of topics,

70
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,200
I listened and I learned from the 
response we got on the episode,

71
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,034
so did many of you,
even if all you learned was that you 

72
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,494
completely disagree with him.
That's what conversation is all about 

73
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,310
and it's that precious space where you 
learn to think on your own,

74
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,940
which is exactly what the point of 
higher education is supposed to be.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,620
College is the single most important 
place where ideas must be challenged.

76
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,454
As I say all the time,
let the battle of ideas happen and the 

77
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:20,950
good ones will eventually win by 
slandering opponents,

78
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:24,160
demanding professors be fired and 
canceling speaking events.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,233
These college kids are unwittingly 
strengthening ideas that will one day 

80
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:28,840
silence of them.

81
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,063
Eventually the day will come when they 
want to say something that's considered 

82
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,214
unpopular and they will then be 
subjected to the same practices that 

83
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:38,590
they themselves are propagating right 
now.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,873
The second they leave the safety of 
their college quad and are hit with the 

85
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,714
harsh reality of the real world.
They'll be ill prepared to deal with 

86
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,134
anyone who doesn't share their myopic 
view of how things should be to help me 

87
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,950
dissect this crisis and that's exactly 
what it is,

88
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:56,710
is Professor Gad said,
God is an author,

89
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:57,544
professor and evolutionary behavioral 
scientists at the John Molson School of 

90
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,210
business at Concordia University in 
Montreal,

91
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,044
Canada.
God is also a fearless defender of free 

92
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:07,894
speech and an outspoken advocate of free
expression in an academic climate that 

93
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,170
doesn't look too kindly on these things.
These days.

94
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,423
We're going to dive deep into what has 
happened at college campuses all over 

95
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:22,240
the world and why free speech must be 
defended at all costs.

96
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,460
Once again,
get in your safe space.

97
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,294
You've been triggered war,
and let's exercise some of that free 

98
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:32,161
speech while we still have it set as a 
professor,

99
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,050
author,
Youtube Creator,

100
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:35,884
defender of free speech and secular 
ideas known as the godfather and he's 

101
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:41,284
spreading the sad truth.
I think you're going to spread a little 

102
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:45,340
of it right here.
Thank you so much for having me again.

103
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,293
So I'm very excited to talk to you.
I say that to all my guests because I'm 

104
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,760
always excited to talk to people,
but I particularly mean it today because

105
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:56,761
you joined me for the first test show a 
all the way back in August.

106
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,950
Uh,
people think that

107
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,843
Sam Harris was the first guest,
but technically Gad sad was the first 

108
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,210
repeat guest.
So you now are the first.

109
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,430
You were the first guest,
you were the first repeat guest and,

110
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,460
and you're doing so much cool stuff in 
this space.

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,110
This,
this sort of,

112
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:12,820
uh,
what,

113
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,200
what do we want to call ourselves now?
What space are we in?

114
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,140
Fighters have good ideas.
I like that.

115
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,760
Fighters have good ideas.
All right,

116
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,770
so I want to get into,
uh,

117
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,350
the work that you do.
I want to talk about your books.

118
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,140
I want to talk about your tweets and I 
want to talk about your youtube channel,

119
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,840
but I saw you do an interview with 
astronaut Omani.

120
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,720
Uh,
which was really,

121
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,030
really fascinating.
Talk about your history.

122
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,930
So you were born in Lebanon and I'm 
going to let you take it away.

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,700
Sam was born in Lebanon,
a 19,

124
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,830
late 1964.

125
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,610
So now everybody knows my age.
There you go.

126
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,573
Um,
lived there for 11 years and then the 

127
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,280
civil war broke out in the mid 
seventies.

128
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,870
It became very,
very difficult to be Jewish in Lebanon.

129
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,793
Uh,
and so we really had to leave under 

130
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,580
imminent threat of execution in Lebanon.
Everybody carries an internal ID card,

131
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,260
very much like a passport,
but for,

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,193
for the country itself.
And on that ID card is stated very 

133
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:09,764
clearly what your religion is.
And so if you are stopped at particular 

134
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:17,831
roadblocks by militia who were not 
sympathetic to you being Jewish,

135
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,270
it wasn't going to turn out well.
And as you might imagine,

136
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,410
most of the militia at that point,
you know,

137
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:24,110
you wouldn't have cleared those 
roadblocks.

138
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,380
And so we really needed to leave.
And so we left Lebanon,

139
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,303
um,
the day that we left Lebanon and we 

140
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,320
cleared the airspace of A.

141
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,560
Well,
Lebanon,

142
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,420
the,
as the captain had mentioned that,

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,220
uh,
my wife and my wife,

144
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:40,550
my mother takes out a star of David,
puts it around my neck and says,

145
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,520
now you don't have to hide who you are.
Okay,

146
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:44,354
so let's,
let's back up before we get to your 

147
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,710
escape because of,
for your escape.

148
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,480
There was some pretty amazing stuff that
happens.

149
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:55,120
So your parents were kidnapped by PLO.
Terrorists later.

150
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,910
Okay.
So we,

151
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,380
we emigrated to Canada and late 75 then 
for the next four years,

152
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:04,340
my parents kept going back and forth 
from Montreal to Lebanon.

153
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,443
They really couldn't extricate 
themselves fully from their previous 

154
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,970
life in Lebanon and on one of those 
trips in 1980,

155
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,510
there were kidnapped by a photo.
Yeah.

156
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,920
You had a guest,
but no relation,

157
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,130
no relation,
no relation,

158
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,940
but Fatah is sort of now it's considered
the moderate version.

159
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,330
The moderate to Hamas.

160
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,670
Moderate in the Middle East is a very 
attentive term.

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,230
Sure.
And so they were kidnapped.

162
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:31,064
They disappeared for a,
I think it was eight days at the time 

163
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,700
that it was happening when my siblings 
are much older than me,

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,833
we're trying to find a way to rescue 
them or even know if they're still 

165
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,040
alive.
I had been lied to.

166
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,620
I was told that they had some financial 
problems.

167
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:47,540
That's why there was so much upheaval in
the house.

168
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,630
So during those eight days or my parents
had disappeared,

169
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,830
I didn't know that they were potentially
dead.

170
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,443
What they were finally rescued.
They were rescued actually because my 

171
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,810
mother's best friend at the time,
her name was,

172
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,243
uh,
was the personal dresser of half as an 

173
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,970
asset.
And so through those connections we were

174
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,340
able to pinpoint which militia group had
them.

175
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:15,330
And I guess was he the president of a 
president of Syria,

176
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,010
the president of Syria,
Syria.

177
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,173
And then through him I think a Yasser 
Arafat got involved and finally they 

178
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,040
found them.
They were with a group led by Don.

179
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm going on my memory here from when I 
was 15.

180
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,790
Uh,
and then,

181
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,960
uh,
they were rescued.

182
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,930
And I think one of the things that you 
might remember from the story with,

183
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,700
uh,
my discussion with Astro,

184
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,730
uh,
when my parents were eventually rescued,

185
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,923
uh,
my father had a severe injury from 

186
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:42,954
having been beaten with a coalition of 
cove and he had a temporary stroke 

187
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,740
paralysis in his face,
which eventually subsided.

188
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,023
And in my mother's case,
I remember that one of the things that 

189
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,054
had really disturbed me as a 15 year old
young male was whether she had been 

190
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,313
raped.
And I remember that shortly after they 

191
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,620
were rescued and came back to Montreal.
I asked her,

192
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,454
the only time I've ever brought up the 
subject and she said that while they 

193
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,450
repeatedly threatened her 
psychologically would rape,

194
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,680
that they hadn't raped her.

195
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,633
And I don't know if that's true or not,
we just sort of dropped the subject and 

196
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,480
never raised it again.
Yeah.

197
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,700
So I don't know that you can know the 
answer to this,

198
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:26,700
but what were,
what were they trying to get out of your

199
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:27,720
brain?
What was the advantage of,

200
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,330
of taking x pats that were now Canadians
and kidnapping?

201
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,970
Yeah.
Great.

202
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,803
Actually,
it's one of the seven deadly sins of 

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,380
greed,
one of the,

204
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,453
uh,
the owner of a building where my father 

205
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:45,141
had a store in the lobby was trying to 
low ball my father to sell the store and

206
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,520
thinking that of course as Jews they 
weren't a very precarious situation.

207
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,350
He had hired these militia to try to 
extract from them a confession that they

208
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:59,970
were Israeli spies and the only thing 
and then if they would then execute them

209
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:03,900
as Israeli spies somehow magically he 
could get that sore.

210
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,063
Luckily for my parents,
of course they didn't confess to that 

211
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,674
because they're not Israeli spies and 
that's what kept them alive for those 

212
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:10,824
eight days because there was an ulterior
motive to get them to sign those 

213
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:14,490
confessions.
Wow,

214
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,333
that's really incredible.
So now I know why I jumped ahead with 

215
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,174
the story about your parents because 
what happened to you getting out of 

216
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,373
Lebanon I thought was fascinating.
So you were talking about going through 

217
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,620
the checkpoints and being in a car.
Yes.

218
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,120
And you have a very foggy memory of.
Exactly.

219
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:30,954
So I remember very,
very well actually we had hired PLO 

220
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,411
militia.
I mean,

221
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,150
you think about the guys that you see 
today,

222
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,800
the Isis guys,
how they look?

223
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,910
Well,
I've,

224
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,743
that's what I grew up with now.
Those guys were contracted to drive us 

225
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,840
to the airport,
uh,

226
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,810
precisely because by close to the baby 
with international airport,

227
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,823
there were a lot of militia checkpoints 
of Palestinians and there was no way 

228
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,970
you're going to get through that if,
if they weren't sympathetic to,

229
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,290
to you.

230
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,123
So,
but of course they could take you and 

231
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,584
they can take it to the ditch and shoot 
you so you don't really know what's 

232
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:02,284
going to happen.
So I remember being picked up by these 

233
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,074
guys.
I remember getting to the airport and 

234
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:09,280
then the story would end up on the 
plane,

235
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,700
but everything in between I have zero 
recollection of that.

236
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:17,200
And I once asked my parents what 
happened and she said that,

237
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,493
uh,
as we were going through different 

238
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,930
neighborhoods that would have been 
hostile to Palestinian militia,

239
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,220
for example,
Christian groups,

240
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,970
everybody was engaging one another very 
much like a Rambo movie.

241
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,040
We were at the bottom of the floor of 
the car,

242
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,500
sort of being hidden.
All of that.

243
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,330
I have zero recollection of that.
Yeah.

244
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,253
It's so fascinating because it shows you
how complex the entire situation with 

245
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:42,940
Lebanon and the Palestinians and the 
Israelis is because you had,

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,833
you had Palestinian militia people being
paid off to help Jews escaped Lebanon 

247
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,870
because of their civil war.

248
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,681
I mean,
it really.

249
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,210
If you,
if you map this whole thing,

250
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:53,740
people will go,
this makes no sense.

251
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,700
Well,
I have,

252
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,010
I've actually written about this,
that,

253
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,003
you know,
Muslims were trying to kill us and 

254
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,240
Muslims saved us.
Right?

255
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,550
So you can sort of have a blanket 
statement,

256
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,450
you know,
all Muslims,

257
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,110
right?
That's an.

258
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,943
Oh,
so you don't believe in all Muslims are 

259
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:07,780
bad.
Okay.

260
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,870
Go ahead.
That outright they're getting.

261
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,220
Because we don't want you.
He misquoted.

262
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,200
So you must feel a sort of very strange 
when a right now,

263
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:19,360
you know,
Hezbollah is sort of taking over Lebanon

264
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,194
and they're fighting in Syria and that's
your home country and it's teetering on 

265
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,780
democracy or it's democracy I should 
say,

266
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,200
is teetering.
Uh,

267
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,100
how do you feel about Lebanon now?
And you might be with you.

268
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,360
I do so much.
I,

269
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:31,831
you know,
my,

270
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:33,160
I have two children,
uh,

271
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:36,070
so between my wife and I,
we speak five languages,

272
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,930
so I speak French,
English,

273
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,310
Arabic and Hebrew.

274
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,890
She speaks English,
French and Armenian,

275
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,053
and yet our children only speak French 
and English because by virtue of living 

276
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:47,614
in Montreal and I really regret the fact
that we don't have the opportunity to 

277
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,480
take our children back to Lebanon,
for example,

278
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,840
one year visiting professorship at 
American University of Beirut,

279
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,790
you know,
dumped them in that context.

280
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,500
They could come back fluent Arabic 
speaker,

281
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,150
speaker.
Could you do it?

282
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,690
Is there because because of the 
political situation or you know,

283
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,563
and in Beirut,
if you make a left turn here than there 

284
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,723
is an isis recruitment center perhaps.
You mean you don't know who's the Nice 

285
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,911
Guy,
who's the bad guy,

286
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:13,744
right?
It won't take much for people to find 

287
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,390
out.
Number one,

288
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,010
that I'm Jewish,
number two,

289
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,620
that I've written quite forcefully about
some of these issues.

290
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,820
It's very easy for you to disappear in 
the trunk of a car.

291
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,280
Right?
So I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable

292
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,114
given the current situation.
Cigarettes now I've been told I have a 

293
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,330
lot of friends that have said,
look,

294
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:33,460
we can guarantee your security come back
and so on.

295
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,350
Can you really?
So,

296
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,243
so I'd rather not.
And certainly not when I have young 

297
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,284
children.
Right.

298
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,870
So before the civil war,
and I know you were,

299
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,030
you were 12 when it happened,
so you were pretty young.

300
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,864
11,
11.

301
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,170
Do you,
what,

302
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:47,830
what was it like to be Jewish?
There was actually.

303
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,220
Okay.
So that's,

304
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,550
that's a very issue because oftentimes 
people will say,

305
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,260
oh,
but Jews were treated very nicely.

306
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:54,891
I mean,
yes,

307
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:55,724
nicely in the sense that they aren't 
daily decapitations the square and 

308
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,260
central square,
right?

309
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,293
You could go about your business,
but everything is nice until the 

310
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,620
decapitations happen,
right?

311
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,010
So,
uh,

312
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,010
you were tolerated,
right?

313
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,420
I mean,
people knew you were Jewish.

314
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,280
They didn't necessarily bother you 
everyday,

315
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,443
but antisemitism pervades the fabric of 
every possible element of society in 

316
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,554
those regions.
Now that doesn't mean that everybody's 

317
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,840
an antisemite,
but you know,

318
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,300
you just be quiet,
don't,

319
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,810
don't signal your belongingness to this 
group.

320
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,670
Be understated.
Yeah.

321
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:34,610
And then once the civil war happened,
sort of the rules were just changed,

322
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:35,210
right?
Is that,

323
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,043
is that what it was?
Basically you guys felt that whatever 

324
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,230
side wins this thing,
we're finished.

325
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,530
I mean,
there,

326
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,363
there were Jews that were killed and it 
would have only been a matter of time 

327
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,480
where somebody would have found us and 
killed us.

328
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,180
So it really was under imminent threat 
of execution.

329
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,560
I mean,
we either get out or that.

330
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,503
Yeah.
So I know that a certain amount of 

331
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:54,620
people will be watching this and we'll 
say,

332
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,454
well wait,
I don't understand because God is a 

333
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,443
extremely outspoken atheist,
but he's here repeated several times 

334
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:01,664
that you're Jewish.

335
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,830
How do you reconcile that?
Because I've met a few people on it,

336
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:04,664
had Ali Rizvi who's an atheist Muslim 
and we talked about how he reconciles 

337
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:08,500
it.
Uh,

338
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,360
and there's been a couple of other 
people where we,

339
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,670
the way I reconcile it for myself,
how do you reconcile that?

340
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,130
So the way I would answer that is that 
Judaism,

341
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,190
or to be Jewish as a multifaceted 
identity,

342
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,950
there's a cultural element.
There is a historical element,

343
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:26,951
there is a shared context history,
there's just the shared history,

344
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,890
shared lineage,
uh,

345
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,480
one of which is adherence to a set of 
religious doctrines.

346
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,460
And so I could choose to ignore those 
doctrines and still say I do belong to a

347
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:41,890
group of people,
uh,

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,050
that can be traced back in this manner 
through genealogy.

349
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,610
Right.
And so in that sense,

350
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:48,030
I'm very Jewish,
uh,

351
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,530
but in the religious element,
I'm not at all Jewish.

352
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,423
Yeah.
Do you think you don't get a certain 

353
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,390
cred of being from the Middle East 
because of that?

354
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,433
Because there is a sense and we're going
to sit down and we followed the gosh a 

355
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,520
little bit later,
but you know,

356
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,220
I've known him online for over a year.
I just,

357
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,320
because he said that he had Palestinian 
ancestry,

358
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:09,870
I just assumed he was Muslim.
I didn't know until we met two weeks ago

359
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:10,704
I had dinner that his family actually 
was Christian and that was just a silly 

360
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,193
and sloppy thinking on my part.
But do you feel that you sort of don't 

361
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,340
get some of the credit of being a real 
middle easterner?

362
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,770
I mean,
it depends on who you're speaking,

363
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,870
I guess from the people on the left that
I spend so much time,

364
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,560
you know,
once I break down the break,

365
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,980
break down with the flawless Arabic than
those kinds of concerns go away.

366
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,100
Right.
Because it's,

367
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,943
it's,
it's quite impressive for somebody to 

368
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,050
accuse you of that.
And then when your mother.

369
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,640
I mean everything about us as Arabic.
I mean,

370
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,630
yes,
we happen to be Jewish,

371
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,190
but I mean,
you know,

372
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,010
culturally we're were Arabic,
right,

373
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:42,844
with Arab Jews.
So it's very difficult for people to 

374
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,374
levy that charge.
Although I have interesting a personal 

375
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,280
anecdote.
When I was a graduate student,

376
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,010
a doctoral student at Cornell,
uh,

377
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:55,650
I became friends with a lot of Arabic 
students,

378
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,653
uh,
as what typically happened because I 

379
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,884
have more in common with them than I 
might have with the Jewish guy from 

380
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:01,880
Poland.
Right,

381
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,320
right.
Sure.

382
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,500
Uh,
and so at one point,

383
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,200
one of these guys who had gone for 
coffee,

384
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,540
he said to me,
you know,

385
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,110
I really,
I really liked again.

386
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,701
I said,
well,

387
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:13,350
why do you say that as though you're so 
surprised?

388
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,040
It was,
well,

389
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,700
you know,
because,

390
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,061
well,
you know,

391
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,380
because you're Jewish,
but you know,

392
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:18,340
but you're not a Jew Jew.
Right,

393
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,453
right.
I said,

394
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,800
no,
no,

395
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,460
I'm a Ju Ju Ju Ju.
He goes,

396
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:21,871
no,
come on.

397
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,860
You know what I mean?
You're not a Jew.

398
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:23,694
So in that case,
what he was saying is you're not really 

399
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,723
the archetype of what I imagined a Jew 
to be you really Arabic and so it's the 

400
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:33,150
opposite of what you asked.
I think all of this is so fascinating.

401
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:33,984
The reason I like talking about it,
it's very similar to what I was 

402
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:41,001
discussing with Tara Fatah few days ago.
That identity is so malleable actually.

403
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,613
It's so,
not necessarily your religion or your 

404
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:47,214
history or even your ethnicity or where 
you were born in nationality because 

405
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,983
it's all of those things.
And I guess that's why I hate identity 

406
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:58,341
politics so much because I realize that 
most people are like,

407
00:18:58,711 --> 00:18:59,544
you are like me,
that pick and choose what to believe in 

408
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:02,934
and that secular values ultimately are 
the things that should move us forward 

409
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:06,540
as a society.

410
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,870
Speaking of identity politics,
uh,

411
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,640
and privileged scores,
I should mention that.

412
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:16,050
I know you're privileged now.
I've lost some points because my skin is

413
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:16,884
a bit lighter that summer,
but I've made sure to put on a bit of 

414
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:22,020
weight so that I could gain on the 
fattism score.

415
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,130
So it an in a homeostatic mechanism 
whereby maintain my victimology score at

416
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:28,224
a certain point.
Right.

417
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,490
But the but the fat thing is way lower 
on the list than the other thing.

418
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,010
I'll bring it back and then the religion
things up here,

419
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:36,600
depending on what religion is.
Such a,

420
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,060
people should be walking around with 
cards and you just hand it to him and be

421
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:40,410
like,
well here's my shit.

422
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:41,244
And mother underprivileged.
I did a thing on buzzfeed the other day 

423
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,330
about privilege.
Did you see this one?

424
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,910
But I didn't say they did it.
How privileged are you?

425
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,540
And I got a 42 out of hundreds that I 
wasn't privileged at all.

426
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,700
Now it's it pretty great.
I'm not really.

427
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,740
I thought I'm going to,
I got to tell people about.

428
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm off the charts on that one.
Yeah,

429
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,560
you'd be,
you'd get a negative sick.

430
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,550
I'm fantastic.
Yeah.

431
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,360
Yeah.
Um,

432
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,193
okay.
So I wanted to get some of your history 

433
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:02,724
out of the way,
but let's talk about what you're doing 

434
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,760
now.
Um,

435
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,910
so you are a professor and you do 
research on your own and all that.

436
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:12,204
We've got your book,
the consuming instincts as signed copy 

437
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,504
for you decided already signed that and 
if I see it on Ebay as a means for you 

438
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:23,190
to try to fund your Malibu House,
I'll be upset.

439
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,640
No,
no,

440
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,980
don't worry about the Malibu House.
I'm working on it in other,

441
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,570
other ways.
Um,

442
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,960
so tell me a little bit about what 
brought you to the world of academic.

443
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,973
So I've always known,
I mean there were two things that I was 

444
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,260
really good at and interested in soccer 
and studying books.

445
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,400
Uh,
I was certainly going quite a,

446
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,920
my soccer career was going quite well,
but then I had some serious injuries and

447
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,850
other circumstances that don't allow me 
to pursue that.

448
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,450
And so that accelerated my move to 
academia and so I always do.

449
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,890
I mean,
I didn't even take any breaks between my

450
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,260
degrees.
I just went through,

451
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:56,240
it's through,
through my phd,

452
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:59,710
it's straight to professorship because I
never imagined doing anything else,

453
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,100
uh,
in terms of the work that I do,

454
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,250
if that's what we talk about.
Uh,

455
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,153
so what I,
what I do is I basically Mary 

456
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,250
evolutionary psychology and biology to 
the study of consumer behavior.

457
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,503
So the idea being that what makes us 
consumed the way that we are is 

458
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,120
ultimately rooted in some evolutionary 
mechanisms.

459
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,133
Why is it that men are the ones who are 
most likely to succumb to the 

460
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,010
pornographic addiction?
Uh,

461
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,030
what,
uh,

462
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,863
how do women's hormones throughout their
menstrual cycles affect their behaviors 

463
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,334
as consumers?
And so I look at these biological 

464
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,330
underpinnings specifically in the 
consumer setting.

465
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,433
So do you think that most behaviors,
most human behaviors are linked back to 

466
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,610
genetics more than anything else?
I know you've talked about this.

467
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,920
Yes,
yes.

468
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,753
Yeah.
And it's the nature versus nurture 

469
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,094
argument and things like that.
But would you say that's really where 

470
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,420
the stuff we're made of?
I mean,

471
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,760
certainly there are biological 
imperatives.

472
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,100
That's our part of our shared,
you know,

473
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,273
human nature,
but there's always an interaction 

474
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,140
between our genes and our environment 
and the.

475
00:21:59,141 --> 00:21:59,974
I always love to use a cake metaphor,
so if you take the ingredients in a 

476
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:03,574
cake,
the,

477
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,360
the,
the baking soda and the flour,

478
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,410
the sugar,
the eggs,

479
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,180
they're each separate ingredients.

480
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,010
Then you put them altogether,
you make a cake.

481
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,740
If I were to tell you now point to the 
exit point of the sugar,

482
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,723
you wouldn't be able to.
It's an inextricable mix and so much of 

483
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:21,640
who we are as an inextricable.
It makes of our nature and nurture.

484
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,563
The problem with most social scientists 
has been over the past hundred years is 

485
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,374
that they have doggedly refuse to accept
that biology matters and so their 

486
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,280
position has always been,
yeah,

487
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,123
yeah.
Evolutionary theory is relevant to 

488
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,400
explain the behavior of the dog and the 
mosquito and the zebra,

489
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,010
but don't use their.
Apply it to human behavior.

490
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,083
We transcend our biology.
What makes us human is that we are 

491
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,350
cultural animals and that's silly.
Well,

492
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:46,840
I mean if you were just to look at 
people being gay,

493
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,390
would that be an argument against that 
as well?

494
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,220
Right,
because when they buy that logic,

495
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,380
they would say you could override it or 
something like that.

496
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,230
That's right.
Exactly.

497
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,930
Of course,
that's one example,

498
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,010
but there's a Zillion,
right?

499
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:57,950
I mean,
I mean it,

500
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,213
it.
It behooves one to understand how 

501
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:01,954
serious academics could genuinely 
believe that biology doesn't carry much 

502
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,020
importance when it comes to 
understanding human affairs,

503
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,020
but it really originally started from a 
very good place.

504
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,790
A lot of miscreants use evolutionary 
theory for nefarious goals.

505
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,590
Right?
Hitler misused that.

506
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,940
A eugenesis misused as a social class 
elitists in Britain and said,

507
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:22,774
hey,
the upper classes are better than the 

508
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:26,240
lower classes.
Who cares if the little classes dot,

509
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,093
hey,
that's the Darwinian of course had 

510
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:32,170
nothing to do with Darwinian theory,
but because of all these cretins misuse,

511
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,180
evolutionary theory,
social sciences said,

512
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,910
okay,
well let's create a new understanding of

513
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:37,744
human nature where biology is no longer 
relevant and hopefully there won't be 

514
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,300
these types of abuses,
but that's silly.

515
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,980
I mean,
you have to route your science and logic

516
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:46,570
and reason.

517
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,403
Yeah,
so my whole a direct message at the top 

518
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:53,180
of the show is talking about academia 
and sort of the ideas that are,

519
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,630
that are working in colleges and mostly 
that are not working and the free speech

520
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:59,390
problems we're having,
which were hugely here in America,

521
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:00,224
but I know it's happening in Canada too,
and it's happening all across Europe 

522
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,080
right now.
Um,

523
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,993
and you're,
you're right in the thick of that 

524
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:07,770
because you are outspoken.
That's what,

525
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,953
why we connected in the first place.
I saw this guy on twitter and I was 

526
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:11,151
like,
wow,

527
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,130
this guy gets it and he's not afraid to 
say it.

528
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,340
So,
um,

529
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,090
what,
what do you think the general atmosphere

530
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,770
or,
or talk about for your experience,

531
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:22,270
what's the general?
So you might have seen it.

532
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,193
I recently delivered a lecture on 
political correctness and the thought 

533
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,150
police and I gave many of these 
examples,

534
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,370
which if,
if they weren't true,

535
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,470
you would think it's straight out of the
onion.

536
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,303
I mean,
it's really just an impossible to 

537
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:39,800
imagine that the fulcrum has,
has swung so much towards lunacy.

538
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,750
Uh,
I think we have to fight it.

539
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,360
I mean,
the reality is that most academics,

540
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,030
uh,
I hate to keep repeating this point,

541
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:49,240
but are afraid of their shadows.
They're careerists,

542
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,453
uh,
to the extent that the general 

543
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,660
environment is,
you have to coddle the,

544
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,180
the students.
You have to infantilize them.

545
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,820
Don't you dare say something that might 
offend them,

546
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,303
then they perpetuate the problem.
But if enough people stand up 

547
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:04,520
courageously and say,
look,

548
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:05,820
this is not right.
As my five.

549
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,010
I've had this discussion recently here 
with some college students,

550
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,210
uh,
and I,

551
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,490
I explained to them that it's not to 
your benefit,

552
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,900
uh,
to have professors be terrified to speak

553
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:18,740
to you.
There's a,

554
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,603
there's a great article that I can't 
remember the name of the professor who 

555
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:22,220
wrote it,
basically said,

556
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,680
uh,
my students terrify me.

557
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,600
That's not a good thing.
I mean,

558
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,520
if you're a student,
you don't want to hear that right?

559
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,740
You want professors will challenge you.
Who,

560
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,660
who gets you to move from your 
positions.

561
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,650
If we are afraid to utter a one syllable
that might somehow,

562
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,590
uh,
necessitate you going into a safe space,

563
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,260
it shatters the possibility for 
dialogue.

564
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,540
Yeah.
So when you say that to students,

565
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,940
I'm going to guess that on an individual
level,

566
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:47,774
if you're sitting across from them,
they probably do get that they probably 

567
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:51,784
don't understand it,
but that when you get them in a group 

568
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:56,860
and the group think star,
that that's where it becomes dangerous.

569
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:57,694
So mom,
so how do you combat that patiently by 

570
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:01,454
demonstrating through evidence that this
is ultimately suboptimal and it will 

571
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,950
only hurt your growth?
Right?

572
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,843
I mean,
people learn by engaging the diversity 

573
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,000
of ideas.
I mean,

574
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,140
that's what learning is about.

575
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,333
And so,
and I explained to them that I'm very 

576
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,390
open to somebody coming to see me and 
saying,

577
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:20,270
look,
I've experienced this in this trauma and

578
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:22,400
therefore I need this particular,
uh,

579
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,760
you know,
acquiescence and fine.

580
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,241
I mean,
I'm an,

581
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,370
I'm an empathetic person.
I'll take that into account.

582
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,020
But to have,
for example,

583
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:30,854
a trigger warning that is sufficiently 
vague that it covers every possible 

584
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:38,480
thing that might trigger somebody.
That's not a good idea.

585
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,433
Right,
so let's dig into the trigger warning 

586
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:41,654
thing a little bit.
So there there would be trigger 

587
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,500
warnings.
For example,

588
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,620
if you were teaching a course and you 
were going to discuss rape,

589
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,783
they would a certain amount of people 
that that like these ideas would want 

590
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,204
you to issue a trigger warning so that 
in case someone that was in the class 

591
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:55,494
had been raped or their mother had been 
raped or their sister had been raped or 

592
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,190
whatever it is,
they would,

593
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,070
they would receive notice before 
discussing it.

594
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,190
I know that doesn't sound terrible in 
and of itself,

595
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,950
but it's,
it's the pervasiveness of it,

596
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:08,784
right?
It's the way that it then sort of 

597
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:13,740
shelters you from really dealing with as
well.

598
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,703
And the reality is that it's not 
restricted to a few examples such as 

599
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,500
rate becomes everything.
It's everything.

600
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,363
As a matter of fact,
I,

601
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,570
I,
I took,

602
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,643
I took it upon me to actually generates 
a list of topics that have been 

603
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,830
suggested as possible.
Topics that would be worthy of a trigger

604
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:33,480
warning.
And actually I covered that in my,

605
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,343
in my lecture,
and basically those topics that I 

606
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:37,674
generated would pretty much cover 
anything that anybody could ever talk 

607
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,600
about soccer.
That'd be then,

608
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,850
I mean,
yeah,

609
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,050
I don't know how it could be,
but yeah.

610
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:46,990
And yet here we are,
we're,

611
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,833
where do you think this started?
Because that's the part that I find 

612
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,190
really interesting and I did discuss it 
a little bit with Tarek.

613
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,363
Um,
where did this idea that you have to be 

614
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,490
protected come from and how did it 
proliferate so quickly?

615
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,980
Well,
I think it comes from different sources,

616
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,400
but political correctness is really the,
the,

617
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,253
the,
the impetus of all of these subsequent 

618
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:08,964
movements,
right?

619
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,360
The idea that there are certain things 
that you should not say.

620
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,670
And then we take this idea and then we 
say,

621
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:15,504
well,
there are certain things that you 

622
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,494
shouldn't say it because it makes people
feel uncomfortable or it hurts them or 

623
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:19,644
triggers a past trauma.
And so it becomes the way that I've 

624
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:22,854
described that there's a,
and it's a speculum hypothesis right 

625
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:25,884
now,
but it's certainly worth testing is a 

626
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:30,120
phenomenon known as Munchhausen's 
syndrome.

627
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,040
Uh,
which basically says,

628
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,930
uh,
uh,

629
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,980
a woman,
typically it's a woman who suffered from

630
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,240
this disorder,
uh,

631
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,350
we'll try to feign an illness to 10 
garner sympathy.

632
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,903
Then there's Bush Munchausen Syndrome by
proxy where you harm your child or your 

633
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,040
pet or your elderly parents to try to 
then garner sympathy.

634
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,970
But I think this type of crying for safe
space is sort of this growth tests,

635
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:57,540
collective Munchhausen Syndrome,
right?

636
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Where people get attention by constantly
screaming victim hood.

637
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,960
And so it becomes a very alluring way to
navigate through the world.

638
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:09,420
I always get attention by saying that 
I'm offended,

639
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:10,254
I'm hurt.
I'm,

640
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,510
well,
I escaped execution.

641
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,530
I could still watch a military movie I 
want from now on,

642
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:20,220
whenever I walk around in any city,
you shut down all movie theaters,

643
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,080
that's military because I was going to 
be executed in Lebanon to do it.

644
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,731
God,
I mean,

645
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,010
it's really nuts when you,
when you,

646
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,720
especially when you lay out like a great
metaphor like that.

647
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:34,160
It's like this is because we could all 
do this and that's why every,

648
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:34,830
what do they call it?

649
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,200
You know,
it's just like the afflicted Olympics or

650
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,780
the oppression and the oppression 
Olympics.

651
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,220
It's like,
it will never stop.

652
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,680
Yeah.
And I see this now as,

653
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:48,700
as a disease that's running rampant and 
that's why I talk about it so much.

654
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,743
I can't imagine that this will continue 
as I already see a lot of academics 

655
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,100
write to me privately,
uh,

656
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,950
saying to me they don't yet have the 
courage to come on board publicly,

657
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,090
but they say,
you know,

658
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,820
thank you for speaking out.
Thank you for being a voice of reason.

659
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,390
This has empowered me to try to be a bit
more open.

660
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,600
And I think all it takes is for a 
flicker to start.

661
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,870
And then eventually I think the tide 
will shift back.

662
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,450
I think.
Yeah.

663
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,650
Well that's nice to hear that they're 
privately do that.

664
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,530
But do you get pushback from professors 
that think a gads pushing this too much?

665
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,580
I don't get it to my face because I'm,
I'm,

666
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,130
I'm a formidable guy to go against other
ones.

667
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:28,090
You better come with all your guns if 
you're going to do this stuff with me.

668
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,640
Yeah.
So usually it doesn't happen directly,

669
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,743
but I will hear from,
from sources that such and such person 

670
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:37,120
is upset that I'm taking these 
positions.

671
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:39,670
So I know that there are groups that are
upset with me,

672
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,290
but they don't necessarily come to my 
face and say.

673
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,650
Right.
So this is a great argument for tenure,

674
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,050
right?
I mean if you have tenure rights.

675
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,860
Oh yeah.
Since 1990 $9.

676
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,950
Ninety nine.
So when you got tenure,

677
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,260
did that change at that moment?
Did they,

678
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,370
what did they do?
The hand your paper.

679
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,260
How does it work?
They,

680
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,590
they,
you kneel down and.

681
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,440
Well,
it's actually a committee.

682
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,450
It goes through several layers.
And then finally use,

683
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,100
receive a letter saying that you've been
granted tenure.

684
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,640
Yeah.
Uh,

685
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,473
the process of applying for it as you 
basically give your whole dose here to 

686
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:10,720
demonstrate that you're worthy of that 
honor.

687
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,713
W,
what are the protections you actually 

688
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:14,160
get for tenure?
I mean,

689
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,170
they just can't fire you just like that,
but there must be some Grazia.

690
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,080
What if they run out of money?
If the university closes?

691
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,650
Only if your department would have to be
closed for financial reasons,

692
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,730
then that would be ground for them 
closing the department.

693
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,360
The fact that you a tenured wouldn't 
protect you,

694
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,540
but the purpose of tenure is really to 
make sure that,

695
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,743
let's suppose I'm doing work on 
evolutionary psychology and the Dean as 

696
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:40,030
a young Earth creationists who thinks 
that evolution is a Zionist hoax.

697
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,810
Yeah,
right.

698
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,520
Well,
he or she can't come to me and say,

699
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,354
Hey,
you better stop this evolution stuff 

700
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,970
because it offends me and it makes our 
university look bad and I'll fire you.

701
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,760
Right?
So tenure is a means by which you ensure

702
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:56,761
that a good ideas are able to be pursued
because oftentimes most of the important

703
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,114
ideas or dangerous ideas,
they're ideas that go against the 

704
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,923
orthodoxy.
They're ideas that are considered 

705
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,540
critical at the time.
Right?

706
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,940
Think of Galileo,
think of socrates,

707
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:08,080
right?
And so the,

708
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,320
the idea oftentimes and in political 
discourse,

709
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,700
politicians will say,
oh,

710
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,890
we've got to get rid of tenure because 
all these facts,

711
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,570
professors sit around doing nothing.
Yeah,

712
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,573
that's,
that's basically them saying that 

713
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:22,840
they're idiots because it's admitting 
they're not doing their job.

714
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,240
Tenure is there to make sure that you 
could pinch pursued dangerous ideas.

715
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,480
Now regarding my specific context,
even when I didn't have tenure,

716
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,803
I was outspoken.
Maybe not necessarily about trigger 

717
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,720
warnings because there wasn't.
Right?

718
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,270
But in other words,
I never modulator that my behavior maybe

719
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,104
to a fault.

720
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,630
Maybe I'm not enough of a careerist I 
just,

721
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,790
I don't care.
Uh,

722
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,633
the,
the pursuit of truth for me is greater 

723
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,500
than any careerist considerations.
Yeah.

724
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,363
Well,
I love that and I know that to be true 

725
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:54,794
from you and that's why your channel has
been picking up steam and while you're 

726
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,860
talking to so many great people,
and I think part of it really is because

727
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,600
of exactly what you wrote about in this 
book,

728
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,703
that you're approaching the political 
topics that we're talking about and the 

729
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:09,470
religious topics from a scientific 
place.

730
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,210
I sense that that really is the bedrock 
of what you do as a scientist.

731
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,840
That's what you're trying to quantify 
and qualify all of this stuff.

732
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,703
Exactly.
And I saw your interview with Bill 

733
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,550
Warner,
who is also a scientist and a,

734
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,450
an uh,
you know,

735
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,220
he studied all of the religions,
right?

736
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,054
He said he studied with Moms,
he studied the Qur'an and he studied 

737
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,250
with rabbis and Jerusalem,
the Old Testament,

738
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:31,760
all that.

739
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,593
And,
and I thought he said something very 

740
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,250
similar that as he's looking at these 
things as a scientist,

741
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,650
not as a sociologist.
Exactly.

742
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,150
And do you think that's really the 
healthiest way to listen?

743
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,140
And actually that's one of the reasons 
why.

744
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:45,974
I mean,
of course I receive negative comments 

745
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:51,710
from people and hate mail and so on.
But given the types of positions I take,

746
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:52,544
they're actually quite,
quite few of them precisely because I 

747
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,870
approach it in the manner that I do.
Right.

748
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,853
So whenever I take a position,
I make sure that it is documented as it 

749
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,270
would be if I were submitting a paper to
a scientific journal.

750
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:05,980
Right.
So my,

751
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,813
my evidentiary threshold is set so high 
that it becomes difficult to break it 

752
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:16,880
down and therefore people can accuse me 
of hate speech and this and that because

753
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,040
everything is backed up.
And the case of Bill Warner,

754
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,874
for the viewers who may not know this,
he basically applied the tools of 

755
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:23,504
content analysis to then quantify the 
amount of hate that is found in 

756
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:29,684
different different religious texts so 
we don't have to have a vacuous 

757
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,670
discussion about whether Islam is 
peaceful or not,

758
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,470
whether the Old Testament is peaceful or
not.

759
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,543
I can actually use the tools of science 
in this case called a content analysis 

760
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,570
to quantify how much hate there is in 
this book.

761
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,810
And,
and that becomes unassailable well.

762
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,723
So with the assailable part b though,
that what's in the book is only only 

763
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:57,470
matters depending on the amount of 
people that act on it.

764
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:58,490
Right?
So that's not,

765
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,190
that's not unassailable in its in its 
scientific method,

766
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,250
but that's what the real issue is,
right?

767
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,093
The real issue is not what's in all 
these books as much as how many people 

768
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,780
are acting on it.
But that sounded almost Reza Aslan,

769
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:13,781
which to me didn't get me out of that 
because residence I fully.

770
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,181
I mean,
look,

771
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:16,010
we know these books are all nuts,
right?

772
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,070
Because they're all filled by,
written by men thousands of years ago,

773
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,610
but it's not really what's in them as 
much as how people act on them.

774
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,080
So,
so Reza Aslan basically used the,

775
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,053
uh,
the worst thing anyone's ever said to 

776
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,290
me,
my,

777
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,550
my deep apologies.
Reza Aslan basically use the,

778
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:36,320
a BS argument from postmodernism to say,
you put your meaning exactly.

779
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:38,550
So you know,
who are we to judge whether kill,

780
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,030
kill,
kill means that kill,

781
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:40,864
kill,
kill could mean a stroke with kindness 

782
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:43,734
and correct.
Right?

783
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,850
No,
it doesn't.

784
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,400
Okay.
Yeah.

785
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,400
A language has accepted beaning and no 
amount of postmodern gymnastics is going

786
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:53,880
to alter that.
Right?

787
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:54,714
So I guess what I think what I was 
saying is that if you looked at the 

788
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:58,374
three books,
and I think by most accounts that the 

789
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,970
old testament's probably the most 
violent of them,

790
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,300
but no one would really acting on the 
violence of that.

791
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,510
So that doesn't discount that it says 
some horrible stuff,

792
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,930
but if nobody's acting on it then it's 
sort of irrelevant.

793
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,420
So I hope,
I hope that's not how postmodern,

794
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,373
because I know,
I know that exact quote from him and it 

795
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:18,264
sounds like pure,
so we could get into the theological 

796
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:21,120
discussion.
I mean,

797
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,931
one of the,
for example,

798
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,764
if in the Old Testament says killed the 
alumni alumna kites a while they don't 

799
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:28,314
exist anymore.
So even if I was desperate to act on 

800
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,760
that,
Edx I wouldn't be able to.

801
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,200
On the other hand,
if a,

802
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,063
another religious book has a,
the following tenant killed the 

803
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:41,970
nonbelievers wherever you find them.
That is actionable today.

804
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,230
Uh,
so,

805
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,580
so no,
the argument that.

806
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,140
Well,
it depends who acts on it.

807
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:46,974
That's not true.
There's very plus we don't have many 

808
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:51,790
people today that act on Deuteronomy.
Well that,

809
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,480
that was my point,
that it depends on who's acting on it,

810
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:57,380
but that doesn't change the specifics.
Exactly.

811
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,770
That are,
that are in the tech.

812
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,280
Fair enough.
Do you find that as an academic and as a

813
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,143
social scientist and all that,
that it's exhausting talking about 

814
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:09,120
religion because you don't believe in it
so that,

815
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,043
you know what I mean?
Like you're trying to add something 

816
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:12,660
rational.
This is what I feel.

817
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,643
I'm constantly trying to rationalize 
things that cannot be rationalized 

818
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:21,030
anymore.
It actually also in your discussion with

819
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:21,864
Bill Warner,
he said one of the interesting things 

820
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,640
about the current is you can almost 
rationalize anything because you can say

821
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,860
something's really great.
Yeah.

822
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,520
So can you explain to a little bit?
Yeah.

823
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,510
So the idea is so people don't know 
that,

824
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,843
uh,
the Koran has what's called abrogated 

825
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:37,460
versus so,
uh,

826
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,290
God might have decided through the 
revelations to say,

827
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,330
uh,
there's no compulsion in religion.

828
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,900
And then later God is allowed to change 
his mind and say,

829
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,010
killed,
you know,

830
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,720
don't be so tolerant.

831
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,170
Right?
Right.

832
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,003
Well,
how could it be that a and not a can 

833
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:52,410
coexist?
Well,

834
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,273
through dual logic that can be allowed 
in the way you do that as through 

835
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,810
abrogation,
which basically means that when you have

836
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,673
two techs that contradict one another,
the later texts texts supersedes the 

837
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:04,464
previous one.
So when people typically quote the 

838
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:09,270
gentle passages from the Koran,
that's the Meccan period,

839
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,790
those passages have actually been 
abrogated.

840
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,660
They've been made null and void.
So now in some cases,

841
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:16,494
the people who who,
who quote those passages know this and 

842
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:20,784
they are actually being duplicitous and 
other cases they're unaware of this 

843
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:24,570
aggregation mechanism.
All right,

844
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:27,390
so let's just talk about Reza for a 
minute since you brought him up.

845
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,513
And he and he,
because he's become such a player in 

846
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:33,510
this space and CNNS even giving him a 
show all about belief,

847
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,070
which sounds just horrific.

848
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,140
Um,
when he plays those games,

849
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,310
you know,
right.

850
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:40,144
You know that he knows this,
he knows about what you just described 

851
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,450
and yet he's doing this.
So what do we do with these players?

852
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,430
You know,
what do we do with?

853
00:38:47,431 --> 00:38:49,630
It's a great question because I don't 
know.

854
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,870
What has endgame is.
I mean,

855
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:51,704
as it is,
it that he's engaging in self deception 

856
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,650
as we know humans are very adept at 
doing.

857
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,663
There's actually some very interesting 
evolutionary arguments for why people 

858
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:01,270
engage in self deception.
You want me to take off?

859
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,463
Let's go there.
Okay.

860
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,363
So,
so the argument for the evolution of 

861
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,690
self deception is that when you and I 
are chatting a,

862
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,280
we're engaging,
if you like an Imac,

863
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:12,610
a valiant battle,
I'd like to get you to do what I want,

864
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,650
but I don't want you to know that I'm 
doing this right.

865
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,640
So when I'm lying to you,
they are typically markers and made that

866
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,850
you're trying to pick up to see if I'm 
being duplicitous or not.

867
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,073
The way that I shut off those markers as
by first convincing myself that I'm not 

868
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:27,970
lying.
In other words,

869
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:33,180
by engaging in self deception,
I shut off the mechanisms that you might

870
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:35,950
otherwise read in me that I'm lying.
Interesting.

871
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:36,784
So,
but is that a fully conscious decision 

872
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:39,064
on the part of the person that's doing 
it as an evolutionary mechanism that's 

873
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,440
been built into us now?
So,

874
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,220
uh,
you know,

875
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,053
signed on Seinfeld,
there's a classic episode where George 

876
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,020
Costanza says to Jerry,
I might get the quote wrong.

877
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,090
Remember Jerry,
it's not alive if you believe it.

878
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,040
Yeah.
Uh,

879
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,970
actually talked about this in one of my 
earlier books.

880
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,290
Uh,
well that's,

881
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,190
that's the idea.
So,

882
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,073
so I don't know,
in [inaudible] case whether he truly 

883
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:04,330
believes the,
the just the endless tsunami of nonsense

884
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:08,710
that he produces or whether it's just a 
duplicitous attempt.

885
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,130
He,
you know,

886
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,290
this is the way by which I've become 
very famous.

887
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,124
This is the way by which I get a lot of 
attention because I'm sort of the Brown 

888
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:17,770
guy from Iran who could appear moderate 
and so on,

889
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,790
and I'm going to stick to that niche 
because it's got me a lot of fame.

890
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:25,150
So I can't tell which of these two 
possibilities he's under.

891
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,013
You know,
it's so interesting because when I hear 

892
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:27,604
you say that,
it clearly comes from a place where 

893
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,970
you're trying to give him the benefit of
the doubt,

894
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,610
right?
You just went out of your way to not say

895
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:35,770
this guy is a duplicitous liar or 
whatever.

896
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,890
And you know,
Sam Harris says how intentions matter.

897
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,420
Right?
And you're trying to say,

898
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:45,421
well maybe his intentions are good.
So that would be a reason to fiddle with

899
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:49,870
some of this stuff.
I sent that all the people that,

900
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,003
that we argue with all the time,
they would not give us any of those 

901
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,233
passes and that to me shows you where 
this battle really is happening right 

902
00:40:59,720 --> 00:40:59,900
there.

903
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,690
There's,
there's kind of a,

904
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,220
an immediate reflex to label anybody 
who's in our space,

905
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,590
you know,
a Nazi and Hitler and Himmler,

906
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,700
right?
That's right.

907
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,690
Yeah,
I agree.

908
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,950
Uh,
I mean I've been fortunate.

909
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,540
Again,
knock on wood,

910
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,940
I haven't had too much of this stuff.
Maybe because I am quite measured in how

911
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:21,430
I speak and maybe because I come from 
that background,

912
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,420
it gives me a layer of protection which 
maybe Sam can't have.

913
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,300
I'm not exactly sure,
but I've been fortunate in that sense.

914
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,750
Right.
So to what my question that started this

915
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:32,584
whole thing,
using scientific method to discuss 

916
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,670
texts,
not this text.

917
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,803
What religious texts that aren't 
necessarily based in rationality or in 

918
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:44,540
secular values,
do you find it exhausting?

919
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,530
I mean,
having,

920
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,520
right?
Like are,

921
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:47,354
do you find yourself spending a lot of 
time deciphering things that we 

922
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,610
shouldn't be worried about anymore?

923
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,850
We don't worry about what scientists 
thought 3000 years ago.

924
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:58,490
So why are we worried about what 
religious people thought?

925
00:41:58,491 --> 00:41:59,960
$3,000.
It's extraordinary,

926
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:00,980
right?
Because if,

927
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,120
if you take a belief that someone holds 
and you don't cloak it under the robe of

928
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:10,770
religion,
then this would be tantamount to the guy

929
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:13,550
being schizophrenia and let's commit 
them to a mental hospital.

930
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,413
Right?
But we can give a good example of that 

931
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,720
because I think that's a really great 
point.

932
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,920
Uh,
okay.

933
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:19,754
So,
uh,

934
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,750
this profit has gone on a winged horse 
somewhere.

935
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,910
Yeah.
If I say that,

936
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:26,270
hey,
you know,

937
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,200
I believe that,
uh,

938
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,030
Dave Ruben,
yesterday,

939
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:32,870
I saw him on a winged horse going to 
happen,

940
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,290
then we're good mushrooms.
Then I would call a,

941
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,580
my clinical psychologists or 
psychiatrists,

942
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:41,720
friends and say,
hey,

943
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,030
let's try to commit Dave Rubin to a 
psychiatric hospital.

944
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,880
On the other hand,
if I say the exact same thing,

945
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,820
but it is cloaked under a religious 
narrative,

946
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,280
don't you dare criticize that narrative,
right?

947
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,203
So the exact same statement is either a 
form of lunacy or perfectly acceptable 

948
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,610
religion depending on whether it is 
protected by religion.

949
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,110
And that's grotesque,
right?

950
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:06,320
I mean,
why is your belief in whatever narrative

951
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:09,680
you choose to believe somehow sacrosanct
and I can't touch it.

952
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,673
Yeah,
so when it comes to religion and 

953
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,374
obviously we've spent a lot of time 
talking about this and I've had mostly 

954
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,434
people that are anti religion,
but just last week I had an ultra 

955
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,290
orthodox,
ultra Orthodox,

956
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:19,870
but Orthodox Jew,
Ben,

957
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,713
she mentioned thought made some pretty 
cogent arguments separating religion 

958
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:27,020
from politics even though I didn't agree
with him on a lot of it,

959
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,060
but I thought he did an interesting,
you know,

960
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:32,030
he wasn't trying to govern.
I sense from a place of religion,

961
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:32,864
which I could at least respect that,
but what do you make of the general 

962
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:37,210
feeling that,
you know,

963
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,053
you watch the superbowl in the second 
last superbowl and they thank God these 

964
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:41,984
are people who spend their entire lives 
training to become machines of 

965
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:52,550
athleticism and the team that lost also 
but also pray to the same guy,

966
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,060
but somehow God really was for the 
cardinals.

967
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,300
So he hates the trailblazers.
I'm mixing sports.

968
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,850
You make sport that I really got it.
I really do not support support of that,

969
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:05,340
but I'm,
I'm,

970
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,540
I'm trying to think of A.
Yeah,

971
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,150
so,
but,

972
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,050
but to me that what that shows is not a 
belief in God per se,

973
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:15,530
as much as it shows almost a 
narcissistic disorder,

974
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:16,603
the Lord of the universe.
And I mean if only people would have a 

975
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:24,131
sense of the vastness of the universe,
uniquely cares about a point guard who's

976
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,760
about to make a three point closing shot
and if he makes it.

977
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,160
Oh Lord Jesus.
Thank you Jesus.

978
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,700
Really be invested in your,
uh,

979
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,880
career stats.
Yeah.

980
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,620
And by the way,
we can also take examples.

981
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,940
It would be like,
you know,

982
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:39,983
if you jerked off or something and then 
felt guilty after because God was 

983
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,260
watching you.
It's like he's watching you do that.

984
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,440
He's watching basketball.
Better things to do.

985
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,363
I mean really if without even more like,
I know there's a certain mocking tone 

986
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:54,720
here,
but without even mocking it,

987
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:56,280
if you,
if you really believed in this,

988
00:44:56,281 --> 00:45:00,240
wouldn't you believe that God would be 
doing something else?

989
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,580
Creating another universe.
You know what I mean?

990
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:04,770
Really.
Otherwise it seems so silly.

991
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,520
He's quite pedantic,
but I'll give you.

992
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,930
I did A.
Actually,

993
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,410
it's in this book where I,
I,

994
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,400
I,
I played this following a mental game.

995
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:19,020
Suppose you had a Martian who came to 
earth and he's shopping for the one true

996
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,810
religion,
and so he asks a bunch of questions.

997
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,740
Am I allowed to wear leather shoes?
Can I have a tattoo?

998
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,380
Am I allowed to be to have homosexual 
relations?

999
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:29,214
I mean,
you think from the most mundane to the 

1000
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:31,464
most a metaphysical questions.
I demonstrated that for every possible 

1001
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:36,354
question that you can generate,
I could identify two religions that 

1002
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,560
prescribe the exact opposite thing to 
that same question.

1003
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,783
I mean,
if that doesn't serve as a devastating 

1004
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:48,830
blow to the whole scam of religion,
nothing was.

1005
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:49,664
Right,
right?

1006
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,780
Let's put it another way.
There are 10,000

1007
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,130
documented religions in the world.
You,

1008
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,480
I bet you 10,000
now here.

1009
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,323
What I mean is different than 
nominations of Christianity with 

1010
00:45:58,711 --> 00:45:59,790
countless different religions,
right?

1011
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,560
Right.
So there are 10,000

1012
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:02,394
of them.
The only thing that they typically have 

1013
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,810
in common is that each of them says that
I'm the true religion.

1014
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,930
The other 9,999
are false.

1015
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,330
Credible.
That sounds a bit fishy to me.

1016
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,143
Right.
And also that they are all designed 

1017
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:17,370
differently.
I find that when I'm,

1018
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,040
when we're debating a lot of this stuff,
um,

1019
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:20,903
you know,
especially with we've gotten almost 40 

1020
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:22,824
minutes and haven't said regressive,
so I'm finally going to say the word 

1021
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,523
progressive and regressive left,
that they always want everything to be 

1022
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:31,920
equally as bad except some religions 
want people to convert into them.

1023
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,910
Some don't,
right?

1024
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,210
That would show that,
not that it's necessarily better,

1025
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,390
but it would show that certain people 
don't want to spread their ideas as much

1026
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:42,020
as other people,
but there is a need on the left to go.

1027
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,460
Everything's bad.
And once you do that,

1028
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:45,780
you're actually saying nothing.
Right.

1029
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,360
I've actually used that same argument,
but in the end,

1030
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,390
under the context of an academic 
setting.

1031
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,940
So there's,
there's a concept known as a meme.

1032
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,820
Are you familiar with that?
Of course.

1033
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,640
So this is from Richard Dawkins,
right?

1034
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:57,474
Well,
Richard Dawkins argues that religion is 

1035
00:46:58,981 --> 00:46:59,814
a Mima plex.
That's a collection of memes and memes 

1036
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,543
spread very much.
Like how viruses spread or how genes 

1037
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:08,520
propagate and populations well,
or or how meme spread on twitter.

1038
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:09,740
Right?
Exactly.

1039
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,360
So to go to your point about religions,
some religions that the content of their

1040
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:19,740
memes are inherently infectious.
In other words,

1041
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,980
the transmissibility of that religion is
much greater.

1042
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,813
So in Judaism,
the fact that you you don't proselytize 

1043
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,800
is precisely the reason why they are 13,
14,

1044
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:30,490
15 million Jews depending on how you 
count,

1045
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,890
right?
And the whole entire universe world,

1046
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:33,843
they are $50,
million Jews on the other hand and a 

1047
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:36,074
religion where you're allowed to 
proselytize and there are other things 

1048
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:40,540
that you can do all.
So for example,

1049
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,280
it takes very little to get into the 
religion.

1050
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,990
In Islam,
for example,

1051
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:44,824
right in Judaism,
if you truly wish to convert according 

1052
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:47,524
to the strict tenants,
you can't just sort of say one sentence 

1053
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:54,270
and we'll welcome to the right of the 
Jewish clan,

1054
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,113
right?
You actually have to go through a very 

1055
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,124
costly process.
So there are all sorts of mechanisms 

1056
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,004
that you could study in the context of,
of a religion that demonstrate why one 

1057
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,090
spreads and another one doesn't.
Right.

1058
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,933
And by the way,
using the example that you just 

1059
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:08,764
mentioned,
it's also a lot to get out of Judaism 

1060
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:12,310
because they not a Jew anymore,
nobody cares.

1061
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,220
But if you were to get out of Islam,
we know this with the PA states all over

1062
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:17,090
the world,
you might get killed on,

1063
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,310
but to kill means to correct.
So you're just sounded right.

1064
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,720
So,
okay,

1065
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,010
we take all of this.
We,

1066
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,860
we get it.
You think that this mode of thinking is,

1067
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,550
is not great for the world and,
and all of that.

1068
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,420
You want to use things from a scientific
place.

1069
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,930
So when I had Peter Goes,
you know,

1070
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:35,680
and he wrote a book called a manual for 
creating atheists.

1071
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:36,514
Yes.
And I read it and I thought it was 

1072
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,970
really great book and I've,
I've tried to use some of those,

1073
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:40,963
uh,
practices when I've talked to people 

1074
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:42,904
about this stuff and I asked him,
does he think that like what's the 

1075
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,680
difference?
At the end of the day,

1076
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,723
if someone holds some of these beliefs 
but isn't doing anything nefarious and 

1077
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:55,720
isn't pushing these ideas on anyone,
do you still think it's bad?

1078
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,480
And he basically said yes,
because he,

1079
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,020
he said,
uh,

1080
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,033
I'm not quoting him exactly,
but that you're diluting yourself and 

1081
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,450
that's not really what the point of 
being human is.

1082
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,200
What would you say in that case if 
someone just picked some beliefs?

1083
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,080
It's nominal.
Nobody cares,

1084
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:11,914
you know,
and you're not oppressing someone or 

1085
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,320
making women dress a certain way.
Right?

1086
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,213
So,
I don't know,

1087
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,500
it depends if I want to be pragmatic or 
a purist,

1088
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:18,603
if I want to be pragmatic,
I say you don't believe whatever you 

1089
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:20,884
want as long as you don't impose your 
beliefs on third parties that I don't 

1090
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:24,730
care.
So that's the pragmatic part.

1091
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,250
If I were to be a purist,
right?

1092
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,333
Uh,
the pursuit of truth matters than I 

1093
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:31,714
would agree then with Peter that to 
believe in these types of fairytales is 

1094
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,890
actually injurious to the human spirit.
Right?

1095
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:43,891
So that in and of itself,
even if it's not propagating violence or

1096
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:44,884
something on someone else,
that it's against the sort of human 

1097
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:48,070
nature or something like that.

1098
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:48,940
And if anything,
I mean,

1099
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:49,774
and,
and many atheists have talked about 

1100
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:52,084
this,
a,

1101
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:57,270
there is a wonder that you can access 
without needing religion.

1102
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,070
What religion does in a sense is it is,
it,

1103
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,570
is,
it covers the capacity.

1104
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:02,404
I mean,
I can go and see a beautiful landscape 

1105
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,373
and be transcendent,
transcendent by the experience without 

1106
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,970
needing Booga Booga to,
to,

1107
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,920
for me to actually experience that.
Right?

1108
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,873
So it actually cheapens life to always 
have to contextualize it within the 

1109
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,740
context of a big data in the sky.
That's interesting.

1110
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,580
I think I've told this story on the show
once before,

1111
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,414
but I want ate pot brownies and I was 
going to see air force one with friends 

1112
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,570
and it was sold out.
So we moved,

1113
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,970
we went and saw contact.
Did you see contact?

1114
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,760
This is what the costs are.
And it was written.

1115
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,040
It was Carl Sagan is only fiction book.

1116
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,340
Uh,
and um,

1117
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,350
I didn't know what the movie was at all.
I had no idea what we were walking into.

1118
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,323
I don't know if you remember,
but the opening scene was this 

1119
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:47,140
incredible panorama of the universe.
And I ate these pop around,

1120
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:47,974
he's,
I was basically like tripping out of my 

1121
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,820
mind and the whole movie just blew my 
mind apart.

1122
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,880
I was like,
this is amazing.

1123
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:53,714
I ended up reading a whole bunch of 
Charles Dickens books and all that and 

1124
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:58,010
it sort of led me to a lot of the things
that I think now,

1125
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:01,400
but the movie ends,
she has this sort of a,

1126
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,653
not that satisfying experience because 
she can't prove that what happened to 

1127
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:10,040
her actually happened and the movie ends
with her just looking out on a sunset.

1128
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,820
And that's exactly what you're saying,
that there are ways to,

1129
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,493
I suppose,
feel connected and feel a part of this 

1130
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,860
thing that don't necessarily standing up
and sitting a lot at a.

1131
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,680
actually that was one of the starting 
points that got me away from religion.

1132
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:32,420
We were sitting at a synagogue,
a again Avraham in Beirut.

1133
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:33,670
Okay.
Uh,

1134
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,960
and I asked my father,
you know,

1135
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,240
I'm confused.
When do we stand up when we sit down?

1136
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,650
And he's like,
you don't shut up.

1137
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:40,484
Just the fact that he said that really 
upsets me because already as I don't 

1138
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,860
remember how old I was,
maybe five,

1139
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:46,694
six,
seven,

1140
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,000
uh,
that left a hole in me.

1141
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:49,760
Well,
what'd you mean?

1142
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,790
Why am I standing up and sitting down?
They give me an explanation.

1143
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:53,923
So the fact that there was sort of this,
this dogmatism a is probably the 

1144
00:51:57,651 --> 00:52:01,310
starting point of what led me astray 
from religion,

1145
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,413
but to come back to atheism,
I've written an article in psychology 

1146
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:07,810
today blog where I talked about carpet 
den,

1147
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,780
right?
Seizing the day.

1148
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,880
And that atheism is really consistent 
with that ethos,

1149
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,050
right of living in the moment,
right?

1150
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,260
There are no do overs,
there is no eternal life.

1151
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,720
It's now is the relationship that I 
formed.

1152
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,330
Now it's the,
it's the knowledge that I helped spread.

1153
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:26,840
Now it's the goodness that I can impart 
to the world.

1154
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,823
And so that actually makes it a much 
more a wonderful experience to realize 

1155
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:34,490
that you have a very short,
limited time.

1156
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,020
Now,
of course it's very scary,

1157
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:36,620
right?
I mean,

1158
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,453
you and I want this party to go on 
forever and that's why I think actually 

1159
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:44,780
that religion will never a sister exist.
We'll never eradicate it because we will

1160
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:48,410
never resolve the problem of our 
existential angst.

1161
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,373
Right?
So when you say the word eradicate 

1162
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:52,060
there,
I know that the,

1163
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,800
the,
the,

1164
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,480
the progressives who have launched this 
huge assault on new atheist,

1165
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,200
they sort of came up with this term new 
atheist and I guess originally it had to

1166
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:04,150
do with a hitchins and Sam and Daniel 
Dennett I think,

1167
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,120
and who is the fourth?

1168
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,770
I think there was a fourth in there,
Sam Harris,

1169
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,380
Richard Dawkins talking,
sorry,

1170
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,130
but the idea that these people,
these new atheists,

1171
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,460
they're not just atheist to believe 
whatever the hell they want to believe.

1172
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,533
They want to destroy religion and I 
think they spread this meme as a way of 

1173
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,830
silencing people who would critique 
that.

1174
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,260
That to me is all they've done here 
because I have now I know many,

1175
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:29,094
many atheists.
I know no atheist that is trying to use 

1176
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:36,651
violence or intimidation in any way to 
stop anyone from believing anything.

1177
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,790
Sure.
They may critique you,

1178
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,280
they may ridicule you,
should they be quiet,

1179
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,830
but why should they be quiet now?
Shove your religion.

1180
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:44,611
I mean,
all day long.

1181
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,760
I should,
I should be quiet.

1182
00:53:45,761 --> 00:53:46,830
And my non belief why,
I mean,

1183
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,080
I'm not suggesting that you should ever 
be and polite.

1184
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:51,420
I mean you can be nice and you can be 
polite about it,

1185
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,920
but I have to be quiet.

1186
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,590
I was quiet when I was living as a Jew 
in Lebanon.

1187
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:57,360
I didn't want to be quiet anymore.
So that's.

1188
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,500
So,
that's really interesting.

1189
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,210
So that the,
all it is,

1190
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:01,044
when they say new atheist,
all they mean really is an atheist who 

1191
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:04,710
speaking up.
And that's what,

1192
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:06,960
that's what they hate more than any of 
you seen some of my,

1193
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,780
a satirical traits of our new atheism.
I'm sure I've said,

1194
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,510
uh,
I,

1195
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,990
I used to weigh 200 pounds,
then I put on 10 pounds.

1196
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,010
I'm now a new atheist.
I used to have this skin tone.

1197
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,873
Then I went on vacation.
I became the new atheists is a term 

1198
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:25,090
that's complete nonsense.
Yeah.

1199
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,610
Um,
alright.

1200
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,290
So we're going to do a little more of 
the,

1201
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:29,124
uh,
the regressive stuff when we sit down 

1202
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,953
with Lalo and a little bit,
but I'm just curious for you personally 

1203
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,110
as you've been part of this discussion.

1204
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:37,943
And again,
we just sat down for the first time in 

1205
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:41,280
August,
so we only met about eight months ago.

1206
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,980
I probably only knew of you on twitter 
for maybe three,

1207
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,710
four months before that.
As you've become part of this.

1208
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,553
I'm curious how much of it,
how much of it consumes you actually 

1209
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,343
like that?
Because I know how personal this is to 

1210
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:54,384
me.
I know that I have trouble shutting it 

1211
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:57,870
off sometimes at night and I don't mean 
just my phone,

1212
00:54:57,871 --> 00:54:59,930
I mean just the thought process and 
feeling that,

1213
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,650
that there is something big going on 
here that were part of a.

1214
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,390
How big does it feel to you?
It's a very big.

1215
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,253
And often,
I mean I would say that the last six 

1216
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:13,731
months I've spent maybe 50 percent of my
time working on these types of issues as

1217
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,450
opposed to say Mike sort of classic 
scientific career.

1218
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,820
Precisely because I,
if you like,

1219
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:25,440
I defined my role more broadly than just
as somebody who's a professor,

1220
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:26,160
right?
I mean,

1221
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,470
I can engage the public in the battle of
ideas and,

1222
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,393
and frankly I'm quite disappointed in 
many of my colleagues who don't think 

1223
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:34,591
that way,
right?

1224
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:35,424
I mean,
nobody is contesting the fact that it's 

1225
00:55:36,421 --> 00:55:38,790
really important to do your great basic 
science.

1226
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:39,840
I mean,
that's what you are,

1227
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:41,010
you're a professor,
you're a scientist,

1228
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:44,220
but if you've got the capacity to 
reason,

1229
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,353
then it is,
it is important for you to also 

1230
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:51,000
participate in battles of ideas that are
outside your very limited,

1231
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,680
uh,
lab studies.

1232
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:54,450
Right?
And so in that sense,

1233
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,493
I actually have been quite consumed by 
some of the issues you're saying now 

1234
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,373
where I sometimes regrets my 
participation is when I don't know when 

1235
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:07,380
to stop aging some ass who's constantly 
hounding me.

1236
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,070
Now in many cases I'm able to disengage,
but in a few times they kind of,

1237
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:12,563
they trigger you in some way and then 
you engage this person and you realize 

1238
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:15,984
you just wasted an hour and a half 
speaking to somebody who was in his 

1239
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:19,450
underwear and his mom's basement.
Okay.

1240
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,041
Yeah.
All right,

1241
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,040
well I'm going to dive more into that 
with you and allow a little bit.

1242
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:23,921
Um,
all right,

1243
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:24,754
so look,
we could talk forever and this is my 

1244
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:27,820
second interview in a row where I 
haven't even picked up my,

1245
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,740
my notes once.
Um,

1246
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,410
but because I started by talking about 
college and that's what you just brought

1247
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:33,670
this to you.
Um,

1248
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,613
what,
what's the hope Gimme Gimme the point 

1249
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,323
for some of this turning now I guess we 
can talk about this stuff and we see it 

1250
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:43,660
that there is this now movement growing 
of people that aren't afraid of speaking

1251
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,494
and all that stuff.

1252
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:49,690
How do you as a professor,
a fuel that you can win this and did you

1253
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:50,710
feel it right?
It's,

1254
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:55,770
it's precisely and empowering every 
single individual to engage the debate.

1255
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,323
Right?
I receive endless private messages from 

1256
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:03,010
people whom I've never met them.
I'll never see again.

1257
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,083
So you don't just because I watch how 
you behave and how much you've got to 

1258
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:09,730
lose professionally and if not also 
personally,

1259
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:12,370
I mean in terms of threats and so on.
Uh,

1260
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,353
this has gotten me the courage to speak 
out against some of my regressive 

1261
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:17,884
friends on facebook and I just spent 
three hours taken on these guys and I 

1262
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:23,020
wouldn't have done it had I not seen 
your courage.

1263
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,200
So basically all you're trying to do is 
to empower people to feel as though they

1264
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,730
can make a difference.
And by having enough of that,

1265
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:33,460
because think about it,
the regressive left is quite,

1266
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,473
uh,
an invested in this fight and all you 

1267
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:40,570
need to do is stand up and offer a 
counterpoint and get enough people to do

1268
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:41,280
it.

1269
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,210
Truth is on our side,
we will win.

1270
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,133
Yeah.
So that's what enrages them more than 

1271
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:47,050
anything else to wrap this up.
That's what enrages them,

1272
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:49,660
is that they've been sort of unchecked 
example all the time.

1273
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:50,300
Right?
Like,

1274
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,133
because they were.
Because the right in a lot of respects 

1275
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:57,400
has gone off the deep end so that there 
was no rational argument to be had.

1276
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,860
Now here come us and it's like,
oh,

1277
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,300
we're going to have some rational 
arguments,

1278
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,350
but they have been doing the whole cries
of racism,

1279
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,630
not a monopoly.
Yeah.

1280
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,730
And there's a new company that's 
offering another product.

1281
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,310
They're not happy.
Yeah.

1282
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,910
What we're going to beat and with better
ideas.

1283
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:13,900
What do you say?
We will.

1284
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,740
Let's do it.
Alright.

1285
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,900
Well it was a pleasure talking to you of
course.

1286
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,970
And for more of guides that you can 
follow them on twitter at Dad's.

1287
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:20,804
That uh,
his youtube channel is in the 

1288
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:26,110
description below and there's something 
big coming.

1289
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,390
We were going to be working together 
pretty soon.

1290
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:30,430
We're going to discuss that with Lalo.
Thanks for watching.

1291
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,420
And we'll do it again next week.
