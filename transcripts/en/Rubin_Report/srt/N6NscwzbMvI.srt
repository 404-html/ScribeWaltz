1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,710
Joining me today is the first investor 
in bitcoin.com,

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,553
blockchain.com,
and several other crypto currency 

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:16,010
websites who is also a libertarian and 
individualistic and a peace advocate.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,870
Roger Veer.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,650
Thanks for having me on.
I was going to save over,

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,410
but then I did a little research and 
it's actually veer.

7
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:29,350
Even though most people say this would 
lead one to getting into cryptocurrency,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,273
wouldn't it?
That's the exact reason that it's very 

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,114
easy to see that.
That's why I would get into 

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,910
cryptocurrencies A.
Alright.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm looking forward to doing this 
conversation because a,

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,510
as I mentioned to you briefly before we 
started for about two years or so,

13
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:45,140
I've sort of been kind of looking into 
this world.

14
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:45,974
A lot of my audience,
the libertarian side of my audience of 

15
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:50,750
course,
is very much into bitcoin,

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,990
so I think probably for the first half 
of this we have to just do,

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,580
do one on one stuff.

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,920
Are you ready to have your,
your thinking cap on?

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,850
You Bet.
All right,

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,640
so for someone that's watching this 
bitcoin,

21
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,474
they have no idea what that means.
They think it has some connotation to 

22
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:06,500
Super Mario,
you know,

23
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,020
punching the question mark and getting 
coins out of this thing,

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,020
which makes some sense,
I guess at some level.

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,453
What the Hell is bitcoin?
Bitcoin is thanks to the invention of 

26
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:20,770
Bitcoin for the very first time in the 
entire history of the world.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,000
Any human being can now send and receive
any amount of money with any other human

28
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,060
being anywhere on the planet,
instantly,

29
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,223
basically for free.
You don't have to get permission from a 

30
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,014
bank.
You don't have to get permission from 

31
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:33,674
the corporation.
You don't have to get permission from 

32
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,674
the government.
Not only do you not have to get their 

33
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:37,834
permission,
it's impossible for any of those 

34
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:43,700
entities to stop it,
so you can now send money from,

35
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:48,310
from here in la to to Moscow instantly 
just like that for less than a penny.

36
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,043
And there's nothing that the Russian 
government can do that there's nothing 

37
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:52,504
that the Chinese government can do.
There's nothing that the American 

38
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,604
government can do.
So if you think that it's a good thing 

39
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,604
that people have control of their own 
money and they're not susceptible to 

40
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,190
things like we had happened in Cyprus a 
few years back where the government just

41
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,030
came in and said,
okay,

42
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,070
we're going to take.
I think it was a third of it.

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,810
Everybody's money in their bank 
accounts.

44
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:08,644
If you think things like that are bad,
you should love bitcoin and even if you 

45
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,604
haven't used bitcoin yet,
it might sound complicated and 

46
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,390
difficult.
But think of it like email.

47
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,800
If I sat here trying to explain to you 
how email works,

48
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,653
it would sound really hard and confusing
and how could anybody figure out how to 

49
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,520
do this sort of thing.
But once you've used email,

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,990
it's not hard.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,853
It's easy.
You just type in the person's email 

52
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,790
address and you send them a message 
bitcoin's the same way.

53
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,190
You just paste,
copy and paste their bitcoin address and

54
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:35,000
you send them some money.
And uh,

55
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,890
so the best advice I can give to anybody
that's new to bit coin,

56
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,070
don't be afraid of it.
Go on the Internet and uh,

57
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,250
get a bitcoin wallet and give it a try.
It's really,

58
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,110
really easy to use once you've actually 
used it.

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,033
Yeah.
I mentioned to you that we take 

60
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:47,650
donations,
uh,

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
at Rubin report.com/donate
a and we take bitcoin donations.

62
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:53,320
We didn't do it for a while and we had 
all these people saying,

63
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,690
why aren't you doing it?
You're missing a great opportunity here.

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,660
So we did it and we have about,
I think around two and a half bitcoin.

65
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,540
Right.
And I've seen it Kinda,

66
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,593
you know,
go up and you can't really watch it 

67
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,940
everyday,
at least from where I sit.

68
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,580
You can't watch it everyday because you,
you'd start going crazy.

69
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,100
It's just like watching stocks everyday.
Um,

70
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,430
but what is it?
What actually is.

71
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,264
And so I get the ease of transfer and I 
want to talk to you about why some 

72
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,210
governments kind of embraced it more in 
some really are against it and,

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,230
and all of that stuff.
But like people,

74
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,090
that's what people want to like what,
like gold.

75
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:23,260
We know what gold is.
It's a thing.

76
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,320
You can put it in your hand,
what actually is Bitcoin,

77
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,790
so with traditional monies that people 
are used to using like the dollar or the

78
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,624
euro or or or traditional payment 
networks like paypal or visa or 

79
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,630
mastercard.
All of these things have one ledger that

80
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,040
keeps track of,
for example,

81
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,874
Paypal,
they have a ledger at the pay pal world 

82
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,880
headquarters and maybe a couple of 
backups.

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,013
They keep track of how many dollars you 
have in your account and how many 

84
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,654
dollars I have in my account and when I 
transfer some pay pal dollars from my 

85
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,950
account to your account,
they update their ledger,

86
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,073
but because they're the ones that are in
charge of that ledger and Keeping Track 

87
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,254
of that ledger at any point,
they can reverse the transaction I made 

88
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,504
to you.
They can take all the money out of your 

89
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,564
account.
They can take all the money out my 

90
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,940
account.
The irs can go to them and say,

91
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,680
take the money out of both of our 
accounts.

92
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,710
Anything can happen at any time.
That's beyond our control.

93
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,544
Even though we like to think of the 
money that's in our pay pal account as 

94
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:12,724
our money,
but in reality we have to trust paypal 

95
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,260
to hold it because paypal has that one 
ledger,

96
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,030
they're at the mercy of their higher 
ups,

97
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:21,860
which are the government people with 
bitcoin.

98
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,570
Instead of there being one ledger that 
keeps track of who has how many bitcoins

99
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,360
and what account.
There's a copy of this ledger,

100
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,194
but it's on everybody's computer around 
the world that's running a copy of the 

101
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,020
bitcoin full nodes software and so 
instead of there being,

102
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,400
you know,
one or two or three copies,

103
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,234
there's more than 100,000
copies of this ledger around the world 

104
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,103
and those 100,000
copies of the ledger all stay in sync 

105
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,224
with one another.
And those ledgers are in every country 

106
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,644
around the world.
So let's say I send some money to you 

107
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,050
via bitcoin for something that a 
government doesn't like.

108
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,750
There's no bitcoin company that they can
call.

109
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,540
There's no bitcoin server.
They can unplug.

110
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,700
All they could do is arrest the two of 
us,

111
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,980
but that doesn't stop the bitcoin 
network as a whole.

112
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:03,814
It keeps right on going.
So the real powerful invention of 

113
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:09,160
Bitcoin is this ledger that's not on any
one computer.

114
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,800
The ledger is distributed across the 
entire planet,

115
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,410
so there's no single place that anybody 
could go to,

116
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:17,320
to stop or modify it or unplug it or 
turn it off.

117
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,154
And so for me,
that's what's so exciting about bitcoin 

118
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,853
is the only way to stop it would be to 
turn off the entire Internet in the 

119
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:26,860
entire world and keep it turned off.
And in 2017,

120
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,660
I don't think that's a very likely 
proposition.

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,593
And I suspect there is some bad guys.
There's got to be an evil guy somewhere 

122
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,360
twirling his mustache going,
we can shut off the entire Internet,

123
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,290
right?
Uh,

124
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,921
maybe,
but,

125
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,790
uh,
hopefully not.

126
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,624
Then hopefully we can build even more 
technologies to prevent bad people from 

127
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,110
turning off the,
the whole world's Internet.

128
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:43,120
And we saw what happened when they tried
in a,

129
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,210
in Turkey,
uh,

130
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,183
previously they turned off the Internet.
We just within the country and people 

131
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,004
were instantly rioting in the streets 
and it led to an entire revolution in 

132
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:51,100
that country.

133
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,933
And uh,
I suspect that would happen in a lot of 

134
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,824
countries around the world that they 
tried to turn off the internet 

135
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,110
completely.
Okay.

136
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,940
So I'm with you understand that 
basically the ledger,

137
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,140
the information,
the true information of who has what and

138
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:06,980
when they have it and all of that.
I understand that when people say we're,

139
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,640
we're mining for Bitcoin,
what does that actually mean?

140
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,923
So this ledgers,
that's all across the entire world gets 

141
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:16,520
updated once on average every 10 
minutes.

142
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,720
But it's who gets to decide who gets to 
make that update.

143
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,780
So the way that problem was solved,
there's all these people are doing these

144
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:28,490
really complicated math problems and the
only way to find the answer to this math

145
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,403
problem is just to guess.
And you have to guess over and over and 

146
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,014
over again.
So these bitcoin mining machines are 

147
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,850
guessing millions of times a second or 
even more than that.

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,460
And when they find whichever machine and
there's,

149
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,870
you know,
millions of these around the world,

150
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:42,704
whichever machine finds the right answer
to this math problem is then the one 

151
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,184
that's designated to be able to make the
next update to this worldwide bitcoin 

152
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,083
ledgers than all these different nodes 
around the world make their update and 

153
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,960
boom,
the transactions that the,

154
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,073
the networks that the next state and 
then all the computer start trying to 

155
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,694
guess again.
But the benefit of finding the right 

156
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,950
answer to this solution is at the moment
you get 12 and a half bitcoins.

157
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:04,784
If your computer is the one that finds 
the right solution and 12 and a half 

158
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,380
bitcoins at the moment is worthwhile.
Like 80,

159
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,820
$80,000
or so.

160
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,983
Oh,
I should mention by the way that we're 

161
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:16,250
taping this probably about two weeks 
before it's going to air.

162
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,190
So anything we say related to the 
specific numbers,

163
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,320
I don't want people to take out of 
context.

164
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,333
They got beer,
doesn't know what he's talking about 

165
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,470
because it was too bright for,
you know.

166
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,130
Okay.
And,

167
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,900
and almost certainly by the time this 
airs,

168
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,120
it'll be something that I said 
basically,

169
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:30,830
even if we were doing this live right 
now,

170
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,590
things would be changing on the fly.
I'd have to check live on the,

171
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,610
on the phone to see what the current 
prices to figure it out.

172
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,190
And,
and Bitcoin is volatile.

173
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,473
But from my point of view,
I want to be exposed to as much of that 

174
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,444
volatility as I possibly can because 
bitcoin allows you to send and receive 

175
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:48,110
any amount of money with anyone anywhere
in the world basically for free.

176
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,060
And there's nothing anybody could do to 
stop it.

177
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,250
And there's a limited supply of bitcoin.
They will never,

178
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,200
ever,
ever be more than 21 million bitcoin.

179
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,480
So if you stop.
So how does that work exactly?

180
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,850
Because I've heard that.
So they'll never be more than 21 yet.

181
00:07:58,851 --> 00:07:59,684
We've got all these computers that are 
constantly working to get the next 

182
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,400
solution to the mathematical equation.
So how is there a finite number of.

183
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,293
So if one of these,
if one of these computers decided to 

184
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:11,564
give itself more than the 12 and a half 
bitcoins that are supposed to be 

185
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,460
allocated,
all the other computers will reject that

186
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:16,911
and say,
no,

187
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,650
that's not part of the rules of the game
that,

188
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,000
that in our software code.
So any computer that deviates from that,

189
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,163
their transactions in whatever they're 
trying to do just gets rejected and 

190
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,313
ignored by the rest of the network.
So right from day one it was programmed 

191
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:30,764
into the software code that there 
wouldn't be more than 21 million 

192
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,430
bitcoins,
but those are released over time.

193
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,970
So a half of the remaining bitcoins are 
released every four years.

194
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,480
So in the first four years of Bitcoins,
Bitcoin,

195
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,250
10 and a half million coins were 
released in the next four years,

196
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,630
half of that,
in the next four years,

197
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,740
half of that.
And,

198
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,930
uh,
it drops by half every four years.

199
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,970
So,
so what year will they all officially we

200
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:50,804
have more than 100 years until the last 
of the bitcoins are released out into 

201
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,120
the public.
So,

202
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
uh,
that's,

203
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,510
it's not a pressing problem at the 
moment,

204
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,344
but what would even,
I mean we don't have to go too far down 

205
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,790
that since it's 100 years from now,
but what would happen when we hit,

206
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,290
when we hit the point that they're all 
out there,

207
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,050
does that somehow drastically changed 
the way the game is played?

208
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,030
Well,
the idea is that by that point,

209
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,850
people that are doing bitcoin 
transactions,

210
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,013
even if they're paying a fraction of a 
penny per bitcoin transaction of people 

211
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,980
are doing billions of transactions per 
day,

212
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,233
those fees have a fraction of a penny 
per transaction will incentivize the 

213
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,600
miners to continue mining.

214
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,580
And we have 100 and something years to,
to find out to figure that out.

215
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:27,414
Yeah,
I suspect there will be some other 

216
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,240
issues.
So there's more pressing problems than,

217
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,150
than that one at the moments here.
Right.

218
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,500
Okay.
So how,

219
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,350
so it sounds to me that it's,
it's incredibly secure.

220
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,184
Right.
Can you just talk a little bit more 

221
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,680
about the general security?
Yeah.

222
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,420
So the,
the bitcoin network,

223
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,283
all these computers around the world 
that are doing mining a more accurate 

224
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:46,944
description of what they're doing is 
actually they're securing the bitcoin 

225
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,284
network.
So the more computers that are mining 

226
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:51,144
the more secure the bitcoin network is 
and the bitcoin network is somewhere on 

227
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:54,954
the order of several thousand times more
powerful now than the world's top 500 

228
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,131
supercomputers combined.
So it's absolutely an incredible feat of

229
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:05,600
engineering.
Wait.

230
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,320
So how do you get that kind of computing
power?

231
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,153
Like are there just,
I assume there's farms of servers just 

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,560
like it's just someone that invested in 
a farm,

233
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,140
right?
I mean is that well how it works.

234
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,000
And initially it was just people at home
in their bedroom because you know,

235
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,834
you,
if you found a block you would get a 

236
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,300
dollar.
And so it wasn't that excited.

237
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,700
But now today when you find a block on 
the blockchain,

238
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,631
you get,
you know,

239
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,040
80,000
plus dollars.

240
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,590
So now it's big,
big business.

241
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:29,424
So people have big,
giant warehouses filled with tens of 

242
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,900
millions of dollars of this mining 
equipment using,

243
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,940
you know,
tens of megawatts of power per,

244
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:37,950
per location,
and it's a big,

245
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,230
big business at this point and you can 
still do it at home.

246
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,190
One of the most important factors though
is the cost of electricity.

247
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,024
So the cheaper your electricity is,
the more profitable your bitcoin mining 

248
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,690
can be.

249
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,523
So I assume there's some bitcoin people 
that probably want to go into solar and 

250
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,880
moved to Nevada or something.
Yup.

251
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,723
And then there's people going around 
looking at buying power plants and 

252
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,810
buying hydroelectric dams,
all sorts of stuff.

253
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:01,590
It's really become a worldwide major 
industry at this point.

254
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,030
Yeah.
I mentioned to you the DNA.

255
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,650
We're going to have to do some 
definitions here.

256
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:06,600
So blockchain,
what is blockchain?

257
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,003
Blockchain is just a fancy name for this
worldwide ledger that's kept on 

258
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:11,514
everybody's computer that's running this
copy of the software and the ledger 

259
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,320
stays in sync with every other copies.
So that's,

260
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,760
uh,
that's basically what a blockchain is.

261
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,310
And the reason it's called a blockchain 
is that ledger.

262
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,383
It's not updated all the time.
It's updated and steps and each step or 

263
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:24,534
update is a block of new information 
that's attached and they're all chained 

264
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:30,150
together mathematically,
so they're all in order,

265
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:30,984
so if a new block gets added to the end 
of the blockchain on average once every 

266
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:36,180
10 minutes and now the blockchain is,
I don't know,

267
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,070
coming up on half a million blocks long 
and it's been going on for,

268
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,780
I don't know,
eight,

269
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,420
nine years now,
something like that.

270
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,460
What are most people use actually using 
bitcoin for right now?

271
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:51,600
Like are they using it mostly just to 
transfer money from person to person or.

272
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:55,660
I noticed actually just two days I 
bought something on overstock.com

273
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,494
and it was the first time that I ever 
saw on an ecommerce site that I could 

274
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,660
have paid in bitcoin.
I had actually never seen that before,

275
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,494
but what?
What are most people using bitcoin for 

276
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,130
a.
I think it depends on.

277
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:07,510
It's kind of like asking what do most 
people use money for?

278
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,490
An imperative.
In my book,

279
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,770
Bitcoin is money,
so people use money in different ways.

280
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,480
Some people save with it,
some people spend it,

281
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,430
some people gamble on the Internet with 
it,

282
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:16,264
some people buy drugs with it,
some people do whatever it is they want 

283
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,780
with it,
but in my point of view,

284
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,614
each each person owns their own money 
and they should be free to do whatever 

285
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:23,350
they want with it.

286
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,920
So long as they're not initiating force 
or fraud against other people.

287
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,773
And I'm curious,
do you know what any of the trends are 

288
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:30,664
like are people really at the moment 
just getting into bitcoin so they can 

289
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,600
save it,
hoping that,

290
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,870
you know,
treating it more as a stock than an than

291
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,810
actual cash or they.
All right.

292
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,560
Then we can also talk about a little bit
about the split with bitcoin cash do.

293
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,403
That's probably a good segue to that,
but do you have any sense of what the 

294
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,920
actual habits are?
Yeah,

295
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,530
so I think that's a great segue into 
that.

296
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:48,364
So when I first got involved in Bitcoin,
I was the first person in the entire 

297
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,720
world to start investing in bitcoin 
startups.

298
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,560
So my first step where,
let's pause there for a second.

299
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,830
This is 2011,
right?

300
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,350
Right.
What are our 2011 bitcoins are less than

301
00:12:59,351 --> 00:12:59,980
a dollar each.

302
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,150
Okay.
And what possessed you to get involved?

303
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,660
Like what did you see that you were 
like,

304
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,980
all right,
this is going to be something.

305
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,233
So,
um,

306
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,693
I grew up in silicon valley than playing
with computers since I was little kid 

307
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,650
love computers all the time.
Um,

308
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,100
and my hobby was studying economics and 
uh,

309
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,143
just kind of by chance,
I came across one economics book in 

310
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,680
junior high when my mother told me I 
couldn't play anymore Nintendo.

311
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,460
I had to go and do something else.
I picked up a book off the bookshelf and

312
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,190
just by luck it was a book called 
socialism by loaded.

313
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,570
Bobby says,
and some people may know who that is and

314
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,890
what that book is and most people I 
expect won't.

315
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:37,724
And when I picked up that book,
I thought it was a pro socialism book 

316
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,750
and I didn't really even know what 
socialism was,

317
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,980
but I kind of knew that Americans were 
supposed to be opposed to socialism.

318
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,640
But I thought,
you know,

319
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,473
I should have an open mind.
I should at least hear what the other 

320
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,620
side of the,
you know,

321
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,630
this point of view has to say,
and it turned out that,

322
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,170
I think it was the Wall Street Journal 
referred to Mommy says book socialism is

323
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,430
loaded,
is devastating critique of socialism.

324
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,300
And in this book he kind of points out 
that prices are incredibly important and

325
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:11,110
without the pricing mechanism,
you don't know what raw resources should

326
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,810
be used to produce what consumer goods.
So this,

327
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,230
you know,
my,

328
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,800
my glass of water here is made of glass 
that I don't know.

329
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,160
I don't even know how they make the 
glass,

330
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,710
but I guess some sand and they melt it 
down or something like that.

331
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,890
But without the price that we got it 
from target for the record.

332
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,510
So we spare no expense around here.
You know what I'm saying?

333
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,553
Right.
And with the prices that go into the 

334
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,490
sand and then the factory and this and 
that,

335
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,324
they know that maybe they should make 
glasses out of sand rather than glasses 

336
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:36,220
out of gold or glasses out of copper or 
take your pick.

337
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,054
And so all the prices all over the world
allocate all of these resources and all 

338
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,770
of these companies and all these 
factories and people and individuals all

339
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:45,604
the way to the time when you get to 
target and you look at the different 

340
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,250
glasses there and you think this one's 
glass,

341
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,084
this one's plastic,
this one suits my need better than this 

342
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:51,694
one and this one cost this much,
and it allocates the resources of the 

343
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,120
entire world.
Without a pricing mechanism,

344
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,463
you have no idea what raw resources 
should be used to create what consumer 

345
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:01,970
goods and reading this book,
it was like,

346
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:02,804
wow.

347
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,350
Anytime the government gets involved in 
any area of the economy,

348
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,393
they're causing a misallocation of 
resources and resources are being 

349
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,634
diverted from their most economically 
efficient use to something that's less 

350
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:14,774
economically efficient and saying 
something's less economically efficient 

351
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:18,494
is just a fancier way of saying you're 
making the world a poorer place than it 

352
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:21,644
otherwise would have been.
And so I found these ideas incredibly 

353
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,510
interesting and it,
it I,

354
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,590
it gave me a better understanding of the
world.

355
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,570
And so I read one economics book after 
another,

356
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:32,260
after another after another,
and so I,

357
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,613
I got to read these theories about the 
origin of money and what the origin of 

358
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,124
money is and the idea of the origin of 
money is that it starts out as a 

359
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,080
commodity,
but not just any commodity.

360
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,360
It has to be commodity that's easily 
recognizable,

361
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,810
easily divisible,
easily transportable.

362
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,730
You can store it easily for a long time 
and it won't go moldy or disappeared.

363
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,593
It has to have these certain 
characteristics that make something as 

364
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:54,854
money.
And I read about these theories in the 

365
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:00,040
books and I was pretty convinced by the 
theories,

366
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,690
and not to go down a whole nother 
tangent,

367
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:05,750
but I actually did some time in federal 
prison in the US as well.

368
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,810
And when I was in federal,
I've got it noted right there.

369
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,180
Okay.
While I was in federal prison,

370
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,640
I got to see firsthand in this micro 
prison economy that sure enough,

371
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,503
the theories in the books that I'd read 
about the origin of money were true in 

372
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:21,644
practice.
So I got to see within the prison that 

373
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,760
sure enough people are using commodities
as money.

374
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:26,594
So in prison people use tobacco and 
postage stamps and top ramen soups as 

375
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,570
money because all of those things are 
easily storable,

376
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,300
easily transportable,
easily divisible,

377
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,180
easily recognizable.
Uh,

378
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:39,410
and of course a limited supply is 
important as well.

379
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,243
And so I got to see firsthand before my 
eyes that the theories that I had read 

380
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:47,360
about in the books are actually true in 
practice.

381
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,610
And then bitcoin came along and I saw 
bitcoin and I knew from the theories and

382
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,444
the books and from the practical 
experience and the empirical evidence I 

383
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,194
had from the prison economy,
I knew people were going to start using 

384
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:01,364
it as money and because the supply of 
Bitcoin was limited and I knew people 

385
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,080
were going to start using it as money,
that meant the price of bitcoin in terms

386
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:09,914
of dollars would have to go up.
So my first step was to buy a bunch of 

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,110
bitcoin and my next step was to start 
building that.

388
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,210
Sorry to interrupt.
But at that early stage,

389
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:17,751
when you say,
all right,

390
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:18,584
I'm going to buy Bitcoin,
who you actually even buying it from 

391
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:20,870
then?

392
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,350
So this was a,
I think February of 2011.

393
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,770
And so there wasn't really an easy way 
to buy bitcoin at that point.

394
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,300
There was no,
there was no coinbase,

395
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,580
there was a,
there wasn't much of anything other than

396
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,414
this one company called Mt.
Gox and it wasn't really much of a 

397
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,004
company at that point.
So I sent my first wire to a person's 

398
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,424
personal bank account,
a guy named Jed mccaleb to his personal 

399
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:46,160
bank account in New York.
And I got my first big ones in there.

400
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:46,994
And then in parallel I was trying to buy
bitcoins from another guy off the 

401
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,610
Internet for anybody who's been around 
in Bitcoin for a while,

402
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:54,110
they may have seen the physical 
[inaudible] sassiest bitcoins.

403
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:56,910
So the guy behind that was also nice 
enough to send me some bitcoins.

404
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,060
And so one time there was actually a 
physical there.

405
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,933
There still are,
but they're more of a collector's item 

406
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:02,670
at this point.

407
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,920
And basically it's a physical coin with 
a Hologram.

408
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,590
And when you peel a hologram off,
you can see that it's been tampered with

409
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,180
and underneath the Hologram is the magic
number that's required to actually spend

410
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,800
the bitcoins.
Um,

411
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,663
do they start?
So they still do make those or maybe 

412
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:17,934
someone somewhere still making them.
But it was the reason just because at 

413
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:21,594
the beginning people needed some sort of
physical representation just to kind of 

414
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:24,954
understand.
I think the main reason is it made it 

415
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:28,980
easier for people to get a hold of 
bitcoin.

416
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:29,814
So I'm one of the main things that I did
that really help spread a bitcoin 

417
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,210
adoption in the early days,
in 2012,

418
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:38,490
I think it was when bitcoins were like 
three bucks each.

419
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,750
I started selling these physical 
bitcoins and I accepted credit cards and

420
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,660
pay pal and I would ship them via Fedex 
and we had proof of delivery.

421
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,630
So it made it hard for people to do 
credit card charge backs or that sort of

422
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:49,464
thing.
And we saw thousands and thousands of 

423
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,670
these physical bitcoins to people all 
over the world that way.

424
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,773
And it was an easy way for people to get
their first bitcoin because then they 

425
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,984
could peel off the sticker and redeemed 
them onto their computer or do whatever 

426
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:02,190
they wanted with them from there.
And uh,

427
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,353
today they're,
they're quite the collector's items 

428
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,334
because there's not too many left of 
those early [inaudible] CSF physical 

429
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:08,200
bitcoins.
Right.

430
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,791
So,
okay.

431
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,624
So you,
you make this initial investment in 

432
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,780
2011,
2012.

433
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,430
When did you start to realize that this 
really was becoming something?

434
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,700
And as we speak right now,
it's Bitcoin is basically at its highest

435
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,910
value of all,
all time in effect.

436
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,780
Yeah.
I,

437
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,620
I knew from,
from day one,

438
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,400
once I put together the pieces in my 
mind and I understood that bitcoin could

439
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,263
be shut down or stopped or controlled in
any way and that there's a limited 

440
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:33,954
supply.

441
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,390
I was so excited about this,
that,

442
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,160
uh,
I heard about it.

443
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,050
And as I was eating breakfast at around 
10:00

444
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,740
AM with the full intent of going into my
office that day didn't make it.

445
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,080
I stayed home and read about bitcoin all
day.

446
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,410
I stayed up all night the next day until
around 4:00

447
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,130
PM the next day and I got too tired and 
I fell asleep for only about an hour and

448
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:53,964
then woke up again and read all about 
bitcoin and I went on sleeping maybe an 

449
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,750
hour and a half per night for about a 
whole week until I got so sick from lack

450
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:04,130
of sleep.
I had to call my friends,

451
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,500
help me.
I'm so sick and he came and picked me up

452
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,334
and drove me to the hospital and they 
gave me some sort of a sedative or 

453
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,664
something and I.
I passed out asleep for maybe 12 or 16 

454
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,613
hours,
but then woke up again and it was all 

455
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:17,394
bitcoin and here we are about seven 
years later and it's been all bitcoin 

456
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,933
all day,
every day for seven years now because 

457
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,280
this is literally.

458
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,113
It's one of the most important 
inventions in the entire history of 

459
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,754
humankind.
Right up there on par with the 

460
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:32,250
importance of the invention of the wheel
or the electricity or the transistor.

461
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,620
That's how big of a deal the invention 
of bitcoin is.

462
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,500
So I want to get into that and how it 
can sort of,

463
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,423
why you really believe this can change 
the way we deal with borders and 

464
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:45,090
societies and nations and wars and all 
of this a bit.

465
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:46,920
But let's just circle back quickly to 
the.

466
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,120
The split.
This bitcoin cash,

467
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,010
bitcoin split.
Yep.

468
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:53,620
So when I first got excited about 
Bitcoin,

469
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,454
you could send and receive any amount of
bitcoin with anyone anywhere in the 

470
00:20:56,081 --> 00:21:00,700
world and it was free most of the time,
the times it wasn't for you.

471
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,743
Pay a fraction of a penny and that led 
bitcoin from being worth almost nothing 

472
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:07,990
to this worldwide phenomenon that it is 
today,

473
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,483
but much more recently within the last 
year to a bunch of people that don't 

474
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,504
have any background in economics or or 
in business seem to think that people 

475
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,244
will use bitcoin solely as a store of 
value even if it costs tens or hundreds 

476
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,850
or thousands of dollars to send bitcoin 
from one person to another.

477
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,690
And so they've intentionally undermine 
bitcoin's usefulness in commerce.

478
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:32,650
So bitcoin on August first split into 
two versions of Bitcoin,

479
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:35,080
there's now a bitcoin segwit and bitcoin
cash.

480
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,880
The bitcoin cash version of bitcoin 
still has fees are less than a penny you

481
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,860
can send and receive them with anyone 
anywhere in the world,

482
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,500
just like that.
Bitcoin segwit.

483
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:45,334
Now the average fee is about $10 a.
I did a bitcoin transaction on the way 

484
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:49,504
here.
Uh,

485
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,950
in fact I was sin sending my bitcoin 
segwit bitcoins to a bitcoin exchange to

486
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:54,784
buy more bitcoin cash.
Bitcoin's the fee for me to send those 

487
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:01,330
bitcoins for my computer to the bitcoin 
exchange with $100.

488
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,930
And so if you ask yourself,
you have two versions of bitcoin and one

489
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:08,590
is slow,
expensive and unreliable bitcoin segwit,

490
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,200
and you have another version of bitcoin 
that's super fast,

491
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,520
reliable and cheap.
It's not the type to say,

492
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,363
and that's bitcoin cash,
it's not a tough decision as to which 

493
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,680
one people are going to start using it 
in commerce.

494
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,820
But these,
right?

495
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,560
So I might,
I might be a little confused here.

496
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,050
So when I'm telling you that I have two 
and a half Bitcoin,

497
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,100
I,
when you say bitcoin and Segwit,

498
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,250
that's the original,
the original,

499
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:28,084
so to speak.
Right?

500
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,130
So that's debatable as well.
Um,

501
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,230
so it,
depending on when you received those two

502
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,180
and a half bitcoins,
that was probably from a bunch of people

503
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:37,150
over time,
however many bitcoins you had on August,

504
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:37,984
first of this year,
you now have that many bitcoin cash as 

505
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,624
well.
So let's say you had two bitcoins 

506
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:42,820
exactly on August.
First,

507
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,520
you now have two bitcoins and into 
bitcoin cash.

508
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,703
Um,
although I believe you said that you 

509
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,810
were holding your bitcoins on coinbase.
I did.

510
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:53,410
And as we were talking about before,
the show base is a fantastic company,

511
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,760
but it's not a bitcoin wallet.
It's a bit coin bank and they're holding

512
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:00,970
the bitcoins on your behalf and now 
they're holding the bitcoin cash on your

513
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:01,750
behalf.

514
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,583
And so you're going to have to wait for 
them to get around to giving you access 

515
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,850
to their bitcoin cash,
which I think they will.

516
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,013
But if you were using a bit coin wallet 
in which you're holding the bitcoins 

517
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:11,074
yourself on your own device,
you would have access to your bitcoin 

518
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:15,010
cash right there from day one.
So what do you mean?

519
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:17,800
I don't have access to it?
If I was to right now,

520
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:18,634
log in and I got to do all that stuff on
my phone and all of the password 

521
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:21,454
craziness and all that,
I'm very happy that you have to do all 

522
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:23,794
those things obviously.
What do you mean I don't have access to 

523
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:26,824
it?
You only have access to the bitcoin 

524
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:30,010
segwit version of bitcoin on coinbase 
today.

525
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,173
They've promised to give everybody 
access to their bitcoin cash at some 

526
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,470
point and hopefully they'll do that 
sooner rather than later.

527
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,303
But August first was a couple of months 
ago now and they still haven't gotten 

528
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,140
around to doing it and I'm confident 
that they will,

529
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,443
but it's nice to have access to your 
money now and not have to wait around 

530
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:47,450
for somebody else to do it.
And that's why it's very important.

531
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,850
And I always tell people,
use a bitcoin wallet,

532
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,013
not a Bitcoin Bank.
So why wouldn't everyone want bitcoin 

533
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,500
cash though?
Unless I'm missing something.

534
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,740
I think everyone is going to want 
bitcoin cash.

535
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,680
There's book.
So then what was the logic?

536
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:01,514
Yeah.
What's the reason everyone's not using 

537
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,194
it yet is that this bitcoin Seibert 
version of bitcoin managed to bring 

538
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:09,694
along all of the existing infrastructure
in bitcoin that's been around for nine 

539
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,220
years now,
eight years now.

540
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,990
Bitcoin cash has only been around a 
couple of months since August first,

541
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:23,440
and the fact that bitcoin cash is now 
supported on the bitcoin.com

542
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,274
wallet,
it's supported in the blockchain dot 

543
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,490
Info Wallet,
a coin base as public as they said,

544
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:28,670
they're going to support it.
Uh,

545
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,793
it's supported in the bitpay wallet.
It's getting more and more support from 

546
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,680
wallets and merchant processors and 
exchanges.

547
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,523
Uh,
I think it's a matter of time when 

548
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:37,414
people are faced between a fast,
cheap and reliable version of bitcoin 

549
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,300
and it's super slow and expensive and 
unreliable version of bitcoin.

550
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,313
There's,
what's the argument from the slow 

551
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:46,414
people,
the people that don't agree with you on 

552
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,030
this?
What's the actual argument?

553
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,420
If we're really just talking about slow 
speeds and a clunkier process,

554
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,970
obviously that doesn't sound good.
So to have fast,

555
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,980
cheap,
reliable transactions on Bitcoin,

556
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,890
it requires a more expensive computer to
run a full node,

557
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,510
but the vast,
vast,

558
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:04,360
vast majority of bitcoin users aren't 
running a full note anyhow.

559
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:07,840
You've probably never run a full node in
your entire life and nobody,

560
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:08,674
you know,
none of these coin based users are 

561
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:10,024
running a full node.
Coinbase runs a number of full notes to 

562
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,320
support your bitcoin transactions.
So if you have

563
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,513
the bitcoin cash version will require 
bigger blocks which require a more 

564
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:23,880
powerful CPU and more storage space.
So right now today you can run a bitcoin

565
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,670
full node for the Bitcoin segwit 
version,

566
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,110
literally on a $25 raspberry Pi.
These people are ready to take.

567
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,003
What is that about?
A Raspberry Pi is a $25 computer and 

568
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,770
that's the name of the computer.
So there's a cup.

569
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:37,200
Yeah,
there's,

570
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,400
there's an actual competitor.
We are another thing on pies now.

571
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,423
But wait,
there's a computer called the raspberry 

572
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,420
Pi I to the number of acts.
So you see there's a lot of terms here.

573
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,740
We're running this thing on cakes.
Okay.

574
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,610
So you can run the Bitcoin segwit 
version of Bitcoin on a $25 computer.

575
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,180
Bitcoin cash today can still run under 
$25 computer,

576
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,180
but in the future as bitcoin cash 
becomes more popular,

577
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,283
maybe it'll take $100 computer or even a
500 or even a thousand or a couple 

578
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:05,780
thousand dollar computer at some at some
point.

579
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,303
But that's okay.
Most people aren't running full nodes 

580
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:12,770
anyhow and if you're,
if you caught it cost five or 10 or $100

581
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,910
to use bitcoin segwit and it cost a 
penny to use bitcoin cash.

582
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,080
It's clear.
So you were,

583
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,060
you've been accepting donations on your 
website.

584
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,433
I think you got most of those donations 
before the price of bitcoin transaction 

585
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:25,674
skyrocketed.
And the reason the price of Bitcoin 

586
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:27,344
segwit transactions skyrocket is there's
one megabyte worth of transactions that 

587
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:34,940
can happen each 10 minute period that 
can hold about 2000 bitcoin transactions

588
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,850
in the early days,
maybe 10 people were using bitcoin every

589
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:38,684
10 minutes.
So you could do it for free and your 

590
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:41,144
transaction will be included.
Now that bitcoin is this worldwide 

591
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,394
phenomenon,
more than 2000 people are trying to use 

592
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,304
bitcoin every 10 minutes,
but you want your transaction to be 

593
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,214
included in the blockchain.
So if more than 2000 people are trying 

594
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:52,794
to use every 10 minutes,
they have to bid against each other and 

595
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,184
the top bidders are the ones that are 
included in the next block on the 

596
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:58,530
blockchain.

597
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,530
So now the fees are about $10 per per 
transaction because anybody that pays $9

598
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,120
has been outbid by the people that are 
paying $10.

599
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,700
So bitcoin cash a solution to that as 
well.

600
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,650
Just make the blocks bigger than one 
megabyte.

601
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,484
It's 2017.
Eight terabyte hard drive is about 100 

602
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,160
bucks at the moment,
didn't they're only going to get cheaper

603
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:17,994
year after year.
So you're feeling basically is that the 

604
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:20,664
technology will always sort of the 
computing power that we need for this 

605
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:25,440
will always sort of stay in front of the
problems,

606
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,303
right?
So just because it keeps getting faster 

607
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:28,770
and there's this great thing called 
Moore's law,

608
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:32,190
which is exactly that.
That computing power doubles about every

609
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:37,191
18 months and so if a eight terabyte 
hard drive today is $100 in a year and a

610
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,303
half from now,
it's going to be about $50 and a year 

611
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,780
half after that,
you know,

612
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,580
$25.

613
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,413
And before you know what their garbage 
in the landfill and people laugh at a 

614
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,950
eight terabyte hard drive the same way 
we'd laugh.

615
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:47,784
I bet eight megabyte hard drive today,
but I remember eight megabyte hard 

616
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:53,520
drives and I remember when they were 
several hundred dollars and I'm not that

617
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:56,640
old of a guy in the same as going to 
continue to happen with computers.

618
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,890
Before we know it.
You mentioned the window before.

619
00:27:58,891 --> 00:27:59,724
I remember when the first,
I think it was four megabyte game came 

620
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:05,000
out on Sega Genesis and it's big deal 
and they were going.

621
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,040
People were going completely bananas 
about it.

622
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,440
That is many lifetimes ago.
Uh,

623
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,070
just real quick,
let's circle back to this,

624
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,200
to this Wallet Verse Bank Thing Because 
I think,

625
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,034
uh,
maybe maybe I could be a little clearer 

626
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,134
on what you're saying.
So coinbase as a bank is really just 

627
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,850
holding my bitcoin.
If they were,

628
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,803
if I had this in a wallet,
then that's actually part of the actual 

629
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,910
blockchain right here.

630
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,053
If you haven't in a bitcoin wallet,
you're interfacing directly with the 

631
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,220
actual bitcoin network.
Whereas when you use a bitcoin bank like

632
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,073
coinbase,
you're interfacing with coinbase and 

633
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:35,544
you're saying,
please broadcast my transaction to the 

634
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:39,390
bitcoin network and most of the time 
they do,

635
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,850
but like your bitcoin cash at the 
moment,

636
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:42,684
you don't have access to it and I would 
actually recommend that on your website 

637
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:45,564
you should put a bitcoin cash address up
there because right now people want to 

638
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:48,864
tip you in.
Bitcoin is going to cost them five or 

639
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,264
$10 in network fee.
So if they wanted to give you a dollar 

640
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,593
in Bitcoin,
they're going to have to pay six or $11 

641
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,474
to do that.
And I don't think too many people are 

642
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,900
going to do that.
These don't seem like the type of people

643
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,734
that would make sense to you.
Whereas if they want it to tip you in 

644
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,044
bitcoin cash,
if a dollar they'll have to send a 

645
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:06,204
dollar and a penny and that's very 
tolerable to people and I'm more than 

646
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,830
happy after we record,
I can show you this bitcoin cash.

647
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,291
Well,
I'm going to say,

648
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,124
yeah,
I've got my own farm out their servers 

649
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:13,914
and we're going to fiddle around with.
So then why would someone use a bank 

650
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:17,604
then?
I think they just didn't understand the 

651
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,220
different.
It's just like yourself.

652
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,293
I think you didn't realize the 
difference between coinbase and a real 

653
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:25,230
big coin wallet until now.
Fascinating.

654
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,083
All right,
well I think we did a pretty decent job 

655
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,434
there of the little stuff.
Do you feel like we basically got the 

656
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,764
one.
Am I missing something on the one one 

657
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,310
for anybody that feels like they're 
missing anything on the [inaudible],

658
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,303
go go to bitcoin dot Khan.
I'm a little bit biased because that's 

659
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:40,110
my website,
but it's a fantastic resource.

660
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,040
Get a bitcoin wallet and start using

661
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,330
it.
It's like email.

662
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:47,890
If you'd never actually used email and 
you only heard people discuss the show,

663
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:49,900
it would seem hard,
but once you've used it,

664
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,110
it's easy.
It's the same with bitcoin.

665
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,993
So go and actually use it and,
and use it with bitcoin cash because it 

666
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,204
won't cost you $5 each time you use it.
It'll cost you less than a penny each 

667
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,200
time you make a transaction.
All right,

668
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,970
so the part of this,
so shifting from all that,

669
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:01,804
the part of this that I thought was 
really interesting beyond just the 

670
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:04,954
financial discussion and just sort of 
the way the future of commerce is going 

671
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:09,464
to work and all that is you really 
believe that bitcoin can change the way 

672
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,170
governments act,
the way,

673
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,400
the way we as individuals respond to 
and,

674
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,290
and talk to our governments and all of 
that.

675
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,373
Uh,
so I'm giving you a sort of a broad 

676
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:23,360
question there,
but uh,

677
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,273
tell me about that.

678
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,133
I hear people asking me all the time or 
aren't is going to regulate bitcoin and 

679
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:29,960
what about government regulation and 
Bitcoin?

680
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,200
But I think they're asking the wrong 
question.

681
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:33,034
The real,
the real end game here is isn't that 

682
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,490
governments are going to regulate 
bitcoin.

683
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,520
Bitcoin is going to regulate 
governments.

684
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,833
Bitcoin is going to limit the power that
every government on the planet has to 

685
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:44,554
control people.
A look at what happened a few years ago 

686
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:48,490
in Cyprus where every single person 
there had,

687
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,453
you know,
a big percentage of their bank account 

688
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,143
just completely wiped out.
Bitcoin gives the ability to people to 

689
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:58,240
opt out of that sort of system in the 
United States here,

690
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,074
you know,
the government can print as much money 

691
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:01,354
at any time for any reason and you 
better believe that they're doing that 

692
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,940
all the time if you're using bitcoin.
That sort of thing can happen.

693
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:10,120
And one of these really interesting 
ideas that had never occurred to me when

694
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:10,781
I was,
you know,

695
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:11,614
going on my binge ever,
any economics books as a kid was a by 

696
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:19,021
Milton Friedman and he pointed out the 
idea of bracket creep and the government

697
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,310
inflates the currency every single year.

698
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,120
So maybe having,
you know,

699
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,040
two or three percent inflation and you 
know,

700
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,560
you're one year to the next.
That's not that big of a deal,

701
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,780
but compounding year after year after 
year,

702
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,080
before you know it,
$100,000

703
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,270
isn't intended,
or 20 years from now,

704
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,180
it's not gonna be that big of an income,
right?

705
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,100
But the government tax brackets are 
likely to stay about the same.

706
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:39,934
So maybe $50,000
income today is the equivalent of 

707
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:43,294
$100,000.
Your income after however many years it 

708
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:47,680
takes to compound to that.
So instead of being in a,

709
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:49,360
you know,
25 percent tax bracket,

710
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:50,194
you're going to be in a 45 percent tax 
bracket even though you're not actually 

711
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:56,290
earning any more money each year.
Bitcoin is the exact opposite of that.

712
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,124
There's no central authority that can 
make more bitcoins out of thin air 

713
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,453
unlike the US dollar.
So that's a really powerful way of 

714
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:05,230
people to opt out of this government 
inflation racket that they had that they

715
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,840
used to bump everybody into higher tax 
brackets year after year.

716
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,770
Right?
So it's sort of,

717
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,150
it's kind of hard to picture what this 
would actually look like in the future.

718
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:13,984
But if you,
if everything you're predicting and 

719
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,660
would like to happen,
happened,

720
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:17,883
even effect as the years go by,
people will obviously be buying more 

721
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:25,290
bitcoin using the US dollar in whatever 
country they're in,

722
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,283
whatever their currencies,
they're gonna use that less and that 

723
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,210
that vary by just doing that.
The governments will in effect have less

724
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:36,730
control over the people because all of 
your,

725
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,133
all of your interactions,
all of your exchanges will have nothing 

726
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,234
to do with the government.
Can Sam grinning from ear to ear as 

727
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:46,520
someone who's this white is in Bitcoin,
is illegal in China?

728
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,354
Or are they just changed something or 
wasn't there something just in the last 

729
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,480
couple of weeks?
They've changed a lot of things in,

730
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:52,314
in China at the moment,
but at the end of the day it doesn't 

731
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,720
matter if you have access to the 
Internet,

732
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,800
you can use bitcoin and this is really,
really,

733
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,000
really exciting.

734
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,920
And I,
I guess it's worth pointing out too,

735
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,560
like I wasn't born a libertarian.
I,

736
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:08,720
I wasn't even.
I didn't really have any political views

737
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,850
at all.
It was the more economics I studied,

738
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,043
the more of a libertarian I became and 
then it was kind of really depressing 

739
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,690
because I looked around the world and 
governments are manipulating the economy

740
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,524
and all these ways that are preventing 
or slowing down the entire world's rate 

741
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:24,850
of economic growth and economic growth 
of,

742
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:26,060
you know,
you know,

743
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,750
two or three or four percent per year 
from one year to the next.

744
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:30,584
That's not that big of a deal,
but compounded year after year after 

745
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,310
year,
it really makes a huge,

746
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,144
huge difference.
And so even if the government is just 

747
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:37,484
slowing down the rate of economic growth
by just one percent and I think it's 

748
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,484
substantially more than that compound,
that times 100 or a couple of hundred 

749
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:44,294
years,
we'd all have flying cars and space 

750
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:48,800
stations by now and be living forever 
because of little nano technology.

751
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,633
Robots that can go on our body and fix 
everything that's wrong with us and who 

752
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,620
doesn't want that sort of thing.
And if you don't want it,

753
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:56,810
don't participate.
You're not forced to participate.

754
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:57,644
And that's what we're talking about,
were slowing down the rate of progress 

755
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:01,244
of all of humankind.
And bitcoin is this incredibly powerful 

756
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:06,200
tool to help speed up that rate of 
progress.

757
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,293
Man,
there's so many different ways I could 

758
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:09,500
go with that.
Uh,

759
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,640
so the dystopian future part of this 
that I guess I would fear is that if,

760
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,450
if the government loses control of the 
monetary system,

761
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:18,284
all the governments whose control and 
the only way they can stop us now is to 

762
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:21,944
go after the Internet.
Wouldn't it stand to reason that 

763
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:26,090
governments would start going after the 
internet?

764
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,040
They're like literally the Internet 
itself,

765
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,650
like actually try to disconnect the 
internet,

766
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,420
maybe whatever that.

767
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,040
But lots of governments are dependent on
the Internet as well.

768
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,970
But there's also lots of smart people 
that are building these mesh networks in

769
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:38,804
which it's not,
it's not dependent on the same sort of 

770
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:43,550
centralized infrastructure that allowed 
the Internet is today.

771
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,683
And those technologies are only going to
get more and more powerful and cheaper 

772
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,340
and cheaper and cheaper thanks to 
Moore's law.

773
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:53,000
And before we know it will all be able 
to connect with everybody else.

774
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,270
And we won't be dependent on,
you know,

775
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,870
these big esps and how do they go about 
doing that,

776
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:59,540
like a mesh network like that.
So basically in effect,

777
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:02,390
getting us off Google and verizon and 
whatever else,

778
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,230
right?
Like that,

779
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,093
those won't be the only pathways.
How do these guys get out of that 

780
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:06,890
system?
Um,

781
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,723
well I think we're of a similar age and 
I'm sure both of us remember before 

782
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:11,504
there were smartphones and before there 
were iphones and before there was Siri 

783
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,570
and Google and all these things.

784
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,403
And,
and now you have the entire database of 

785
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:20,480
human knowledge right in your hand.
And if you buy a used iphone,

786
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:23,750
you can get it for about a hundred bucks
and another couple of years that's going

787
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:26,930
to buy a cheap android phone for 20 
bucks right now.

788
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:27,920
Like,
that's incredible.

789
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,010
So the hardware to do this is going to 
get cheaper and cheaper.

790
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,410
The technology is going to become more 
and more accessible.

791
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,463
Uh,
it's gonna be cheaper and cheaper for 

792
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,630
anybody to put satellites up in space 
and maybe government,

793
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:40,200
you're going to try and stop this and 
do,

794
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,063
do bad things to do that.
But if they start trying to shut down 

795
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:46,170
the world's Internet to prevent people 
from using their own money,

796
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,050
that's just a fantastic example that the
government people are the bad people and

797
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,840
they're not our friends and they're not 
here to help us.

798
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,760
Anybody that's here trying to say,
hey,

799
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,090
we're going to turn off the Internet if 
you use money without our permission.

800
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,310
Those are bad people.
We shouldn't support them.

801
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,690
We shouldn't want anything to do with 
them.

802
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,890
And that's just more proof that we do 
need bitcoin to opt out of there.

803
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,510
They're violent curse of system to 
control us all.

804
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,900
We shouldn't be their tax cattle,
livestock.

805
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,870
It's a great sell for libertarianism in 
general.

806
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,030
Like if mean this is what I am always,
you know,

807
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,670
selling the ideas of freedom.
It's like if you think people,

808
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,710
everyone complains,
the government's horrible all the time.

809
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,723
You have half the people want to give 
them more money and give them more 

810
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:22,681
control.
And it's like,

811
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,240
no,
do the opposite.

812
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:25,710
Yeah,
you don't starve them,

813
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:27,510
but let's try it.
Let's try it that way.

814
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,170
So I think I'm follow the logic here.

815
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,160
So when you talk about how,
why this would basically stop wars to do

816
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:35,994
you mean because of economic reasons or 
because basically we wouldn't be giving 

817
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,133
the economic reasons,
meaning countries wouldn't have an 

818
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,803
economic incentive to fight,
but also that the people wouldn't be 

819
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,740
giving them enough money to fight in the
first place.

820
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:48,750
Is that.
So there's a couple of reasons.

821
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:51,150
And uh,
since we have quite a big audience,

822
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,070
I've never talked about one of them 
publicly,

823
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,620
a really up until now,
what will they think about that one too?

824
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:56,650
All right,
let's throw one of,

825
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,513
one of the easy,
simple reasons is that lots of 

826
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:01,650
governments fund their wars,
the inflation.

827
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,903
They just print money and they use that 
money to buy guns and bombs and tanks 

828
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:07,380
and they use it to murder people all 
over the world.

829
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,290
And a war is just a euphemism for 
murder.

830
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,030
Uh,
you're,

831
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,500
you're killing.
Sometimes some bad people get killed,

832
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:14,334
but for the most part,
innocent civilians are getting killed 

833
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:17,184
all over the world and let's say 
somebody came in here and stole my 

834
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,580
wallet,
ran off down the street.

835
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:23,330
If I started chasing them down the 
street and shooting guns and I,

836
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,100
I shot a dozen innocent people that 
didn't steal my wallet.

837
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,880
I said,
oh,

838
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,713
it's okay,
because I was trying to get the bad guy 

839
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,480
who stole my wallet.
I would go to jail for being a murder,

840
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:35,010
for killing all those incident people.
So let's say let's take for granted.

841
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,430
Let's say Saddam Hussein was a really 
bad guy who deserved to be killed.

842
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,660
They murdered more than half a million 
Iraqi children to do it.

843
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,010
Right?
That's murder.

844
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,260
You're killing kids,
right?

845
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:48,720
It doesn't matter how bad of a Guy 
Saddam Hussein is.

846
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,630
You don't go and kill a bunch of kids to
get them,

847
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,330
and that's exactly what the United 
States government did,

848
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,720
and if any individual did that trying to
catch a common thief,

849
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,980
you would go to jail for it.

850
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,813
But for whatever reason,
people just have amnesia or a closed 

851
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,650
eyes when when governments do the exact 
same thing,

852
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:05,484
if you're murdering innocent people,
you're a murderer and that's what 

853
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,054
governments do and they do it primarily 
through printing money and use that to 

854
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:12,924
pay people to go and drop these bombs 
and guns and tanks and bitcoin takes 

855
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:20,841
that power away from them because if the
the end game is to have bitcoin replaced

856
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:24,420
the dollar of place to your place placed
in and when I'm saying Bitcoin to Dan,

857
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:26,420
referring to bitcoin cash to be clear,
okay,

858
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,193
but replace all those things and that 
takes away government's ability to 

859
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,014
inflate the currency,
to pay for all these things and people 

860
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:34,380
maybe sometimes they worry.
Well,

861
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:37,300
what about schools and roads and bridges
and hospitals?

862
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:39,120
Well guess what?
People love schools.

863
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,020
They love hospitals.
They love roads and bridges.

864
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,123
Things that people like people will be 
more than willing to pay for 

865
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:44,614
voluntarily.
I'm not interested in paying to drop 

866
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,150
bombs on people in countries.
I've never been to an I'm probably never

867
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:51,640
going to go to.
And I think 99 percent of the people out

868
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,710
there in the world also are interested 
in doing that.

869
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,540
And for the one percent that are 
interested in doing it,

870
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,390
do that with your money.
Don't force me to participate.

871
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,820
Right.
The other really,

872
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:05,110
really interesting way that I've never 
ever spoken about publicly up until now.

873
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:05,944
But I think bitcoin and cryptocurrencies
are a big enough part of our society at 

874
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:09,364
this point where I'm not really worried 
about the attacks from governments on 

875
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:13,624
them.
And initially that was my strategy from 

876
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:15,904
day one.
I wanted to spread bitcoin to as many 

877
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,430
people around the world as quickly as I 
possibly could.

878
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,130
They would become too big and too wide 
spread to be shut down.

879
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,303
So if people are using bitcoin and 
cryptocurrencies to buy their groceries 

880
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:29,890
and their diapers and things like that,
how can government shut it down?

881
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:30,724
But here's an interesting way,
but do you think we've hit that 

882
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,580
threshold yet?
But we're,

883
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,390
we're,
we're getting,

884
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,790
we're getting pretty darn close to that.
And at this point,

885
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,750
uh,
you know,

886
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,561
there's,
I don't know,

887
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:39,394
a hundred something,
200 something governments around the 

888
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,120
world.
If one government wants to shut it down,

889
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,130
that probably makes other governments 
like it even more.

890
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,330
I would guess maybe there's a bit of 
that at this moment.

891
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,780
Uh,
China has been cracking down a bit,

892
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,920
quite a bit.
I would guess trump in the u.

893
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:52,754
s government maybe like bit coin a 
little bit more now that China doesn't 

894
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:55,534
like it,
which we could use a little bit of that 

895
00:39:58,781 --> 00:39:59,790
leverage with China,
right?

896
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,600
Because how much do we owe them an 
actual dollar?

897
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,443
Sure.
Maybe we can pay them back in bitcoin 

898
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,293
for pennies on the dollar in the future 
once the RMB goes to nothing because 

899
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,670
everybody's using cryptocurrencies.
But another really,

900
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:12,160
really interesting thing.
So let's go back in time.

901
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:14,230
And a bad guy that everybody agrees 
upon,

902
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:15,130
you know,
Adolf Hitler.

903
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:15,964
I think pretty much.
I thought I could do one show without a 

904
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:22,110
Hitler reference while I'm playing it 
safe in my example here as well.

905
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,953
So let's say,
and I'm sure you can find people out 

906
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,044
there that don't think he was a bad guy,
but the vast majority of society does 

907
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:32,650
think he was a bad guy.
So Adolf Hitler started doing bad things

908
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:33,484
with money stolen from people in the 
form of taxes and what did the rest of 

909
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:36,934
the world do?
They started stealing money from other 

910
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:38,854
people in the form of taxes,
had kidnapping and slavery in the form 

911
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:42,040
of a draft.

912
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,873
Right?
And like lots of people went 

913
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:44,284
voluntarily,
but I'm sure lots of people went in 

914
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:47,620
voluntarily and we should be clear with 
our language,

915
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:48,454
right?
The draft is the moral equivalent of 

916
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:50,974
kidnapping and slavery.
There are literally kidnapping people 

917
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,853
and enslaving them and sending them off 
to some far off land to fight against 

918
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,760
their will.
And if they don't do that,

919
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:00,170
they go to jail and half the time when 
they go off to the far off land,

920
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,023
they get killed as well.
So the draft is the moral equivalent of 

921
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:03,910
kidnapping,
slavery.

922
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:04,744
So Adolf Hitler is a bad guy.
Everybody agrees with that almost 

923
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:08,524
everyone.
But then the rest of the governments 

924
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:12,220
around the world start going and doing 
all this crazy bad stuff.

925
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,054
Well,
what would happen if we had this online 

926
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:15,784
anonymous digital cash in which people 
could pool their resources and set up a 

927
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:20,974
betting pool and anybody that correctly 
predict the right day that Adolf Hitler 

928
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:28,270
dries,
I can anonymously collect this,

929
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:29,760
you know,
millions of dollars in,

930
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:30,594
in anonymous digital cash that people 
all chipped in a buck here and a buck 

931
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:34,310
there and 10 bucks a year.

932
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,443
I bet you could have raised a lot of 
money for someone to correctly predict 

933
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:42,030
the right day that Adolf Hitler dies.
I mean,

934
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:43,660
this is,
I said dystopian before.

935
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,340
Now you're,
you're going real dystopia.

936
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,720
Dystopia,
or is this a utopia?

937
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:48,554
Right?
Imagine if people could have raised 10 

938
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,593
million bucks voluntarily for around the
world and Adolf Hitler can't round up 

939
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,960
and send them off to the concentration 
camps anymore.

940
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,570
Is that a dystopia or a utopia?
Well,

941
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:00,440
it's a huge.
Right,

942
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:01,274
so it's a utopia in this explanation.
There's a piece of me and I love all 

943
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:06,620
these,
these Topian movies,

944
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:09,260
which is why I can go down this road and
all kinds of different ways.

945
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
There's a piece that's sort of like,
wow,

946
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:11,714
you could really end up creating some 
insane vigilante system where it's not 

947
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,120
just Hitler that's going to be taken 
out,

948
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,220
but any,
you know,

949
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,590
anybody that gets smeared by the media 
or whatever,

950
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,250
and then this is constantly happening to
people that actually don't deserve it.

951
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,160
So that would be the dystopian part.
But in this part,

952
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,200
so I've been thinking about this for 
more than a decade since before bitcoin.

953
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,380
And uh,
yeah,

954
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:37,131
it's scary,
you know,

955
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:37,964
we don't want to see know Justin Bieber 
or people like that we'll be having bad 

956
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:44,070
things happen to happen to them.
But on the net,

957
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:45,320
and you know,
if you look in the last century,

958
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,154
governments murdered more than a hundred
million people around the world and 

959
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:50,804
that's all a lot of people.
So in effect you think it would cause 

960
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,880
governments to police themselves 
basically to do good things because they

961
00:42:58,881 --> 00:42:59,890
would,
if there's a,

962
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,290
basically a ransom on them or.
Right.

963
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,100
Like that's,
that's really the idea here.

964
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,270
It it might do that or it might just 
make it too dangerous for governments in

965
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:09,104
the traditional form that we have today 
where they go around and boss people 

966
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:12,710
around and threatened to send them to 
jail.

967
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,140
If they don't obey,
maybe it'll make that sort of thing.

968
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,670
Not Possible,
and as a voluntary yes to.

969
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,660
I think all human interaction should be 
on a voluntary basis.

970
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:24,830
A starbucks asks me to buy their coffee.
They don't tell me to buy their coffee.

971
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:25,664
If I.
If I decided I don't want to buy 

972
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:29,270
starbucks coffee,
nothing bad happens to me at all,

973
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:31,670
but if I decide I don't want to pay for 
Obama care,

974
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,190
if I was a US citizen living in the 
United States,

975
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,960
I would go to jail for not doing it.
If I think health insurance to obamacare

976
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,040
is a good idea,
I'll pay for it myself.

977
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:40,874
I don't need to be forced at the point 
of a gun or with the threat of being 

978
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:45,740
sent to jail to,
to participate in that sort of thing and

979
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:46,574
that's what governments are.
The very definition of government is a 

980
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,124
monopoly on the use of force and they're
forcing people to do things against 

981
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,024
their will and if you think forcing 
peaceful people to do things against 

982
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:56,210
their will is a bad thing.

983
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,703
You should be opposed to the state and I
don't know what the end effect of the 

984
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,170
invention of cryptocurrencies will be on
governments,

985
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,900
but I'm sure it will vastly,
vastly,

986
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:09,860
vastly limit their power and that's a 
great thing for all of humankind.

987
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,753
It liberates the individual and it 
speeds up the rate of economic growth 

988
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:14,024
for the world.
Like maybe there's some scary things 

989
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:17,900
that'll happen,
but the benefits far,

990
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:20,090
far,
far outweigh the drawbacks.

991
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,280
I suspect that some people are probably 
watching this going,

992
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,111
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

993
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:24,944
This guy is just trying to talk a bit 
bitcoin because he probably owns a lot 

994
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,840
of bitcoin and he'll talk it up,
talk it up,

995
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:30,890
talk it up,
get it going,

996
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:31,724
and then when he feels it's hit its peak
or when he wants to cash out cash out 

997
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:38,670
and then that's that.
So there is some truth.

998
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,503
I own a lot of bitcoin and bitcoin cash 
becomes really successful over the 

999
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:43,620
world.
All make a lot of money.

1000
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:46,850
I've already made a lot of money,
but I've already donated millions to,

1001
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,703
to charity.
I donated several hundred thousand 

1002
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:52,830
dollars to help Ross Ulbricht,
um,

1003
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,610
get his appeal going and hopefully get 
out of prison for those that don't know,

1004
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,100
Ross Ulbricht is the person that was,
uh,

1005
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,173
convicted of creating the Silk Road,
which was the first online anonymous 

1006
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:04,344
marketplace in which people could buy 
and sell anything that sole purpose 

1007
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,170
wasn't to harm other people.
And uh,

1008
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:13,680
that guy for creating a website now has 
a double life sentence,

1009
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:16,050
plus 40 years.
He didn't kill a single person.

1010
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,243
He built a website and now the 
government sent them to jail for two 

1011
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,424
life sentences plus 40 years.
So his mom would make a fantastic guest 

1012
00:45:23,551 --> 00:45:27,600
on your show in the future.
She's an incredibly wonderful woman.

1013
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,680
And can you imagine,
you know,

1014
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,514
if you have kids,
imagine your son got sent to jail and 

1015
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:32,784
he's gonna die in prison for having 
built a website that allows people to 

1016
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:36,930
buy and sell things.
Mainly Pot,

1017
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,550
is that what it was?
What I was going to say?

1018
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:39,384
What would it be?
Mainly drugs is what people were using 

1019
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:42,210
it for and if you think about it,
what are drugs?

1020
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:43,044
Drugs are things that make people feel 
happy and there's a bunch of alcohol on 

1021
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,850
the shelf behind me.
Why is that drug okay.

1022
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,740
Pots,
okay in California,

1023
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:50,574
but in the neighboring state,
it's not like because a bunch of people 

1024
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:56,700
that you and I have never met got 
together and wrote down words on a piece

1025
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:58,860
of paper and then call those words a 
law.

1026
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,953
Writing down words on a piece of paper 
and calling you a lot doesn't alter 

1027
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:03,990
morality either.

1028
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,823
It's perfectly moral for me to smoke pot
or drink alcohol or smoke crack or it's 

1029
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:10,860
not.
And the politicians getting together and

1030
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:11,694
writing down words on a piece of paper,
calling it a law doesn't alter morality 

1031
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:15,414
in any way whatsoever.
And so this poor young man is going to 

1032
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:21,690
die in prison unless he somehow gets an 
appeal or it gets out,

1033
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,480
um,
for making a website that allowed people

1034
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,340
to buy and sell these things that make 
them feel happy.

1035
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:27,174
I,
for anybody who's drank some alcohol or 

1036
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,710
smoke some pot before they do it because
it makes them feel happy.

1037
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,200
It makes their,
improves people's lives.

1038
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:35,034
And Yeah,
some people get out of hand and get 

1039
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,860
addicted and do bad things.
But,

1040
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,360
uh,
that's life.

1041
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:40,530
You know,
people die all the time.

1042
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,800
Some people eat greasy hamburgers and 
get obese and die of a heart attack.

1043
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,340
It's their life to do it with.
It's not the politicians lives.

1044
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,253
Yeah.
So you mentioned a second ago that you 

1045
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:54,441
were a citizen of the United States.
You actually renounce your citizenship.

1046
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,800
About what?
About five years ago?

1047
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,930
Two thousand and 14.
May Fourth,

1048
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,280
I'm sorry,
February fourth.

1049
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,680
Uh,
it's one of the crowning achievements of

1050
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:02,460
my life.
I had.

1051
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,140
My only regret is that I didn't do it 
sooner.

1052
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,660
Okay.
So you are a citizen of Japan.

1053
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,451
So I,
I'm,

1054
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:08,284
I'm not a citizen of Japan either.
I'm actually a citizen of a wonderful 

1055
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:12,210
country in the Caribbean called Saint 
Kitts,

1056
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,050
which is probably a country nobody's 
ever heard of because there's only about

1057
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:18,000
45,000
people in the entire country.

1058
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,570
So wait,
first,

1059
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,423
why did I think it was Japan?
Is that I've been living in Japan for 

1060
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,310
over a decade.
Japan's my main home base.

1061
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,590
Japan is a wonderful country.

1062
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,423
Anybody who hasn't visited there,
you were in for a real treat if you go 

1063
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,910
and visit Japan at some point.
Yeah.

1064
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,250
So,
so what caused this decision a couple of

1065
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:34,260
years back and why?
St?

1066
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,201
Kit?
Well,

1067
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:38,500
um,
when I first got out of federal prison,

1068
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,453
I felt I had been treated incredibly 
unfairly by the United States 

1069
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:42,484
government.
For people that are interested in the 

1070
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:44,524
details.
We can talk about it or Roger really 

1071
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,130
shooting maybe real quick.
We should just hit on that.

1072
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:48,964
So why were you in prison?
Yeah,

1073
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,350
sure.
So the short summaries,

1074
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,184
I read all these economic books and I 
got really excited about the power of 

1075
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:56,530
economic freedom to make the world a 
better place.

1076
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,490
And so I thought the best way to tell 
more people about the wonderful benefits

1077
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:01,324
of economic freedom was to run for 
California state assembly as a 

1078
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:05,830
libertarian candidate.
So in the year 2000,

1079
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:07,630
I ran for state assembly as a 
libertarian.

1080
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:08,893
I got to have a debate against the 
Republican and Democratic candidates at 

1081
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:11,854
San Jose State University.
And in that debate I called the ATF and 

1082
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:15,694
FBI a bunch of jackbooted thugs and 
murderers and reference to all the 

1083
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,430
children that they burned to death in a 
church in Waco,

1084
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,160
Texas in I think 1994,
I believe it was.

1085
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:25,803
And uh,
maybe their parents were religious nuts 

1086
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:28,954
and really believed in all sorts of 
magic skype people in Jesus this and 

1087
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:32,164
Jesus that

1088
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,290
even if their parents were religious 
nuts burning to death,

1089
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:42,220
all the kids doesn't help them.
You murdered a bunch of kids.

1090
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:43,054
So if you're somebody that goes and 
burst at the bunch of kids in a church 

1091
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,320
because their parents are religious 
nuts,

1092
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,670
you're not a good person.
So I called the ATF and FBI agents,

1093
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:52,504
a bunch of jackbooted thugs and 
murderers in reference to what they did 

1094
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,510
in Waco,
Texas back then.

1095
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,243
I still think there are a bunch of 
jackbooted thugs and murderers for what 

1096
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,820
they did there.
And not just that,

1097
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,230
there's plenty of examples,
but

1098
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,900
it turned out there were some plain 
clothed atf agents and the audience,

1099
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:11,280
and at that point I was torn to your 21 
years old somewhere in that ballpark and

1100
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:15,270
I had already had some success in 
business and they really didn't like the

1101
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:16,104
things that this young man was saying as
they started looking into me and 

1102
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:19,651
figuring out,
well,

1103
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:21,540
how can we prosecute this guy?
And so at the time,

1104
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,403
uh,
I was telling computer components on 

1105
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:26,670
Ebay and I was also selling a product 
called a pest control report,

1106
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:29,370
2000 on Ebay,
which is basically a firecracker used by

1107
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:31,570
farmers to scare birds,
other cornfield.

1108
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,650
And today that sounds a bit crazy to 
sell firecrackers on Ebay.

1109
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:35,723
This was in 1999 or so.
This was back when he had a guns and 

1110
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,250
ammo section.
You could buy ar,

1111
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,950
fifteens and shotguns and ammunition,
and they had a fireworks section and it,

1112
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,220
it wasn't a big deal to be selling those
sorts of things,

1113
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,290
so I was selling them on Ebay,
uh,

1114
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,510
for those that are familiar Kybella 
sporting goods catalog,

1115
00:49:51,511 --> 00:49:55,020
but they were selling the exact same 
product in their catalog.

1116
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,880
Anybody could order them,
they'd ship them to you in the mail.

1117
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,120
This was before nine slash 11,
so it wasn't a big deal back then.

1118
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,293
Uh,
I wound up being the only person in the 

1119
00:50:02,511 --> 00:50:05,130
entire nation to be prosecuted for 
selling those without a permit.

1120
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,470
Even while I was in prison to other 
companies,

1121
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,720
we're still selling the exact same 
product without a permit.

1122
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:10,943
Eventually the manufacturing,
the other resellers were all asked to 

1123
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:15,360
stop selling them.
None of them went to prison and them had

1124
00:50:15,361 --> 00:50:17,460
to pay a fine.
None of them had any problem whatsoever.

1125
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,563
I was the only person in the entire 
nation to go to prison or have any 

1126
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:23,700
problem for selling them.
So I did 10 months in federal prison,

1127
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:24,863
had three months of a federal probation.
The day I was allowed to leave the 

1128
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:28,850
country,
I left the country,

1129
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,790
I looked into announcing my citizenship 
at that time.

1130
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,623
Unfortunately it's very expensive to get
citizenship somewhere else and it's 

1131
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,823
extra difficult if you're a felon in the
United States to get citizenship 

1132
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:41,300
somewhere else.
So I looked into it at the time,

1133
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,820
so a lot of money,
a lot of work.

1134
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:47,270
Didn't have as much money then.
So I decided to,

1135
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:50,200
I guess it's good enough to just live 
outside of the US.

1136
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,720
Needed to pick a country.
Wasn't sure where to go.

1137
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,180
Um,
I had had one Japanese girlfriend before

1138
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,920
in the United States and it was a good 
experience.

1139
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:58,754
So,
uh,

1140
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,860
I figured there were more to be had in 
Japan,

1141
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:01,610
but,
uh,

1142
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,443
if I had had a Russian girlfriend,
I would have wound up in Russia for 

1143
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,510
Brazilian.
It would have been Brazil.

1144
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:07,430
It was just kind of by chance there was 
Japan,

1145
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,670
but Harry m more than a decade later and
a very settled in and,

1146
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,440
you know,
speak fluent Japanese at this point.

1147
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:14,470
I can give your next interview in 
Japanese if you'd like.

1148
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,193
But why say kitts though?
It ultimately was saying is one of the 

1149
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:20,894
few countries in the world where you can
get citizenship very quickly by 

1150
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,483
investing in real estate.
So I bought some real estate in St 

1151
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,340
Kitts,
visited the island in person.

1152
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,550
Like I love St Kate's St Kitts is a 
gorgeous place,

1153
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:34,430
like the low all years,
maybe 72 degrees and the highest,

1154
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:36,230
maybe 80,
85 degrees.

1155
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:38,390
Not very humid,
wonderful weather all year round.

1156
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:39,224
So I've been spending every single 
winter there that I think this winter 

1157
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:43,400
will be by like fourth or fifth year.
They're like,

1158
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,290
uh,
I'm headed there after La.

1159
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,000
So it's a great place.
And uh,

1160
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,613
you know,
go on a.

1161
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,720
If you're looking for a holiday place,
go to St Kitts.

1162
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:51,554
I really recommended it.
And now you're on that board of tourism 

1163
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:54,080
there too,
apparently.

1164
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:57,030
I'm happy to come and say hello.
It's a small place in Saint Kitts.

1165
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,473
Um,
what now I can obviously understand now 

1166
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,900
after hearing your story,
which I had read about,

1167
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:03,883
obviously beforehand,
I can understand your frustrations of 

1168
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,344
course with the government and all sorts
of things and that they singled out one 

1169
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,420
person who all that.
Um,

1170
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,930
what was it like actually that moment 
when you would,

1171
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,520
I assume you have to sign a couple of 
documents and what are you doing?

1172
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,510
You slap a guy high five at the end or 
like what,

1173
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,530
what was that actual moment?
That's a great story too.

1174
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:25,040
So I had to go to the US embassy in 
Barbados and uh,

1175
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,810
I can't remember the name of the clerk 
there,

1176
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:27,644
but if he happens to see the interview,
I thank you for being such a good sport 

1177
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:31,700
and having a good sense of humor with 
all this.

1178
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,250
So I went up to the and you have to have
an interview,

1179
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,650
um,
in order to renounce your citizenship.

1180
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,920
And one thing that really surprised me 
and I didn't know this,

1181
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:42,350
is you're not telling them that you want
to stop being an American.

1182
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,530
You're asking for their permission to 
stop being an American.

1183
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,510
And I asked the guy at the window,
I said,

1184
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:51,020
have you ever seen somebody be denied 
the ability to stop being an American?

1185
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:51,531
And said,
Oh yeah,

1186
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:53,540
it happens all the time.
Really,

1187
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,403
really was stunning to me.
I would have thought that if you don't 

1188
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:59,060
want to be an American anymore,
it should be up to you.

1189
00:52:59,061 --> 00:52:59,894
But no,
our masters in Washington DC decide if 

1190
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,490
they're going to allow you to stop being
an American.

1191
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:05,690
But uh,
this,

1192
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:09,860
this clerk at the window when I came up 
and I gave my bundle of paperwork,

1193
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,590
there was a fee.
The fee is even higher now.

1194
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:13,101
Now.
The fees,

1195
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:16,520
2000 something dollars.
When I announced I think it was $440.

1196
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,691
And he asked me,
he said,

1197
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:19,870
do you want to pay with cash,
credit card or bitcoin?

1198
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,520
And I had the same look on my face that 
you just did not.

1199
00:53:23,521 --> 00:53:25,070
I said what?
I said,

1200
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,973
how,
how would you know that I would be 

1201
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:28,460
interested in paying in Bitcoin?
He said,

1202
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:29,600
oh,
we know all about you.

1203
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,510
We've,
we've googled you.

1204
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:31,344
And I said,
well,

1205
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,840
can actually pay him.
Because it was.

1206
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:33,674
No,
I was just kidding.

1207
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,870
So,
so basically you had to fill out,

1208
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,190
they knew you were coming,
right?

1209
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:39,990
You need an appointment.
Okay,

1210
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:41,820
fine.
So he was just messing with you,

1211
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:45,000
kind of.
He had a good sense of humor and then,

1212
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:46,890
uh,
so you have the initial,

1213
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,140
uh,
interview and he,

1214
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:50,580
ca he cautions you.
He says,

1215
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:51,720
uh,
he warns you.

1216
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,330
He says,
and you know,

1217
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,940
I think the draft is the moral 
equivalent of kidnapping and slavery and

1218
00:53:57,941 --> 00:53:59,010
war mass murder.

1219
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,080
I think taxation is theft,
you know,

1220
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:02,640
I have,
I'm a voluntary,

1221
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:03,510
just,
I don't believe in,

1222
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,740
you know,
in government.

1223
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,150
And he told me,
I said,

1224
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:08,820
I have to caution you,
if you stopped being a US citizen,

1225
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,240
you won't be allowed to serve in the 
armed forces.

1226
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,990
I thought I'm probably okay with that.
I have to warn you that,

1227
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,720
uh,
and so I've been a felon for,

1228
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,100
you know,
15 years now,

1229
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:22,950
something more than 15 years.
So as a felon you're not even allowed to

1230
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:24,540
vote anyhow.
And I philosophically,

1231
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,250
I'm not really interested in voting at 
this point.

1232
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,830
And even back then,
I wasn't really interested in voting,

1233
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,391
but he told me,
he said,

1234
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:34,410
if you renounce your US citizenship,
you won't be allowed to vote,

1235
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,770
man.
He was just throwing you all the eggs.

1236
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,040
And then another one.
So,

1237
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:38,791
you know,
at the time,

1238
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,090
I don't know,
I was 34,

1239
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:43,260
I think he said if you were announced 
your US citizenship,

1240
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,140
you won't be allowed to collect social 
security.

1241
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,973
And I'm pretty sure that's not going to 
be around by the time I'm old enough to 

1242
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:50,444
retire also.
So this was like a real breakup 

1243
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:52,560
situation.
They were,

1244
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:53,394
they were pulling out all the stops and 
he has his script that he has to cost 

1245
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,480
me.
And I think there might've been one more

1246
00:54:57,481 --> 00:54:57,911
thing,
but all,

1247
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,180
all of those were like,
instead of like,

1248
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:01,530
oh my God,
what was I thinking?

1249
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,490
It was like,
Hooray,

1250
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:06,840
I can't wait to be free of social 
security and all of this stuff.

1251
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:07,674
So,
uh,

1252
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,090
and so,
uh,

1253
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,873
it's,
it's not a decision that people take 

1254
00:55:11,881 --> 00:55:13,230
lightly either.
It's a big,

1255
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,550
big,
big step in life.

1256
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:15,300
But,
uh,

1257
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,370
they make you have a one week cooling 
off period.

1258
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:18,204
So he cautioned me of all those things 
and then I had to hang around for 

1259
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:22,640
another week on the island where I don't
know anybody.

1260
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,620
Then went back a week later and signed 
the paperwork and this and that.

1261
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,790
And uh,
I was free.

1262
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,980
So that's it.
Yeah.

1263
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,180
That's it.
And you did it.

1264
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:32,820
So now you're a felon without US 
citizenship.

1265
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,830
Yeah.
And so every single time I come into the

1266
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,710
country now I get sent to the secondary 
inspection and one,

1267
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,190
there was another guy a because it on 
your.

1268
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,551
Well,
no,

1269
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:42,384
you don't have a passport anyway,
but is there something on your passport 

1270
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,580
get flagged in the US system as you 
know,

1271
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,414
watch out for this guy.
And so another interesting thing like 

1272
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,670
anybody who's met me,
I'm a pretty white collar kind of guy,

1273
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:57,783
um,
but since my actual charges dealing 

1274
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,933
explosives without a license and it's 
worth pointing out that the crime isn't 

1275
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:05,520
dealing with explosives to crime is 
doing it without the license,

1276
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,363
without permission slip.
But that's automatically considered to 

1277
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,760
be a violent felony.
So I,

1278
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,840
not only am I a felon,
I'm a violent felon as well.

1279
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:13,883
And so when I,
to have a buddy that would sell 

1280
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,840
firecrackers out of his basement in 
highschool now,

1281
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,720
pretty common when we were probably in,
you know,

1282
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:21,840
in the nineties in highschool,
I think so.

1283
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,043
Um,

1284
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,083
but,
uh,

1285
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,480
I get flagged on their computer and 
they're like,

1286
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:28,560
oh,
watch out for this case.

1287
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:29,403
They the me to the secondary inspection.
Sometimes they're real uptight about it 

1288
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,120
and they're watching me.
And then other times they're like,

1289
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,490
what do you do?
I said it's sold firecrackers and Ebay.

1290
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:37,324
And they're like,
oh,

1291
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,520
you're that guy,
that guy.

1292
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,533
But apparently they have some list of 
notes about being on their computer and 

1293
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:45,154
they have to read all the past notes 
about me and then write new notes about 

1294
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:51,430
the time that I'm coming into the list 
of notes they have to read about me gets

1295
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:53,620
longer every single time I come into the
country.

1296
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:57,670
So it's a bit of a burden guy.
It sounds like an episode of Seinfeld on

1297
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:59,450
crack or something.
Um,

1298
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,431
all right.
Well I think,

1299
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:01,990
I think we did a little bit of 
everything here.

1300
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,823
I wanted to do the one on one stuff,
which I know you've talked about many 

1301
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:07,990
times before and I wanted to get some of
your bio if you had to,

1302
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,853
just to wrap this whole thing up.
If you had to predict where this is all 

1303
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:12,990
going.
Obviously you're very hopeful for all of

1304
00:57:12,991 --> 00:57:13,571
this,
but you know,

1305
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:15,250
there is some upside down stuff.
I,

1306
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:17,000
you know,
we didn't even talk about the red.

1307
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:19,530
It's split and you know,
there's some people that are,

1308
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,403
you know,
you've got your haters and trolls and 

1309
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:23,230
all that.
I'll deal with them.

1310
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,960
Don't send them to me.
I'll deal with him.

1311
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:25,853
Fear not.
But if you had to give me like a 

1312
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,920
prediction of where you see all this 
over the next couple years,

1313
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:32,440
what do you think's going to happen?
So a couple of hundred years ago,

1314
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,960
if I told you there's going to be a 
separation of church and state,

1315
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,363
you would think I'm a nutcase and a 
heretic and I might get burnt at the 

1316
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:39,820
stake for saying such a thing.

1317
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,670
Um,
before the invention of Bitcoin,

1318
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:43,504
it would sound crazy to say that there's
going to be a separation of money in 

1319
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,504
state,
but now that doesn't sound so crazy 

1320
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:50,920
anymore and it's starting to happen 
right before our eyes.

1321
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,470
And I think within another couple of 
decades,

1322
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,060
all currencies are going to be at,
beyond the control of,

1323
00:57:57,061 --> 00:57:58,050
of governments.
People aren't,

1324
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,190
aren't going to be using dollars and 
euros and yen.

1325
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,033
They're going to be using bitcoin cash 
and ethereum and Minero and things like 

1326
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,451
that.
And,

1327
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,800
uh,
that's a wonderful,

1328
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,320
wonderful thing for,
for all of humankind.

1329
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:09,154
And uh,
just like a separation of church and 

1330
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:11,374
state was a great thing for all of human
kind of separation of money in state is 

1331
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:14,440
as well.
Yeah.

1332
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:15,161
Well,
I got to tell you,

1333
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:16,560
I thoroughly enjoy this.
I,

1334
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,340
you know,
I find I always learn a little something

1335
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,174
when I'm doing these,
but I think I learned a lot here and as 

1336
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:21,880
I said,
you know,

1337
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,350
these are ideas.

1338
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,183
The ideas that I try to put into this 
business that I built a business here 

1339
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,873
are the same ideas that I try to talk 
about it on the philosophical level and 

1340
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,880
now we've got to turn these two point 
five into into something major,

1341
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:36,790
so let's do it.
You're officially my business manager or

1342
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:37,624
something.
Now my digital cryptocurrency business 

1343
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:40,310
manager.
I buy that.

1344
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,143
I'll gladly do that and I'll help you 
set up a bitcoin cash donation address 

1345
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,464
on your website and I'm sure people 
would love to send you tips and bake on 

1346
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:46,931
cash.
There you go.

1347
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:48,550
Awesome.
But it was a pleasure talking to you and

1348
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:50,950

1350
