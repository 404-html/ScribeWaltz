1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,473
My goal this year with the show is to 
expand on even more topics we discussed 

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,970
as well as the people that we're talking
to.

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:09,804
Yes,
we absolutely hit our stride by calling 

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:14,900
out regressive bullshit and by 
addressing the regressives,

5
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:15,734
the tide is actually turning.
People are finally standing up to their 

6
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,854
insincere attacks and realizing that 
liberalism is about the rights of 

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,024
individuals before that of the group,
so if you truly believe in equality for 

8
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,200
women,
then you have to defend their individual

9
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:33,150
rights,
whether it's to wear what they want,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,273
drive a car or marry who they choose 
regardless of their religious or 

11
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,890
cultural background.
I said there was an awakening months ago

12
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,960
and it's pretty undeniable right now,
right?

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,300
That doesn't mean we can rest though.
If anything,

14
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,134
it means we have to dig in deeper and 
keep calling out regressive nonsense 

15
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,590
when we see it,
but as I've also said from day one,

16
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:55,740
I want this show to be a place for big 
ideas of all kinds.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,843
Over the course of the next few weeks,
I'm going to talk to people from hugely 

18
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,820
different walks of life,
conservative radio talk,

19
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:04,170
show host,
Larry Elder,

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,970
science writer and skeptic Michael 
Shermer and former leader of the English

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,110
Defense League,
Tommy Robinson,

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,183
just to name a few.
We're going to go big on topics ranging 

23
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,710
from the election to science to 
spirituality and more.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,260
We're kicking off the year with CNN.
Don Lemon.

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,123
Love him or hate him.
Don is one of the few people in 

26
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,450
mainstream media not afraid to say what 
he thinks,

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,320
and he often pays for it via criticism 
from both sides of the aisle.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,510
Not only does he host his own nightly 
show,

29
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:33,960
but he also reports on location from 
natural disasters,

30
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:34,794
cohosts electoral debates,
and as even forigin unlikely friendship 

31
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:41,970
with Glenn back along the way.
I know when we see these people on tv,

32
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:44,370
we have a way of thinking that they 
aren't even human,

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,363
that they're just robots or something,
but I can assure you from personal 

34
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,360
experience that with done what you see 
is what you get.

35
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,540
We can always mark mainstream media and 
we absolutely should.

36
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,374
Trust me,
I've made plenty of jokes at CNNS 

37
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,063
expense.
Just check my twitter feed at the same 

38
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,444
time.
We should acknowledge though that there 

39
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:02,274
are many journalists in the mainstream 
media trying to do good work while 

40
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,460
online media has changed the way we get 
the news.

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,294
I think one of the big lessons from 2015
is how online media could also be full 

42
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,304
of crap.
Just because something isn't mainstream 

43
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,420
doesn't mean it doesn't push a 
narrative,

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,690
distort facts or outright lie.
As 2016 begins.

45
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,450
Let's all continue to shed light on 
issues we care about.

46
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,284
Talk about difficult topics in an honest
way and see if we can make the 

47
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,930
conversations in our lives a little more
enlightened.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,553
All right.
My guest this week is the host of CNN 

49
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,910
tonight.
Self proclaimed king of twitter,

50
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,803
and one of the few guys in Cable News,
not afraid to tell you what he really 

51
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:43,680
thinks.
Don Lemon.

52
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,710
What's going on?
It's called CNN tonight with Don Lemon.

53
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,610
Okay.
Oh,

54
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,330
with Don Lemon.
With don limit.

55
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,980
How long did you have to fight to get 
that in there?

56
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,630
Not that I'm picky.
Listen,

57
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,000
it's everything is important.
It all matters.

58
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,440
Dave Rubin,
how are you?

59
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,423
I'm doing good.
It actually does all matter and it's 

60
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,644
funny that you say that because that I 
think that's a good place to start 

61
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,840
because you have been on this upward 
thing forever.

62
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,690
We've known each other for probably like
four or five years now.

63
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,800
And you did my old Sirius xm show a long
time ago and,

64
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,920
and you were,
you were subbing in for a lot of people.

65
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,920
You were jumping around show to show,
but you have your own gig now.

66
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,754
Pretty good,
right?

67
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,190
It is pretty good.
I mean,

68
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,820
it's weird because people will say 
you've been on this upward trajectory,

69
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:27,270
blah,
blah blah.

70
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,830
And it doesn't feel that way when you're
living it.

71
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,200
Right.
I'm still the same guy.

72
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm still feels the same.
And um,

73
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:33,780
so,
you know,

74
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,613
the struggle is real,
but it's great to be in prime time on a 

75
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,420
major network.
I mean,

76
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,800
you know,
you kind of,

77
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,570
it doesn't get any better than this.
A show with my name on it there.

78
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,823
I have no complaints and very.
I live every moment in gratitude right 

79
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:48,510
now.

80
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,380
Yeah.
So there's,

81
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,243
there's a lot of stuff I want it to have
the first show of the year with you 

82
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,030
because you're in the thick of it,
right?

83
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:57,330
Like every time I turn on the news and 
something's going down somewhere,

84
00:03:57,331 --> 00:04:00,630
they send you there or you're at the 
studio or you're interviewing somebody.

85
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,720
So I thought you'd be the perfect person
to sort of kick the year off with.

86
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:07,100
But let's get a little bit first.
It wasn't the day to day operations.

87
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:07,934
So you have your show at night.
What's going on in the world of Don 

88
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,933
Lemon all day long?

89
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,920
Well it depends on,
it depends on the day,

90
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,130
but I mean pretty much every night I'm 
on the air at 10:00

91
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,130
PM and every night between seven and 
eight I have a rundown meeting and every

92
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,063
single morning at 10:30
I have an editorial meeting and then 

93
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,670
sometimes up I try to do the network,
a editorial call at nine,

94
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,773
so it can be a very long day.
And then I do radio on some mornings at 

95
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,950
seven.
This is all eastern time?

96
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah,
about seven,

97
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,410
seven,
15 eastern time.

98
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,340
So it depends,
if it's a day I do radio,

99
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm up at 6:45,
7:00

100
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,143
and I'm giving an editorial and the time
during the morning show and then I try 

101
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,860
to read in from then and reads the 
papers are at my door and then uh,

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,630
I try to stay awake and if I do,
I do the 9:00

103
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,140
editorial call and then if I don't,
I wake up at 10:30

104
00:04:59,141 --> 00:04:59,974
for my shows,
editorial call and then I'll try to go 

105
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:02,500
back to sleep.

106
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,333
But then sometimes other shows will call
and ask me to do live shots to do 

107
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:10,030
something I cover the night before I'm 
going to cover the that night or I'll do

108
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,210
an interview with Donald Trump or are 
coming to a taping like I did today with

109
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:15,490
Rand Paul.
It just really depends.

110
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,730
So there's no set schedule.
So sometimes I get to sleep.

111
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,370
Other times I don't.
And um,

112
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,530
that's it.
And so usually usually I'm here,

113
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,840
I try to be,
unless I don't have any sleep,

114
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,810
the latest I'll get and it's probably 
like six or 6:30.

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,270
But usually I try to get in about four,
4:30.

116
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
And you're taking,
you're taking naps in the.

117
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,840
That is your office right there.
I saw you at Lsu blanket.

118
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:36,890
So you do take naps.

119
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,610
Ouch.
Just before,

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,370
uh,
you just before we hooked up on skype.

121
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,620
Yeah,
we connected on skype.

122
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,000
Be careful,
be careful

123
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,720
out and buy a,
you know crystal,

124
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:51,740
right?
I do,

125
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,270
yeah.
Crystal came in and said,

126
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,104
hey,
what are you doing?

127
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,123
Don't go to sleep.
You've got to skype with Dave Rubin and 

128
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,680
15.
I'm like,

129
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,010
I know,

130
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,150
I know Dave.
And he'll be fine.

131
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,190
He'll be fine.
So it's funny even the way that you,

132
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,024
you started saying hook up there and 
then you immediately have to hedge your 

133
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,374
bets because you're one of these people.
And I want to talk about this a little 

134
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:08,654
later on that everything that you say 
becomes like this sort of hot button 

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,700
thing.
Uh,

136
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,130
but before we,
before we delve into all that stuff,

137
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,213
um,
how much news do you actually have to 

138
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,084
consume every day?
Because I know I do an interview show 

139
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,370
once a week,
but I'm in the news constantly.

140
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,204
I'm always paying attention to this 
stuff and on twitter and during this 

141
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,414
whole thing,
and there's a certain amount of 

142
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,884
bandwidth I think,
that you only have in your brain to 

143
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,284
absorb all this stuff,
but you have to know sort of all the 

144
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,550
stuff that's going on all the time.

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,440
That's a very good point.
Um,

146
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,300
and sometimes I,
can,

147
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,030
I,
can,

148
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,130
I consume so much that I forget,
right?

149
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,851
Like,
Oh yeah,

150
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,620
I knew that.
Like someone will say something and then

151
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,051
I'll go,
oh yeah,

152
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:46,551
yeah,
that's right.

153
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,384
I knew like,
like today I was sent out a note on 

154
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,120
Wayne Lapierre's flip flop on background
checks.

155
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,983
Yeah.
Then someone else reminded me that we 

156
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,660
did it before and I'm like,
Oh yeah,

157
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,980
that's right.
We did do that before.

158
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,310
And then I looked at why he did it.
So there's a,

159
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,203
you know,
he has a perfectly legitimate 

160
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:06,080
explanation in his head why he did it.
But sometimes you just forget.

161
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,280
So,
um,

162
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,760
what I try to do quite honestly is not 
to,

163
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,953
um,
I try to be informed without being 

164
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:14,984
inundated because you don't have to know
every single thing that's going on in 

165
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,270
the world and I don't.

166
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,090
My show doesn't cover every single thing
that's going on in the world.

167
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:27,160
I don't do a traditional rundown new 
show like stack,

168
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,160
like now this,
now this,

169
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:28,994
now this is pretty much a theme and it 
is the biggest story of the day or the 

170
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,483
hottest topic or the talker of the day.
And usually we try not to do too many 

171
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,710
subjects are we try to make them all 
relate and we don't do a lot of stars.

172
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,470
Like traditionally,
you know,

173
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,120
when peers was here and when Larry was 
here,

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,193
the hours that I'm in now or like very 
star heavy and focused and they didn't 

175
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,460
do very well.
And so we do watercooler talk,

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,450
provocative conversation,
have conversations that people will have

177
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,070
at home but not necessarily on 
television.

178
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,083
And it's paid off.
And thank goodness our ratings are 

179
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,320
great.
We're doing great and you know,

180
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,070
we're still going.

181
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,903
Yeah.
How much of that comes directly from 

182
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,310
you?
Because I remember when,

183
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,770
when you did my show way back when,
whatever that was,

184
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:13,604
four or five years ago,
I think that same week that we met you 

185
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,874
had subbed in for joy Bihar over on Hln 
and I remember we were having a drink 

186
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,434
and you were saying how much you like 
that because it gave you a chance to 

187
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:28,050
sort of be yourself and get out of the 
kind of traditional newsman thing.

188
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,680
So are all these decisions in terms of 
the format and all that,

189
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,870
is that all coming directly from you?
Well

190
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,283
shared.
A lot of it comes from me and a lot of 

191
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,460
it comes from the,
the team,

192
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,690
um,
our staff,

193
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:39,524
the producers and our executive producer
Jonathan Wall who's really great with 

194
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:45,110
ideas.
And then I'll have ideas as well.

195
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,800
It depends on the day.
Sometimes like now you know,

196
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,053
it's a no brainer.
The president is having this big town 

197
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,260
hall with Anderson this week.
He made,

198
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:56,940
he did the Senate at the house.
We're going to talk about guns,

199
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,133
right?
We're going to talk about a executive 

200
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,660
orders.
Uh,

201
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,530
and,
and so it's pretty easy.

202
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:06,300
We're going to talk about what's 
happening in Oregon,

203
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,120
so sometimes it's just pretty self 
explanatory.

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,100
It's our show.
It's great to finally have a show,

205
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,380
uh,
and that I don't have to call a newscast

206
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,920
because it's not a newscast,
although when it needs to be,

207
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:23,190
we can quickly become a newscast that we
can give you.

208
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:27,630
I can give you the 32nd or 15 second 
elevator pitch between one floor,

209
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,480
biggest story of the day or biggest 
talkers.

210
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,000
Otherwise it does not fit.
I don't care if you're a movie star,

211
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,040
I don't care who you are,
if it's not,

212
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,080
if it has nothing to do with the news 
that it's not relevant,

213
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,180
it's not coming on the show.
That simple.

214
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,163
Alright.
So before we get into all the meat and 

215
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,860
we're going to talk politics and guns 
and all that kind of stuff,

216
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,870
uh,
how did you get into this thing?

217
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,170
Did you always want to be on TV?
Did you always want to be a news guy?

218
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,660
What,
what brought little don lemon to be over

219
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,160
at Time Warner Center right now?

220
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,403
I was always curious as a kid and um,
when we would go out and about my 

221
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,430
parents,
I write about this in my book,

222
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:06,380
which is called transparent by the way 
that I would just talk to everybody and,

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,273
you know,
my mom would like come and grab me in 

224
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:09,860
the restaurant.
My Dad would always say,

225
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:10,694
don't teach them to be afraid of people.
And my mom said after that conversation 

226
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:16,010
she just let me go.
So I would just ask people like,

227
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,010
what are you here?
Are you on vacation when you're doing?

228
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,943
I've just always been curious.
I don't necessarily think that I wanted 

229
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:24,140
to be on television,
although I liked it.

230
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,243
Um,
I always wanted to be a journalist and 

231
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,473
you know,
people remind me when I go home for 

232
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,960
holidays or just to visit my family that
you remember even in college,

233
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:33,794
used to bring the camera to school.
Remember we taped this fake show when 

234
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,374
you were a kid.
You remember you used to carry this 

235
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:39,500
camera around and then a or do you 
remember?

236
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:43,280
We had you anchor our high school and so
I forgot a lot of those things.

237
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,380
And so it's always been there.
Yeah.

238
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,810
So let's talk about the gay thing for 
justice.

239
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:50,430
Sick,
because I don't think we had about you.

240
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,130
Let's talk about your gay thing for a 
second.

241
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,150
We can talk about mine too if you want.
Um,

242
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,990
there's so much I can go because let me 
see that hand.

243
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,950
Raise your left hand.
Oh yeah.

244
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,860
I got one of these.
Wow.

245
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,030
I got one of these.
Yeah.

246
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,590
But that's okay.
Go ahead.

247
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,650
You can get one too.
Didn't you just say,

248
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,410
I think if I'm not mistaken,
just on air.

249
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,340
A couple of days ago you said to 
somebody,

250
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:12,174
why would you get married?
Didn't you say that to Brook or 

251
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,150
somebody?

252
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,270
Oh,
there's somebody in the crowd.

253
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:18,930
Why would you get married?
I just think that I don't want to create

254
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:19,764
another controversy.
I don't see the need to run off and get 

255
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:23,424
married right away or ever.
And I don't know if I'm the marrying 

256
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:26,390
kind.

257
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,360
Yeah.
That said,

258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,580
listen,
my whole thing,

259
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:29,960
and I'm pretty sure you'll agree with me
on this,

260
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:30,794
is that we should just have the right.
The same rate that everybody else has 

261
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,450
this.
Yeah.

262
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,640
If you want to do it,
do it.

263
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:35,780
If you don't want to do it,
don't do it.

264
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,790
Like that's it.
But that's why I don't even want to talk

265
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,624
about the gay thing much.
So we could literally do just a minute 

266
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:40,964
on this,
but I know I'm just messing with you 

267
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:42,950
because we know each other.
No,

268
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,521
no,
I know,

269
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:46,010
but like to me like,
and we've talked about this privately,

270
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,080
but like it's exhausting talking about 
the gay thing.

271
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,943
Gay people shouldn't have to think about
it any more than straight people should 

272
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,350
have to think about their sexuality or 
of that.

273
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,184
But anyway,
you basically came out when your book 

274
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,210
came out,
so it was about four years ago,

275
00:11:58,211 --> 00:11:59,044
is that right?

276
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,510
Okay.
Most professionally,

277
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,890
yeah,
it was 2011.

278
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,900
It was funny because I was talking to a 
friend in Chicago,

279
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,960
which was before I came to work at CNN 
and he said,

280
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,360
he goes,
I know people were saying don lemon came

281
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,440
out and he's like,
what do you mean?

282
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,570
Downloading came out dot limon has 
always been out.

283
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,810
So,
you know,

284
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,693
since I've been out since my twenties,
but it wasn't something that I talked 

285
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:17,814
about on the air or shared publicly,
but my bosses knew I would bring my 

286
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:24,540
boyfriends to the Christmas party.
I mean it wasn't a big deal,

287
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,733
but the public didn't know.
I would host events for like gay events 

288
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:33,060
in Chicago and now basically out.
So when people say,

289
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,890
you know,
it took you 45 years to come out,

290
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,311
I'm like,
well,

291
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:38,520
not really.
I think I had to do it because there was

292
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:41,090
so much confusion.
And when you're in the public eye,

293
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,010
I think it's important that you say,
uh,

294
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:46,590
at least when I came out that you sort 
of,

295
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,763
you had to make a declaration because 
it's important for young people who are 

296
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,660
at home,
people who may be struggling,

297
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,390
people who may have doubt.
And I want people to know like,

298
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:57,210
Hey,
you can be a gay person and you can host

299
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,280
a show on CNN.
And it is okay.

300
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,480
Yeah.
So that's the part that I wanted to talk

301
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,290
about because this is exactly what we 
talked about four years ago,

302
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,920
that there was so much going on with gay
rights.

303
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,510
There was so much happening at the 
moment and in a way as a public person,

304
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:17,950
it's sort of like this extra pressure of
if I'm going to talk about this on air,

305
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,770
I have to be authentic about it.
Right?

306
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,310
Like,
how much of that did you actually really

307
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,144
feel?

308
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,010
Well,
I,

309
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,280
no one forced me.
I started writing a book about,

310
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,173
you know,
sort of my exploits as a journalist and 

311
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:32,130
writing about my childhood and how I 
grew up and whatever.

312
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:32,964
And I just thought it would be 
disingenuous to write a book like that 

313
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,020
and not included.
So it's like,

314
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,863
you know,
telling everything about your life 

315
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,990
except for that,
you know,

316
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,790
one important thing.
That one,

317
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,210
that one thing that is really important,
it's not all of who I am.

318
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,570
Um,
but it is an important part of my life.

319
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,433
And I think it's important again,
for other people to be able to see 

320
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:53,970
someone like me or like a Dave Rubin 
who,

321
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,270
who people who are successful and who 
just happened to be gay.

322
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,800
So yeah,
there was a lot of pressure on it,

323
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,110
on me and there was a lot of pressure 
to,

324
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:02,910
as a person of color to come out.

325
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,170
Yeah.
Isn't it cool how it's so irrelevant.

326
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,004
I mean,
that's even why I'm prefacing this by 

327
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,190
saying,
let's put two seconds.

328
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,250
Yeah.
He enlisted.

329
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,093
Let me tell you,
it's irrelevant to you and it's 

330
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,970
irrelevant to many people who live in 
big cities like you're in la now.

331
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:16,490
I'm in New York and when we met with you
in New York,

332
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,150
um,
so for us it's easy because there I am,

333
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,180
there is no space place where I am in 
the closet.

334
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,120
My entire team knows,
the audience knows,

335
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,280
my family knows people at the 
barbershop.

336
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,160
No.
Like I don't really care what you know,

337
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,290
bob at the barbershop thinks about me or
of,

338
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,320
of gay people.
I'm,

339
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,380
I am completely out.
And that is to a lot of people,

340
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,500
that's not reality.
And it's strange to certain people,

341
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:46,040
especially a certain demographics and 
certain ethnicities,

342
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,993
people aren't quite that out yet.
I think it's easier for you as a white 

343
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:50,924
man to be out.

344
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,800
Yeah.
Alright.

345
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:51,980
Well

346
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,461
we'll.
Okay.

347
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:53,294
So we'll,
we'll delve into some of the racial 

348
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:54,920
stuff.
So my,

349
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,753
my last thing on the gay thing is do you
think there is something about gay 

350
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:03,551
people in general that there are so many
out gay people in news right now?

351
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,204
I mean,
you take you and you take cheever and 

352
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:11,150
Anderson and Rachel Maddow and Thomas 
Robertson and you know,

353
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,740
there's a half out guy on Fox.
Even.

354
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,960
He may be out already.
I'm not sure.

355
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:15,794
I'm not even going to name them,
don't even have to smile or look at the 

356
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,630
caviar or whatever.
But my point is that for some reason,

357
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,000
you know Riley,
yeah,

358
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,180
he's definitely gay.
That guy.

359
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,014
I'll tell you no,
but my point that there's a lot of out 

360
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,793
people that people get there,
there's something comforting in a weird 

361
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:32,930
way or something about gay people.
It would be my aunt.

362
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,070
Anything there?
Yes.

363
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,540
There's something comforting about gay 
people.

364
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,550
We're loving people,
loving people,

365
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,830
but here's the thing,
I don't think,

366
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:40,664
Dave,
that those numbers are any different 

367
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,540
than any other profession.
I think that there have been some people

368
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:49,400
who are brave enough to step up in this 
profession because I feel that if you're

369
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,750
a journalist,
you take an oath.

370
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,450
I'm much like you do.
If you have a juris doctorate,

371
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,950
when you become an attorney,
have you haven't.

372
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,561
When you,
you know,

373
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:58,430
you take the medical oath when you 
become a doctor.

374
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,590
I think that journalists really feel 
that,

375
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,320
you know,
you have an obligation to inform people.

376
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,080
You have an obligation to tell the 
truth.

377
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
You have an obligation to be as unbiased
and objective as any human being can be.

378
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,310
So I think that when you're in this 
business,

379
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,130
in order to get the truth from people,
in order to be truthful,

380
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:20,420
you have to live who you are and if you 
can put different rules on,

381
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,180
uh,
other people that you put on yourself.

382
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,410
And so I think that maybe people are 
just more visible because it's a visible

383
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,760
medium obviously.
Um,

384
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,850
and I just think that we sort of take 
that oath,

385
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:34,310
but I don't,
I think there are plenty of gay doctors,

386
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,144
there are plenty of gay lawyers,
there are plenty of gay politicians as 

387
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:41,840
we have seen plenty of gay people in the
clergy and on and on and on.

388
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,340
I just,
I don't think it's any different.

389
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:45,140
I just think that we happen to be more 
visible.

390
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,350
For the record.
I have a friend who's a gay janitor,

391
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,900
so we are out.
We're in every occupation that they're.

392
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,030
Yeah,

393
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,490
I know gay athletes,
I know gay and everything.

394
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,100
So there you go.

395
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,500
Alright.
So that's it for the gay thing.

396
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:58,640
Forget about that.
Let's move on.

397
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,031
Let's.
All right,

398
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,470
so cable news,
you got to ring on your finger.

399
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:03,050
Stop it with me.
It's enough already.

400
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,150
Um,
so cable news,

401
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,000
what do you make of the general state of
Cable News?

402
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:12,470
Because it gets a lot of crap at,
you know,

403
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,543
from everybody all the time.
And I'm not talking about you 

404
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,094
specifically,
but in general you say cable news and 

405
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,820
people start freaking out,
right?

406
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,540
So what do you make of the general like 
sense of Cable News?

407
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,581
Well,
I think it's,

408
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:27,070
you know,
obviously it's an easy target,

409
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,930
right?
The media,

410
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:29,764
excuse me,
the media is always an easy target and 

411
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,780
so when you're in that easy target that 
happens to be on 24 hours a day,

412
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,920
you're going to be an even bigger 
target.

413
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,180
And when you're on and there is no 
script there,

414
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,014
you know,
then you're an even bigger target 

415
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:47,320
because we are human and sometimes many 
times,

416
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:51,360
most times there are no words in box to 
read when you're in cable.

417
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,970
Now if you're on broadcast,
it's a whole different story.

418
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,290
If you're doing an evening broadcast in 
national or local,

419
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,870
everything is scripted for you.
You read,

420
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,400
if you're doing a 30 minute newscast,
maybe you read at the most five to seven

421
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,110
minutes of copy,
right?

422
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,891
You're saying,
oh,

423
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:11,730
the big story out West was the flooding 
and Blah about Dave Rubin joins us,

424
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,930
uh,
with the latest Dave,

425
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:13,590
what do you know?

426
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,790
Boom.
And then that's it.

427
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,870
And then you go,
thank you dave.

428
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,590
And now let's talk about the president's
reform on gun control.

429
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,483
And you even talk like this,
it's a very specific answer for you and 

430
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:23,581
blah,
blah,

431
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:24,690
blah.
And all you're saying is thank you.

432
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:28,350
And the most that you'll say is 
incredible report,

433
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,180
Bob Blah.
That's it.

434
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,010
When your cable,
you're saying,

435
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,060
no,
listen,

436
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,890
that's not right.
The facts aren't there.

437
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:35,724
Hold on,
let me get my information where the 

438
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,900
president said back in such and such,
that's another.

439
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,380
People are screaming right now and 
you're like,

440
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:40,641
wait,
wait,

441
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,410
wait,
now you talk.

442
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:41,671
Wait,
wait.

443
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:44,850
Now you talk.
So there's a lot more room for error.

444
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,190
There's a lot more people talking back 
and forth.

445
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,580
It's a lot more interesting to watch.
So of course people are gonna,

446
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,830
you know,
we're going to be a target and sometimes

447
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,720
deservedly so.
Most of the time.

448
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,850
Not really because we're just,
we're just,

449
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,230
we just happen to be on television in 
very real moments a lot of the time.

450
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,190
Yeah.
So to that point,

451
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:05,650
how often,
because I right now in this very second,

452
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:08,590
I have an ifb in my ear just so that I 
can hear you,

453
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,570
because it's the nature of how we're 
doing skype.

454
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:11,920
I don't think you have one in,
right?

455
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:12,754
You're,
you're just doing the skype off the 

456
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:14,920
computer.
But one of the things,

457
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:15,940
yeah,
they're okay.

458
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:16,774
We have proof.
But one of the things I hear all the 

459
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,920
time,
and I think I probably thought this too,

460
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
is that when you're on Cable News,
you're on television in general.

461
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:27,370
There is someone in your rear always 
barking orders at you.

462
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,363
How,
how often is that actually true for you 

463
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:30,604
that,
that you're doing your broadcast and 

464
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,780
someone is actually telling you what to 
say.

465
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:36,100
And I'm not talking about the technical 
stuff.

466
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:37,570
Cut to commercial.
I mean,

467
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,463
you know,

468
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,170
sometimes people tell you what to say 
and so sometimes you're like,

469
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
Amen.
Thank you.

470
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,210
Sometimes people are correcting you.
Sometimes people are like,

471
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,420
they're your other ears are listening to
the guest.

472
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,680
And then someone will say,
well,

473
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,480
you know,
I'm a,

474
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:55,600
well,
it's gonna.

475
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,130
It's gonna Affect the fourth amendment.
And then so the producer will say,

476
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,930
the president never mentioned the fourth
amendment.

477
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:01,471
And you'll say,
hey,

478
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,090
listen to president ever mentioned the 
fourth amendment.

479
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,640
Or sometimes you'll say,
um,

480
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,410
uh,
it was uh,

481
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,423
an unalienable right.
And then the producer will say in 

482
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,281
Elliot,
right?

483
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:13,530
So just little things,
or,

484
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,380
um,
I always like to tell people that,

485
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,580
well,
this recent example is we go on the air,

486
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,340
everything is ready in the show,
you know,

487
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,570
the openness scripted,
right?

488
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,620
And it's like,
you know,

489
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:25,921
blah,
blah,

490
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,731
blah.
Donald trump.

491
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:28,110
Is that a rally in Iowa?

492
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,940
And we know this is CNN tonight.
I'm Don Lemon,

493
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,330
right?
And then all of a sudden that,

494
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,440
you know,
introduce now let's go to our panel.

495
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,910
Dave Ruben is here,
Ryan.

496
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,520
Liz is here and you know,
Kaylee Macanese here,

497
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,590
so panel.
And then someone will say,

498
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,330
stop.
And I'll go,

499
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,950
oh standby.
I'll say.

500
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,170
And then they'll roll the breaking news 
animation.

501
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,811
You're like,
oh,

502
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,040
okay.
And they'll go breaking news,

503
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,510
breaking news.
And they'll say,

504
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,583
uh,
there's been a plane that's been 

505
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,510
diverted.
You say there's been a plane that's been

506
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,160
diverted.
And then as you're talking they'll say,

507
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,270
okay,
now go with prompter.

508
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:01,360
And so all of this stuff you are talking
and then you look up and they say,

509
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,620
okay,
joining us on the phone.

510
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,310
And they'll say,
Bob Williams,

511
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:07,720
they'll say Bob Williams from Nebraska,
from Nebraska,

512
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,300
and so you know,
and sometimes you'll be in the middle of

513
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,490
a sentence and people will talk to you.
So it does happen.

514
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,430
People at home think you're stupid,
but actually you're not that stupid.

515
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:16,264
You're just like,

516
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,240
uh.
So that's it.

517
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,163
And that's why I wanted to ask you that 
because I think there's this sense out 

518
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:26,310
there that you're getting orders of what
you can and should say.

519
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,040
And what you're really saying is it's 
technical stuff.

520
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,874
It's stuff because we have a live 
program and maybe they're fact checking 

521
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:33,980
you,
but they're not being like,

522
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:34,814
Don,
you better tell him or say saving you 

523
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:37,671
buy.
Wait,

524
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,120
whoa.
Explain what you meant by that.

525
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,350
And you're like,
oh,

526
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,184
what I meant was

527
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,230
because someone might misconstrue it,
but it doesn't really.

528
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,123
Everything gets misconstrued and 
everything now gets taken out of 

529
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:48,844
context.

530
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,330
Like I can say,
okay Dave,

531
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,730
let's not talk about the gay thing.
Right?

532
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,500
And then.
So we'll just take that and say,

533
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,370
oh,
Don Lemon zest,

534
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:57,780
shamed of being gay.
And you're like,

535
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,680
no.
That was like a habit.

536
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,573
The sentence in an entire conversation 
that we had and then it builds upon 

537
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:04,474
itself and it keeps building.
It's like a wildfire and by the time it 

538
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:08,014
gets to the end it has absolutely 
nothing to do with what you said and 

539
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:12,610
then people believe it because of social
media.

540
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,880
It's really kind of ridiculous.
I want to explore that somehow.

541
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,610
Yeah,
I think she didn't investigate that.

542
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,653
Well.
It's something that we've been talking 

543
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:19,974
about here a lot because one of the 
things that I'm seeing all the time now 

544
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,750
and unfortunately I see this more on the
left,

545
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:25,584
is people being misquoted all the time 
and no matter what you say and so that 

546
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,040
it's a good segway actually because I 
think you,

547
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:36,120
in terms of the mainstream media people,
you're the victim of this all the time.

548
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,130
I mean,
every time I open up mediate,

549
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,170
Don Lemon says this,
Don Lemon,

550
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,004
this that,
or go back and look at the whole thing 

551
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,250
of what I said and you're like,
wait a minute.

552
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:45,084
That's not what happened at all dot.
I don't know if that kind of time to 

553
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:50,460
listen to the context.
What do you things to do?

554
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,680
But,
but that's exactly what your point is,

555
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:55,170
that they get you on the,
on the one liner,

556
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,580
they know that nobody's going to go back
and watch the two minutes before the two

557
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:01,020
minutes after.
So for you,

558
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:01,854
how,
how aware of that do you have to be and 

559
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,030
how much are you thinking the whole 
time?

560
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,893
Oh,
I better not go there even though it's 

561
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,340
what I really believe or it's what I 
want to say.

562
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,510
Well,
I'm aware a little bit,

563
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,690
but um,
I can't do that to myself.

564
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,524
I don't,
I don't want to censor myself that way 

565
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,310
because then you're not authentic.
And I think that,

566
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,560
you know,
whatever success I've achieved,

567
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,394
I think it's been through authenticity.
And so if I was worried about every 

568
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,590
single word and how it's going to be,
of course you want to be smart,

569
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:30,424
right?
And you want to be buttoned up in a 

570
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:35,230
certain way or have your facts straight.
I don't want to do that.

571
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,960
And so if you want to take me out of 
context and that's your business.

572
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,153
Um,
and I think for the most part smart 

573
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,240
people,
the viewers aren't dumb.

574
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,093
They,
they understand what's happening in the 

575
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:48,950
stuff that happens online,
especially like twitter and all those.

576
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,410
It doesn't usually translate to 
television.

577
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,244
It certainly doesn't translate into 
ratings and it doesn't translate into 

578
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,140
credibility.
So you know,

579
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,550
you just,
it's wonderful that I work for a network

580
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,600
and a boss who says constantly ignore 
the noise.

581
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,450
You guys are doing great.
The network is doing great.

582
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,300
Our story is great right now.
Continue the momentum,

583
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,190
be yourself,
be smart,

584
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,113
keep moving and don't even read.
It doesn't even matter if we tweet or 

585
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:19,100
not or we don't have to read it.
It's a,

586
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,963
it's amazing and wonderful.
We're in a great spot right now and 

587
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,570
seeing it so we don't worry about that.

588
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,080
Right.
It's kind of funny because on the social

589
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:26,070
media side,
you know,

590
00:24:26,071 --> 00:24:26,904
like I,
I could pick something like when you 

591
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:29,920
said that the black hole thing during 
the,

592
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:33,180
the plane thing and think you know,
you're on air for hours,

593
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,850
you're talking about all of this stuff.
You're just throwing out,

594
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,310
you know,
somebody said it could be a black hole,

595
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,850
like you weren't saying it's in a black 
hole or whatever it is.

596
00:24:41,851 --> 00:24:44,370
And then next thing you know don lemon 
is trending and all that.

597
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,680
So you really,
you really can just put it aside.

598
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,540
No,
I mean I can because we listened.

599
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,750
We,
I've talked about this ad Nauseum at the

600
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,583
New York Times.
Did a thing on it.

601
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,230
It's not,
it's not that you believe those things.

602
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,040
We had a thing called crazy conspiracy 
theories that people were sending to us.

603
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,903
Yeah.
So one of those was that it was a 

604
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,660
question from a viewer.
That's it.

605
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,523
I've read the question from a viewer and
that was the end of story and that took 

606
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,660
on a life of its own,
but so be it.

607
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:11,860
It may be famous,
but it's not.

608
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,813
It did not come from me.
That's [inaudible] positing that I'm 

609
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:15,371
saying,
Hey,

610
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:17,710
look this,
this is what viewers are saying.

611
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:18,544
They were also seeing.
It was in a hangar somewhere that we 

612
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,900
mentioned that there were also saying 
that it was a,

613
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:25,580
it was flown.
Someone else took it and hijack did.

614
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,000
There were a number of different things 
that were said about it,

615
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,100
all of which we talked about on social 
media.

616
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,110
That one just happened to get picked up.

617
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,741
Yeah.
You know,

618
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,290
at the top of the show,
I did a little piece on how I was saying

619
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,124
we need mainstream media,
but we also need online media because I 

620
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:39,424
do believe we need both for different 
reasons and different corporate 

621
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:42,900
interests and all that.
I think.

622
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,783
I think.
I think we look as the online guy and 

623
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,320
the and the mainstream guy.

624
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,670
We need more.
We need more honest online people.

625
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:54,750
We need online people,
online people who will actually do their

626
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:56,340
homework,
who will call,

627
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,174
who will not write an article off of 
someone else's article off of someone 

628
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,060
else's opinion of what someone else did 
online.

629
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:07,380
People who actually saw the entire 
segment in context to do their job,

630
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:10,200
not just like lazy people are lazy and 
they just go,

631
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:10,951
oh,
you know,

632
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:12,360
I'm such and such.
Whatever.

633
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,800
Yeah.
He said that and you're like,

634
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,980
no,
that's not so.

635
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:17,010
It's.
And it's Kinda hard for us,

636
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,113
for those of us who are in more 
traditional media to chase all of those 

637
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:21,840
things down and it's just not worth it.

638
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,451
Yeah.
I mean,

639
00:26:22,451 --> 00:26:23,920
you literally took the words out of my 
mouth.

640
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:27,580
That's exactly what I'm saying because I
think at some point there was the online

641
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:28,414
media,
dede was doing a lot of good stuff 

642
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:33,460
getting to stories that maybe hadn't 
bubbled up to you guys yet.

643
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,593
And yet somehow in the last year or two,
there's so many trashy sites that are 

644
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,340
just waiting for,
for not,

645
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,380
not just the,
you know,

646
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,214
the on air guys,
but for politicians to just find any 

647
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:45,684
little thing that they can say and run 
with that just so that they can get 

648
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,730
clicks and they're no longer doing a 
service either.

649
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,010
Well,
we call it click,

650
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,090
Click Bait.
We're at,

651
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,060
at the point in here at CNN where we 
realized that I'm clickbait.

652
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,880
Just say Don Lemon and people are going 
to click on it.

653
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,823
Yeah.
So they will say don lemon and then 

654
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:04,050
anything.
But um,

655
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,550
what I wanted to say is,
oh,

656
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,463
when you talk about online people,
so have you ever worked for a 

657
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,550
traditional network where you work for 
serious?

658
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,290
So that was,
I would imagine that's pretty.

659
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,303
Yeah,
that was corporate.

660
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,173
That was corporate is so rigorous here 
before I can say anything on the air as 

661
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:22,230
a fact or present something.
It's got to go through our fact checkers

662
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,180
is it has to go through standards and 
practices.

663
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,193
You know,
what our definition of what we're 

664
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,330
talking about,
the guys in Oregon,

665
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,480
what our definition of terrorism is,
all of those things,

666
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,533
um,
how we confirm things we had the other 

667
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,154
night when Natalie Cole died,
everyone was reporting Natalie Cole 

668
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,790
died,
but we couldn't get in touch with her,

669
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,820
her publicist,
the publicist was busy and every time we

670
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,230
call the phone was busy.
The email,

671
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:44,064
I guess we could not report that CNN 
would not report that until we heard 

672
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:51,750
from an official person online.
People don't have those,

673
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,970
you know,
they don't have to climb those hurdles.

674
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,360
And I think that's sad and missing 
because listen,

675
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,283
we don't have to be first,
we just want to be accurate and I wish 

676
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:01,694
like,
I wish the online people want it to be 

677
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:06,510
more accurate than first or funny or 
opinionated.

678
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,170
Yeah,
I totally hear you.

679
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,004
I,
I feel like I sort of exist in between 

680
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:13,810
those two worlds and I'm,
I'm just trying to do what you're saying

681
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:14,644
which is,
which is be honest and have honest 

682
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:16,774
conversations.
And even though I had one of these 

683
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,440
things in my ear and nobody's yelling,
what did they tell you?

684
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:21,510
No,
uh,

685
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,830
nothing they're saying doing it.
You're doing a hell of a job.

686
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,560
That's what they just said.
Um,

687
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,643
so,
so the other thing that I think is 

688
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:31,630
interesting about you is that you get 
heat from both sides.

689
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:33,310
And I'm not talking about when they 
misquote you,

690
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,290
now I'm talking about if you say 
something,

691
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,393
for example,
about black lives matter or you're 

692
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,220
taking a selfie right now.

693
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,520
I just wanted this for.
I'm going to do when I,

694
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,720
when I post online,
go ahead.

695
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,770
Nice.
So,

696
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:46,350
um,
that you get equal heat from both sides.

697
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,780
So if you take a black lives matter,
for example,

698
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,260
there's a certain amount of racist 
people who will look at you as a,

699
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,363
as a black man,
and they're going to just say racist 

700
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:55,734
shit,
that's just going to come no matter 

701
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:57,294
what.
And then there'll be people when you've 

702
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,390
said things that haven't been,
you know,

703
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,224
sort of in lock step with,
with the movement that'll say you're an 

704
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,364
uncle Tom.
And I'm only using that word because 

705
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:08,574
when I googled you,
it was one of the first words that came 

706
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:11,790
up,
uh,

707
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,920
that Don Lemon is a trademark.
That word.

708
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:14,760
But go ahead.
Yeah.

709
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:15,594
That don lemon is an uncle Tom.
But to me it seems like you're usually 

710
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:19,914
doing good stuff when people on both 
sides are attacking you and that's what 

711
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,150
you're getting all the time,
right?

712
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,800
Well,
yes.

713
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,070
And the thing that people.
Here's the thing that when I,

714
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,490
when we talk about double standards and 
expectations of people,

715
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,350
uh,
as a person of color,

716
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,823
well,
someone just to say someone not of 

717
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,154
color,
people don't expect you to be the 

718
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,830
spokesman for all white men,
right?

719
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,664
Are All,
thank God they don't even expect you to 

720
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,320
be the spokesman for gay people.
I got it.

721
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,400
Somehow.
There's this expectation of me to be the

722
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,580
spokesman for black people or gay people
and I neither what?

723
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,310
I'm the spokesman for his information 
and truth,

724
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,593
and so if black lives matter does 
something that is worthy of criticism 

725
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,963
than it is my job as a journalist to 
give that criticism because no movement 

726
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:05,584
is perfect.
Even the civil rights movement was a 

727
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,650
perfect and received that share of 
criticism.

728
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,723
So there's a black person in this 
position and the only one who is in 

729
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,150
prime time on a cable network.

730
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,800
When people see that coming from me,
they're like,

731
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,930
how dare he?
Well,

732
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,150
I'm not doing that.
I'm doing my job.

733
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,760
That is what I'm supposed to do.
So,

734
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,653
and if someone who is white sees me 
talking about black lives matter and in 

735
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,613
a way that's positive,
then of course I agree with them so you 

736
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:31,200
know I can't win.
And so the.

737
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:36,201
The point is not to be an advocate or 
someone who is an activist.

738
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,643
My point is to be a journalist.
The I get those races and they get this 

739
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,040
homophobia,
sexism,

740
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,800
but at the end of the day,
what I'm giving his information,

741
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,900
or if I say,
um,

742
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,040
you know,
uh,

743
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,420
I just received information that,
you know,

744
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,263
Michael,
that the cop in the Michael Brown case 

745
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:57,400
is not going to be indicted.
That word is going to come out.

746
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,293
People who want him to be indicted or 
going to get upset and call me an uncle 

747
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,280
Tom because it came out of my mouth.

748
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,010
And then 20 minutes later when the guy 
comes out and says,

749
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,050
there's no indictment,
no one goes,

750
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,890
oh,
he was right.

751
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,000
They just go,
oh,

752
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,100
he's covering that story.
I can't believe him,

753
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,480
you know?
So it's just,

754
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,093
it is what it is.
People take out their frustrations on 

755
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:19,450
the person who was in front of them and 
I haven't been that person.

756
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,583
And do you find that a lot of it,
it's odd that like with the uncle Tom 

757
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,130
stuff,
that,

758
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,870
that comes from people on the left that 
they would want you,

759
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,310
right?
The people on the left,

760
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:31,144
they should see you as an individual 
except what they're seeing or what 

761
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:34,744
they're complaining about is that you 
should be this representative of black 

762
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,200
America or whatever.
I find that the people who were supposed

763
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:44,050
to be the most tolerant are the least 
because they,

764
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,163
they never consider that they in fact 
may not be because they think that 

765
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,440
everyone thinks like them.

766
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,110
Yeah,
and not everybody thinks like you.

767
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,710
So you know,
concern.

768
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,900
I find that,
listen,

769
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,823
I get it from all sides,
but I find that the people who are most 

770
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:04,060
incredulous about things and many times 
the most vocal are liberals.

771
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,260
Yeah.
And and many times for me as well,

772
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,650
African Americans,
because they're looking at me regardless

773
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,170
of the facts.
Even if the facts don't pan out,

774
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,033
even if,
if the evidence and all the 

775
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:19,330
investigations and all the autopsies 
show no hands up,

776
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,164
don't shoot.
I have to come on television and say 

777
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,020
hands up,
don't shoot.

778
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,810
I can't do that.
That's not what the evidence shows.

779
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,970
So I have to say the evidence does not 
show that.

780
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,000
So that never happened according to the 
evidence.

781
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,670
I can't believe you.
You sell out and you're like,

782
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,710
well,
what do you want me to do?

783
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:36,910
Lie.
I can't lie.

784
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,830
Right?
And then that's exactly where they go.

785
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,190
Oh,
because he's getting

786
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,023
the information from his year,
which I think you've illustrated is 

787
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,330
actually not the case.
Okay.

788
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,164
So a lot of people have been asking me 
this on twitter and I thought you'd be 

789
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,873
the perfect person to pose this question
to the way the media frames certain 

790
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,204
things.
So the way the media frames black lives 

791
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:59,741
matter versus how the media is now 
framing this Oregon militia thing and we

792
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,790
don't have to get into the nitty gritty 
of,

793
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,830
of every little instance that's 
happening.

794
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,690
But a lot of people were saying,
you know,

795
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,770
that the media is not calling these 
Oregon people.

796
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,604
They're not calling them terrorists.
And if this was a group of black people 

797
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,860
or especially if this was a group of 
Muslim people,

798
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,873
we would be calling them terrorists.
And I was googling the word terrorism 

799
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,283
and you know,
it talks about intimidation or violence 

800
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,733
and violence and to me it's a little 
hazy whether them taking this building 

801
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,593
where they had to use no force per se.
And apparently the building was just 

802
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:35,320
open and yes,
they had guns and it's federal property,

803
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:37,790
it's all that,
whether it's actually terrorism.

804
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,624
And would the medium be treating it 
differently if it was either black 

805
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,870
people or Muslim people.
Why are you falling into that trap?

806
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:47,750
Dave Rubin,
I tell me why me out of this trap,

807
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:48,840
how about that?
So here's the,

808
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,340
the thing.

809
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,173
So I actually wrote an editorial saying 
that it was terrorism in my editorial 

810
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,670
for the Tom Joiner morning show.
And so,

811
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:56,720
um,
you know,

812
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:59,210
it was read by someone here at CNN and 
they said,

813
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,044
well,
our definition of terrorism here at CNN 

814
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:05,090
is different,
is that it has to be political,

815
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,690
it is political,
that's political,

816
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,680
but it also has to have someone who has 
been hurt by it,

817
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,413
like physically hurt.
So it's not terrorism until someone has 

818
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,440
actually hurt or killed or what have 
you.

819
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,240
And I think that's part of the 
definition here,

820
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,120
but according to the law enforcement 
people I spoke to,

821
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,823
if you are doing something for a 
political end or whatever that is 

822
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:27,020
illegal in that manner than it is 
terrorism.

823
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:27,854
So I have called a terrorism.
I've heard other people call it 

824
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:30,404
terrorism.
I don't know how other media 

825
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,104
organizations frame it,
but here at CNN I don't think there's a 

826
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,480
double standard about what's going on 
and what it is.

827
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,650
Now.
Here's the thing,

828
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,140
is it,
do I know that it.

829
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,740
Would it be different if it was Muslims 
or if it was black,

830
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,880
black people?
Yeah,

831
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:47,840
of course.
I live in America.

832
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:48,674
I know that in this particular case.
So I have to have to hedge it and say 

833
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,190
I'm not so sure.
And here's why.

834
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:59,810
Because it is in the middle of nowhere.
It's 280 miles from Portland,

835
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:04,370
Oregon.
The next biggest city Burns is what?

836
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:05,204
80 slash 30 or 80 miles away.
And no one really knows where Burns 

837
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,473
Oregon is,
right?

838
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,343
So it is basically a truck stop,
not even a truck stop at a rest stop in 

839
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:18,200
the middle of nowhere.
What the government is trying to do,

840
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:19,034
the FBI is trying to do is to avoid 
another Ruby Ridge and another waco and 

841
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,190
so it is the middle of winter.
Nobody's there.

842
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,770
Nobody is in danger of being hurt.

843
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,160
The best thing that these guys can do is
be ignored.

844
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:35,180
I hate that we even have to give them 
media attention because they're Yahoo's.

845
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,160
They're not within their legal rights 
for anything.

846
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,320
So I think what they're doing now is 
perfectly fine.

847
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,213
Let them sit there in the middle of 
winter and freeze their asses off and 

848
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,163
fine.
If you want to stay down in the middle 

849
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,180
of winter in that little crappy 
building,

850
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,890
then that is your business.
Yes,

851
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:50,724
it is a federal building and they are 
breaking the law and at some point they 

852
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:54,144
will have to take care of it.
But I think at this point I think 

853
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:59,340
they're actually doing the right thing.
As far as immediate reaction,

854
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,260
I don't.
I haven't seen any.

855
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,320
I don't know anyone who's called it like
a peaceful protest or what have you.

856
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,313
It's it is what it is.
It's people who are ignorant of the law 

857
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,050
who have taken over a building and they 
should pay for the pay,

858
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:16,710
the consequences when the time comes,
but right now I'd say ignore them.

859
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,110
Yeah,
and I'm pretty sure they're not going to

860
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:22,530
get what they want at the end of this.
That's usually how these things

861
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,900
and it's many of the people whose land 
was saved by the government helping them

862
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:31,430
out years ago and now they want to 
reclaim it and get the money back.

863
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:33,830
That the more money that was already 
given to them,

864
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,873
they're just ignorant of the law.
If this was a building that mattered in 

865
00:36:38,421 --> 00:36:40,430
the middle of the city that mattered,
sure.

866
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,990
Reaction will be completely different 
and there would be more direct threat to

867
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,670
Corbett direct threat.
Yes,

868
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,150
but I do think that they're getting a 
pass there because of their religion.

869
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:53,420
They're not Muslim because they're white
non-african-american.

870
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,343
I do,
but I don't know how different the 

871
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:56,684
reaction would really be.
I don't know because it's a building 

872
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,134
that nobody cares about in the city,
in a place that nobody really cares 

873
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:02,744
about it.
Yeah.

874
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,583
And it's only 15,
about 15 or so people who are actually 

875
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:07,700
in that building.
It's not hundreds of people.

876
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,490
Yeah.

877
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,960
They're running out of snacks.
I heard.

878
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,290
So this thing can't last that long.
They're idiots.

879
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,261
All right.
So,

880
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,850
uh,
let's talk about some of the things that

881
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:18,060
bring us together because that,
you know,

882
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:18,894
what the audience is going to go now see
lemons looking at somebody who's giving 

883
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,310
him the signal,
whether he can talk about it or not.

884
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:24,660
Someone is in my office,
but I'm just,

885
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,450
we're just laughing.
Um,

886
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,863
so one thing that you've done that I,
I really appreciate because it comes 

887
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:34,290
completely with the spirit of how I've 
done this show is you've really tried to

888
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,940
build bridges with people that perhaps 
some might think you shouldn't get along

889
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:39,774
with or you shouldn't talk with.
So I've seen you a couple times with a 

890
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,343
Glenn Beck and,
and I was tweeting up a storm the first 

891
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:50,310
time I saw it because I thought this is 
exactly what the news is supposed to be.

892
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,153
This is what not not reporting,
but this is what conversation is 

893
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,354
supposed to be.
You guys come from very different 

894
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:57,140
places,
you know,

895
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,760
he's a pure libertarian,
I suppose.

896
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,773
Uh,
your politics are different and you 

897
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:03,684
know,
you're just trying to have the 

898
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,470
conversation and that's what I'm trying 
to do here.

899
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,350
And I thought it was pretty beautiful.
I was.

900
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,213
So I guess I don't even know what my 
question is as much as I want to see 

901
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:12,324
more of that.

902
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,300
Well,
he,

903
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,210
you say that our politics are different.
I'm not political.

904
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,410
I'm like the least political person that
you got on.

905
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,500
I swear I don't care about conservative 
or liberal.

906
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,310
I think all politicians are full of it.
I think I'll go with you on that.

907
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,770
And I judge things on my own.
So,

908
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,633
you know,
especially coming from an African 

909
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:35,560
American background,
African Americans are pretty liberal and

910
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:39,070
then some things and also very 
conservative and many times conservative

911
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:42,970
socially when it comes to the church.
So you know,

912
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,863
you know,
for people to sit there and pretend 

913
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:45,011
like,
oh,

914
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,720
where do those big liberals and they're 
not,

915
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,850
and then you don't accept gay people and
then it.

916
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,490
So it's not true.
So I'm not,

917
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,230
I,
I am not political.

918
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,760
So when you say my politics are 
different,

919
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,200
it's not,
I will listen.

920
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,063
I think the only way,
especially if it's someone you don't 

921
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:02,410
agree with or if you consider them your 
enemy or not on your side,

922
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,600
don't you want to know what they're 
thinking?

923
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,760
I don't understand.
When people say,

924
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,830
I am never going to talk to them,
how could you?

925
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,753
Don't you dare sit down.
You knew how much crap I got because I 

926
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,990
like I because I sat down twice with 
Aaron Wilson and I went,

927
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:21,850
um,
I almost got the interviews between me,

928
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,923
uh,
George Stephanopoulos and one other 

929
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:28,200
person.
I forget who it was and we all,

930
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,880
you know,
George ended up getting the interview.

931
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,960
I got so much guff because I wanted to 
do an interview with him.

932
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:35,651
It's like,
well,

933
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,460
don't you want to hear from him?
Like even if you don't agree with them,

934
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:40,294
especially if you don't agree with them,
you want to hear his rationale and his 

935
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,074
reasoning,
so it is never made sense to me to not 

936
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:51,910
talk to someone who you disagree with.
Now that's it.

937
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,620
I think that people should be respectful
and they should be in their right minds,

938
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,493
but you know before you are,
when you're talking to them and if they 

939
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:03,250
don't then they're outta here.
I'll cut you right off if you're.

940
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,200
Yeah,
if you're being an ignoramus,

941
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,460
I'm not dealing with it.

942
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,061
Yeah.
Well,

943
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:09,100
interestingly,
I wasn't even going to bring this up,

944
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:11,350
but a couple months ago,
maybe two months ago or so,

945
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:12,184
you had a Sam Harris who's been on my 
show who's become a friend of mine and 

946
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,163
Dean Obeidallah were on and they were,
they were debating this Islam and and 

947
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:20,740
sort of,
you know,

948
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,220
religion verse people thing.
And in the midst of it,

949
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,233
Dean said something that I knew to be 
implying that sam believed something 

950
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:30,004
about all Muslims and I knew it to be 
not true because I had sat there with 

951
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:35,800
Sam and rehashed it.
He's rehashed it a thousand times.

952
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,090
And while it was infuriating aiding for 
me to watch,

953
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,440
I thought,
all right,

954
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,450
at least they're having the 
conversation.

955
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,180
So that's what you're just opening the 
door for.

956
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,330
Yeah,
and the thing about that is,

957
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,360
is that we have to stop calling people,
you know,

958
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,640
Isms or obs,
phobias,

959
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,523
not homophobic or Islamophobic or 
whatever because they want to have a 

960
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,040
conversation.
That's part,

961
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,650
that's what we do is have a 
conversation.

962
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,930
And when you have great minds,
like you know,

963
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:09,110
a Fried Zacharia or Sam Harris or 
whomever who say,

964
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,183
yes,
there is a problem that must be 

965
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:13,880
addressed in Islam and we have to figure
out how to do it.

966
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:14,714
When you have great minds like that,
those are the people that you should 

967
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:18,080
listen to.
When you have people who say there is no

968
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:20,540
problem.
And by you saying this,

969
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:21,374
then you are as auto phobic,
then that person is very dangerous 

970
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,943
because the evidence is there doesn't 
mean that people in that religion or 

971
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:29,540
that it doesn't mean that that Islam is 
bad,

972
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,040
doesn't mean mean that Muslims are bad.

973
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,033
It doesn't mean that because we talk 
about crime in that is committed mostly 

974
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:35,654
by African Americans.
It doesn't mean that African Americans 

975
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:37,724
are bad or that black people are bad.
It means that we were just having those 

976
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:43,580
conversations and so we have to stop 
that.

977
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,600
And,
and you know,

978
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,840
Matt,
I think that's why I can talk to someone

979
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,910
like a Glenn Beck is because,
you know,

980
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,953
I want to,
I would rather have common ground with 

981
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:53,594
people or try to reach some sort of 
common ground or consensus rather than 

982
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:57,344
just having them an enemy,
keeping them at arm's length and not 

983
00:41:58,971 --> 00:41:59,804
being at the table.
That's what's happening in Washington 

984
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,070
and with the Congress right now.
What good is that doing anybody?

985
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,133
Yeah.
So that's actually a perfect segue for 

986
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:09,044
the political climate.
So let's just talk about that a little 

987
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,840
bit.
So you've been in this for awhile.

988
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,060
It's pretty bad right now,
right?

989
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,770
Like,
could it get much worse?

990
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,900
I keep thinking that it's not going to 
get much worse.

991
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,390
And now I realize we're in an election 
year.

992
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:23,180
We've got this crazy thing with trump 
right now.

993
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,040
That's me.
Yeah.

994
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,870
You just have to nod through this whole 
thing probably.

995
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,380
But really like how much worse is this 
thing gonna get before this election

996
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,393
comes?
I think it's going to get a lot worse 

997
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,923
and I think um,
because of how much it's being amped up 

998
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:42,164
on both sides.
So whoever's in the White House next is 

999
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:48,020
going to have a huge challenge.
Like if a Democrat is in there,

1000
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,440
all those people that have been read by 
the right and by Donald Trump,

1001
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:55,520
right?
Some people you can,

1002
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,740
if you can just go hillary

1003
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,070
and they go,
ah,

1004
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,050
can't even get her name out,
right?

1005
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,060
Say you say Donald Trump,

1006
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,240
they go,
oh my God,

1007
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:04,260
I hate that guy.

1008
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,433
You can't even get their name out.
So I think people are becoming amped up 

1009
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,233
more than almost any election that I've 
seen except for during the Obama 

1010
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,020
election.
It was pretty,

1011
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,500
it was pretty crazy,
right?

1012
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,500
Him and Sarah Pailin,
it was like,

1013
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,030
wow.

1014
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,610
In a weird way,
doesn't it seem like,

1015
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,453
to me,
it seems like we were all on ecstasy 

1016
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,660
back then,
like it was like seven years besides the

1017
00:43:25,661 --> 00:43:28,300
past,
is that if we just romanticize the past,

1018
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,600
it was bad.
Yeah.

1019
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:30,651
I mean,
come on.

1020
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:31,580
It was,
you know,

1021
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:35,060
he wasn't,
he wasn't America and he was a Muslim.

1022
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,620
He went to a madrasa.
Um,

1023
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,710
what else?
Oh,

1024
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,580
you know,
a socialist,

1025
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:43,430
all that socialist,
all those things.

1026
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:44,320
And then,
you know,

1027
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,080
mccain couldn't find a running mate in 
any found Sarah pay on it.

1028
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,100
And then that was a disaster.
And then people said,

1029
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,020
oh my God,
everybody was out to get Sarah Pailin.

1030
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,973
And then as it turns out,
she was not as informed as she should 

1031
00:43:53,411 --> 00:43:54,590
have been.
And so it was,

1032
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,380
you know,
it was a little crazy.

1033
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,520
Right?
All that said,

1034
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,260
we didn't have a trump.
Right.

1035
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,123
How do you deal with this trump thing?
Because one of the things that I've 

1036
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:04,820
noticed and,
and we've talked about it,

1037
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,240
it makes me,
I love interviewing him.

1038
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:08,074
It goes,
love it.

1039
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,080
I,
I know.

1040
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,810
I don't necessarily love what he says.
That's not.

1041
00:44:10,811 --> 00:44:13,140
Don't get me wrong.
The spectacle.

1042
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,680
I loved new.
No,

1043
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:19,540
I love interviewing him because you 
don't know what he's going to say.

1044
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,570
I love the back and forth.
I love the way his mind works.

1045
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,510
Doesn't mean I agree with him.
When he's like,

1046
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,650
excuse me,
excuse me,

1047
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,790
Don.
You know,

1048
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:28,700
people at home are like,
oh,

1049
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:30,880
he cut you off inside.
I'm kind of laughing.

1050
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:31,714
I'm,
oh my gosh.

1051
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
And I'm like,
you know,

1052
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,470
when he goes up,
excuse me,

1053
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,880
done.
He is,

1054
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,300
it's a bit comical sometimes he's,
he's a performer,

1055
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,670
so I love interviewing him,
but that's about it.

1056
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,603
So is that really though the secret 
sauce to what he's doing that the rest 

1057
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:46,990
of these guys?
All of them,

1058
00:44:46,991 --> 00:44:47,824
pretty much.
I would argue that Bernie probably is 

1059
00:44:49,261 --> 00:44:52,510
not as Bernie does seem like he's 
speaking from the heart and he speaks in

1060
00:44:52,511 --> 00:44:53,920
a way that doesn't sound like a 
politician,

1061
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,840
but pretty much the rest of them,
they all just sound like politicians and

1062
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:02,050
people are over that.
And because of that,

1063
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,950
even when trump says crazy stuff,
it makes people like him,

1064
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:10,870
like we had this like a thing that's 
like eating itself constantly with him.

1065
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,490
And because of that,
I mean,

1066
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,770
I tell people this because I use it,
tick them off,

1067
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:16,300
right?
They usually tell like people who are on

1068
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:18,890
the left,
the president trump get used to it.

1069
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,043
Oh Wow.

1070
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,780
But it's,
you know,

1071
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:22,614
I had never,
I had not underestimated him since he 

1072
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,420
got into the race because here's why.
And I said this from the beginning,

1073
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,860
you can probably find it on tape 
somewhere.

1074
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,040
He's used to swimming in these New York 
media waters.

1075
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,570
Sharks,
right?

1076
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,910
He knows how to handle them,
manipulate the media.

1077
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,730
He knows how to cut a deal,
you know,

1078
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,680
if you can say,
if you can make it there,

1079
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:44,514
you can make it anywhere.
This guy has made it with help from his 

1080
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,030
dad.
Don't get me wrong,

1081
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,710
but you know,
he,

1082
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,510
um,
he's made it here.

1083
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,040
He's become,
you know,

1084
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,040
at the top of the food chain and the 
media food chain here.

1085
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,740
He knows how to deal with the media and 
so,

1086
00:45:58,741 --> 00:46:01,200
and he's got a lot of money,
a lot of it,

1087
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,303
of running for president is having a ton
of dough and he has a ton of dough and 

1088
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:06,174
he knows how to deal with people and he 
has a good year on what people want to 

1089
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,260
hear.
So when he's in front of a crowd,

1090
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:12,571
he's like,
oh,

1091
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:13,404
they liked that,
huh?

1092
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,600
And it gives them more or they don't 
like that so much.

1093
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,523
He changes the subject.
So having known all of that and being 

1094
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:22,040
here in the nineties and,
and knowing Donald Trump,

1095
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:23,880
I was like,
this guy isn't going anywhere.

1096
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,740
So yeah.

1097
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,330
Yeah.
I'm all right.

1098
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:28,164
I got just a couple more for you because
I know you have to actually be blowing 

1099
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,540
me off.
You have to be live on air.

1100
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,470
Uh,
not too.

1101
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,000
Not too long from now and about two 
hours and 15.

1102
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,660
Oh,
I got plenty.

1103
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,151
I'll go.
Listen.

1104
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:40,730
I'll talk as long as you want.
Um,

1105
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,630
so,
uh,

1106
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:43,763
how much do you think.
One of my major issues is when I watch 

1107
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:48,140
something live,
by the way,

1108
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,050
I know we're not lying.
We're not.

1109
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,740
Okay.
All right.

1110
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,710
Um,
when I watched something like the,

1111
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:53,311
uh,
you know,

1112
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,144
the press club,
the yearly thing where the media gets 

1113
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:57,710
together and rose to the politicians and
all,

1114
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,010
what's it called at the press club,
the,

1115
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:00,290
uh,
my last correspondence,

1116
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,530
the White House correspondence dinner.
Thanks.

1117
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,050
When I watch all of this stuff and even 
I saw you a couple of weeks ago at,

1118
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:06,933
in the spin room at the debate in Vegas,
we were at the democratic debate there 

1119
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,600
and I've been around it a little more 
lately.

1120
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,763
I'm.
One of the things that I really do fear 

1121
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,283
is that the media and the politicians 
are just in it too tightly that people 

1122
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:24,060
are just too friendly with each other.
They're actually,

1123
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:27,390
you know,
we have so many instances of people that

1124
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:30,220
are married to people on television and 
they're the kids.

1125
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:34,120
And this one or the uncle of that one on
all of this stuff.

1126
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,193
Uh,
I'm pretty sure no one in your family's 

1127
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,920
pulling strings in politics.
Right?

1128
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,580
Let's get that out of the way,
except for my cousin brock.

1129
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,740
But that's,
of course he's your cousin,

1130
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:45,820
of course these guys.
Right.

1131
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,283
But really,
how do you see that as an actual threat 

1132
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:49,744
to democracy?
Because that I really see as a major 

1133
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,084
problem.

1134
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,240
Uh,
I don't know if I would call it a threat

1135
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:56,880
to democracy.
I do see it as um,

1136
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,310
it's a little fake and phony to me.
Like,

1137
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,370
you know,
it was great going to,

1138
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,253
you know,
being invited to the White House 

1139
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:04,884
correspondence dinner,
but it was a lot more fun when I was 

1140
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:09,000
covering it and I can make fun of 
people.

1141
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,020
Right.

1142
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,790
So how much does that make you bite your
tongue?

1143
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,260
Because you want to go to the dinners,
right?

1144
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:14,320
Like we've all been around.

1145
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,810
I went to the White House Christmas 
party,

1146
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:18,644
right?
And because I knew the Obama from 

1147
00:48:20,301 --> 00:48:23,330
Chicago and it was tough and I said this
before,

1148
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:26,840
like when you know someone,
people I didn't know them that well.

1149
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,300
They weren't my best friends,
but I knew them from around the way.

1150
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:32,380
Right from being I was a local news 
anchor and they were there,

1151
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:33,214
they,
you know,

1152
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,073
that would introduce them at chicken 
dinners like emo state Senator Barack 

1153
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,770
Obama and Michelle,
and then his wife would always say,

1154
00:48:39,771 --> 00:48:40,820
Oh don,
stay out of trouble.

1155
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:41,241
And I'm like,
who?

1156
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:42,074
Me?
Why?

1157
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,380
So to have to sort of criticize him on 
policy and the things it was,

1158
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,363
it was,
at first it was uncomfortable in 

1159
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,833
Michael,
he's the president and the buck stops 

1160
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:51,970
with him.
So I've got,

1161
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,850
you know,
an ease,

1162
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:53,684
black,
whatever.

1163
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,340
I've got to do it.
I'm a journalist,

1164
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,203
that was,
I took an oath and so when I saw him 

1165
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,223
sort of in an,
in an informal context and not like 

1166
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,793
throwing questions at him or seeing him 
at the end a Bj and like yelling across 

1167
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:06,890
the room,
like,

1168
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:07,910
how are you going to handle this?

1169
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:08,743
And having them yell back when I had to 
go and shake their hand and take a 

1170
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:12,250
picture with him,
I was like,

1171
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,860
oh,
what are they going to say it?

1172
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,550
So I walked up and you know,
and they were like,

1173
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:20,450
hey,
you know,

1174
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,260
you did the right thing by coming out.
And I was like thank you.

1175
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:25,850
Right.
And so they get it,

1176
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,833
they get it.
But it was a little weird and I felt 

1177
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:28,964
like I don't know if I should be that 
close to winning in this sort of 

1178
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:35,650
situation to be partying with the 
president or for that matter,

1179
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,490
partying with some of the people,
you know,

1180
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:39,110
when you go to the Oscars and all those 
things.

1181
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:39,973
I don't know,
I just feel like I kind of feel like 

1182
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:41,780
Wendy Williams,
right?

1183
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:42,614
Who Sits on her purple chair and she 
liked talks smack about everybody and 

1184
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:48,350
then when they see her or when she sees 
him she's like,

1185
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:48,690
oh.

1186
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,960
Or I kind of feel like that a little 
bit.

1187
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:56,190
So don't you think that more you guys 
need that sense?

1188
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:59,670
Because I totally feel like everybody,
you know,

1189
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:00,504
and it's not just,
I don't mean just the at the friendly 

1190
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:02,740
level,
but you know,

1191
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,481
we don't,
we don't have to.

1192
00:50:03,481 --> 00:50:05,550
I'm not trying to name names or people 
here,

1193
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:09,390
but there are plenty of anchors that 
literally used to work on campaigns for.

1194
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,560
For President or I mean you can name 
some names or look a little weird to me.

1195
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,640
Look,
I mean somebody like a,

1196
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,040
you know Stephanopoulos right there.
This

1197
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,050
is Diane Sawyer.
There's a George will.

1198
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,270
I mean even in George will is a 
commentator,

1199
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,293
a David Gergen.
He's accommodated Donna Brazil 

1200
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,750
commentator.
That's different.

1201
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,970
But when you're a journalist,
you know there are plenty of journalists

1202
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,280
who have worked for campaigns.
Yeah,

1203
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,700
but when you're a commentator,
how,

1204
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,500
how different do you actually think that
is?

1205
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:35,334
So somebody like Don Dave,
but don't you think they have a certain 

1206
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:40,770
amount allegiance for a campaign that 
they would,

1207
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,060
that they worked on previously that they
can,

1208
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:43,710
you know,

1209
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:47,190
I think they do.
That's why we hire them because they not

1210
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:48,024
because they have allegiance because 
they have knowledge to that person or 

1211
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:50,880
will.
We will say,

1212
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,210
Donna Brazil worked for the Al Gore 
campaign.

1213
00:50:54,211 --> 00:50:56,250
You,
everybody knows that.

1214
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:58,890
So she can offer insight,
but also with it,

1215
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,300
unless you're crazy,
you know,

1216
00:51:00,301 --> 00:51:02,400
that her allegiance would be to,
you know,

1217
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,690
um,
to Al Gore.

1218
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,753
Uh,
I think it's totally different because 

1219
00:51:06,061 --> 00:51:06,894
when you're a commentator,
you're hired to commentate as they say 

1220
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,910
or to comment.
Uh,

1221
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,810
and to give your opinion as a 
journalist,

1222
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:14,580
you're not necessarily,
that's not your role.

1223
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,590
Yeah.
But you're pretty much right.

1224
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:18,840
I would say you're right in between 
those two things.

1225
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,300
Um,
I do it on CNN.

1226
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:26,301
What I do is I do and more of a point of
view on I am hired as to give commentary

1227
00:51:28,531 --> 00:51:31,860
on the Tom Joiner morning show radio 
show which had to be approved by CNN.

1228
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,790
So I feel free and different in that 
zone to give.

1229
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,670
But when I'm on CNN I have to watch 
myself because that's not exactly what I

1230
00:51:39,671 --> 00:51:40,504
do,
but everyone has a certain lens and 

1231
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:44,154
everyone has a certain background and 
they have a point of view and I think 

1232
00:51:47,911 --> 00:51:51,480
that's okay as a human being,
as long as you let people know that and.

1233
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:54,110
But that's nothing new.
You know,

1234
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,450
Merle Cronkite,
all those guys gave commentary.

1235
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:57,961
Right?
Well,

1236
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:01,170
I always do think that's funny when some
of these people on tv,

1237
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:02,220
you'll say,
well,

1238
00:52:02,221 --> 00:52:04,260
I don't share any of my opinions.
And it's like,

1239
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,363
that's pretty much impossible actually,
even if for no other reason than your 

1240
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:10,500
body language when you're talking to 
somebody.

1241
00:52:10,501 --> 00:52:11,140
Right?
Yeah,

1242
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,973
yeah,

1243
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,430
yes,
absolutely.

1244
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,870
Yeah.
I don't see anything wrong with it,

1245
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,880
especially if you declare it.
That's why I had,

1246
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:17,410
you know,
when,

1247
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,480
when people were saying,
oh,

1248
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:19,730
Fox is to the right,
okay,

1249
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:20,600
fine.
They let you know,

1250
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,640
MSNBC is to the left.
Okay,

1251
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:23,474
fine.
They let you know and we are neither 

1252
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:28,760
here.
We want to be objective at CNN,

1253
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,713
but we don't want people to have an in 
our objectivity to let people run all 

1254
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:34,130
over reality and truth.
No.

1255
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,180
Yeah.
Um,

1256
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,020
so I should tell everybody that right 
before we started the recording here,

1257
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,160
uh,
you said to me,

1258
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:45,270
what are we going to talk about?
And I said to you that I knew with you I

1259
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:46,240
wasn't going to have to,
you know,

1260
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,570
a lot of times I'll tell them,
I guess our,

1261
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,080
we're going to touch on these kinds of 
things,

1262
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,150
but I knew if you knew that you were 
going to be cool with that,

1263
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:51,984
so I hope that that alone,
I want my audience to know that because 

1264
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:54,714
I hope that alone will dispel some of 
this stuff about sort of how a lot of 

1265
00:52:58,681 --> 00:53:00,770
you guys have to operate or at least how
you have to operate.

1266
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,480
Because [inaudible] the person that I 
know off the camera is the same guy that

1267
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:04,314
I know right this second.

1268
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,443
Yeah,
I.

1269
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,053
There you go.
And I don't want to know the exact 

1270
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:10,150
questions you're gonna ask me.
And most of that was just like,

1271
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:10,984
Hey,
what are we gonna talk about what's 

1272
00:53:11,351 --> 00:53:12,161
going on and what's.
No,

1273
00:53:12,161 --> 00:53:13,510
you didn't,
you didn't push me at all.

1274
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,350
Don't do that or I'm going to get mad.
Yeah.

1275
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:17,283
No.
And we don't do that with our subjects 

1276
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:18,934
either.
Like someone we're going to go 

1277
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:20,920
interview.
We don't give them the questions.

1278
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:21,680
I mean,
I'm,

1279
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,780
they'll say,
what are we going to talk about?

1280
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,460
We're going to talk about you running 
for president.

1281
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,550
That's the.
Yeah.

1282
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,460
GimMe a Gimme like your worst moment 
with a candidate.

1283
00:53:30,461 --> 00:53:32,380
Like what's like the worst thing that's 
ever.

1284
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,070
Any real flub or did he ever really 
offend anybody or anything like that?

1285
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,480
No,
I mean,

1286
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,850
one of the,
um,

1287
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:45,360
one of the most contentious moments was 
with Rand Paul.

1288
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:47,490
I'm sure you remember that.
And I started this whole thing called no

1289
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:50,760
talking points because I hate,
I hate,

1290
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,720
I hate talking points and I hate the way
politicians answer questions.

1291
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,613
So ask me a question,
just a simple question and I'm going to 

1292
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:58,270
be a politician.
A.

1293
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,240
Does that,
your office that you're in right now?

1294
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,810
Well,
when you talk about offices,

1295
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,200
a grandmother taught me was that you 
don't really own anything.

1296
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:10,890
It's all shared.
It's all part of the American people own

1297
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:12,060
everything.
Right?

1298
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,620
And then you're just like,
okay,

1299
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,870
are you going to answer the damn 
question?

1300
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,930
So the simple answer is yes,
this is my office.

1301
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,633
Politicians have a hard time doing that.
So Rand Paul had did that with me and I 

1302
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:25,471
was just like,
I'm like,

1303
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:26,304
look man,
could you stop telling me what you did 

1304
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,530
yesterday in Congress and would you do,
how do you feel about this,

1305
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:33,210
do you hear the question that I'm asking
you?

1306
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,403
And so then he got really upset and it 
became really heated and so it was an 

1307
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:39,990
uncomfortable moment,
but it was also a very freeing moment to

1308
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:40,980
me because I was like,
you know what,

1309
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,430
you know what,
I'm sick of this.

1310
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,383
And so I set a marker there and so 
everyone I had that came on had to 

1311
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:50,514
answer the question and they do now,
now I'm not going to badger people 

1312
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:55,080
because sometimes they just won't.
And I'll say okay.

1313
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,260
And then I will say it is obvious that 
you don't want to answer the question so

1314
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,570
we will move on.
Right?

1315
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,440
Because I don't want to waste the 
audience time.

1316
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,250
So that was probably an,
an uncomfortable moment that I have with

1317
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:06,084
a candidate.
But then I just interviewed him two 

1318
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,280
hours,
three hours ago.

1319
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:09,620
So it's all,
it's all good.

1320
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,450
Yeah.
Do you ever bite your tongue though,

1321
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,870
related to the fact that you want these 
guys to come on again?

1322
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,720
Because even when I was in the spin room
talking to,

1323
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,050
talking to their representatives,
not even the candidates,

1324
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,540
I did feel a little bit of,
you know,

1325
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,940
I had huckabee's campaign on back on 
there at the end,

1326
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,590
the

1327
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,930
for you,
but they all want to be on CNN.

1328
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,700
Fair enough.
All going to come.

1329
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,530
But yes,
I know where you're going with this.

1330
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,940
And the thing is,
is not,

1331
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,833
it's not.
So let me share a little secret with 

1332
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:36,900
you.
This is just between us.

1333
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,833
This is just between us.
So if you had that concern you had and 

1334
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:41,644
that's a very real concern and that.
And that's real because you do want 

1335
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:46,200
people to come back,
right?

1336
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,720
So it's all in the way you asked the 
question,

1337
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:49,554
it's all in the tone and if I say,
why are you such a damn bleeding heart 

1338
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,350
liberal,
you'll go,

1339
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,290
what do you mean?
So you can just go,

1340
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,041
well,
you know,

1341
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,380
that's a very liberal perspective.
Why?

1342
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,090
Why do you feel that way?
Yeah,

1343
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,580
it's the same question,
right?

1344
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,770
Pretty much.
It's all in the way you asked it.

1345
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:09,570
It's like asking a question with a smile
on your face.

1346
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:12,150
It's all in the tone and you can do it 
by complimenting.

1347
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:16,140
It's like I know you pride yourself on 
your politics and your liberalism.

1348
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,940
So would you answer this question for 
me?

1349
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,383
Same thing.
Well that's the way you asked the 

1350
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:21,880
question

1351
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,713
that sort of brings it back to we 
started this sort of online versus 

1352
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:27,460
mainstream media thing because I'll see 
a lot of times,

1353
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:28,294
you know,
the online guys who aren't interviewing 

1354
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:32,170
these people who are commentating on it,
they'll be like,

1355
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,004
Ahhh,
lemon didn't attack him for this or you 

1356
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:35,740
didn't do this or that.
And it's like,

1357
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,813
well guess what?
He's the one that actually has to stand 

1358
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,561
there.
Do it,

1359
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,900
get another interview in the future,
you know,

1360
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:41,734
figure out how to get truth from people 
that aren't going to give you a much 

1361
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:44,680
truth.
Uh,

1362
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:46,320
so my point is it's easier said than

1363
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,600
here's the thing.
It is,

1364
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,493
it's not.
And it's not even that it's easier for 

1365
00:56:50,001 --> 00:56:50,834
them to say it because there was not 
necessarily the best way or the easiest 

1366
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:57,830
way because you want someone to continue
to sit there and the interview to answer

1367
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,060
questions,
right?

1368
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,480
Uh,
and you,

1369
00:57:00,481 --> 00:57:03,890
you also want,
you don't want to antagonize them.

1370
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:05,083
And I'm also thinking about the viewer 
because if I continue to antagonize 

1371
00:57:08,781 --> 00:57:10,250
them,
the viewer gets no information.

1372
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,980
That person shuts down and it's not good
for any of us.

1373
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:14,480
Right?
So it's done.

1374
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:18,650
So rather than what am I going to do,
stand up,

1375
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:21,980
go over to the chair that the subject 
was sitting in and ring their neck.

1376
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,600
It's not,
it's not gonna happen.

1377
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,820
So if you're,
if you're sitting there,

1378
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,790
Dave Rubin,
and you don't want to answer a question,

1379
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,790
what am I going to do?
Inject you with,

1380
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:33,890
what do you call it?
Sodium,

1381
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,770
sodium Pentothal to make you tell the 
truth.

1382
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:37,663
It's not gonna happen.
So you get as much as you can and then 

1383
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:42,680
you move on.
That's how it works.

1384
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,780
All right,
I got one more for Ya.

1385
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,580
But first,
have you ever touched wolf,

1386
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:47,414
blitzers?
Beard?

1387
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,820
I feel like I'd really today in that way
it was,

1388
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,120
we gave each other a td hug and it was a
little weird,

1389
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:57,010
like,
Oh yeah,

1390
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,213
I'm convinced there's something,
there's something like the whole secret 

1391
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:01,520
to his success is the beard.

1392
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,560
It's mad.
It's magic will be on my show at 10:00

1393
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,400
PM.
So you have to watch.

1394
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,091
Oh,
nice.

1395
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:07,780
All right,
cool.

1396
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,321
Uh,
all right,

1397
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:11,920
well then my last question for you is 
what's next?

1398
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,783
Because I've,
I've seen this thing not to talk about 

1399
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,180
the rise that you didn't want to talk 
about before,

1400
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:17,230
but,
but I've seen it.

1401
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,050
I flat out seen it.
So what's next man?

1402
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,060
So I'm sure you've read.
Um,

1403
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,220
so here's the thing,
people always ask me,

1404
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,350
Oh,
what are you going to do next?

1405
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,110
What's your,
you,

1406
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,993
how long bought to get where I am.
So I'm just going to love this for 

1407
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:35,970
awhile.
Like I really,

1408
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:40,740
I wake up every day and usually,
you know,

1409
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:41,603
sometimes the first time I wake up as,
because an alarm goes off and it's time 

1410
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:45,294
for my editorial call.
And the first thing that's on my mind 

1411
00:58:47,851 --> 00:58:48,684
every day as well.
What am I going to put on tv today that 

1412
00:58:51,571 --> 00:58:56,430
is pretty freaking awesome.
So I'm in a really great spot.

1413
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,950
I'm,
I live every moment in gratitude.

1414
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,560
I am very happy.
I'm content.

1415
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,483
I'm not complacent,
so I'm going to enjoy this for the 

1416
00:59:04,201 --> 00:59:05,034
moment.
And I would have to say that the next 

1417
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:08,610
thing,
if I could think about it,

1418
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,290
but best laid plans,
right?

1419
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:11,363
It's probably a show that is more bill 
Maher or Chelsea handler or something 

1420
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:19,860
like that where I can actually give a 
point of view and actually say,

1421
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:23,390
like you said,
shit or whatever it is that you said and

1422
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:25,610
not have everybody going,
oh my gosh,

1423
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,340
she can't.
I can't believe Don Lemon said that.

1424
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,503
Well,
they're probably gonna do that either 

1425
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:31,010
way,
but uh,

1426
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,660
yeah.
So that's probably.

1427
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,490
If I had to think of something,
but who knows,

1428
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,290
I will probably do this if all goes as 
it's going now,

1429
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,700
knock on wood,
you know,

1430
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:45,110
God allow for the next 10 or 15 years 
and that's not a bad thing.

1431
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,113
Yeah.
Uh,

1432
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,870
well listen,
I 100 percent.

1433
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:48,704
You know,
how thrilled I am for your success and 

1434
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:50,714
our friendship and uh,
I look forward to our next adventure at 

1435
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,890
blondie's.
You can down some wings.

1436
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,060
You,
you put me to shame.

1437
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,340
I mean it was sad.
I had to cut back.

1438
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:00,110
I was there this weekend.
Past weekend.

1439
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,480
Yeah.
I only ate eight of my 10 wings.

1440
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,543
Oh yeah.
I've ordered like two ordered double 

1441
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:08,780
owners when we've been together.
You literally,

1442
01:00:08,781 --> 01:00:11,630
you got a double order.
You had I think 48 wings on a plate.

1443
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,120
No,
let me tell you this.

1444
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:15,250
Let me tell you.
Um,

1445
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:16,933
I used to be able to do that in my 
twenties and thirties and forties and 

1446
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:22,760
now I can't do it.
Wait,

1447
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:23,780
did you hit the big five?
Oh,

1448
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,610
I thought you were 49.
I don't want to hear it.

1449
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,170
Oh No,
you turned five.

1450
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:29,150
Oh,
I'm a little behind you.

1451
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,770
How far?
Uh,

1452
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:32,660
I'm 39.
Oh Wow.

1453
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,220
You're,
you're older than me.

1454
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,950
I'm 37.
Wait a minute.

1455
01:00:36,951 --> 01:00:38,810
Something ain't right here.
Anyway.

1456
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,703
You guys can catch Don weeknights on CNN
and pretty much wherever and whenever 

1457
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,650
breaking news happens.
Don.

1458
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:46,484
Thanks a lot,
man.

1459
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:47,623
Thanks.
Good to see you.

1460
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,370
Did you to keep up the good work.
