00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,503
Joining me today as a biologist,
a former professor at evergreen state 

2
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:13,090
who is now a professor in exile,
Bret Weinstein.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,650
Welcome back to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me back on.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,790
Professor in exile a friend.
That's what it says on your twitter bio,

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,910
which means it's your most defining 
characteristic right now.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,530
That has become the tenor of my life.
All right,

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,020
so I went into the Rubin report 
archives.

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,840
They're very much like the Jedi 
archives.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,683
I went into the Rubin Report Archives 
this morning that you were on this show 

10
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:38,930
originally on May 30th,
2017.

11
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,764
So that's about a year and a half ago.
It was just as the Evergreen Brouhaha 

12
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,070
was beginning you,
you still were employed at the time,

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,313
uh,
which probably seems like a lifetime 

14
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,910
ago.
Um,

15
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:53,744
so I think first maybe we should just 
play a little catch up from that and I 

16
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,540
just to be clear,
you had been on the show one since then.

17
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,374
You were on with your brother Eric,
and we did a little bit about evergreen 

18
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:03,800
in your life,
but I saw,

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,730
I thought first let's do to catch up on 
what happened,

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,410
where you're at,
where you're going,

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,710
and then we're going to do sort of new 
territory and we're going to cover a lot

22
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,660
of biology and all that.
Great.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
So May 30th of 2017 would be exactly one
week into the riots.

24
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:26,880
The protests that my classroom that 
became relatively famous happened on May

25
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,820
23rd,
so one weekend and I was sitting in this

26
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,654
chair

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
and that feels like a lifetime ago 
doesn't.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,870
I mean it feels like it for me and I 
think less has happened to me,

29
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,190
although it's been a pretty busy year 
and a half.

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,043
The transformation of my life and 
heather's life in that period has been 

31
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,750
so dramatic that it's hard to even 
relate.

32
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,320
I've never had so much happen in a year.

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:50,951
Yeah.
So.

34
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:51,784
Okay.
So for people that don't know anything 

35
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:53,914
about the story,
and I suspect there's very few watching 

36
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:55,984
this at the moment,
can you give me like the 92nd recap of 

37
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:01,660
what happened?
So can that be done in 90 seconds?

38
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:02,200
Let's see.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,033
It can be done with with carnage.
I must say I feared this question more 

40
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:08,710
than any other because there's so much 
detail in the story.

41
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,500
It can't be covered properly.
All right,

42
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,373
give,
give a cliff notes version that 

43
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,980
basically,
and an explainer,

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,873
equity and inclusion movement got 
started on my campus as it is on 

45
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:25,501
virtually every campus and the new 
president of Evergreen threw fuel on the

46
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,094
fire.
He used the division over that issue to 

47
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,740
accomplish things he could not have 
accomplished otherwise.

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,143
I tried to block his moves to dismantle 
the excellent part of Evergreen's 

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,473
teaching model,
which heather and I were using the full 

50
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:42,964
effect.
And I became effectively enemy number 

51
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,490
one of this equity and inclusion 
movement.

52
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,960
They arranged a protest at my classroom,
very dramatic.

53
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,270
50 students showed up demanding my 
resignation.

54
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,600
Not a single one of them was a student I
had ever encountered.

55
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,820
Um,
but in any case,

56
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:05,680
they made a terrible error.
They filmed their confrontation with me,

57
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,813
they uploaded it,
I now know to facebook somebody else in 

58
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,750
the public,
uh,

59
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,243
picked those videos up and broadcast 
them and the world watched me try to 

60
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:18,070
reason with them and,
uh,

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,303
that set things in motion where 
evergreen started using me as an excuse 

62
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,330
for its problems.
It blamed me for what happened there for

63
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,900
the dropoff in enrollment for all sorts 
of things.

64
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,100
And uh,
I started engaging with the public about

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,280
what was taking place at Evergreen about
issues of freedom of expression and free

66
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:46,480
inquiry on college campuses and 
increasingly a evolutionary biology,

67
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,560
which,
you know,

68
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,190
people did not initially really 
understand that.

69
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:55,240
That was the focus that I had,
not a freedom of speech issues.

70
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,920
Now increasingly that's what people want
to talk to me about,

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,270
although we're going to get to plenty of
that because I know that's what you're,

72
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,160
your real focus and passion is.

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,100
And it's sort of funny that now you've 
been thrust into this.

74
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,203
Um,
but in effect you were protesting 

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,690
putting racist policies on campus.
Is that fair to say?

76
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,660
Yes.
And this is one of the,

77
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,050
I think,
hardest lessons for people to learn.

78
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,243
People good people get the idea that you
can spot the right side by certain 

79
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,813
heuristics and you know there's been a 
historical fact of oppressed people 

80
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:39,250
tending to be people of color,
et Cetera,

81
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:43,300
and so people have gotten lazy about 
recognizing who's in the right.

82
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,370
If you follow a principal to its logical
conclusions.

83
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,270
In other words,
if you're against segregation,

84
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,620
for example,
as I am,

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,993
then when the segregationists are 
telling white people to leave campus or 

86
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,234
asking them to leave campus,
then you are committed to standing 

87
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,644
against segregation.
And when you do stand against 

88
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,044
segregation,
the world goes crazy because people who 

89
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,924
are being lazy about recognizing which 
side is defending the principle that 

90
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:15,520
they,
they subscribe to a,

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,440
they fall out in the wrong place.

92
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,273
And so anyway,
yes it is your principles and adherence 

93
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,370
to them that gets you in trouble.
Yeah.

94
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,283
Okay.
So you then show up in this studio a 

95
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,640
week after this whole thing goes down.
It was your first public interview about

96
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:34,270
any of this.
What did you think at the time was going

97
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,680
to happen by talking about this publicly
or,

98
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,510
or what was your hope at least by 
talking about this publicly?

99
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,240
Well,
you know,

100
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:44,074
initially my hope was to expose the 
foolishness at evergreen and save the 

101
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,584
college from its own worst instincts 
because your audience may not care 

102
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,240
terribly deeply about this,
but for a small number of people,

103
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,670
for 4,000
students at a time,

104
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,803
Evergreen was actually a wonderful 
experiment in which it was possible for 

105
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,620
people who hadn't had tremendous,
uh,

106
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,473
educational advantages before they got 
to college to have an experience that 

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,913
couldn't be reproduced anywhere else.
Evergreens model was so unique that if 

108
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:24,560
you ended up in the right classrooms 
with professors who really cared,

109
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,520
it was,
it was like no other place and,

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,630
and you were given incredible

111
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,480
a freedom as a professor to do what you 
want it with these kids.

112
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:33,840
Right?

113
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,673
I believe that the position that heather
and I had was the freest academic 

114
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:43,800
position in the country and maybe on 
earth.

115
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,693
Well,
I mean really more freedom than a 

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,310
tenured professor at Harvard has.
And that was,

117
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,203
let's be honest,
it was both a blessing and a curse if 

118
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:56,160
you decided to use that freedom for 
good,

119
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:56,994
if you decided to figure out how to 
innovate structures that didn't exist 

120
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:00,174
anywhere else,
you could do it and nobody could tell 

121
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:03,150
you not to.
On the other hand,

122
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:07,530
if you decided to take the rest of your 
career off and you know,

123
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,150
teach with one hand while you,
you know,

124
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,480
dealt with your hobbies,
you could also get away with murder.

125
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:15,150
And so that happened as well.
And you know,

126
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,043
there was attention every,
every good professor at evergreen 

127
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,810
grumbles about the fact that there are a
large number of people who,

128
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,003
uh,
are holding positions there that they 

129
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,310
don't really value.

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,261
And you know,
the,

131
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:31,470
the phrase that we,
that we typically used in private on the

132
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:34,020
faculty was that Evergreen paid in 
freedom,

133
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,270
which meant that it didn't pay well.
It wasn't a good paying job,

134
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,100
but the ability to have a blank canvas 
and decide how you were,

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,140
what you wanted to teach and in what 
way,

136
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:50,910
and to innovate new mechanisms and take 
students off campus for a week or two or

137
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:51,744
10,
that freedom was a very valuable 

138
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:57,114
commodity that evergreen,
undervalued the whole time it should 

139
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,324
have,
it should have leveled with people that 

140
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,480
it was hiring and it should have said,
look,

141
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,490
this job is not going to make you 
wealthy,

142
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:06,324
but it can make you very happy if you 
have the temperament that really wants 

143
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,450
to figure out what's possible.

144
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,813
So as this was unfolding and now you 
went public and you also did Rogan and 

145
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,700
you were on Tucker Carlson,
where you said,

146
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,534
I'm deeply progressive because suddenly 
you were sort of getting crap from your 

147
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:22,730
side,
so to speak,

148
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,730
and you were getting embraced by perhaps
a different side.

149
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,300
And I do want to get a little more into 
that now because it shows what a sort of

150
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,910
crazy realignment politically we've had 
these days.

151
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,640
Um,
were you shocked how deep it went?

152
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,370
So you went public,
you were,

153
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:39,830
you were giving the facts,
you were exposing sort of the corruption

154
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,500
and how it went all the way up to the 
administration and all that.

155
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,320
I think from that first interview we 
did,

156
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:48,660
I think you thought that there would be 
a course correction in here,

157
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,310
or at least there was a chance for a 
course correction and at least the way I

158
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,144
read the last year,
at no point was there even a slow down 

159
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,880
or any reflection from the 
administration and the rest of it,

160
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,260
they just went in on this.

161
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,503
I am completely shocked by the fact that
the world's recognition of just how 

162
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:10,664
awful things were at evergreen did not 
force an acknowledgement that something 

163
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:15,164
was wrong.
So I would not have been surprised if 

164
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:22,880
evergreen had backed off cynically if 
they had privately said,

165
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:26,180
actually we were on the right track.
We were misportrayed and.

166
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,780
But we nonetheless have to acknowledge 
what the world is saying to us.

167
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,123
The fact that that did not happen at all
still shocks me and I can't explain it 

168
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,820
because you have a president who is 
widely understood to be a.

169
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,400
is there a polite word for bond?

170
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,363
He's bonkers.
He is one of my favorite words like 

171
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,250
bananas too,
but bonkers,

172
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,580
you know,
wackadoodle too young.

173
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,510
But in any case,
we have a president who was,

174
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,263
I mean,
look,

175
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,610
he's the mad king,
right?

176
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,790
He's the mad king and you've got a whole
bunch of people standing around.

177
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm accepting his authority when in fact
he's an outsider,

178
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,060
is understanding of the college,
uh,

179
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,563
or his plans for the college are 
completely inconsistent with the values 

180
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:14,970
that the college was founded on.
Yeah.

181
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,100
And were they really accepting his 
authority actually,

182
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:17,934
because there are moments in the chaos 
of this that these videos are posted 

183
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,080
where he can't even leave to go to the 
bathroom.

184
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,350
And he was also a hostage in this,
in his own,

185
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
maybe his own,
like perverted a dream or something.

186
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,980
You know what I mean?
He was,

187
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,130
um,
both puppet and puppeteer.

188
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,333
Okay.
Um,

189
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,810
and so the thing is yes,
he is held hostage in those things,

190
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:43,050
but I believe he's a willing hostage in 
the sense that he's trying to accomplish

191
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:44,130
something and you know,
look,

192
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,103
it tells the whole tail.
Once you say what we are doing is about 

193
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,843
equity,
there is a whole swath of people that 

194
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,300
cannot figure out how they would object 
no matter what it is that you say next,

195
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,233
no matter what your plan is.
If you've said that it is for the 

196
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:01,764
purpose of racial equity,
then a whole section of the population 

197
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:09,750
will just fall in lockstep.
What is that?

198
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,640
What is that psychologically do you 
think?

199
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,470
Oh,
I know because I think we're seeing this

200
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,304
everywhere now.
This is not just something that's 

201
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:18,240
happening at universities anymore.
This is happening all over society.

202
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,163
I wish I could

203
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,390
say that it is an error in cognition 
that people are seeing it incorrectly.

204
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,273
What I know for sure now as well as 
anybody on earth is that the part of 

205
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:36,720
people's minds that drives them in the 
direction of silence,

206
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,554
of self editing,
of all of these things is actually 

207
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,570
accurately perceiving a threat that it 
cannot manage.

208
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,793
Now I'm not looking for sympathy.
I do not have my job anymore and I miss 

209
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,010
it.
It was a great.

210
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,020
However,
I've landed on my feet.

211
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,093
I'm.
I wouldn't trade my position for any 

212
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,310
other.
I like where I am.

213
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,200
However,
first of all,

214
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,660
there's not an infinite number of those 
positions in the world,

215
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,333
so most people who are looking at some 
sort of an equity and inclusion 

216
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,983
juggernaut who are thinking,
should I stand up actually have to ask 

217
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,484
themselves what happens if I do?
Do I have an economic plan B for my 

218
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,760
family,
right?

219
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,040
Anybody who doesn't have an economic 
plan,

220
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,874
B for their family and I have to say as 
much as I would like evergreen to be a 

221
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,044
place in which all the faculty had 
enough skills that they could go do 

222
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,320
something else.
If they have to,

223
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,293
they don't write.
They can't easily move to another 

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,160
college because the way they teach at 
Evergreen doesn't,

225
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,213
uh,
create a CV that will get you hired 

226
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,370
elsewhere easily.
Um,

227
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,220
and so I think lots of people are 
looking ahead and saying,

228
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,560
if I stand up and I say the right thing 
now,

229
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,080
what,
what will,

230
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,740
what will become of me and the problem,
the place where I,

231
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,763
you know,
I have sympathy for anybody who sees 

232
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,600
that and so I don't have a plan B,
I don't know what to do,

233
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,853
where I lose sympathy with them is when 
they then having made that calculation 

234
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,810
rationalize what they are saying and 
they join,

235
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,110
not reluctantly,
but they become enthusiastic

236
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,710
allies of this movement in order to,
uh,

237
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,690
basically they sell the rest of us out.
Right?

238
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,683
And in a weird way,
they almost have to do that 

239
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:25,470
psychologically to live with themselves.
Right?

240
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,453
I mean,
otherwise you realize that then you are 

241
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,260
a sellout in the,
you know,

242
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:31,860
it,
it,

243
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,480
it's harsh,
but it's true.

244
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:34,470
But what I'm so fat,
why?

245
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,240
The reason I'm so fascinated with this 
is because as you know,

246
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,093
I've been on tour with Peterson for the 
last couple months and I think this is 

247
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:44,070
the number one question that we get 
asked.

248
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,690
People want to speak up and they are 
afraid of losing their jobs and,

249
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,613
and I think that's why your story 
resonated with so many people because 

250
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,580
people were looking at you and going,
well,

251
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,830
it's pretty freaking obvious.
This guy is not a racist.

252
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:56,664
He's not a hater.
He's a self identified left knee and a 

253
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,454
progressive and all of these things.
And somehow he stood up to the monster 

254
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,070
and I think the fact that you're still 
here and you're,

255
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,110
you're,
you're not employed at the moment.

256
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,090
And now I do want to discuss that a 
little bit too.

257
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,920
But the fact that you're still here,
you're alive.

258
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,750
You're still willing to talk about these
things.

259
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,780
I think that's the type of courage that 
people are looking for at the moment.

260
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,183
Well,

261
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,080
you know,
I do.

262
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,380
So I have to say for a year now,
uh,

263
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,360
I have had these interactions,
you know,

264
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:30,560
a couple times a day somebody will come 
up to me on the street and unless I'm in

265
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:33,140
Olympia,
it's always nice.

266
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,313
People have people,

267
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,710
even sons,
beard,

268
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,340
they're still coming up to.
Actually that has reduced it.

269
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,174
I think we're not quite sure there.
Is that who I think it is or is that 

270
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:43,720
Eric or is it presented?
I don't know.

271
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,450
But you go buzz cut and then your 
scottfree then.

272
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,340
Oh Man,
I'd be,

273
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,970
yeah,
I could go on the Lam.

274
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,790
They've never find me.
Um,

275
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,130
but

276
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,130
the thing is the,
it raises questions.

277
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,080
The stuff that people say to me about 
what they see on the outside,

278
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:00,914
you know,
I get to compare that to what the 

279
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,810
experience was on the inside.
And so I've done a lot of thinking about

280
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,630
what it is,
is,

281
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,360
you know,
is there some reason that,

282
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,450
that I stood up when others didn't.
And I think,

283
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,030
you know,
it comes down to something simple,

284
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,230
which,
you know,

285
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,170
I'll just,
I'll just put it out there.

286
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,053
I think people are rationalizing their 
acceptance of this nonsense movement in 

287
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:31,301
order to sleep and for some reason that 
particular switch works the opposite way

288
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:32,444
for me.
If I heard myself rationalizing that I 

289
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:35,714
would not be able to sleep.
So in order to sleep I had to stand up 

290
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,180
and,
you know,

291
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,003
I'm lucky I have really good friends.
I have a wonderful brother who was 

292
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,380
friends with you and that put us in 
contact and uh,

293
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,760
I have something else to talk about.
You know,

294
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,140
evolutionary biology is fascinating to 
people.

295
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,770
They don't know how to think about it 
and they're,

296
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,983
you know,
just as my students where they're very 

297
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,950
interested to hear what I have to say on
the subject.

298
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:08,120
So that means somehow,
even though I couldn't see it exactly on

299
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:12,470
May 23rd of 2017,
there was a path forward for me,

300
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,910
which,
you know,

301
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,290
it could come crashing down tomorrow,
but so far it looks good.

302
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,490
And I,
I,

303
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,350
I regret nothing.

304
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,393
Is there an evolutionary explanation to 
that type of person that either can 

305
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,610
sleep or cannot sleep?
Because you know,

306
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,520
people come up to all of us all the time
now and they say,

307
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,130
I wish I could speak up.
I don't want to lose my job.

308
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,290
My wife's pissed at me.
I mean all of these things.

309
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,124
And they're literally,
sometimes I'm talking to people one on 

310
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,170
one and they're whispering.
I mean,

311
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,060
this,
this,

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,520
this layer of fear is seriously real and
it is sitting on top of people.

313
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,504
So is there an evolutionary explanation 
why at the moment it seemed like a very 

314
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:57,890
small amount of people are doing it.
Absolutely.

315
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,810
And for me,
just quickly,

316
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,600
I would just say for me it's like,
I don't know if it's about sleeping,

317
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,570
I just,
I just feel like I'm doing what's right.

318
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,610
That's it.
It's actually not more,

319
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,840
uh,
you know,

320
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,090
it's not more a confusing or needs more 
of an explanation

321
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,570
that that's just what I'm doing.
Um,

322
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,583
yeah.
There are two things to say on this 

323
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:20,740
front.
One.

324
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,080
So I know we're going to talk more about
evolutionary theory later on,

325
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:26,914
but yeah,
there is a way in which evolutionary 

326
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:33,931
theory stalled 30 years ago and I don't 
believe that the explanation that you're

327
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:39,820
looking for is on the table in the way 
that you know.

328
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,590
Any evolutionists that you asked would 
say,

329
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,120
Oh yeah,
the explanation is over here,

330
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,133
but I do believe we can see what it is.
There are a lot of adaptations that do 

331
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:48,994
not map well onto the individual.
If you look at the individual and you 

332
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,940
say,
well,

333
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,133
why would the person behave this way?
It seems paradoxical sometimes if you 

334
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,370
look at something larger than the 
individual and it's not the group.

335
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,770
This is the thing.
We've been caught in this argument about

336
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:08,970
group selection since the sixties and 
are actually even earlier,

337
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,430
but that's where it began to come to a 
head.

338
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,733
If you look at the lineage that is to 
say a population of people who are 

339
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:24,050
related now talking about ancestral 
ancestral population,

340
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,320
there are many characteristics that have
value for the lineage moving forward,

341
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,770
that are hard to understand from the 
point of view of the individual and many

342
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,620
of the things that we have a really hard
time explaining,

343
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:40,890
including things like homosexuality and 
religion.

344
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,193
Um,
many of these things are adaptations 

345
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,140
that exist at that slightly higher 
level.

346
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,260
And so what I would say is an individual
who can't sleep if they're not doing the

347
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:55,224
right thing or if they hear themselves 
rationalizing that individual is not 

348
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,780
well suited to certain jobs,
um,

349
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,860
but they're very well suited to other 
jobs.

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,570
And the idea that a population has an 
emergent nature and that,

351
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,850
you know,
a division of labor between,

352
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,013
you know,
I'm not telling you that not 

353
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,640
rationalizing is the way we should all 
be.

354
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,533
It may well be that we need certain 
people who are very good at carefully 

355
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:25,230
rationalizing certain things in order to
get jobs done.

356
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,183
I mean,
I would imagine if you are in the 

357
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,484
military,
if you are in a position of command in 

358
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:32,484
the military,
that there are certain things that you 

359
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:36,870
have to rationalize in order to win the 
war.

360
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,510
Now,
I'm not saying I don't like war.

361
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,270
I'm not saying that every word should be
one.

362
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,620
You know you shouldn't enter into a war 
that isn't justified,

363
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,160
but once you've entered into it,
the goal is justified.

364
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,140
Maybe you have to rationalize certain 
things.

365
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:55,974
You know,
you move troops over here in order to 

366
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,600
protect something over there.
Well,

367
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,434
what are you doing to these people?
You may be sending them to their deaths 

368
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:03,924
so you know,
even talking about it makes makes me 

369
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,480
uncomfortable because it's not something
I would be good at,

370
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,673
but the point is when you look at the 
population and the fact is the 

371
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,080
populations that we have a live on earth
today are all winners,

372
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:19,770
right?

373
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,050
These are the winners.
Irrespective of how you got here,

374
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,080
irrespective of how oppressed your 
population looks in relation to other.

375
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:29,380
Somehow you made it to the president.
You're a winner.

376
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,703
Those winning populations had many 
characteristics within them and they 

377
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,840
knew how to call upon these people and 
you know,

378
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:40,674
sideline those people and then switch it
up at the point you arrive somewhere 

379
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:44,670
else where different skills are 
necessary.

380
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,130
So I'm in essence,
yeah,

381
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,003
I think there's a very simple 
evolutionary explanation and some of us 

382
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,360
have certain skills,
other people have other skills.

383
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:53,194
And the real trick is can you figure out
the switching mechanism that decides 

384
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,550
what to call on?
At what moment?

385
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,240
That seems to be the key part of this,
right?

386
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,133
I mean that's it.
It's like some people are going to do 

387
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,194
it.
Some people,

388
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,460
some people know they should do it and 
won't do it.

389
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,960
Some people probably shouldn't do it and
do,

390
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:10,930
do it and everything in between.
Well,

391
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,530
you know,
you probably have this experience too,

392
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,393
but when I,
when people come up to me and they 

393
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:16,824
talked to me,
there's just a couple of different 

394
00:21:18,331 --> 00:21:20,970
styles of conversation that unfold.
Um,

395
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:21,804
you know,
and there's lots of people who want to 

396
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,340
apologize for what happened to me,
which I always find odd,

397
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,253
you know,

398
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,550
unless they were there in the room,
right?

399
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,423
Unless it was them,
but I'm guessing those people that have 

400
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,590
never contacted me,
but,

401
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,040
you know,
some people want to apologize,

402
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:37,874
some people,

403
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,510
you know,
I want to thank me and some people,

404
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:46,120
there's this one thread which is I'm 
facing something like this too.

405
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,500
Can you give me some advice?
And,

406
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,603
you know,
I always say the same sort of thing to 

407
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:54,050
them and it throws them,
you know,

408
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:54,890
I always say,
look,

409
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,923
it's not safe.
You have to think very carefully about 

410
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:04,481
what you're doing and don't kid yourself
about what you're signing up for and you

411
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,150
know,
you can,

412
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,110
you just watch in their eyes as they,
um,

413
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,620
grapple with the fact that they didn't 
get what they wanted from me,

414
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,463
what they want it to be told.
They wanted somebody to egg them on and 

415
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:15,860
say,
do it.

416
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:17,360
It's the right thing.
It'll work out.

417
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,340
And you tell them,
oh,

418
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:21,200
it may not work out.
And,

419
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,940
you know,
there's a moment of heartbreak,

420
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,774
but my hope is that the people who 
should do it have to go through that 

421
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,760
little heartbreak in order to get to the
other side.

422
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,080
And so among my various,
uh,

423
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,680
jobs at the moment is to show people the
abyss.

424
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,370
Just say,
look,

425
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,090
is this the abyss you want to jump?
If it is,

426
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,980
nobody can tell you that,
but you,

427
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:49,814
I certainly can't.
It would be irresponsible of me to tell 

428
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:54,920
people to do something like what I did.
Because you could get,

429
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,850
you could get maimed.

430
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,930
Yeah.
And in a way it's sort of the shows that

431
00:22:58,931 --> 00:22:59,764
I'm most proud of.
Here are the ones where I was able to 

432
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:06,070
facilitate a little bit of that.
So it's sitting down with you.

433
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:06,904
It's sitting down with Lindsay Shepherd 
who went through something very similar 

434
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,783
in sitting down with James Damore,
these people who did not ask to be 

435
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,350
heroes who even if I say the word hero,
I can see you're uncomfortable.

436
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,720
You know what I mean?
Like the people that didn't want this.

437
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:20,554
But somehow it got thrust upon them and 
then and then they got there and then 

438
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,230
hopefully I was able to amplify that a 
little bit,

439
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:29,680
which then spreads that out to all sorts
of other people,

440
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:30,820
which is pretty cool.
So let's,

441
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,953
let's,
I know I don't want to do this for 

442
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,483
obviously the entire interview.
So let's just catch up on a couple of 

443
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,640
things.
We'll do a bit more.

444
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,590
So there's one,
one

445
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,750
thing that is,
and I believe there's a little caveat to

446
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,584
it.
If you do it and you'd do it for the 

447
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:46,040
right reasons,
in other words could do it cynically.

448
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,903
You could stand up against one of these 
things in order to see if you couldn't 

449
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,400
get famous or something.
People will see through that,

450
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,593
right?
Especially the people who've gone ahead 

451
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,250
down this road because they know 
something about it.

452
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,163
But if you do it for the right reasons,
if you're really trying to advance the 

453
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,004
ball to challenge a bad narrative,
the people who have gone through this 

454
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,840
recognize it and you know,
it won't feed you,

455
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,140
but it is very reassuring to discover 
other people who see a,

456
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,750
the corrupt narrative who understand 
what happens when you challenge it.

457
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,220
Um,
so anyway,

458
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,383
if,
if you're hungry to meet other people 

459
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:32,460
like that,
uh,

460
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,280
standing up,
you know,

461
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,080
you got to figure out what you're going 
to do to feed yourself.

462
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,870
But it does put you in contact with lots
of people who,

463
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:40,490
uh,
are very worthwhile.

464
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,160
Yeah.
It's so interesting because again,

465
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:45,040
after being with Peterson,
it's like people will say to him,

466
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,840
you know,
I want to get a new job.

467
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:47,674
Should I just quit my job tomorrow?
And it's like you have to seriously 

468
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:51,810
think about what your options are.
You may hate your job.

469
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:53,700
It doesn't mean you can leave tomorrow,
right?

470
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,350
You got to think about all of this 
seriously.

471
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:57,184
And I think that that is the key here.
So I'm curious how much of this has 

472
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,823
shifted what you think politically 
because you do talk about politics now 

473
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,700
and I know when I had you in there for 
the first time,

474
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:10,534
I think I said to you,
we'll revisit this question because I 

475
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:14,494
thought here's a guy that's,
that I come from a very similar 

476
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:17,674
political places,
him as a progressive and all of these 

477
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:21,550
things and now I see,
you know,

478
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:22,384
as you know,
I consider myself a classical liberal 

479
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:25,240
and I,
and I love libertarian ideas.

480
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,230
Obviously we just did stand up together 
last night and Bray California,

481
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:31,090
you and your brother joined me on stage 
for the,

482
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,360
for the second half.
And it was mostly a conservative crowd.

483
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:35,194
There were some trump people,
there were some lefties and some 

484
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:37,800
liberals,
but you know,

485
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,673
mostly conservatives and they,
they love you guys and yet you both 

486
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:45,320
still identify as lefties and the whole 
thing.

487
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:47,890
And I wonder now a year and a half 
later,

488
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,263
are you shocked at that?
That you are now really liked by people 

489
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:54,874
that perhaps you thought were your 
ideology decal opponents and now you're 

490
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:01,990
sort of on the outs with the people that
you used to be allies with.

491
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,090
Okay.
That's a good question.

492
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,200
I get one every episode.
I am

493
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,080
heartened and flabbergasted by what I 
encounter on the center.

494
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,340
Right.
You know,

495
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:21,110
this is not the Republican party that I 
remember from my youth.

496
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,063
This is a very different entity and I 
think it has a lot of refugees who've 

497
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,423
been driven out of other places and 
they've grouped there because I don't 

498
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,020
because because something over there is 
making sense to them.

499
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,983
Well,
as you said to me the first time we met 

500
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,630
Dave,
you have ptsd from political,

501
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,630
from the compressions.
Yeah.

502
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,660
And I must say we should,
we should return to this,

503
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:43,620
but I,
uh,

504
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,310
was very

505
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,300
heartened to hear you bring that up 
during your episode with a,

506
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,260
with Ben Shapiro and Eric and Jordan.
You,

507
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:54,360
uh,
you went through a cool exercise which I

508
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:58,680
think deserves a place.
I'm with steel manning.

509
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,600
And your exercise I think was something 
like where is someplace that you suspect

510
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
your own thinking might be incorrect and
you brought up political ptsd as a place

511
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:15,291
to pay attention to,
but let's just say I am shocked that,

512
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,340
uh,
the center right seems to be,

513
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,240
you know,
it has protective custody of liberty and

514
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,210
free speech and science of all things.
I mean,

515
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,540
how the heck did the center right ended 
up end up having custody of these things

516
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:37,170
which are traditionally things that the 
right is uneasy about and the left,

517
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,920
uh,
has,

518
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,240
has defended.
But nonetheless,

519
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,400
the people who value them are where they
are.

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
I think they do have something wrong.

521
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,240
You have your initial question was,
has this changed my political view?

522
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,670
And I think one of the everybody said it
would.

523
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,300
And I,
you know,

524
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,143
I,
I believe I am being honest with myself 

525
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,123
when I say really hasn't changed my view
of what is true politically much if at 

526
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:04,464
all.
I think because what I believe is true 

527
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,010
isn't predicated on anything social.
Right?

528
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,810
In other words,
these are the conclusions that I reached

529
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,420
through game theory and evolutionary 
thinking.

530
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,150
And observation of the political 
landscape,

531
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:19,830
they're not things,
you know,

532
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,753
it wasn't that I went to a dinner party 
and had a good time and fell in with 

533
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,760
their political ideas.
So it's not,

534
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:28,560
you know,
the fact that I am not,

535
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,250
I'm welcomed in certain quadrants of the
left.

536
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:34,140
It doesn't change anything about what's 
true at all.

537
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,400
Right.
It can't.

538
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,160
So I,
I understand that.

539
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,860
But at the same time,
I mean,

540
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:40,694
you can go to.
I've done public events with you that 

541
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:42,854
are usually.
We're usually invited by libertarian 

542
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:45,104
organizations.
We've done some Iran things together 

543
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:48,530
and,
and a couple other things.

544
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,663
And I think everything that we've done 
publicly and when you joined me for 

545
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:52,484
standing up,
the crowds all basically seem to be on 

546
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,550
the right as you're saying this sort of 
new,

547
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,750
this new center,
right?

548
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:57,584
That maybe needs a better phrase than 
that because center rights or it needs 

549
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,750
something sexier than that per se.
Um,

550
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,003
but I mean,
have you been invited anywhere by 

551
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:05,744
progressives to,
to tell your story or to get some 

552
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,450
comradery or empathy or sympathy or 
Kudos or anything other than Gfe?

553
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,340
Occasionally,

554
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,810
and only slightly,
I mean,

555
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,673
the,
the asymmetry is amazing and I must say 

556
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,763
one of the most interesting things to me
about the early phase of this public 

557
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,420
part of my life is that initially there 
was just this overwhelming,

558
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,380
uh,
a message that came back at me.

559
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:40,460
You are a conservative or to 
conservatism or something like that.

560
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,090
And welcome to the dark side I think is 
what they usually do.

561
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,820
Say that.
And then at the point that a,

562
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,840
the phrase idw showed up on the 
landscape.

563
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,280
Then there was this point about,
oh,

564
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:55,690
the idw is a right wing movement or 
something like that.

565
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,793
And so there's a trajectory there.
There's something we track immediate 

566
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:04,960
effects pretty well as people we can 
observe them and detect them.

567
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,390
There's often a slower pattern that is 
harder for us to see.

568
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,960
And so just by analogy,
I find this is true with healing,

569
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,640
physical healing.

570
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,710
If you do damage to your knee,
for example,

571
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,813
there's a one month healing trajectory,
but there's also a one year and a five 

572
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,610
year trajectory and they're much harder 
to spot.

573
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,830
Um,
so anyway,

574
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:27,664
the,
the interesting thing is the challenge 

575
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:34,480
of you're on the right or now surely you
will be moving to the right,

576
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,553
you know,
that was just an overwhelming message 

577
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,470
that came back.
Um,

578
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,530
but the ability to talk back to that 
message and say,

579
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,210
actually no,
still on the left,

580
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,760
actually part of a left you don't even 
remember exists.

581
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:53,761
And one of my fears is that all of the 
stuff that the left was correct about is

582
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:57,880
not getting properly credited now.
So to the extent,

583
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,790
I don't know if people have seen this 
hidden tribes,

584
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,133
a report that came out maybe a month ago
now that says that there's this vast 

585
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,320
Osass,
80 percent in the middle do agree on,

586
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,203
you know,
the desirability of a fair society that 

587
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:16,870
doesn't burden one population in order 
to enrich one another.

588
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:17,581
And uh,
you know,

589
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:18,820
that we basically share

590
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,953
that basically it's only eight percent 
actually that buy into this hyper 

591
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,570
political correctness and the,
and the rest of it is a tiny fringe.

592
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,240
The authoritarian

593
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,570
left and it's a tiny fringe on the,
you know,

594
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,700
the white nationalist,
right?

595
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,630
And the rest of us in the middle,
you know,

596
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,553
we're not in perfect agreement,
we don't agree on the order of the 

597
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:39,780
priorities,
but we do agree basically on what a good

598
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:44,781
society would function like and that a 
lot of the gains,

599
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,403
I mean,
you know,

600
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,860
the ability to be gay and out and 
function in society without that being a

601
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,780
tremendous obstacle that that's 
something that,

602
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,823
you know,
the left deserves credit for a racial 

603
00:31:58,471 --> 00:31:59,560
equality,
you know,

604
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:03,330
equity is a different beast by virtue of
the new,

605
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,943
uh,
I hesitate to even call it that 

606
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,390
definition because it's not a definition
in the standard sense,

607
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:12,390
but equality,
these are traditional left values and we

608
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,224
were right about.
And so the fact that these things are 

609
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:16,884
now no longer controversial that belongs
in the discussion to the left has been 

610
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:22,770
right about some stuff.
It's also been wrong about some stuff.

611
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,293
And the right has been right about some 
stuff and it's been wrong about some 

612
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,380
stuff.
And it is time for that conversation.

613
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,510
Absolutely.
And that's why I don't denigrate what it

614
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,450
was.
I am upset with what it is.

615
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,590
And perhaps guys like you and your 
brother and Sam,

616
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:39,424
some people that still identify as left,
these will be able to do a reclamation 

617
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:47,651
project that I just don't see anymore.
I see sort of more that this thing needs

618
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,690
to burn.
So out of the ashes of Phoenix can rise.

619
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,670
That's just maybe a little bit of a 
tactical thing,

620
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:53,504
but let's just jump back to an 
evolutionary explanation for some of 

621
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,980
this.
So I asked you about why some people can

622
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,740
do this from an evolution,
evolutionary perspective,

623
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,470
why some people are able to step up and 
some people aren't.

624
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,513
What about,
what's the evolutionary explanation for 

625
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,100
why this,
let's say eight percent,

626
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:10,934
very loud,
but small group of people feel the need 

627
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,810
to purge everyone.
Is there.

628
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:15,644
Is there an evolutionary because that 
seems it would be almost counter to 

629
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,034
evolution.
You'd want to have more commonalities 

630
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:22,724
with people and bring in a big tent.
But what I see them consistently doing 

631
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,460
is just getting rid of everybody who 
dare you.

632
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,920
Talk back to the,
to the God.

633
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,220
Well,
you know,

634
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,063
I,
I wish I had known this was going to 

635
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:35,990
come up because I would have looked it 
up,

636
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:36,610
but there was a,
uh,

637
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,350
there was,
uh,

638
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,183
put me on the spot.

639
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,443
Say I'm a report that emerged,
maybe it was six or eight months ago 

640
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,820
that I don't know.
I haven't looked into it and it's not my

641
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:49,020
area of specialty,
but,

642
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,030
uh,
it sounded right to me.

643
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:54,000
And what it said was that there is a 
particular,

644
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,230
um,
there's a particular personality trait,

645
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,530
authoritarianism that isn't ideological.
It doesn't really care whether it's a,

646
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,040
you know,
defending fascism or communism,

647
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,470
what it wants to do,
his boss,

648
00:34:10,471 --> 00:34:13,740
people around.
And that essentially what's confusing to

649
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:14,574
people is that at the moment these dyed 
in the wool authoritarians are 

650
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:19,734
concentrated over on the left and 
they're saying stuff that sounds 

651
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:25,530
nominally like leftist stuff,
but that,

652
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,330
you know,
we're the winds to shift.

653
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,140
And the authoritarians have the moment 
to be over on the right.

654
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,060
They be there.
And so,

655
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,800
uh,
that,

656
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,783
that makes sense to me.
And what I would like people yourself 

657
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:41,694
included to consider is that there is 
almost no point in engaging those 

658
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:48,570
people,
right?

659
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,410
This question of the importance of 
liberty is settled,

660
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,753
right?
The 80 percent of us in the middle all 

661
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:57,644
get

662
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,470
the fringe on the far left and the far 
right are,

663
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,603
I don't want to say safe to ignore 
because they can always rise up and 

664
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,260
become important as the one on the left 
is doing.

665
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,150
Um,
however,

666
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,973
that's not where the game is.
The game is all of the people who can't 

667
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:20,101
figure out how to escape from the stigma
and all that is driving civilization.

668
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:22,754
So all of the people who are falling in 
line with what's going on on the 

669
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,250
authoritarian left,
those are the people to reach.

670
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,420
And what you raised about,
you know,

671
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,930
let's say the audience last night at the
comedy club and you know,

672
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,410
this is reliable.
This was the second one I with you.

673
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:42,411
It was exactly the same the first time.
The thing that is so heartening is,

674
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,360
you know,
I can come into a room and you're right,

675
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,223
that room last night must have been 95 
percent right of center and first thing 

676
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:58,260
you tell them is,
here's a,

677
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,880
uh,
a progressive.

678
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,460
I'm,
I tell them I'm a radical,

679
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,660
right?
Yeah.

680
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,030
It doesn't dampen their enthusiasm one 
bit.

681
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,020
In fact,
it,

682
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,263
they're thrilled to discover that things
are not so bleak and that there is 

683
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:13,914
somebody on the other side of this thing
who's still talking reasonably and can 

684
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,484
hear them and can see them and doesn't 
think that they're racist and out of 

685
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,990
control.
And so anyway,

686
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,333
you know,
I know I take a lot of flack for 

687
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,730
interacting with the right and I'm not 
listening to that flag because it is the

688
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:33,370
best thing we can do is to engage and 
uh,

689
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,210
you know,
when you spot the humanity of the people

690
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:37,044
on the other side,
then to the extent that we differ over 

691
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,130
something,
we can talk about it.

692
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,633
All right,
well we could keep going down this 

693
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,234
Pandora's box of,
of lunacy related to everything that 

694
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:49,070
you've been through.
But let's do,

695
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:49,904
let's just catch it up to where we are 
now and we can start looking at the 

696
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:52,394
future a little bit.
So you and your wife had there who you 

697
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:54,950
referenced.
Heather.

698
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,030
Hi.
Who's been on the show?

699
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,770
Uh,
who's a brilliant professor as well.

700
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:58,181
And,
and,

701
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:59,014
and has that,
that brave evolutionary tick that you 

702
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:02,894
have to have you end up marrying a woman
that was going to have the same 

703
00:37:04,821 --> 00:37:05,870
evolutionary tickets.
You,

704
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:06,704
that's pretty good.

705
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,030
You really want to know the answer.
Yeah,

706
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,913
I'm heather and I,
we were not going out but we were 

707
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:17,091
friends in high school and I don't know 
that others will understand the phrase,

708
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:18,984
but the one that runs in my head is 
somebody goes to high school with the 

709
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,780
girl you should marry and it might be 
you.

710
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,820
Right?
So anyway,

711
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,020
in my case,
you know,

712
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,670
I don't know how because you know,
I was,

713
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,090
I was a confused kid.
Like every other kid that age,

714
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,420
there was something about her that 
seemed so very right.

715
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,450
And I have to say I was right about that
best decision I ever made.

716
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,303
Was she ever pissed at you during this 
because you sort of thrust her in the 

717
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,174
spotlight to,
and the fact is both of you left your 

718
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:54,050
jobs,
you got a $500,000

719
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:59,051
settlement for two tenured positions,
which to some people that's $500,000.

720
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,500
I was like,
it sounds like a lot of money,

721
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:02,570
but,
but this is your life's work.

722
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,404
You and your wife,
you've since relocated your family and 

723
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:06,650
your two kids.
Um,

724
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,030
so this is,
this is massive.

725
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:10,340
500 grand in the scheme of that is not a
lot,

726
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,810
but was she ever never

727
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,430
bothered or,
or hesitant by what you doing?

728
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:18,220
Because she didn't go public about this 
until a bit after.

729
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,910
Um,
she was never pissed.

730
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:26,250
Not for a minute.
She and I were in complete agreement.

731
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,900
We saw the same thing unfolded 
evergreen.

732
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,221
The,
uh,

733
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,054
the nature of our teaching at Evergreen 
was kind of interesting in the sense we 

734
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:36,904
had like a little undeclared graduate 
program and evolutionary biology where 

735
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:41,644
we couldn't award you a master's degree,
but if you were interested in 

736
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:46,690
evolutionary biology and many people 
didn't know they were,

737
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,524
but they would take my program and uh,
then I would sort of nudge them over 

738
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,261
towards Harrisburg.
I'm.

739
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:54,094
So we had students bouncing back and 
forth and we had a community of people 

740
00:38:56,441 --> 00:39:01,441
that were in our circle.
So the basic point is that creates a,

741
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,733
a,
an opportunity for every night at 

742
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:09,371
dinner,
either an,

743
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:10,204
I would compare notes,
what we were seeing at the college and 

744
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:13,710
all of these things talk about,
you know,

745
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,740
students,
you know,

746
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,250
what the students blind spot is,
what they do particularly well.

747
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,990
And as this unfolded,
heather and I saw the identical,

748
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,183
a picture or maybe the way to say it is 
the picture of what was happening 

749
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,270
emerged between us as we discussed it.
And she was,

750
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,883
let's put it this way.
What put me in the bullseye was the 

751
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:39,340
emails that I wrote.
And the thing is,

752
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:40,174
I said in faculty meetings,
I never wrote an email that heather 

753
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:44,914
didn't look at first and tell me it's 
ready and frankly there were a lot of 

754
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:54,070
emails that I didn't send and if I made 
one error,

755
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,860
I believe I should have sent everyone 
right,

756
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,753
because what they do is they leave a,
a historical record of what is taking 

757
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,600
place.
So the descent was in retrospect,

758
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,910
very clear as you went back through the 
emails.

759
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,201
Um,
but anyway,

760
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:08,770
yeah,
heather,

761
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,040
heather was in complete agreement the 
whole time and I think,

762
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,053
uh,
the confrontation was less in keeping 

763
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,173
with her personality traits than mine,
but in terms of her commitment and her 

764
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,720
belief in what we were doing,
it was a team effort.

765
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,590
There's a lesson in marriage right 
there.

766
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,350
And there's probably many lessons in 
marriage.

767
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:31,300
Okay.
Yeah.

768
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,950
Alright.
So let's just get to where you are now.

769
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:34,784
You guys have left Washington.
Neither one of you are teaching at the 

770
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:39,254
moment.
You're trying to figure out what your 

771
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:42,800
future is.
I assume the same with heather.

772
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,560
What is that like,
number one and number two?

773
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:46,394
I think a lot of people would be 
surprised to know that schools have not 

774
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:51,080
thrown offers at you.
I mean,

775
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,133
you,
you have a seriously great public 

776
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,410
profile now you are respected by so many
people.

777
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,230
You have,
you have fans and not just students.

778
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:01,064
Now you have former students,
but you have fans that would love to 

779
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:06,620
sign up for courses that you would be 
teaching and all sorts of things where I

780
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:08,510
think most people would look at this on 
their face and think,

781
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:10,220
wow,
what an asset this would.

782
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,070
This guy would be not only 
intellectually but pr wise and all that.

783
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,380
That's not where we're at.
It's absolutely not.

784
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,160
And it,
uh,

785
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,993
it does say something and I'm,
I'm an outsider to whatever discussions 

786
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:25,810
it is that result in nothing of that 
sort coming our way,

787
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,390
but it is conspicuous.
Um,

788
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,660
so you asked what it's,
what it's like,

789
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,410
um,
you know,

790
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,850
I'm having a,
a,

791
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,280
a very unusual experience in life.
And you know,

792
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,114
my,
my life was great before any of this 

793
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,920
happened.
It's great now.

794
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:51,230
Um,
the lack of security is frightening when

795
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:52,340
I stare at it,
you know,

796
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,100
heather and I have two kids and if we 
didn't,

797
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,283
we would be in a different position.
We could take risks and we could afford 

798
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,170
to go through,
you know,

799
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,130
years of austerity.
But as it is,

800
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:06,980
we have responsibilities and you know,
our kids didn't sign up for this.

801
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,650
Um,
so I mean they would have said,

802
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,560
are you saying they didn't get that 
gene?

803
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:13,720
What are you telling me?
Oh no,

804
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,563
they're bored,
but it's our responsibility to protect 

805
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:17,631
them.
And so,

806
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:20,270
you know,
the whole thing has been a

807
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,573
frightening from the point of view of 
what it means for the future because 

808
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,620
literally,
I don't know,

809
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,920
it seems like things are headed along a 
path in which,

810
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,233
you know,
the settlement that you mentioned is a 

811
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,330
tiny fraction of what we would have 
earned over the rest of our careers.

812
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,340
And a huge amount of it was burned up 
paying lawyers and uh,

813
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,751
taxes,
you know,

814
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:45,584
you get all that money in one chunk.
So we got about two years of buffer 

815
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:51,320
money from that,
but it wasn't,

816
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,170
it wasn't like we got bought out.
We,

817
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,004
uh,
we could have in a state that had 

818
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:01,910
punitive damages,
we likely could have won a,

819
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,493
something much more like 4 million bucks
for the amount of income that we would 

820
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,910
have earned over the rest of our 
careers.

821
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,700
How and why did you guys not go that 
route?

822
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:14,950
Because I think a lot of people,
when they saw the number,

823
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:15,784
I remember when I saw the number,
I think I just saw an article or 

824
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:18,400
something and I was like,

825
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,050
Whoa,
Whoa,

826
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,700
Whoa,
why so low?

827
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Because Washington is one of 11 states 
without punitive damages.

828
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,710
It's that sense.

829
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,543
Oh,
I thought you said that Washington 

830
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,830
didn't have punitive damages.
Oh,

831
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:28,850
I just misheard you.
Okay.

832
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,050
So that,
that,

833
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:31,940
uh,
that caused us

834
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,590
to,
uh,

835
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,110
effectively cut our losses and decide 
that it,

836
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,693
there was nothing to be done.
We did the best we could with evergreen 

837
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:43,740
in cutting our ties with them at the 
point that they made it clear.

838
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:44,574
I mean,
they,

839
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,620
they behaved atrociously in negotiations
for one thing.

840
00:43:49,621 --> 00:43:50,454
They dragged their heels,
they wouldn't sit down with us until we 

841
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:54,780
were already back on contract for the 
next year,

842
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,050
fully assuming that we would be going 
back into a classroom,

843
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:00,330
but what would it be like to walk onto a
campus that is,

844
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,060
you know,
paying a pr firm to demonize you.

845
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,740
Right.
What would that be like?

846
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,290
And we would have done it,
but they,

847
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:10,080
uh,
they insulted us in negotiations.

848
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,510
They offered us panic buttons.
Right.

849
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:16,170
As if.
So panic buttons in the room literally.

850
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,680
Yeah.
Like,

851
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,980
as if the problem was that we were 
panicking,

852
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,450
you know,
rather than that they had,

853
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,303
you know,
they could've at least they offered you 

854
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:27,740
a counter baseball bat.
Wouldn't that have been nice?

855
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,780
Right.
Something,

856
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,470
um,
but they didn't to end,

857
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:31,304
you know,

858
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,580
hobbling the police.
The whole thing was a fiasco.

859
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:36,890
So we cut our losses.
We've,

860
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,490
we've moved,
he moved to Portland,

861
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,370
which is wonderful.
I know that's

862
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,320
in some ways,
not interpretation,

863
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,773
but it is a marvelous place.
You went to the only more progressive 

864
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:47,820
place.
Uh,

865
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,840
it does seem that we have here a glutton
for punishment onto that

866
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,110
belly of the beast.
But I,

867
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:53,590
you know,
the,

868
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,850
the beauty of Portland,
you know,

869
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,733
there's a beauty and there's a tragedy 
there is this a equity and inclusion 

870
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,343
thing and it seems to go up to the 
mayor's office who happens to also 

871
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:06,394
frighteningly and a parallel to 
evergreen be the police commissioner so 

872
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,790
he can stand down the police and,
and has done so in some sort of

873
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,043
from that video from a couple of weeks 
ago with antifa basically running 

874
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,530
traffic in the middle of Portland.
I mean,

875
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:21,364
it's,
it's unfathomable that that's happening 

876
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:25,870
in the streets of the United States 
city.

877
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:26,880
Right,
right.

878
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,350
It is.
They are flirting with the same.

879
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,213
I mean,
it is the same story as evergreen 

880
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:31,900
except,

881
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,630
um,
this is a major American city,

882
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,310
you know,
to have a college,

883
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:37,563
a play games with literal anarchy is 
dangerous enough to have a city doing 

884
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:44,920
it.
Uh,

885
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,610
I shutter to them.

886
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,350
Thank you.
Didn't want to think about Texas.

887
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:50,320
I really on this tour.
I got to tell you to San Antonio,

888
00:45:50,321 --> 00:45:51,700
I think you'd have a field day over 
there.

889
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,900
Well,
but here's the thing,

890
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,290
other part of liberalism is also true.
Important.

891
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,440
So I never encounter a,
the antifa madness and the mayor and his

892
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,520
confusion,
you know,

893
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,020
it's like the mayor of your town,
you never,

894
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,280
never run into it.
What I do run into is a clean,

895
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,900
a functional city.
People as far as I can tell,

896
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:19,360
are very decent to each other.
Um,

897
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,433
you know,
to make provisions for cyclists to 

898
00:46:23,051 --> 00:46:28,051
commute around the place.
So I think in some sense Portland is,

899
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,753
it shows exactly the conflict between 
the left better instincts in its worst 

900
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:35,730
instincts.
And uh,

901
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,733
I hope that it will come around to the 
kind of enlightened progressivism that 

902
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:42,544
used to exist rather than the naive 
progressivism that seems to have taken 

903
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:46,720
over.
All right,

904
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,340
let's shift all together.
Let's do it.

905
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,020
Let's talk about the step.
You really know.

906
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:52,190
How about that.
Okay.

907
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,430
Biology,
evolutionary biology.

908
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,230
I thought this would be an interesting 
place to start.

909
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,064
You just recently did a talk with 
Richard Dawkins just in the last couple 

910
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:01,790
of weeks.
Uh,

911
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,110
as I understand the video of it should 
be up online somewhat soon.

912
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,080
It will be up within a couple of weeks.
Okay.

913
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,100
So hopefully people will be able to 
actually watch this conversation.

914
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,243
I'm very quickly,
this event was put together by 

915
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,234
Pangbourne philosophy.
There's been a little tumbled around 

916
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:23,240
that and I know you just wanted to 
quickly address what's going on there.

917
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:29,170
So pangbourne philosophy is obviously 
imploded and that has

918
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,023
left people speculating about what 
happened and why some of us like myself 

919
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,284
continued to participate with Pangbourne
just very quickly for people that have 

920
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:39,454
no idea.
They were putting together a lot of the 

921
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:41,283
public events that included a,
well the one that you moderated with 

922
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,540
Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris in 
Vancouver.

923
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:48,640
Also the one that Douglas Murray 
moderated,

924
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:49,474
which I think was that in the UK or was 
that Australia is one in Dublin and one 

925
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:53,600
in London.
Um,

926
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,453
and then a series of other events like 
the one that you did with Dawkins and 

927
00:47:57,161 --> 00:48:01,150
this this day of reflection that was 
supposed to happen on November 17th that

928
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:04,720
we all pulled out of which now I think 
you can take it from there.

929
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,680
Sure.
So,

930
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,573
um,
let me just say that I know that there 

931
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:12,370
is a lot of speculation about what took 
place.

932
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:14,290
Why people pulled out of the New York 
event,

933
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,124
why some of us like myself stayed in and
I was in at the point that it was 

934
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,053
canceled a couple of days ago and I do 
hope people will recognize that there 

935
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:26,440
was a predicament for those of us like,
uh,

936
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,850
like myself and like Eric who were 
looking at the,

937
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,803
uh,
the Pangbourne situation and trying to 

938
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:35,644
figure out what to do,
which was at the point that Pangbourne 

939
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,110
canceled the Auckland event,
something new emerged.

940
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,153
So other events had been canceled,
but there had always been refunds for 

941
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,590
people who had bought tickets at the 
point he canceled the Oakland event.

942
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,873
There was a lack of refund money,
which called our attention to the fact 

943
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:56,734
that something was off money that should
have been kept separately for that 

944
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:02,110
event.
So that if it was canceled,

945
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:04,540
it could've all been refunded somehow 
wasn't with.

946
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,850
We didn't know.
And,

947
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:07,150
and to be clear,
you guys,

948
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,513
and I think not just,
you guys hadn't been paid for some 

949
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:10,654
previous things too.
So it wasn't just about the people that 

950
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,920
were buying the tickets.
Just,

951
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,910
Oh,
it wasn't Auckland,

952
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,000
it was Sydney,
Sydney is where speakers,

953
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,893
as far as I know,
that's where speakers didn't get paid 

954
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,504
for the first time and I'm certainly one
of the people who didn't get paid and 

955
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:26,770
still haven't been.
Anyway.

956
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:27,910
Yeah.
And also as a sidebar,

957
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:28,180
that's.

958
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,660
So that is why I pulled out of the day 
of reflection thing in New York.

959
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:32,494
I was supposed to host the whole day,
but then when I realized that people 

960
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:35,494
hadn't been paid for previous things and
I had heard through the grapevine that 

961
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:39,970
there was some shady stuff going on and 
I just said,

962
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:40,804
you know what,
let me just not get involved in this 

963
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,410
mess in that.
Which makes perfect sense.

964
00:49:44,411 --> 00:49:46,480
Yeah.
So I think what I did also makes perfect

965
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:47,350
sense,
uh,

966
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,690
which is,
I looked at the situation and I said,

967
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:51,183
well,
you've got people who haven't been 

968
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,553
refunded their money for Auckland.
You've got speakers from Sydney who 

969
00:49:56,891 --> 00:50:01,891
haven't been paid and if the New York 
event comes apart,

970
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,860
then it's going to compound that.
It's going to create new,

971
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,080
a ticket holders who haven't been paid.
Um,

972
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,413
and so my thought was let's have an 
event that gives people what they paid 

973
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:20,080
for so that we don't make the damage 
worse and I certainly didn't sign up for

974
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:20,914
anything new after the Oakland event was
canceled and there was a failure to 

975
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:26,020
repay patrons.

976
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,853
But my thought was from the point of 
view of protecting the fan base from 

977
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:35,150
whatever was going on behind the scenes 
at Pangbourne,

978
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,193
the better part of valor was to make the
event happen and be successful rather 

979
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:45,251
than create another auckland situation.
So in any case that,

980
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,623
you know,
and I should also point out that up 

981
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:54,281
until so Pangbourne gave us a,
a little bit of warning just a couple of

982
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,070
days before he canceled it.
He said he was about to cancel it.

983
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,670
And Eric and I tried to save it.
In fact,

984
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:02,504
Eric,
who had pulled out of the event quietly 

985
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:06,320
so as not to cripple it,
uh,

986
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:07,943
and he and I got on the phone with 
Travis and we tried to get travis to 

987
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:18,090
agree to hold the event and to let us 
rescue that.

988
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:19,004
We offered to work for free and we would
have liked to have held the event so 

989
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:24,464
that it wouldn't cause further harm to 
people and I don't know why Travis 

990
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,950
refused,
but he did.

991
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,790
So anyway,
it got canceled and I,

992
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,490
uh,
I just,

993
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,353
I do want people to understand that it 
was not that anybody was unaware that 

994
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:47,141
something was going on.
The question was what's best for the fan

995
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,240
base,
the movement to the extent that there is

996
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,074
a movement,
is it better to have another event 

997
00:51:52,431 --> 00:51:55,430
canceled and have more harm?
I didn't think so.

998
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,343
Yeah.
And I know this is all a little insider 

999
00:51:57,191 --> 00:51:58,024
baseball for people,
so I know you just want it to get that 

1000
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:01,390
out.
So I'm glad that it is a few of us.

1001
00:52:01,391 --> 00:52:02,224
Also,
we had discussed possibly doing a free 

1002
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:04,924
thing and who knows,
maybe there will be something in the 

1003
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,024
future if people end up getting stiffed 
on ticket prices because obviously we 

1004
00:52:09,401 --> 00:52:11,380
want people to get something and if we 
can all figure it out,

1005
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:12,311
we will.
Okay.

1006
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:14,950
So that being said,
you did do an event with Richard Dawkins

1007
00:52:14,951 --> 00:52:16,750
as we said,
the video should be up soon enough.

1008
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:20,260
Chicago,
what should we expect from this?

1009
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,300
And,
uh,

1010
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,680
I think on its face,
I think a lot of people would say,

1011
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:24,514
wait a minute.
Well,

1012
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,530
we've got Weinstein and Dawkins,

1013
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,920
these guys should agree on everything 
she didn't they.

1014
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:31,803
Well,
this goes back to the question of what 

1015
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:37,921
happened to evolutionary biology 30 
years ago and um,

1016
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,710
darkens and I do agree on a tremendous 
amount,

1017
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:47,070
but the place at which we start 
disagreeing I think is a branching point

1018
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,283
where you have the way evolutionary 
theory went 30 years ago and the way it 

1019
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,300
should have gone,
and you know,

1020
00:52:55,301 --> 00:52:59,020
that's not an indictment in and of 
itself.

1021
00:52:59,050 --> 00:52:59,883
Fields take wrong turns all the time.
But what should happen is you should 

1022
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:08,440
detect that you're on the wrong path 
because suddenly progress ceases.

1023
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,160
And that didn't happen.
So,

1024
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,690
so what actually happened 30 years ago 
that got us?

1025
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,013
Ironically,
I would argue that the last piece of 

1026
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,150
progress that we all really agree now,
there's been lots of empirical work,

1027
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,013
but the last piece of theoretical 
progress actually involves a Dawkins' 

1028
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,703
selfish gene,
which is essentially encapsulates a 

1029
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:32,064
synthesis that does lots of things,
including brings a proper theory of 

1030
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,520
cultural evolution online.

1031
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,020
Which cultural evolution is a non issue 
for almost all creatures.

1032
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,780
But for birds and mammals,
it's a big deal.

1033
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:49,614
And for human beings it is the big deal.
So to the extent that we did not have a 

1034
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:58,590
way of discussing cultural evolution 
prior to the selfish gene doctrines,

1035
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:02,820
introduction of the concept of memes 
which have now been trivialized by,

1036
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:03,654
you know,
people putting funny captions on 

1037
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:06,120
pictures,
but the concept of,

1038
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,993
I think you could argue they've become 
the most relevant way of communication 

1039
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:11,530
in a bizarre way this.
But they'd be.

1040
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,200
They've become,
you know,

1041
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,063
little tidbits become little bites and 
the fact is almost everything about 

1042
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,360
human beings that is interesting and 
special,

1043
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,920
at least touches cultural evolution if 
not is entirely housed there.

1044
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:26,754
So in order to understand ourselves,
we have to get this cultural revolution 

1045
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,610
things straight and document set us,
I believe,

1046
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:33,630
on the right path.

1047
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,660
Chapter Eleven,
he introduces the word meme,

1048
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:38,910
he introduces the concept,
he sets us in motion,

1049
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,540
but he makes an error in that chapter.
No big deal.

1050
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,403
We all make errors,
but it hasn't been corrected in 30 

1051
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:46,660
years.
And so so.

1052
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,730
So what does that error?
The error is in a,

1053
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,623
a misportrayed will of the relationship 
between culture and its evolutionary 

1054
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,980
units and genes and the way that they 
evolve.

1055
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,143
So what Dawkins says and that chapter is
that means the units of cultural 

1056
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,220
evolution exists in a new primeval soup,
right?

1057
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,990
He says,
this is a new kind of evolution.

1058
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,853
It begins at the point that culture 
begins to happen and it is independent 

1059
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,163
of the genes that cannot be the case 
cannot be the case because the only 

1060
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:22,974
reason that you are able to pick up 
units of cultural evolution is because 

1061
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:32,361
you have a brain that your genes created
which is hospitable to those things.

1062
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,670
Which means that to the extent that your
a culture starts wasting the time.

1063
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,210
And the energy and the resources of your
genes,

1064
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:45,000
the genes are in a perfect position to 
shut it down.

1065
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,763
Right?
So my point to Dawkins on stage in 

1066
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,450
Chicago was,
that can't be right,

1067
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,853
and if you make an adjustment to the 
theory that you darkens presented in 

1068
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:03,150
1976,
if you adjust it correctly,

1069
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,010
you discover that,
um,

1070
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,103
many things that are paradoxical about 
cultural evolution are no longer 

1071
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:16,200
paradoxical and many things about human 
beings are suddenly tractable.

1072
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,530
So can you give me an example of that?
I can give you the ultimate example.

1073
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,543
I will accept that.
And so the ultimate example has to do 

1074
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,460
with a religion and things that function
like it.

1075
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,010
So if you think about,
um,

1076
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:30,903
you know,
this is the antithesis of some little 

1077
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:34,540
picture with a caption on it,
right?

1078
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,420
You Imagine Catholicism,
for example,

1079
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:38,254
Catholicism is a set of beliefs that has
profound implications on the way that 

1080
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:45,994
believers deploy their efforts,
their resources to things that they 

1081
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,940
elevate,
the things that they,

1082
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,950
uh,
issue all of that.

1083
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,830
So the question is why?
Right?

1084
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:02,130
So dawkins and I would agree there is no
supernatural explanation necessary to,

1085
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,153
uh,
interpret what is taking place on earth 

1086
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:08,794
or anywhere else in the universe.
You don't need a supernatural 

1087
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:13,930
explanation if you were trying to 
explain phenomena.

1088
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,633
So why is it that people who hold a 
belief that supernatural forces are at 

1089
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:25,081
the heart of a human affairs?
Why are those people so successful?

1090
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:27,550
Historically?
That's the question.

1091
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,650
And Dawkins,
and I disagree with it,

1092
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,900
I would disagree over it,
uh,

1093
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,763
because a,
he has this view of what cultural 

1094
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:37,120
evolution is that it's independent of 
genes.

1095
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,750
I say it is actually much more flexible 
than jeans,

1096
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,750
but it is subordinate to the will of the
genes.

1097
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,130
Um,
and he also does not subscribe.

1098
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:49,503
Actually,
he came around a bit on this on stage I 

1099
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:52,690
thought,
um,

1100
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,490
but he also does not subscribe to a,
uh,

1101
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,270
a lineage level interpretation of 
selection.

1102
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,223
He is a traditional Ken selectionist who
believes effectively that the 

1103
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,980
individual,
that the gene and the individual are the

1104
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,160
places that we must interpret a 
evolution.

1105
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:16,090
And if you do that,
then lots of things are paradoxical,

1106
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,190
hard to explain.
Maybe intractable,

1107
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,680
if you accept that lineages evolve,
um,

1108
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,230
that adaptation can apply to the 
lineage,

1109
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:31,290
then you can begin to understand 
phenomena like a religious traditions as

1110
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:37,020
adaptive properties of a population.
And uh,

1111
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,003
there is tremendous progress to be made.
So what happened on stage with Dawkins 

1112
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:48,270
was at dinner prior to the event,
we more or less agreed that I would lead

1113
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:55,540
the discussion because I had a sense of 
where we disagreed and he would react to

1114
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:56,374
it and I put together a list of points 
on which I was certain that we agreed 

1115
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:05,470
points on,
which I was pretty sure we disagreed and

1116
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,510
points on which I wasn't sure which way 
to call it,

1117
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,530
which we didn't get to.

1118
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,113
But anyway,
I started out by pointing out the vast 

1119
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,663
agreement between the two of us and 
asked them about each one and more or 

1120
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:17,740
less I had been right about where we 
agreed.

1121
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:20,650
And then I started to go through the 
list of places that we disagree.

1122
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,560
And I thought it was a fascinating 
conversation.

1123
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,800
It was definitely a closer to the 
conversation I hoped we would have won.

1124
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,010
I feared we might have,
um,

1125
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,040
there was a lot of progress.
Could you,

1126
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:35,923
could you sense which way,
not that this matters in the grand 

1127
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:39,830
scheme of things,
but at,

1128
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,740
at some level it does,
which way the audience was going,

1129
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:43,574
not that it,
not that it is about who gets more 

1130
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:45,794
cheers or anything,
but what I do find fascinating about 

1131
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:48,824
these things and although I didn't 
attend any of the live events with Sam 

1132
00:59:51,181 --> 00:59:52,250
and Jordan,
um,

1133
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:53,084
you know,
I've watched some of them and just sort 

1134
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:55,004
of noting a little bit of crowd applause
and jeers and pauses and things I think 

1135
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:03,470
gives you some extra taste that may be 
for you guys on stage.

1136
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,220
You can't quite quantify.
Well,

1137
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:08,480
I mean,
first of all,

1138
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,314
I'm a believer in that and it was one of
the most important tools that I used to 

1139
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:15,160
use in the classroom.
You know,

1140
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,740
figuring out what people heard,
how it landed,

1141
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,190
what they don't yet have.
So anyway,

1142
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:25,790
I'm very cognizant of what people are 
hearing and I was listening carefully to

1143
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,360
the audience and um,
you know,

1144
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:32,510
the thing was set in motion,
you know,

1145
01:00:32,511 --> 01:00:36,020
as another new atheist event.
And so in some sense I was,

1146
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,760
I was battling uphill because my basic 
point was new atheism is,

1147
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,140
is a Culdesac,
it's,

1148
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:47,170
it's a problem in and of itself.
It's a problem because at the end,

1149
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,000
at the end of it,
there isn't enough.

1150
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:52,670
Is that like the most simplistic way 
that I could present it?

1151
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,563
No.
I mean,

1152
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:58,580
let me just put it in stark terms.
Atheism is defensible,

1153
01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:59,653
but new atheism is wrong and new atheism
is wrong because it portrays religious 

1154
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,404
belief as a defect of mine rather than 
an adaptation and non literal 

1155
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:12,584
adaptation.

1156
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,780
And so in a room full of people who,
you know,

1157
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,930
Dawkins is a very famous person,
most people presumably showed up to hear

1158
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,950
a Dawkins.
Almost all of those people have at least

1159
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,560
deep sympathies with the ideas of new 
atheism.

1160
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,873
And so somebody setting out to say 
actually new atheism is an incorrect 

1161
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:37,514
instantiation of atheism because it is 
effectively ideological and it accuses 

1162
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:46,940
people who have religious faith of being
mentally defective.

1163
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:50,030
And in fact Dawkins and I tangled over 
this,

1164
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:50,571
you know,
I said,

1165
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:51,380
look,
you're,

1166
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,640
you've called religion a mind virus.
That's an incorrect interpretation.

1167
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:56,480
And at first he said,
well,

1168
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:58,820
I don't really mean anything deep by 
virus.

1169
01:01:58,821 --> 01:01:59,654
He said it's,
you know,

1170
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,450
you could argue that every gene in the 
genome is like a virus,

1171
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,280
right?
And I said,

1172
01:02:04,281 --> 01:02:05,114
well,
but what people hear when you say that 

1173
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,693
is that,
that they're mentally ill for believing 

1174
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:09,920
this.

1175
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,281
And he said,
well,

1176
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,840
they are mentally ill,
right?

1177
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,521
And so,
you know,

1178
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:14,810
you could see the division in his own 
thinking,

1179
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,010
right?
Because they're at that point,

1180
01:02:16,011 --> 01:02:18,560
he's then saying both things at the same
time saying both things.

1181
01:02:18,561 --> 01:02:19,394
And I,
you,

1182
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,723
I understand his position about you 
could interpret each gene as 

1183
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:24,460
independent,
you know,

1184
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,433
I could defend that position too,
but in order for there to be an 

1185
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,583
honorable atheism,
we have to own up to what all that 

1186
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:37,350
religious belief was about.
And then,

1187
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,400
I mean,
and this is the place that I get into an

1188
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,220
easier pickle,
a pickle with Peterson as well,

1189
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,700
is the question of if we acknowledge 
that religious belief is adaptive,

1190
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,123
then all of the things that are true of 
adaptive phenomena kick in and the most 

1191
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:03,930
important one is that adaptive phenomena
are not timeless.

1192
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:08,550
They are adaptive relative to a 
historical time and place.

1193
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,950
And it may be a very long standing time 
and place.

1194
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,930
But the point is there is nothing.
It is purely magical thinking to imagine

1195
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,063
that religious traditions that are 
thousands of years old are the core of 

1196
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,770
the toolkit for moving forward.
Our,

1197
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:29,890
our existence in 2018 is so novel that 
if there's one thing we can be sure of,

1198
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:33,610
it's that are adaptive nature is a poor 
match for it.

1199
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,580
So then can anything be truly timeless?
Is that the right question?

1200
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,400
Well,
yeah,

1201
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:44,490
but the way you do it is this,
the longer standing,

1202
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:49,670
some truth of some kind is the closer it
gets to being timeless.

1203
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,890
In other words,
if we look at things that are,

1204
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,950
um,
very evolutionarily longstanding,

1205
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:57,683
well those things have persisted through
environments that were very different 

1206
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:01,944
from each other.
So what that means is that thread still 

1207
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:07,590
functions irrespective to an extent of 
the context.

1208
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,460
The longer it lasts,
the more likely it is to speak to truths

1209
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:14,270
that continue to be relevant,
but the,

1210
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,263
the bitter pill for modern people with 
respect to understanding the degree to 

1211
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:22,284
which evolution is the key to seeing 
ourselves properly is that we live in 

1212
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:36,140
circumstances that are more novel than 
almost any creature has ever faced.

1213
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,560
Now,
you know,

1214
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,393
a creature can fished and flop into a 
boat and it's suddenly a novel 

1215
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,770
circumstances and it's dead within 
minutes.

1216
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:44,623
Right?
Don't tell that to the dinosaurs in the 

1217
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,210
media was going well there.
Yeah,

1218
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,320
there you go.
That was so novel that you know,

1219
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:53,340
I mean dinosaurs didn't survive that one
group.

1220
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,500
The birds are still with us and they're 
doing great,

1221
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:02,150
but we are creatures living in 
circumstances that are not only novel at

1222
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:08,370
an unprecedented level,
but are changing so rapidly that even to

1223
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,560
the extent that we can figure out what 
to do,

1224
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,940
the world changes out from under us.
We have to stop that right?

1225
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:15,774
That is going to kill us.
That if you want to know what the 

1226
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:21,220
greatest existential threat to humanity 
is,

1227
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:22,373
it is the rate of change that we have 
set in motion which makes it impossible 

1228
01:05:25,781 --> 01:05:29,680
for us to adapt fast enough to it.
It has to be slowed down to a point that

1229
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:30,400
we can catch up.

1230
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,233
Is that impossible though,
because we already have that power 

1231
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:37,980
because I'm with you on this.
Just from my limited knowledge of this,

1232
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:41,580
just from what I do,
you know from doing these shows and that

1233
01:05:41,581 --> 01:05:42,414
people can watch more.
You know the amount of information that 

1234
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:47,400
you can intake on a given day.
The amount of things that you can share.

1235
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,430
You can speed things up and listened to 
them two times as fast.

1236
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:53,490
You can clip everything and that we can 
take all of this information.

1237
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,710
Things can be live streamed,
all of this,

1238
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,101
Bang,
Bang,

1239
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:56,401
Bang,
Bang,

1240
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:56,761
Bang,
Bang,

1241
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:57,930
Bang.
It's happening faster.

1242
01:05:57,931 --> 01:05:59,460
We're learning more.
We know there's a great

1243
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,600
thirst for this.
Um,

1244
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,320
but can it be slowed down?
I mean,

1245
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:06,763
what,
what force could slow down progress 

1246
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:10,790
really wisdom.
Um,

1247
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,123
and that,
that's the,

1248
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,700
that's the problem is that.
Thank you.

1249
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:19,060
We are children in this landscape and 
children grow up,

1250
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,380
right?
I mean,

1251
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:24,450
the key to raising children properly is 
to,

1252
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,353
is to back off the things that protect 
them enough that they actually get 

1253
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:33,370
burned without being burned so severely 
that they're crippled.

1254
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,273
In other words,
you have to experience the places that 

1255
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:40,150
your notions are naive in order to 
become less night.

1256
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,900
We are now in a situation in which we 
are behaving in a childlike fashion in,

1257
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,790
you know,
in a very,

1258
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:51,130
in a foundry or something like that.
Right?

1259
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:52,810
We're like children running around in 
the foundry.

1260
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:57,310
There's molten metal that we need to 
figure out how to recognize it,

1261
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:57,920
how not to.

1262
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,660
We were just pressing every button.
Buttons are cool.

1263
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:02,830
Our.
Yeah,

1264
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:05,280
we got to stop doing that.
I don't think,

1265
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:07,680
you know,
if I'm to be candid about it,

1266
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:12,270
I don't think we are in an unrecoverable
situation.

1267
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:17,130
I can see the path forward and it's all 
still plausible as far as I know,

1268
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,413
but I'm worried that we won't get there 
and the reason we won't get there is 

1269
01:07:21,151 --> 01:07:25,350
that there are lots of things that have 
been true that just aren't true anymore.

1270
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,740
In other words,
the people who are in love with,

1271
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,073
you know,
a limitless market in which you can do 

1272
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:33,930
anything that you can manage and it's 
all cool.

1273
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:36,780
And then at the point we find out that 
it isn't cool.

1274
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,570
We might have to take some action,
but in the meantime,

1275
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:40,630
you know,
you're,

1276
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:43,650
you're free to explore.
I'm very sympathetic to this view,

1277
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,580
as you know.
Well,

1278
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,653
I would be sympathetic to this view if I
didn't recognize that there was a 

1279
01:07:48,841 --> 01:07:51,240
problem in which,
for example,

1280
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:52,403
if you look at the way our economic 
system is hooked up to our political 

1281
01:07:56,521 --> 01:07:59,310
system,
there is a problem where anytime you set

1282
01:07:59,311 --> 01:08:04,311
a new force in motion in the market,
if that force pays at a high rate in the

1283
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:06,204
short term,
but it costs at a high rate in the 

1284
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,073
longterm,
by the time you get around to 

1285
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:11,004
discovering the costs in the long term,
it has found its way into the political 

1286
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:15,940
system so that it cannot be reversed.

1287
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,380
And you can't have a system in which you
can't reverse them.

1288
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:19,283
So this,
the simplest way to frame this would be 

1289
01:08:20,581 --> 01:08:22,380
some sort of crony capitalism kind of 
thing,

1290
01:08:22,381 --> 01:08:23,610
right?
Well,

1291
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,750
you know,
we're not,

1292
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:29,640
we're not truly free market because 
we've politicized competition basically.

1293
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,081
Well,
you know,

1294
01:08:31,081 --> 01:08:32,860
I tried to look at everything,
um,

1295
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,780
through an evolutionary lens.
And to me,

1296
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,040
politics and economics are just one more
landscape.

1297
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:44,041
And they're interesting because it's 
humans and humans are especially capable

1298
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,530
in this regard.
But the,

1299
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,770
um,
the natural tendency for a creature that

1300
01:08:53,771 --> 01:08:58,771
has found its way into a niche is to 
protect its access to that niche.

1301
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,950
And the way creatures do that is they 
freeze other creatures out.

1302
01:09:02,951 --> 01:09:05,710
So there is this natural pattern.
I mean,

1303
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:10,030
I can't not see it now that I now that I
understood that it exists.

1304
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:15,160
There's this natural pattern where the 
upstarts who succeed,

1305
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:19,270
the stories that we know we don't know 
about the upstarts that failed mostly,

1306
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:22,990
but you have startups that succeed end 
up tremendously powerful.

1307
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:24,303
And then they go through this process in
which they become hostile to upstart 

1308
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:29,644
newness and they become hostile to 
upstart and us for the most natural of 

1309
01:09:32,261 --> 01:09:33,094
reasons which is that their wellbeing 
depends on shutting down the process 

1310
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:38,140
through which they became successful.

1311
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:42,140
So this could be like facebook buying 
all their competitors and things of that

1312
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:42,620
nature.

1313
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,720
It's the,
let's put it this way,

1314
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:45,554
there are obvious versions and then 
there are innumerable versions that are 

1315
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:50,204
cryptic and we were never going to 
understand the whole landscape of ways 

1316
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:54,344
in which those who have reached this 
level of power that you and I will only 

1317
01:09:57,951 --> 01:10:01,010
dream about,
that they will then shut down the access

1318
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:02,810
to others.
It's like there's a,

1319
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,503
I don't even want to call it a 
conspiracy because it doesn't have to 

1320
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:10,820
have any consciousness to it at all,
but there is a tendency for,

1321
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:11,983
um,
for those who have succeeded to shut 

1322
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:18,250
down the,
the mechanism through which they see.

1323
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,093
I mean,
you can see this with a people 

1324
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:22,363
frequently remarking on the fact that 
immigrants are often not that wildly 

1325
01:10:25,311 --> 01:10:28,580
enthusiastic about further immigration.
Why is that?

1326
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,800
For obvious reasons,
you know,

1327
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:31,634
you're talking about do people who've 
just entered at the bottom of the 

1328
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:36,230
economic ladder want more competition?
Well,

1329
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:37,903
they're actually,
and there's a tension between what 

1330
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,813
people should want,
but you shouldn't imagine that there's 

1331
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:42,914
some immigrant ness that necessarily has
you favorable to anybody else who has 

1332
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:47,740
that label.

1333
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,573
Does this also sort of explain a little 
bit of what's happening in the tech 

1334
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:54,280
world right now in terms of it seems 
that these companies,

1335
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:55,091
twitter,
facebook,

1336
01:10:55,091 --> 01:10:55,924
youtube,
are potentially at least using 

1337
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:01,930
algorithms against their own audience,
a shadow banning people.

1338
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:06,931
I mean that they are basically now 
turning against their own people because

1339
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:09,700
of their,
whatever they perceive to be their own,

1340
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,340
uh,
protection or longterm health.

1341
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,174
Even though I would argue in most cases,
that's not really what's going to 

1342
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:16,614
happen.

1343
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,250
Oh,
without question.

1344
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:22,760
This is what's going on and let's put it
this way.

1345
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:25,640
If you're at the top,
if you're in that strata,

1346
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,170
you have a lot to lose through anything 
you can't predict.

1347
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:31,303
And so there is a way in which we expect
the upstart who got there through some 

1348
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:39,374
sort of radical transformation to be 
favorable to route a radical 

1349
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:42,764
transformation.
But the way we should understand it is 

1350
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:45,074
that once you've gotten there,
radical transformation becomes 

1351
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:48,074
threatening and you start to 
conservatizing evolutionary force and 

1352
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,483
you know,
we can look at what twitter is playing 

1353
01:11:56,151 --> 01:12:01,151
with these days with the potentially 
eliminating like some follower counts.

1354
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,090
You know,
at a breathtaking act of paternalism,

1355
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,110
you know,
at best and are doing it for us,

1356
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:09,951
for us,
right?

1357
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,620
Because we shouldn't be so concerned 
about who's paying attention.

1358
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:16,930
But really the truth is,
as much as we all recognize that there's

1359
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,600
a problem with,
you know,

1360
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:23,600
tweeting to get trivial likes,
on the other hand,

1361
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:28,790
understanding what your audience hears,
what they find favorable,

1362
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:32,870
what doesn't ring true to them is the 
way you learn,

1363
01:12:32,871 --> 01:12:33,704
it's the way you steer.
And so effectively twitter is playing 

1364
01:12:36,831 --> 01:12:40,970
with blinding us so that we can say 
whatever we want into the void,

1365
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:44,780
but we have no idea how it,
there's no ping back to you basically.

1366
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,440
And so,
you know,

1367
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,910
I mean,
I don't need to tell you,

1368
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,400
you're a comic,
you're standing in front of the room and

1369
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:50,050
you get

1370
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:52,210
a lot better when they laugh.
It's better,

1371
01:12:52,211 --> 01:12:53,790
it's better when they laugh.
Yeah,

1372
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:54,970
exactly.
Yeah.

1373
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,120
Um,
what should we be thinking?

1374
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:59,170
You know what?
Before I get to that.

1375
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,570
So as you know,
I was just in a,

1376
01:13:01,571 --> 01:13:02,404
in Europe and I did a bunch of the 
Scandinavian and Nordic countries and 

1377
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,573
Sweden was a particularly interesting 
case because I know that our fifth most 

1378
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:13,750
viewed country for this show is Sweden,
which is sort of fascinating considering

1379
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:15,430
how tiny Sweden is.
Uh,

1380
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:16,264
so I,
I sort of circled that we did two shows 

1381
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:18,574
in Sweden.
I kind of circled them on the calendar 

1382
01:13:19,901 --> 01:13:21,940
because I was like,
something's going on in Sweden.

1383
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:22,774
I want to figure out what it is now.
I thought if you would have asked me 

1384
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:25,894
before I did the show that first night,
I thought it was gonna have a lot to do 

1385
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:29,194
with immigration.

1386
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:30,813
What I realized,
although there were a lot of questions 

1387
01:13:31,931 --> 01:13:33,780
about immigration at the end,
uh,

1388
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,653
it had much more to do with gender and 
what is happening to their highly 

1389
01:13:39,551 --> 01:13:44,551
egalitarian society that have done most 
of the things related to gender and true

1390
01:13:44,951 --> 01:13:47,290
equality correctly for many,
many years.

1391
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,273
And all of our friends on the left 
always point to Sweden and Norway and 

1392
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:51,814
Finland.
These countries that I was just at as 

1393
01:13:52,601 --> 01:13:53,434
the examples of their perfect societies 
and they're really struggling with 

1394
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:58,084
certain things that you know,
that the government is forcing them to 

1395
01:13:59,591 --> 01:14:02,150
have genderless kindergartens and that 
the,

1396
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:03,043
the emasculation of men and the removal 
of the father and that they have 

1397
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:11,110
supposedly Europe's first feminist 
government and all of these.

1398
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
So I thought as long as I have you here 
and since gender seems to be such an 

1399
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:21,360
endlessly a provocative and also 
misunderstood topic,

1400
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,750
um,
what should we do on gender right now?

1401
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,180
Yeah.
Um,

1402
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,283
well beyond you go to Sweden and 
figuring out what's going on here 

1403
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,290
because something.
Well,

1404
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:36,010
what it struck me as is that they've 
done everything right in effect in terms

1405
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:38,230
of egalitarianism and they've done it 
for,

1406
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,300
for decades now.
They've done it right.

1407
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,830
And when they got to the end,
which is now,

1408
01:14:42,831 --> 01:14:43,664
and they got to the current day,
they realized that despite all of this 

1409
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:48,640
equality,
men and women are still different.

1410
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:53,200
That women still care more about people 
and men still care more about things.

1411
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:56,230
So even though they've been given the 
exact same opportunity,

1412
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,513
women are still becoming nurses and men 
are still becoming engineers and it's 

1413
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,540
like the social justice warriors or 
whatever you want to call that crew,

1414
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:08,230
they still don't like the results of 
true equality.

1415
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,950
So I think that's why Sweden's in such a
weird place,

1416
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,390
the average person's like,
what?

1417
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,490
We've done it right when we did it 
right.

1418
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,260
Everyone's equal,
you can do whatever we want,

1419
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:20,920
but then the result isn't being allowed 
to be accepted.

1420
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,450
Does that,
does that make some sense?

1421
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,440
Oh,
it makes perfect sense.

1422
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:24,810
I think

1423
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,643
the,
uh,

1424
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:31,700
the naive left finds the failure of its 
hypothesis absolutely galling.

1425
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:36,863
And so they're effectively trying to 
erase that failure by hard coding the 

1426
01:15:40,321 --> 01:15:41,460
solution into government.

1427
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,620
So I think that's exactly what's 
happening happening

1428
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,453
in Sweden right now.
And it's tragic and with respect to sex 

1429
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:49,710
and gender,
it is so needless,

1430
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:50,783
right?
The fact is the truth of sex and gender 

1431
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,723
is,
there are parts of it we don't fully 

1432
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,360
understand yet,
but in general,

1433
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:58,343
actually we do.
We pretty much understand how we got 

1434
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:05,601
here.
And the truth is it is asymmetrical.

1435
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,173
It is a complimentary,
the truth of male and female is a 

1436
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:13,983
complimentary truth.
It may be largely irrelevant in the 

1437
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,780
present.
In other words,

1438
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,243
technology has eliminated most of the 
basis on which the division of labor 

1439
01:16:24,271 --> 01:16:25,104
between men and women initially evolved,
so I think we have actually an 

1440
01:16:28,561 --> 01:16:33,310
opportunity here to become,
to behave in an enlightened fashion that

1441
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:36,720
the the easiest place to solve this 
problem is sex and gender.

1442
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:37,853
What we should do is pretty clear and it
is not hard to ground and evolutionary 

1443
01:16:43,021 --> 01:16:48,000
theory because unlike other places like 
a race for example,

1444
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,420
we do know what to think with respect to
sex and gender and the.

1445
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,273
The basic outline is this.
Men and women are different for 

1446
01:16:55,441 --> 01:16:56,274
historical reasons.
The basis for that difference and the 

1447
01:16:59,701 --> 01:17:04,701
utility of that difference has largely 
been neutralized by the modern world.

1448
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:11,270
We don't need to retain those 
distinctions,

1449
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:15,440
but some of those distinctions are built
in at a deeper level than others.

1450
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,333
So meaning you could potentially be a 
stay at home dad and that could be 

1451
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:19,454
perfectly fine,
but that probably for evolutionary 

1452
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:25,600
reasons is not going to be the thing 
that usually happens,

1453
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,100
right?
But here's my point.

1454
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,223
We can democratize access to almost 
everything with respect to sex and 

1455
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,704
gender.
There are very few places where we 

1456
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,010
actually need to have,
um,

1457
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:44,690
some asymmetry in access,
but probably,

1458
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:45,883
you know,
the firefighter who comes into the 

1459
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:49,034
burning building through the roof to 
pull you out when you're panicking and 

1460
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,560
you don't know what to do because you've
never been in a fire before.

1461
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,570
Um,
on average,

1462
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:59,030
that should probably be a guy.
They're just better built for it.

1463
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:03,170
If there's a woman who is well enough 
able to do it,

1464
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:04,123
should you be picky about the 
firefighter who plucks you out of the 

1465
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:07,640
burning building?
Absolutely not.

1466
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,520
I mean,
I personally am thrilled to see it every

1467
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:13,100
time it runs against the narrative that 
we expect.

1468
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,300
Right?
You know,

1469
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:15,310
I,
uh,

1470
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,390
I'm very fond of Stacey Brown,
the,

1471
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:21,980
the police chief at Evergreen who was 
driven out along with heather and me.

1472
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:26,210
I thought it was great that she was 
female and that she was a,

1473
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,800
an excellent cop.
So I'm,

1474
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,800
I'm up for the narrative being broken 
by,

1475
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:31,970
by,
uh,

1476
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:37,370
by reality as often as possible,
but you democratize the access,

1477
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:42,260
but you don't force people to do what 
they otherwise would for one thing,

1478
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:46,460
you wouldn't even want to force it 
because for every job that you would,

1479
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:50,690
you know,
force women into it some higher rate,

1480
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:53,840
let's say engineering jobs because it 
sounds like a good thing to do.

1481
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,793
There's some awful job that men are 
disproportionately represented in that 

1482
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:00,260
you would also have to force them into 
to be fair.

1483
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:05,120
So you democratize the access.
You recognize that the division of Labor

1484
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:05,983
that we have,
that we have inherited is largely 

1485
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:09,270
outdated.
Um,

1486
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,860
but you don't a override people's,
uh,

1487
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,510
show me,
you know,

1488
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,070
if,
if women,

1489
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,293
if you democratize access to engineering
perfectly and women go into it at equal 

1490
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:23,300
rates,
great.

1491
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,090
If they don't,
that's cool too.

1492
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:28,130
Um,
so in any case,

1493
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:28,964
it's,
it's a question of allowing liberty to 

1494
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:36,020
decide where people go after you've done
away with not barrier.

1495
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,460
Well,
it's so interesting because I think then

1496
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:39,280
you hit it right on the head that,
well,

1497
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,173
Sweden's now politicizing it.
They're making a point of making this 

1498
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:43,154
political because they will not accept 
the science of what they've done 

1499
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,880
correctly.
And I think that that is what is,

1500
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:54,080
what is lead this sort of average person
there to go this,

1501
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,760
this is just not right.

1502
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,713
So it's,
I don't know what the way out is and I 

1503
01:19:58,191 --> 01:20:00,320
sense that most of the people there 
didn't know at the way I was.

1504
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:01,183
Well,
I mean the way out really is to 

1505
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,094
recognize that the,
the ire of the authoritarian left on 

1506
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,630
this point is actually indicative of the
whole problem.

1507
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,063
In other words,
because sex and gender is more or less 

1508
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:21,171
clear,
the desire to erase it,

1509
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:26,990
irrespective of the collateral damage is
an indicator of just how wrong this path

1510
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:30,150
is.
So,

1511
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,333
you know,
I find this all the time where people 

1512
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:33,863
have,
if you're not focused on biology and 

1513
01:20:37,141 --> 01:20:40,620
you're focused on the world that you 
find in your galled by,

1514
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:43,020
uh,
by inequality,

1515
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,603
then you think,
well,

1516
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,340
let's just solve the inequality.
Which is hard code the solution,

1517
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:52,590
but then you hard code the solution and 
it says men and women of the same to the

1518
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:55,320
extent that there's any difference in 
what they choose to do,

1519
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:56,154
that's the result of a either cryptic 
barriers or internalized misogyny or 

1520
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,214
whatever,
and then the problem is you're now 

1521
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:06,130
interfering with my biology class.

1522
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,103
You're now telling me that we that the 
received wisdom is that men and women 

1523
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:11,064
are the same thing.
When I know damn well that can't be 

1524
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:13,164
right,
so you don't want to build a solution 

1525
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,390
that forces you to confront your 
biologists,

1526
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,490
physicists,
your statisticians,

1527
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,713
right?
You want all of these stories to the 

1528
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:27,690
extent that they're true,
have to reconcile all true stories,

1529
01:21:27,691 --> 01:21:28,524
records to the extent that you've got a 
naive notion over here and you want to 

1530
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:33,773
just write it in because it seems very 
important to you and you're willing to 

1531
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:38,010
tolerate all of the cascading effects 
elsewhere.

1532
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,900
You don't belong in a position of power.

1533
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:41,843
Unfortunately though,
a lot of those people are in a position 

1534
01:21:43,571 --> 01:21:44,404
to power and I think we're seeing more 
of them get into positions of power and 

1535
01:21:46,981 --> 01:21:49,680
I think it's also now having a counter 
effect in Europe,

1536
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:50,514
which is why we're seeing the rise of 
more far right parties because people 

1537
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:55,650
are just like,
screw this,

1538
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,680
this is so wrong.
I'm going to take my chances over here.

1539
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,760
People who inherently are not say far 
right or certainly not racist,

1540
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:03,803
are now playing with people that perhaps
they wouldn't have played with before 

1541
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:08,160
because they're so sick of this.
And I.

1542
01:22:08,161 --> 01:22:09,720
and I'm worried where that leads us.

1543
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:10,370
Oh,
I think,

1544
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:11,360
I think this is exact,
and I've,

1545
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:14,000
I've heard you say this,
is that you were afraid that the,

1546
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:19,150
the lunacy over on the authoritarian 
left is actually going to collapse.

1547
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,720
It's going to leave people who otherwise
wouldn't play ball with the far right.

1548
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,700
Yeah.
Over there.

1549
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:27,160
Um,
and not because they're racist.

1550
01:22:27,161 --> 01:22:27,994
That's the key to this.
It's not that they'll suddenly become 

1551
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,590
wake up and be racist or hate women or 
hate gays,

1552
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:35,710
but it will be such a disgust of,
of reality.

1553
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:36,610
And,
and a,

1554
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:39,880
and a rejection of what's provable,
that they'll be like,

1555
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,980
at least there's something over here.
I mean,

1556
01:22:41,981 --> 01:22:43,390
it's,
it's an awful bargain,

1557
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,250
but I think it is.
I think,

1558
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,590
I just think it is.
I see this,

1559
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,060
uh,
frequently where people,

1560
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:51,043
you know,
because they detect that there's 

1561
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:57,881
something wrong with communism and 
socialism are often driven,

1562
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:03,140
right pretty far into the let's not 
regulate anything camp and the answer is

1563
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:08,141
actually have to regulate stuff just out
of a desire to continue as a species.

1564
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,850
So,
you know,

1565
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:10,743
I don't want to see people driven 
because there's something wrong over 

1566
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:15,040
here.
I don't want people to be driven into,

1567
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:18,190
into a reactionary position that is not 
justified.

1568
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:23,410
The thing on sex and gender though is 
maybe this is the key question.

1569
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:24,993
Every reasonable person who just simply 
observes the world knows that men and 

1570
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:34,210
women are not the same thing.
They know that,

1571
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:35,133
uh,
those differences have an implication 

1572
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,880
for the way we view all sorts of things 
like mating and dating,

1573
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,900
what careers we want to have,
how we view risk.

1574
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,940
And all of these things for historical 
reasons.

1575
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,073
All reasonable people can infer that 
from their own observations of the 

1576
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:51,034
world.
You are now confronted with people who 

1577
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:57,970
insist that you not acknowledge what you
can see.

1578
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,850
Those people are crazy,
right?

1579
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,713
They're dangerously out of control.
They're dangerously out of control on 

1580
01:24:05,181 --> 01:24:07,900
other topics where it's harder to know 
what's true,

1581
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:14,190
but you wouldn't want people who were so
naive as to argue that men and women are

1582
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,780
effectively identical,
but for depression,

1583
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,913
in charge of any policy,
you don't want them in charge of 

1584
01:24:19,271 --> 01:24:20,940
economic policy,
in charge of,

1585
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,000
uh,
you know,

1586
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:24,040
a prisons,
anything.

1587
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,313
Um,
so having seen just how far their 

1588
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:33,721
confusion goes,
can we all agree to shut them out of the

1589
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:34,564
discussion about how power is to be 
wielded and the rest of us can have a 

1590
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:40,150
discussion about what our values are,
what we think we know,

1591
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:42,760
what we don't yet know,
and what its implications are.

1592
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,500
That that's the place we should go.

1593
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:47,750
That seems like an effective ending 
here.

1594
01:24:47,751 --> 01:24:48,584
Unless you want to throw in one more.
Did we not hit something that's been 

1595
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:53,180
rattling around in your brain?
Actually,

1596
01:24:53,181 --> 01:24:56,750
he's a know I covered a lot of territory
here.

1597
01:24:56,751 --> 01:24:57,471
Yeah.
All right,

1598
01:24:57,471 --> 01:24:58,304
well it's always a pleasure sitting down
India and you joined me last night for 

1599
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:03,860
standup in Bray California.
This'll be up already,

1600
01:25:03,861 --> 01:25:07,670
but you're joining me tonight in Oxnard.
I'm turning you into a standup comic,

1601
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:09,960
which is a biologist.
Worst nightmare.

1602
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:10,990
I don't know.
It's a,

1603
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,770
it's not quite the,
uh,

1604
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,833
the thing where you're,
the lead singer of your favorite band 

1605
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:16,934
has laryngitis state,
but it's about as close as I could hope 

1606
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:20,691
to go.
Yeah.

1607
01:25:20,691 --> 01:25:22,060
All right.
Well we're going to do this.

1608
01:25:22,061 --> 01:25:22,820
I will do.
Well,

1609
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,860
we did it about a year ago after the 
original one,

1610
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,190
but we'll do this more than once a year 
because you're,

1611
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,810
you're right in the center of all the 
things that I think are,

1612
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,930
are right at the moment and for more on 
Brett,

1613
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:33,913
follow him on twitter as long as they 
can track how many followers he has at 

1614
01:25:37,851 --> 01:25:38,684
Bret Weinstein.
