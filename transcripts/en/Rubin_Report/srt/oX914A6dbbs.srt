00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,350
Joining me on the show this week is 
author,

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,350
speaker and Associate Director of the 
Henry Jackson Society,

3
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:08,184
Douglas Murray.
I've been familiar with douglass work 

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,833
for almost a year now.
His name kept popping up in my twitter 

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:16,680
feed after the Charlie Hebdo shootings,
like last week's guest,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,533
Ayaan Hirsi Ali Douglas has been a 
relentless defender of free speech even 

7
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,384
when it isn't popular to do so.
Part of my awakening about the 

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:24,774
regressive left came around the same 
time as Charlie Hebdo when I saw more 

9
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,040
concerned for political correctness then
for the victims of the horrific attack.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,053
I was really impressed with.
Douglas is clean and clear explanation 

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,250
of why free speech must be protected at 
all costs.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,530
And that's one of the issues we're going
to talk about today.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,650
This is where I should tell you the 
Douglas Murray is a neo-con.

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,320
The word neo-con sounds kind of evil to 
me.

15
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:48,170
Sorta like a decepticon.
Uh,

16
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:51,480
and like decepticons neocons are big on 
world domination,

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,980
or are they.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,993
Well,
that's where we're going to find out 

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,640
when we talked to Douglas today.
You know,

20
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,474
we get so lost in throwing around labels
all the time that we hardly know what 

21
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,194
they mean anymore.
As I understand that a neo-con is 

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,710
someone who wants to spread democracy 
through military intervention and we all

23
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:09,750
know how well that usually works out.
Right?

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,953
Uh,
well this is just generally thought of 

25
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,360
in the American Lens,
but is it the same for the British?

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,430
I want to find that out.
Am I way off altogether?

27
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:18,264
I want to find that out too.
And that's what we're going to talk 

28
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,210
about.
Some of you might be thinking,

29
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,340
Dave,
you've been labeling the regressive left

30
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,174
for weeks now.
How is that different than labeling 

31
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,100
someone to neo-con?
I think the thing is here that we had to

32
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:29,934
identify what the regressive left stands
for us so that we could also identify 

33
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:33,990
what we stand for.

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,900
As I've said before,
I felt the need to talk about the lunacy

35
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:37,734
on the left because there just weren't 
enough voices amplifying the battle of 

36
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,340
ideas that you guys all want to have.
That's why you're here.

37
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,930
And that's what I'm going to continue to
do.

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,450
So today,
as I sit here with someone firmly on the

39
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,640
right,
a scary neoconservative,

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,683
let's all have a battle of ideas and 
actually listened to what he says and 

41
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:55,944
then formulate opinions on those ideas.
Let's not do what the regressive left 

42
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:02,190
does,
which is label someone and then prejudge

43
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:05,130
everything they say based on that very 
label.

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,353
I think there's going to be agreement,
disagreement and everything in between 

45
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,563
and it's our ability to have those 
honest conversations and know that 

46
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:16,830
people we disagree with can feel as just
an as principled as we do.

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,320
That's the spirit that I'll continue to 
do this show in.

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,930
While I do want to continue having these
types of conversations,

49
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:22,764
I also want to assure you guys that 
we're going to be widening the net 

50
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,270
around here as well.
I want to talk politics,

51
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,200
science,
culture,

52
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,040
and more.
Of course,

53
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,890
free speech and the battle of ideas will
always be a mainstay,

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,560
but I don't want to become a one trick 
pony either.

55
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,603
Next week I have two people who are 
putting many of the ideas we've been 

56
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:38,964
talking about into action,
David Keys and Faisal Al Mutar from 

57
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,194
advancing human rights.org.
They're using the tools of democracy to 

58
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,264
help advance human rights in parts of 
the world where the people are most 

59
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,610
effected by the ideas we've been talking
about.

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,440
The point is I'm going to keep mixing it
up,

61
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,980
keep letting me know what you guys think
and who you want me to talk to.

62
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
Most importantly,
let's keep pushing the conversation 

63
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,990
forward so we can build bridges where 
others were just tear them down.

64
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,850
Douglas Murray is an author,
a journalist,

65
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,684
and atheist,
a neoconservative and an outspoken 

66
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,340
defender of free speech.
Douglas,

67
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,350
now that I've labeled you all sorts of 
things,

68
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:18,184
welcome to the show.

69
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,440
Very nice to be with you.

70
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,720
I told you right before we started that,
you know,

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,380
we've only been doing this show for 
about two months now,

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,513
but I,
you by far I've had more requests to 

73
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:28,754
have you on then pretty much anyone else
because you seem you seem to be like 

74
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,134
this sort of hub of free speech and free
thought and that even though I think 

75
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:40,550
maybe we don't line up exactly 
politically,

76
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:41,384
people wanted to see us sit down.
So I'm excited that you took a little 

77
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:45,494
time here.

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,180
I look forward to hearing our 
differences.

79
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,131
Alright,
so.

80
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:50,964
Alright.
So first what I want to start with is 

81
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,184
the word neoconservative because it's 
really the first thing that if someone 

82
00:03:56,461 --> 00:04:00,690
googles you that pops up that you were a
neoconservative or a neo con.

83
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,670
Now I know since I come from the left,
this is a real buzzword for my people.

84
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:07,470
They,
they freak out on this.

85
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,720
I think that you're some sort of 
imperialist,

86
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,010
this kind of thing.
So first I thought,

87
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,023
well let's just get what the definition 
of neoconservative ism is from you 

88
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,213
first.

89
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,390
It's quite nice to know that's the first
thing that comes up on Google.

90
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,263
What I expected far words were basically
people have been moved from the left in 

91
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:34,210
the postwar period in America and 
famously described themselves.

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,730
Thanks.
So I've been crystal as being.

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,690
Liberals have been mugged by reality.
The truth is that now I wrote a,

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,450
I wrote a book on neo-cons about 10 
years ago now.

95
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,600
And um,
the truth is,

96
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,540
is that the word neoconservatives with 
ms.so

97
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,070
filled with pejorative connotations.
Everyone thinks they know what they mean

98
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,710
by that.
I,

99
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,230
I wrote a book partly to correct those 
ms dot apprehensions.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,210
I didn't think it was remotely 
successful in that regard.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,620
Um,
but,

102
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,021
uh,
I,

103
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,090
I'm,
I'm,

104
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,920
I'm not that bothered about the term.
I think it is interesting and it remains

105
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,763
interesting,
the movement of people from a liberal 

106
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,690
position as it were.
Um,

107
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,863
but apart from that,
I think has gotten relatively little 

108
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,450
relevance today.
I think the word is probably noxious for

109
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,470
at least a generation,

110
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,650
right?
So I think within an American context,

111
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,950
it basically means using military force 
to spread democracy.

112
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,130
Is that,
is that fair to say?

113
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,580
Um,
no.

114
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:35,330
I mean,
actually,

115
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,500
mainly no conservatives in America where
we're not interested in foreign policy.

116
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:40,400
The first,
first,

117
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,190
certainly a glitch weren't,
uh,

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,300
but,
uh,

119
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,760
certainly in recent years it's been 
perceived.

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,750
I wouldn't say that in terms of bringing
democracy,

121
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,584
I think the most striking a 
neoconservative foreign policy idea was 

122
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:56,090
really that idea that you could use 
military force for humanitarian means.

123
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,940
It partly solved a sort of imbroglio 
that cut for a long time by that point,

124
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,700
which was that people on the left,
broadly speaking,

125
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,190
didn't believe in the use of force and 
people on the right,

126
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
broadly speaking,
didn't think that humanitarian 

127
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,124
catastrophes where the sort of thing you
use the military for neoconservatives 

128
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:17,480
were few people to sort of meld these 
things together and say actually,

129
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
as in the Balkans,
the use of military force to alleviate 

130
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,003
human suffering and to prevent,
in that case even worse genocide 

131
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,560
occurred was a good thing.
However,

132
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,130
I mean,
um,

133
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,930
as we all know the last 10 years,
if,

134
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,943
if it's possible for a neoconservative 
to be a liberal who's been mugged by 

135
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,594
reality,
then I think it's probably possible now 

136
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,580
to be a neoconservatives who's been 
mugged by reality as well.

137
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,933
So I guess this is why labels just suck 
in general because I think what you're 

138
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,364
saying is there's,
there's various lines through here that 

139
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,294
you could be someone that does believe 
in nation building and obviously there 

140
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,704
are some people that do believe in 
nation building and then you could be 

141
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,404
someone that just purely believes on 
intervening on Humira and humanitarian 

142
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,910
regards and probably several other 
things beneath that.

143
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:04,744
Right?

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,633
Absolutely.
I think that thing of that being a sort 

145
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,180
of coalition with people from left and 
right,

146
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,014
who certainly met I think in the 
nineties over the Balkans mess again in 

147
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:15,930
a bit and the early part of the last 
decade,

148
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,793
but I think since that aligns that 
occurred is suddenly gone and sold in 

149
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,420
different ways.

150
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,350
Okay.
So that's.

151
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,470
I just wanted to start there just so 
that people have a little bit of a sense

152
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:26,304
of the word and don't get too hung up on
it before all the commenters start 

153
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:30,370
yelling at you right out of the gate.
Uh,

154
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,463
so I wanted to start also with that,
where I became familiar with you was 

155
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,693
right after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in
France because you were all over the 

156
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,610
media and I saw an interview.
Uh,

157
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,810
it was a discussion on Al Jazeera and 
you were incredibly,

158
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:53,811
I thought lucid and clear and clean and 
your explanation of why we can have no,

159
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,673
um,
we can have no give when it comes to 

160
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:59,154
free speech.
So I thought you could possibly explain 

161
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,064
that for me.

162
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,770
Yeah,
that wasn't the best interview I've ever

163
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:10,771
had.
One always tries to be polite of course,

164
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,230
but um,
it was a bit much,

165
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,240
but within 24 hours a of the 12 people 
being shot dead in Paris,

166
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,580
the Algiers you inviting me on,
I wanted to have a discussion about what

167
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,960
this would mean about the,
uh,

168
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,400
allegedly nascent European hatred of 
Islam and Muslims and,

169
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,650
and so on.
The,

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,810
the socal backlash thing,
um,

171
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,733
and uh,
I was fairly furious about that because 

172
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,064
I thought that this was obviously 
diverting attention from actual dead 

173
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:48,361
bodies onto a potentially hurt opinions,
hurt feelings and so on.

174
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,890
And um,
anyhow,

175
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,800
I did actually,
it was a prerecorded for what it's worth

176
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,010
and I went back,
uh,

177
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,003
uh,
afterwards and said to a colleague or 

178
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,650
they're never going to wear that 
because,

179
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,484
um,
I think I did at some point give the 

180
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,703
interviewer who was sitting in Doha a 
piece of my mind about the fact that he 

181
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,960
seemed to,
uh,

182
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,780
well he didn't like it,
let's say when I pointed out he lived in

183
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,614
an unfree country and was working for an
unfree media and that I wasn't 

184
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,574
answerable to him.

185
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,790
I still haven't actually got the fee for
that interview

186
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,983
because

187
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm not being asked back either.

188
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,980
I'm guessing the check is not coming in 
the mail,

189
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:23,814
so I would just let that be.
So what I liked about that though is 

190
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,520
that you clearly.
So yeah,

191
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,770
you called out the interviewer in Doha,
but really you were,

192
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,380
you were really calling out your own 
media,

193
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,060
right?
You were calling up people in the UK and

194
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:36,894
you were calling out people in France 
and probably in America and all over 

195
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,870
these,
that sort of.

196
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,704
We were doing this to ourselves 
literally before the bodies had been 

197
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,284
buried.

198
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,420
Yes.
Well,

199
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,920
you know,
it's,

200
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,003
it's,
was recognizing in a way when you've 

201
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:51,824
lost.
We've lost every round of the free 

202
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:57,560
speech wars in recent years from the 
satanic verses a fair on.

203
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,710
Whereas we always sort of get a 
technical,

204
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,670
uh,
there's always,

205
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,040
there's always a technical way out.
We allow ourselves,

206
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:04,671
you know,
I mean,

207
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,470
I'm off the satanic verses,
you know,

208
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,630
thank goodness someone wished you 
remained alive.

209
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,760
But,
but basically everybody has been.

210
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,663
Has this been often said,
internalize the fact why there's never 

211
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:15,590
been another book.
Like the satanic verses published.

212
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,570
There probably won't be in our 
lifetimes.

213
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm off to Charlene Abdo.
You know,

214
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:21,684
people walked through the streets of 
Paris world leaders in that sort of 

215
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:25,664
preposterous parade through Paris.
Parisians holding up pencils as if this 

216
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:32,984
was an act of defiance.
No inactive defiance would have been if 

217
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:38,060
everyone had marched through Paris 
holding a cartoon of Muhammad,

218
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,463
the act of defiance on the part of the 
media that was so desperately trying to 

219
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,640
find a way to be showing alliance with 
they're slaughtered colleagues.

220
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,503
The best media could do is to sort of 
repeat the same weasley excuses even 

221
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,690
doing for 10 years since the Danish 
cartoons,

222
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:56,600
the FA and try to save their dignity.
I mean,

223
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,570
it's a very undignified site.
I think the media,

224
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,940
uh,
after all we've got,

225
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,700
remember it probably awards itself more 
awards than anyone else in the world.

226
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,640
Uh,
I know firemen and policemen don't,

227
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:08,474
don't,
don't have endless award ceremonies for 

228
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,380
their bravery and give each other metals
and so on.

229
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,880
But journalists are doing it all the 
time.

230
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,580
There is lots of journalistic bravery,
don't get me wrong,

231
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,420
but,
uh,

232
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,253
the reason why we keep on failing and 
this is because actually our media as a 

233
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:23,084
whole and most individuals just don't 
want to make the kind of standard which 

234
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,553
if we'd made it 20 years ago,
we wouldn't have to keep on going 

235
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,304
through today.

236
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,223
Right.
And I suppose that's why people are 

237
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:36,760
responding to you the way they're 
responding to you and responding to what

238
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:37,594
we're doing because it seems,
it seems late at this point by us 

239
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:45,400
talking about free speech.
It seems so late and overdue and I think

240
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:46,234
that's why there's been this,
this sort of groundswell of support for 

241
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,430
what we're doing.
Do you agree with that?

242
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,060
I hope so.
I mean,

243
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,840
you know,
I'm,

244
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,340
I'm a bit pessimistic about the,
you know,

245
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,860
the possibility of another satanic 
verses.

246
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,300
But look,
I mean,

247
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,483
things could change,
but it certainly seems to me that a lot 

248
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,124
of people are increasingly aware of the 
fact that we live in an age of 

249
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,803
extraordinary caladis at an age of 
cowardice that masquerades as an era of 

250
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,100
truth telling.
Um,

251
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,350
you know,
I mean,

252
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,183
but these things are very confusing.
I think for most people when they're 

253
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:18,080
living through them.
You know,

254
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,240
if,
if you just said,

255
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,790
if you just said I didn't know in 1999,
uh,

256
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,723
if I didn't see me,
you'd see me in one of us had said to 

257
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:25,901
the other,
you know,

258
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:30,460
the 21st century is going to be racked 
across the Western world with blasts for

259
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:35,461
me was you just thought you must be 
drunk or I'm at the most.

260
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,380
If you believe that prediction,
you would have said,

261
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,200
well,
how do the Spanish inquisition come back

262
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,210
into Europe here?
How did that occur?

263
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,073
How did I know?
How did the Catholic Church remains 

264
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,990
returned to medieval times and start 
burning heretics?

265
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,820
Well,
no one would have thought that in 2015 a

266
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,654
newspaper offices across the world would
be debating whether they could show a 

267
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:06,310
little cartoon or some guy just,
just,

268
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:08,410
just to not even have the,
I mean,

269
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:11,500
not even as it were,
accurate photo fit of Mohammed,

270
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,940
just anything which they then say could 
be called Mohammed.

271
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,220
You wouldn't have believed that this 
would be the thing that broke a,

272
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,910
um,
the western press,

273
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,050
but it.
But it is.

274
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,993
Yeah.
So was was one of the most infuriating 

275
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:30,381
parts for you that actually what Charlie
Hebdo did was incredible satire,

276
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,153
making fun of all religions.
So I saw in that Aljazeera piece and in 

277
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:38,290
another piece where people were saying 
that this was racism,

278
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,143
what they were doing was racist,
but actually it was the reverse of 

279
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,624
racism.
They were fighting for the principles 

280
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,710
that the left is supposed to believe in.
Right?

281
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,780
W W,
w what?

282
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,693
Let's not forget the fact that we live 
in an age when everyone not only has an 

283
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,224
opinion but is expected to have an 
opinion and most people therefore have 

284
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,470
to mug up very fast on things they know 
nothing about.

285
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,860
So after Shawnee Abdo and January,
a lot of people were just cropping up on

286
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,560
things who had always said he never 
actually seen a copy of Charlene.

287
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,040
I've never actually,
uh,

288
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,350
read it or seen the cartoons or new 
anything very much about it.

289
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,113
But one of the immediate attacks on the 
dead journalists was of course to say 

290
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,310
they were racist.
That was probably for me,

291
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:26,311
the thing which I have to keep going 
during that period.

292
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,243
I thought it wasn't remain under the 
belief that it was intolerable that a 

293
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:32,314
group of people could go through the 
front doors of the newspaper office in 

294
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:34,954
Europe and gum people down with 
Kalashnikovs and then for their fellow 

295
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,280
travelers to,
as it were,

296
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,350
more pub afterwards by saying,
well,

297
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,513
they were kind of racist anyway.
I didn't know much about them until 24 

298
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:45,814
hours ago,
but I'll say they're racist and then 

299
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:51,890
nobody needs to mind.
I thought that was a real low point.

300
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,190
Yeah.

301
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,370
You know,
we've been calling them.

302
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:54,204
It's a,
it's a phrase that marginalized coined 

303
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,620
the regressive left.
Uh,

304
00:14:58,621 --> 00:14:59,454
and is that really where they have 
failed us as a society more than 

305
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:07,350
anything else by this meme that 
everything is racist.

306
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,050
Everything is based in,
you know,

307
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,893
if you,
if you say anything you hate women or 

308
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:13,410
you hate gays,
all of this,

309
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,273
this idea that people on the other side 
that you disagree with can't be as 

310
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:18,924
principled as you are.
Is that where the left has really 

311
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:21,504
failed?

312
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,483
Oh,
you want me to just start with 

313
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,180
describing why the left?

314
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,940
Then I'm going to push it and then I'm 
going to put you on somebody.

315
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,030
Look,
the problem is several things.

316
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:33,864
Firstly,
just because people aren't religious 

317
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:36,054
doesn't mean they don't still want to be
thought to be good by their 

318
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:38,544
contemporaries and their peers.
And it used to be quite straightforward 

319
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,990
to demonstrate how are you a good.
Well,

320
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,830
today we're sort of making it up on the 
hoof,

321
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,840
you know,
I don't know.

322
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:46,674
Um,
we've got to be the most frenetically 

323
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:52,390
supportive person ever of whatever the 
latest rights issue,

324
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,910
but really the deepest,
uh,

325
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,460
um,
a desire of.

326
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:57,990
I wouldn't say it from the left,
it's just this,

327
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,020
whatever this movement is that being so 
gripping in recent years to 70 people,

328
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,423
I think a predominant thing is,
is that people want other people to be 

329
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,830
racist.
They want people to be racist.

330
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:11,664
They want Nazis.
They are fighting a war that was 

331
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:20,571
effectively finished consummately 70 
years ago and they don't seem to realize

332
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,060
it or they want to look as brave as the 
people who fought narcissism,

333
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,320
but they can do it from their home on 
skype or twitter or facebook.

334
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,640
And,
you know,

335
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:30,060
the,
the,

336
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,893
the,
these people are in so many ways 

337
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:33,204
disappointed people because the number 
of Nazis around these days is quite 

338
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,210
small in number,
thankfully.

339
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,200
Uh,
um,

340
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,033
I mean there's a supply and demand 
problem or there's an enormous demand 

341
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:46,050
for Nazis,
but not much of a supply.

342
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,120
So people go scouring around,
uh,

343
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,200
the social media is media,
political landscape,

344
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,303
desperately trying to find people who 
they can call Nazis or racists in order 

345
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:00,900
to position themselves as therefore anti
racist or anti Nazi.

346
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,320
These people need this because they need
to feed off it and they're great hope is

347
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:07,854
that they can call everybody else racist
when and then be the only person 

348
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:15,210
standing who's not a racist.
It's,

349
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,500
it's,
it's terrible.

350
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,360
I mean,
these people are not only fighting,

351
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,823
as I say,
uh,

352
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,860
I pretty much dead battle about they're 
wasting their lives in the process.

353
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,590
Right?
So is that where the,

354
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,650
the meme of Islamophobia has come in and
been dealt with in such a dishonest way?

355
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,833
I'm going to guess that you wouldn't 
argue that there's no people that hate 

356
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,580
Muslims,
right?

357
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,100
You agree that some people just hate 
Muslims,

358
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:40,880
right?

359
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,950
Sure.
And people hate all sorts of people.

360
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:43,300
Yeah,

361
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,133
sure.
People hate people because of their 

362
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,870
color or their religion or whatever,
so their sexuality,

363
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:48,704
whatever.
But this idea of Islamophobia seems to 

364
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,004
me that it's taken on this new thing 
where you're not allowed to hate an 

365
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:57,840
idea,
not people.

366
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,381
Yeah.
I,

367
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,214
I,
uh,

368
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,083
I think this is one of the most 
successful ways that anyone's come up 

369
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:05,470
with in recent years to shut down 
debate.

370
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,160
It's no surprise that the people who 
started off the I,

371
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:09,994
the term Islamophobia,
the people who were keenest on it from 

372
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:15,700
the outset in the 19 nineties own words,
what were his limits?

373
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,790
Uh,
they wanted to portray themselves as the

374
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,390
only defenders of Islam against these 
haters.

375
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:25,630
These people who hated all Muslims,
hated the religion.

376
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,390
It's been a trickle that's been going on
for a very long time.

377
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,210
Yeah.
We just,

378
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,800
just to clarify that the word came from 
the Muslim Brotherhood,

379
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:34,634
right?
Yeah.

380
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,520
Yeah.
I mean,

381
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,353
I don't think people realize that they 
think it came from some think tank 

382
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,250
probably in the United States.

383
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,261
No,
it,

384
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:41,720
it,
it,

385
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,490
it was just picked up by such people.
Um,

386
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,760
and I,
I think when a real problem because a,

387
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,210
still most people when they hear the 
cry,

388
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,890
Islamophobia Think,
oh,

389
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,260
this must be a,
you know,

390
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,170
some racist problem and so on,
and the problem is among other things,

391
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:04,171
and it's scooped up any and all 
criticism of anything to do with Islam.

392
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:05,950
And,
and that means that,

393
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,700
uh,
uh,

394
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,640
if you come out with a criticism of the 
Muslim Brotherhood,

395
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:10,510
for instance,
the group,

396
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:13,540
which is eminently possible to criticize
a,

397
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,180
you are being Islamophobia.
Uh,

398
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,073
if you say you don't like something 
which may well be very fundamental to 

399
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:21,574
the Islamic faith,
you are being Islamophobic and that for 

400
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:26,014
the time being,
and I think this will change and it may 

401
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:30,840
change very fast and very nastily,
uh,

402
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,710
but for the time being,
Islamophobia trumps most other things.

403
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,270
So for instance,
um,

404
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,191
uh,
I,

405
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:40,070
you know,
you could be the,

406
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,480
you can be the most outspoken feminists 
of your generation,

407
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,880
but if you said something that was 
Islamophobia,

408
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,920
Islamophobia would,
for the time being trump,

409
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,590
feminism and so on,
gays by the way,

410
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:52,870
go really down low in this pecking 
order.

411
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:54,940
No one really cares about that,

412
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,140
right?
Actually,

413
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:56,974
people seem afraid to talk about the 
fact that isis is literally throwing 

414
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:03,850
gays off the roofs of buildings.
There's no outrage over that,

415
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:04,230
right?

416
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,250
It should get it.
It should not be easier than this,

417
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,600
uh,
isis,

418
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,840
throw gays off buildings,
uh,

419
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,833
criticize isis and what's more,
criticize the ideology that they are 

420
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,963
coming from.
I mean,

421
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,963
I,
isis poses an enormous problem because 

422
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:25,320
Isis don't get their ideas from nowhere.
They didn't invent them yesterday.

423
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,430
They always publish along scriptural 
explanations,

424
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,590
uh,
from the Koran and had he,

425
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,240
of why they're doing what they're doing.
Now,

426
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:38,241
that doesn't mean that people should say
isis through the gaze of the buildings.

427
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,170
Therefore,
all Muslims hate gays.

428
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,004
Therefore,
all gays or anyone else should hate 

429
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,220
Muslims obviously.
No,

430
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,920
of course.
Yeah.

431
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,390
But obviously you have to identify where
the problem comes from and I mean,

432
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:49,224
you know,
I look around and I find ones of people 

433
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,340
willing to do this,
uh,

434
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,410
uh,
at the moment,

435
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,820
you know,
and just a quick one,

436
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,121
you know,
the,

437
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:55,870
the,
I mean,

438
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,740
you always get reached to the National 
Union of students in Britain if you want

439
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,574
to reach for a bunch of idiots at the 
National Union of students in Britain 

440
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:04,720
recently,
didn't,

441
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,803
uh,
didn't condemn isis because they said 

442
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:11,920
that it would be Islamophobic to do so.
So while Isis,

443
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,773
uh,
throwing gays off buildings and raping 

444
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,294
young girls for the alleged crime of 
being a Yazidi or occurred or from a 

445
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,070
Muslim sect,
the,

446
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,750
a group,
men,

447
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,290
men have a rapist,
salacious.

448
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,780
Don't believe in it.
If you criticize that,

449
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,840
your Islamaphobic look,
as I say,

450
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,960
uh,
people are caught.

451
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,000
They're caught in this terrible,
terrible.

452
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,930
I'm a mess of half thinking a 
nonthinking and um,

453
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,950
everyone's got to find a way to help 
them think their way out of it.

454
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,360
But they've been to be quite fast.

455
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,650
They better be fast.
I fear that they're not.

456
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:44,810
So what would you say to the people that
would argue,

457
00:21:44,811 --> 00:21:45,644
well,
we really created isis because we went 

458
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,230
into Iraq,
which now by most accounts was the wrong

459
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,750
war to go into.
I'm not sure if you agree with that,

460
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,763
but uh,
and then by leaving so quickly the way 

461
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:58,130
we did,
we just,

462
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,053
it was a breeding ground.
It was fertile ground for religious 

463
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:02,504
extremism and all of this awfulness to 
happen so that it's not just about 

464
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:07,760
religion,
it's also about the geopolitics.

465
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,950
Can I make a point which doesn't always 
go down well with American audiences,

466
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:16,770
but I think he's worth pointing out as 
an outsider,

467
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:17,604
as a question because part of the 
American thought disease on this is now 

468
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,800
in Europe as well,
but it started with you.

469
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:26,460
We give you some bad ideas and you'd 
give us as well this,

470
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,010
this American,
um,

471
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,933
self obsession.
This American idea that nothing in the 

472
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,990
world can get screwed up unless it's 
because of America is a,

473
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:37,824
an intellectual disease.
You've got to get over the world can go 

474
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:45,180
to hell without America doing anything.
The world can go to hell without America

475
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:46,014
lifting a finger.
But every time anything in the world 

476
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,630
does go to hell,
Americans ask themselves,

477
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:54,690
what is it we did or didn't do that made
this happen?

478
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,190
That's why you still see the amazing,
uh,

479
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,070
an example of not only the president of 
the United States,

480
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:07,071
but other senior figures in American 
politics even wanting to apologize for,

481
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:08,580
you know,
the era of the Crusades.

482
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,310
I'm sorry,
this stuff happened centuries before,

483
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,920
uh,
before the British even discovered,

484
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,940
uh,
um,

485
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,520
uh,
the early cities of America and so on.

486
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:20,480
I mean,
you know,

487
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,001
this,
this,

488
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,260
this,
this happened before,

489
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,050
before the US was,
was founded.

490
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,113
Uh,
you keep blaming yourself for things 

491
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:33,441
before the creation of America.
And nobody is fooled apart from you.

492
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,583
I had a friend some years ago who went 
to interview Yasser Arafat and Iranian 

493
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,030
friend,
a journalist,

494
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,740
very distinguished journalists from 
Iran.

495
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,080
And he went to interview,
yes or I for some years ago.

496
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:44,780
And he said,
I'm at the end of the interview.

497
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,700
Uh,
it was a knock on the door.

498
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:47,534
And one of you asked about how fast 
goons or porthole or male friends or 

499
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,280
whoever,
I'm said,

500
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,383
Chairman Arafat,
the American delegation is here to see 

501
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:56,414
you.
And uh,

502
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,790
and my friend thought he had a scoop and
he said to,

503
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,680
I don't know who is this American 
delegation?

504
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,543
And there was a delegation that's come 
from the US to apologize for the 

505
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:08,270
Crusades.
And Arafat burst out laughing.

506
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,530
Everybody laughs at this apart from you.
Uh,

507
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,610
um,
isis was not created because of George W

508
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,443
Bush,
uh,

509
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,260
uh,
um,

510
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,580
al Qaeda wasn't created because of Bill 
Clinton or George Hw Bush.

511
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,120
There are things that America can do 
well and things that can American can do

512
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:26,954
badly.
And there are things you've done that 

513
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,544
haven't held.
There were things that Britain has done 

514
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,870
that hasn't helped,
but it is not all because of you.

515
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,170
Right?
So I,

516
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:37,220
I do agree we have a way of making 
everything about ourselves.

517
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:39,720
Maybe it's because we're a young 
democracy and a lot of respect.

518
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:42,440
So we're still in our infant tile phase 
perhaps.

519
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,323
Do you guys not have that in England?
Because obviously England has done all 

520
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,330
sorts of imperial things,
far more far,

521
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,900
far richer history of materialism than 
the United States saying you guys,

522
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,470
you guys don't have that feeling is that
it doesn't exist at all.

523
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,753
Britain,
Britain could teach America something 

524
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:00,554
about imperialism and it can teach and 
he could teach America something about 

525
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:05,360
post and pivot as we've been going 
through.

526
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,000
We've been going through this for 
decades and rightly so.

527
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:08,840
I mean,
you know,

528
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,393
Britain,
like all countries are after their 

529
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:16,010
height.
It looks over what it's done and wonders

530
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,410
whether it was a force for good or ill 
in the world.

531
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:22,250
And we have periods where we are.
We seem to think we did no good.

532
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,084
And other times when,
when we realize actually that on 

533
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:26,810
balance,
maybe things were better than that.

534
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,300
Maybe.
Maybe we did more good than we did harm.

535
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:32,360
It's always in the balance that goes up 
and down and perhaps so it should.

536
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,950
But the fascinating thing to me again 
about this is it's so one sided.

537
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:37,820
I mean,
you know,

538
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,953
we hear all the time about what empires 
do and about the British empire and 

539
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:43,264
about the mandate in Palestine and about
America is really quite minimal 

540
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:47,714
involvement or at least quite brief 
involvement to date in the Middle East 

541
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,080
and so on.

542
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,530
But you know,
why don't we ever talk about Turkey?

543
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:57,800
Why don't we ever talk to them.
One of the most important,

544
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:01,670
the longest and largest empires in human
history was the Ottoman Empire.

545
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,570
I never hear anyone from America or 
Britain or anyone else saying,

546
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,404
you know,
the Turks have got so much to answer 

547
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,713
for.
Nobody ever says the Turks have done so 

548
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:16,640
much wrong in the Middle East and until 
we punish them sufficiently,

549
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,653
you wouldn't hear this.
It's only people in America and Britain 

550
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:22,124
and the rest of the west who so self 
obsessed and I know so little history 

551
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,871
and,
and,

552
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:27,704
and what,
what we think is we will be able to 

553
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,154
solve it if we beat ourselves up and we 
could beat ourselves up for every year 

554
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:35,834
we have in the future and it still 
wouldn't solve the problems in the 

555
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,580
Middle East.
It wouldn't solve Iraq,

556
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:42,740
it wouldn't so serious.
Wouldn't solve Turkey,

557
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:44,370
wouldn't stop Isis.
It wouldn't do anything.

558
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,413
It's a luxury.
It's a luxury that I think is a kind of 

559
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:49,200
decadent luxury.
I don't,

560
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,310
I don't approve of it.
You may have,

561
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,830
may have gotten,

562
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,150
but I think I got that idea.
So it sounds almost like a sort of like,

563
00:26:55,151 --> 00:27:00,150
you see this as like a disease of the 
Western mind sort of that we've,

564
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,053
our,
our society because of our freedoms has 

565
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:03,874
moved so far past some of these other 
places that we turn everything on 

566
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:09,604
ourselves.
We don't realize sort of how good we 

567
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:11,970
have it or something to that.

568
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,350
Well,
and also it's laziness.

569
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,180
It's laziness masquerading as moral 
sophistication.

570
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,430
You know,
if,

571
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,970
if you go to a dinner party,
I mean,

572
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,340
I know you went at a,
I mean this is,

573
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,183
this is squared for you there,
but if you were to go to a dinner party 

574
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,393
and somebody was going to see them about
Afghanistan and you wanted to say 

575
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:31,690
something really clever about 
Afghanistan,

576
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,524
you would probably say something about 
how terrible American involvement in 

577
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,410
Afghanistan has been.
Uh,

578
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,413
uh,
if you signed to any other power other 

579
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:42,790
than a western powers involvement in 
Afghanistan,

580
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,840
uh,
um,

581
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,730
it's not so sophisticated,
you know,

582
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,703
uh,
if you go from America or you go for 

583
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,660
Britain,
you go for yourself,

584
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,481
you know,
you,

585
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,400
you,
you look like,

586
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:53,020
you know,
something about African history,

587
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,810
which let's face it,
very few people do.

588
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,430
You start to look like,
you know,

589
00:27:57,431 --> 00:27:58,264
about African history and you also look 
like you're so morally sophisticated 

590
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,613
that you can even beat up on yourself.
And what it means among other things is 

591
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,290
you don't actually have to pay attention
to the world.

592
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,363
You don't have to go anywhere,
you don't have to really think about 

593
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,850
things.
You don't really have to keep up to date

594
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:14,860
because every time anything happens you 
can say,

595
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,400
well,
there was that time and you know,

596
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:17,950
and,
uh,

597
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,783
in,
uh,

598
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,360
and just come up with some date and uh,
and hey,

599
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:23,194
presto,
you walk away looking like you know 

600
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:26,740
something and looking like you're 
someone.

601
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,441
Yeah.
You know,

602
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:28,274
it's funny,
I never thought of it sort of through 

603
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:31,460
the prism that you're presenting it 
right now,

604
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,294
but I think Turkey is a really 
interesting example of this because if 

605
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm not mistaken,
since 1974,

606
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:40,340
Turkey's been in occupation of half of 
Cypress,

607
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:41,300
right?
Isn't that,

608
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,060
isn't this an occupation of a sovereign 
nation?

609
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,980
You still have one of my most salient 
important points I should have gotten.

610
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,450
Okay.
You all right?

611
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,700
So I just tossed it up for you.
Take it away.

612
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,000
I mean,
Cypress is,

613
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,060
is the most startling example of all,
you know,

614
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,983
Turkey is a member of NATO and there's 
an occupation of part of a European 

615
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,850
country.
Uh,

616
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,110
and I never hear anyone talking about 
this.

617
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:08,944
I mean,
you know,

618
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,790
unless you have Cypriot friends,
no one ever raises Cyprus at dinner.

619
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,883
Uh,
whenever anyone's got a placard on the 

620
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:17,800
street marching up and down and in the 
occupation,

621
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:22,120
they never talking about Cypress.
No one ever raises it.

622
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,530
Uh,
why?

623
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,530
Because they don't care and they don't 
know.

624
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,250
And I'm,
I know I'm in it.

625
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,084
It's these things.
You can only point these things out and 

626
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:36,610
hope that over time that trickle down to
this information gets somewhere,

627
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,320
you know,
but as I say,

628
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:39,154
in the meantime,
people have got a very narrow set of 

629
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:46,210
facts and the easiest way out is to 
think it's our fault.

630
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,130
Alright,
so I want to delve a little more into,

631
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,083
into Israel and Palestine and the 
imperialism and how it all happen and 

632
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:56,730
right.
People never talked that.

633
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,643
It all started with the Ottoman empire 
and then the British empire and the 

634
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,690
mandate and all that stuff.
But before we get to that,

635
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,703
let's just do a little bit quick on,
on Syria right now because it seems to 

636
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:10,190
me by every estimation,
it's no longer a country under any,

637
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,060
under any circumstances that we consider
a functioning country.

638
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,163
Um,
and it seems to me that we're at this 

639
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,564
point also basically just in a proxy war
with the United States pretty much in a 

640
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:21,524
proxy war with Russia.
And my completely oversimplifying it at 

641
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:25,694
this point.

642
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,563
Well No,
it's not quite approximate war with 

643
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,500
Russia.
It's something else.

644
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,380
The truth is,
is that Syria is the end of Syria,

645
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,230
the end game in this area as it were,
which I think we probably are in now,

646
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,850
is the end game that aside,
and the Iranians always wanted,

647
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,300
which is assigned against Isis,
um,

648
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,163
because if it's a sad against Isis,
they know that the world will not back 

649
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,890
Isis.
And you know,

650
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,733
earlier this year I started,
was interviewed by Jeremy Button at the 

651
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,820
BBC and said,
uh,

652
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,003
you know,
talks about the opposition as these 

653
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:03,820
terrorists of Isis and,
you know,

654
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,313
some years ago,
he wouldn't have been able to get away 

655
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,980
with that so much.
She still can't completely get away with

656
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:11,530
that line now,
but some years ago,

657
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:12,364
he certainly couldn't.
I knew and worked with some members of 

658
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,130
Syrian opposition more than 15 years 
ago,

659
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:18,964
I think to begin with and know and knew 
that there were people who were very 

660
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:23,854
good,
who wanted their country not to be run 

661
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:30,361
by the Bashar Al Assad family forever 
and wanted Syria to be the great country

662
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:32,350
it could be.

663
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,820
Um,
uh,

664
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:37,060
all of our hopes have gone.
Most of those people are dead now.

665
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,950
And side has got what he wanted and the 
Iranians have got what they wanted.

666
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,160
No one will bag isis,
quite rightly so in the end,

667
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:50,161
will allow us to remain in power a look.
This is to some extent,

668
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,723
um,
uh,

669
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,010
what happened is when we don't take any 
interest and don't really get involved,

670
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,153
I,
I've always been against us intervening 

671
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:03,580
in any major way in Syria for one reason
in particular,

672
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:05,240
which was that I always said that,
uh,

673
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,153
after Iraq and Afghanistan,
we should realize that we clearly don't 

674
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,444
have the desire,
the willpower or produce the people 

675
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:16,540
anymore in your country or mine who want
to spend,

676
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,530
you know,
20 or 30 years in this country governing

677
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:23,060
bits of it,
helping with infrastructure problems,

678
00:32:23,061 --> 00:32:23,894
with anything else.
We're good at going in and doing the 

679
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:27,364
first phase.
But we're no good at the follow up and 

680
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,240
we should realize that.
And in the meantime,

681
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,413
uh,
not be responsible for any country's 

682
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:35,014
collapsed.
The WHO's who's nation building 

683
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,260
afterwards,
we really don't want to do.

684
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,083
So you're not a very good 
neoconservative that I think because 

685
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,670
wouldn't,
because wouldn't all the people that are

686
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,400
going to label you neoconservative would
say you should be for all these things.

687
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,433
Will it be,
will he do the labels never listened to 

688
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,930
to actually say,

689
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,781
uh,
so what,

690
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:55,320
what should we do then?
Basically,

691
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,180
I mean without,
without really belaboring Syria,

692
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:59,220
because I know we could talk about it 
for two hours.

693
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:01,890
I mean,
at this point watching this country just

694
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:05,270
collapse and Russia filled the vacuum.
What should the role of the West v?

695
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,870
I don't think we have much of a role now
as I say,

696
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:09,420
oh,
the,

697
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,560
the opportunity for,
for backing would go guys,

698
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,460
the window closed very early in the 
conflict.

699
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,140
Um,
the truth is,

700
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:21,200
is that the future of Syria is not going
to be an American hands.

701
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,034
It probably never was.
It's certainly not and never was going 

702
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:28,430
to be in British hands.
Iran will win in Syria.

703
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,383
Russia will win in Syria.
Bashar Al Assad will win in Syria and 

704
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:33,494
everyone else,
including most of the Syrian people 

705
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:36,740
lose.
And that's the end game.

706
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:37,574
That's the result.
How much would you like it or not like 

707
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:40,550
it,
but that's the result.

708
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,451
Yeah.
Yeah.

709
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:43,280
I mean,
I basically agree with you on that.

710
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:47,210
How much of this do you think is that 
it's very obvious that,

711
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,200
that Obama just wanted out of this part 
of the world.

712
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,213
He just simply wanted out and the way we
left Iraq and everything else I was 

713
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:56,810
against,
I was against,

714
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:58,660
that's going into Libya was against 
this,

715
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,500
Syria,
all of this stuff.

716
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,100
But to your earlier point,
it seems like even if we do something,

717
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,050
everyone hates us and if we don't do 
anything,

718
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,750
everyone hates us.
Is that the ultimate irony here?

719
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,430
Well,
it's an irony.

720
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:13,740
There are many others as well,
but,

721
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,401
uh,
yes,

722
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:16,250
I mean it is true that when America 
rack,

723
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,183
so it gets blamed on when it doesn't act
to get blamed and sometimes that blame 

724
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:21,120
is,
um,

725
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,890
is worth listening to and sometimes it 
isn't.

726
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:23,724
I mean,
to some extent and how you have to 

727
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,370
listen to who it comes from.
I would say,

728
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,520
um,
uh,

729
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,150
um,
when people who criticize America or her

730
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,810
allies or country like Britain do,
so,

731
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,880
uh,
as helpful critiques,

732
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:36,714
you can usually tell and when people 
criticize America or Britain or any 

733
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:42,570
other country and they're speaking as 
enemies,

734
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,440
you can also tend to tell,
um,

735
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,070
uh,
so you know,

736
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:50,250
that there are lots of things that we 
can learn from this period.

737
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,113
I would think it would be very 
regrettable if America decided that the 

738
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,930
response to all of this will be the 
America will decide,

739
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:58,500
well,
we,

740
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,050
no one ever loved us anyway.

741
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,470
So we're going home.
You know,

742
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,450
you wouldn't have America to kick around
anymore.

743
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,510
Sort of lap is a Jeb Bush like line.
And I,

744
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,353
I hope that,
I hope that America doesn't take that 

745
00:35:10,261 --> 00:35:11,094
view,
but you know,

746
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,063
Obama as,
as I hope everyone also learns the 

747
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:15,660
lesson of Obama on this.
I mean,

748
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,840
bomb his predecessor and he found all 
sorts of ways,

749
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,713
uh,
uh,

750
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,693
to mark up the Middle East,
but Obama has as well how many new ways 

751
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,750
in,
in,

752
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,780
in,
in some ways,

753
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,400
uh,
you know,

754
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,090
a bomb was meant to be the president 
who,

755
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,953
who,
who brought the troops home and brought 

756
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:31,050
peace in the Middle East and um,
you know,

757
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:31,884
he did a bit of that,
but he certainly hasn't brought peace 

758
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,910
anymore than the waters receded and all 
that other stuff.

759
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,380
And it's been a very,
it,

760
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,180
it,
I think the Obama presidency,

761
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,163
the end of it,
people will realize not that his 

762
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,690
predecessors were terrific and that he 
wasn't or anything but that,

763
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,900
but the,
but the noblest aspirations,

764
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,023
uh,
it can all go wrong in wholly different 

765
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:53,214
ways.

766
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,980
Doesn't that Egypt speech,
the speech he gave in Cairo,

767
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:57,814
which really was the reset,
doesn't that seem like not just a 

768
00:36:00,551 --> 00:36:01,384
different time,
it almost feels like it was from a 

769
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,210
different planet at this point.
Right.

770
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,090
As,
as,

771
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,570
as did the Russia reset and as does the 
Russia reset now,

772
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,310
you know,
after 9:11,

773
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,520
uh,
I'm a Dick Armitage.

774
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,180
A famously said to the Pakistani 
ambassador who was saying,

775
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,014
you know,
uh,

776
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,090
oh wait,
no new usual guff about,

777
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:22,490
you know,
when an Isi and so on,

778
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:24,860
don't know who we know about our cage 
and all this sort of stuff.

779
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,983
Dig On.
A teacher said to a bang the table and 

780
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,900
when the Pakistani ambassador said,
you know,

781
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:33,020
there's a lot of history and you said to
bang the table and say,

782
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,590
history stops today.
It's a very noble a,

783
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,140
a threat.
But it's never true.

784
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,630
Um,
history didn't start a,

785
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,471
uh,
nine slash 11.

786
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:47,300
It didn't start with the beginning of 
the first Obama administration.

787
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,090
I,
I wish we were wiser about this anyhow.

788
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,833
Well,
I think in a world of twitter and vine 

789
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:58,140
and short videos,
our attention span just is afraid to the

790
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:58,974
point that people just forget history.
People just don't really care about 

791
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:02,784
history.
So one more quick thing on Syria and 

792
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:06,000
then we'll move on.
The refugee situation in Europe,

793
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,620
which I'm seeing these videos every day 
coming out of all sorts of different you

794
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,590
from Denmark and Sweden and Germany.
Just,

795
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:16,230
it sounds like an absolutely terrible 
situation.

796
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:17,064
And what I think is most interesting 
about it is nobody had heard about any 

797
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:21,300
of it a month ago.
I mean,

798
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:23,070
it basically started a month,
maybe five,

799
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:23,904
six weeks ago,
something like that before that it 

800
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,034
seemed like there was no refugee crisis 
and now it seems like an epic refugee 

801
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,564
crisis.

802
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,930
Um,
well,

803
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:34,080
I don't know.
It looks at that from that.

804
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,170
That's at least what we were getting 
mainstream here.

805
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,980
Well,

806
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,750
in Britain and of course you have,
I mean certainly southern job,

807
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,910
it's been going on for a very long time.
Obviously a and southern Europeans,

808
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:45,744
the Italians and the Greeks in 
particular and asking for help for a 

809
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,940
very long time.
And if you go,

810
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:54,230
as I did,
I'm a producer in south of Italy.

811
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,530
It's nearer to Libya than it is to 
anything else in it.

812
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,940
Thinking Sicily,
uh,

813
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,803
you didn't see the graves of,
of migrants who tried to get over going 

814
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,590
back 15 years or more.
Um,

815
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,780
so it,
it is quite long developing story.

816
00:38:08,781 --> 00:38:09,614
It's true that every year in recent 
years when you get towards the summer 

817
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,300
months,
there's a surge.

818
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,330
Obviously it's easier to cross the 
waters during those months.

819
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,590
This is a,
by the way,

820
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:19,424
I mean,
this is such a hugely complex story and 

821
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:23,840
it's one that really,
uh,

822
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,703
we're all getting wrong.
It's a classic example of the sort of 

823
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,430
twitter age not being,
not being really fit for purpose,

824
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,593
uh,
because this is one of the most 

825
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,823
extraordinary and vast and migrations 
that we've seen and it's being 

826
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,280
misunderstood by almost everybody.

827
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,473
The majority of the migrants who are 
coming into Europe and not from Syria 

828
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,870
for the Syrians comprise of a minority 
of the migrants.

829
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:50,704
You can pick your presenters,
some people think is a narrow and 20 

830
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:53,524
percent some people up to 40.
It varies obviously between the points 

831
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,600
of entry.
Um,

832
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,590
but,
uh,

833
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:02,590
the vast majority are coming from all 
over the world.

834
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:06,490
So people from Bangladesh,
people from coming from a,

835
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:08,260
um,
the farther east than that,

836
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,970
there are people.
The majority,

837
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:12,070
I would think by my mo,
my own observation,

838
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,220
uh,
coming from a sub Sahara in Africa.

839
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,050
And so when you hear statesman a saying 
and pundits and others saying,

840
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:20,884
well,
you know,

841
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,510
we need to solve Syria for instance,
and then we'll solve the migrant crisis.

842
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:27,520
These people don't know what they're 
talking about,

843
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,790
even if it was in America or Britain or 
any other countries,

844
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,653
gift to solve the humanitarian 
catastrophe of Syria that would only 

845
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,390
solve a part of the migraine crises.

846
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,520
Yeah.
What's your plan for Eritrea?

847
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,610
Has Anyone got one?
Has Anyone fortive one?

848
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:45,910
Can anyone point to Eritrea or on a map?
Uh,

849
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,773
uh,
we are so not fit for purpose in rising 

850
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,060
to this challenge.
And all that can happen.

851
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:54,040
I don't know if you having to lower the 
tone somewhat.

852
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,460
Benedict cumberbatch,
uh,

853
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,443
uh,
one of my compatriots was on stage in 

854
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,374
London the other night,
finished a performance of hamlet and 

855
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:02,254
berated the crowd and berated British 
politicians for not bringing in enough 

856
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:08,110
people.
That is the clever,

857
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,740
a caring thing to say at the moment.
We must open our doors.

858
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,230
Refugees welcome.
You know what?

859
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,423
In the UK,
a recent poll showed only seven percent 

860
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:22,741
of the British people wanted immigration
into the UK to increase seven percent.

861
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,063
It's the same across Europe.
People don't mind accepting genuine 

862
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:28,264
refugees,
but no one knows what to do with a 

863
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,294
number of refugees,
genuine refugees who are coming and 

864
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,413
absolutely nobody knows,
including Chancellor Merkel who having 

865
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,230
saved Europe,
uh,

866
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,000
in the financial crisis has now totally 
floundered on the refugee crisis.

867
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,830
And Angela Merkel doesn't know what to 
do.

868
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,843
The European Commission just recently 
tried to force quotas on European 

869
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:53,200
countries to take migrants they couldn't
and didn't want to take.

870
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,360
And as the European Commission issued 
that they admitted that that number they

871
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,194
were talking about was not fit for 
purpose because the number was so much 

872
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:03,640
higher.
What I'm trying to convey,

873
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,070
this is a continent wide catastrophe,
which we are at the beginning of.

874
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,980
And I think,
uh,

875
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,833
as I say,
we haven't even begun to rise to it and 

876
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,210
we're going to see,
I think terrible things.

877
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,330
A winter's coming.
Uh,

878
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,173
uh,
Sweden is now putting refugees intense 

879
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,220
because it's run out of properties.
Sweden took the view.

880
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:24,851
Let's let,
let,

881
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:26,710
let's show the world how generous we 
are.

882
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:29,720
Let's be,
they said a humanitarian superpower.

883
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,230
Now they're going to have to raise 
taxes.

884
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,303
They've got increasing public opinion 
against them and the top party in the 

885
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:38,630
polls in Sweden,
the humanitarian,

886
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,533
uh,
uh,

887
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,493
uh,
um,

888
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,670
hyper power of Sweden is the party of 
the January called far right now,

889
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,310
top of the polls in Sweden.
And we're going to see that everywhere.

890
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,171
Yeah.
Is that,

891
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:51,004
is that what's coming next?
Because that is what I feared that I 

892
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,090
think somebody like Bender Benedict 
Cumberbatch,

893
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:55,924
I think there's some well intended 
intentioned humanistic thing going on 

894
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:00,850
here.
Uh,

895
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,570
well I don't know about that actually.
I mean maybe,

896
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,510
maybe they just want to look like 
they're doing that,

897
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:06,740
but,
but if you,

898
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:10,050
you know,
it comes back to a really a core mistake

899
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,790
or error.
If you want to be generous,

900
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,653
be generous,
but don't demand other people to be 

901
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:17,330
generous for you.
Uh,

902
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,730
the head of the Scottish nationalist 
party a little while ago since she would

903
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,600
be willing to take in a Syrian family.
It's months since she said that.

904
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,450
And as far as I know,
there are no Syrians living with her.

905
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,593
Uh,
one of the top members of the Labour 

906
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,550
party said the same thing months ago.
So far as I know,

907
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,650
she hasn't got a Syrian family in her 
house.

908
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,980
Um,
I think this is posturing and it really,

909
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:40,890
it's not sincere because if you said to 
those people,

910
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:45,810
look for numbers that are actually 
coming and look at the numbers of people

911
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:46,644
who say they want to come,
you will realize that it is not only 

912
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:53,610
economically but societaly 
unsustainable.

913
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,550
So you would have to realize that

914
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,330
yeah.
So under the best of circumstances,

915
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,260
bringing these people in would be 
extremely difficult.

916
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,153
And basically what you're saying is 
we're doing this or this is being done 

917
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,850
under the worst of circumstances because
there's just simply no controls here.

918
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,550
Well,
there's no good.

919
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,383
Doesn't nobody knows who's coming.
Most people destroy their papers before 

920
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:18,150
they get here.
Most people pretend to be a,

921
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,740
a Syrians,
even when they're very obviously not.

922
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,980
Um,
and,

923
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,843
and the truth is,
as I've seen in covering this story in 

924
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:28,270
the south of Europe,
the truth is,

925
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,780
is that once you're in European waters,
your,

926
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:33,460
your in Europe and you never,
you never go back.

927
00:43:33,461 --> 00:43:34,570
There is no,
uh,

928
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,830
there's no particularly good way.
Even when this was a low point,

929
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,650
there was no particularly sophisticated 
way to work out who was,

930
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:42,484
who and to work out who was genuine,
who was an economic migrant and that's 

931
00:43:46,211 --> 00:43:48,820
whole system is basically broken down 
now.

932
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,090
So once you're in,
you're in and uh,

933
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:54,640
um,
I think this is going to,

934
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,563
it's going to obviously approve a 
potentially breaking challenge for 

935
00:43:58,781 --> 00:44:00,940
Europe because these are,
uh,

936
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:01,943
the owner,
Germany is meant to be bringing one 

937
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:08,020
percent of its population in addition 
every year for the foreseeable future.

938
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,590
Who pays for that?
Who Pays for those people?

939
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,580
I mean,
you know,

940
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,413
I'm not heartless about this.
I would like to see everywhere genuine 

941
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,344
refugees get asylum in countries,
hopefully return to their countries and 

942
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,360
help rebuild them when they're safe 
again.

943
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,240
But I would like genuine asylum seekers 
to get assigned.

944
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:26,074
But the moment,
the whole thing is so tied up that 

945
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:29,314
actually I think Europe's heart is going
to harden towards all of these people 

946
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,930
and in that lack of attention to the 
detail,

947
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:37,764
I think yes,
across Europe we see a catastrophe 

948
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:40,250
starting.

949
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,560
Yeah.
What do you make of the Gulf countries?

950
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:43,520
You know,
Kuwait,

951
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,660
Bahrain,
united,

952
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:45,860
Arab Emirates,
etc.

953
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,933
I read this morning that the six main 
gulf countries have taken in zero 

954
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,930
refugees.
These are theIr brothers,

955
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:54,741
are they not?
I mean,

956
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:55,790
what,
what's going on here,

957
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,040
brothers?
In the same way that the,

958
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,640
uh,
palestinians have their brothers.

959
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,790
We'll get to that next.
Uh,

960
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,810
um,
well,

961
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:07,811
look at the gulf state countries 
bringing no syrian refugees.

962
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:10,820
And one,
one kuwaiti official,

963
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,280
uh,
uh,

964
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,130
rina recent interview was asked why and 
said,

965
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,020
I'm a,
an interview in arabic.

966
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,660
It's on the net.
Uh,

967
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:20,490
said,
uh,

968
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,510
that the reason was because a qa,
you have to understand,

969
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:27,220
he said that we are very fragile island 
countries.

970
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,880
We are,
we can't take in all these people.

971
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,630
They are traumatized.
They come from a different culture.

972
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,460
You know,
it's a different culture.

973
00:45:34,461 --> 00:45:37,270
Syria,
we can't put up with them in the gulf as

974
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,220
much more like Sweden.
Why don't you go to Norway,

975
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:41,410
Sweden,
uh,

976
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,010
um,
and so now,

977
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,873
and you see,
it's another thing of people's good 

978
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:48,770
instincts being used against the 
european is here.

979
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,760
I don't hear that.
What european see is catastrophe,

980
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:55,730
what did we do?
We must be responsible.

981
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:58,190
What's our responsibility?
We must do this.

982
00:45:58,191 --> 00:46:02,000
We must do it even if it breaks us and,
and over in the gulf,

983
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,800
taking in zero people and they don't 
give a damn about it.

984
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,903
And frankly I think they probably find 
it quite funny that the europeans have 

985
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,580
fallen for the idea that this whole 
catastrophe,

986
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:15,110
it's the fault of the europeans.

987
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:15,940
Yeah.
Alright.

988
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,920
So I do want to move on,
but I have to backup for a second.

989
00:46:17,921 --> 00:46:21,040
So what are you thinking in the mind of 
someone like angela merkel?

990
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,530
What do you think?
She's actually thinking.

991
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,620
She has to know that it's not 
sustainable.

992
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:27,670
Right.
And I get it.

993
00:46:27,671 --> 00:46:28,504
She's either trying to have these lofty 
goals of trying to do something on 

994
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:33,244
humanitarian grounds or whatever.
What do you think really is going on in 

995
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,410
her head?
Also knowing that,

996
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:41,350
as you said before,
this probably is going to strengthen the

997
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:42,550
far right in Germany.

998
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:43,940
Yeah.
I mean it,

999
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,541
uh,
Germany,

1000
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,390
it may,
it may not actually be possible to solve

1001
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:52,391
it because in Germany for all sorts of 
obvious historical reasons,

1002
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,140
uh,
if you,

1003
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,120
if you say,
if you say in britain,

1004
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,441
uh,
I don't know,

1005
00:46:57,441 --> 00:47:00,800
we might have a migration so large that 
a british culture,

1006
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:03,830
but it's a cycle basically over.
If you were to say that if you've always

1007
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:04,664
not true at the moment,
but I mean if somewhere down the road 

1008
00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:06,854
you were to say that you,
you would still get most british people 

1009
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,160
sort of thing that,
you know,

1010
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,373
we're nice guy.
We enjoying ourselves a country where 

1011
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,900
we've been broadly a force for good in 
the world.

1012
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,650
They wouldn't want britain to be over.
Germany has a different thing.

1013
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:19,484
There are a lot of people in Germany,
a who for historical reasons and some 

1014
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:23,774
understandable historical reasons.
Basically think that german guilt can 

1015
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:27,554
never be alleviated and the anything 
other than the destruction of Germany 

1016
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:34,930
could never,
never rid Germany of its sins.

1017
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,093
Now,
my own view is that those people may be 

1018
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,630
in the years ahead themselves in a 
minority.

1019
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,793
I think it's quite hard to tell young 
germans that because of something their 

1020
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,244
grandparents did,
they have to abolish themselves as a 

1021
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,244
country or as a society,
but they've definitely got the problem 

1022
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:51,334
harder nicely.
You can see that in angela merkel's 

1023
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:54,214
response angle America when she was 
asked recently at the press conference 

1024
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,620
by nice german lady who just sort of 
said,

1025
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:00,454
you know,
isn't this,

1026
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,730
isn't this a problem for our country?
And I am concerned for my country.

1027
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,120
I was just brushed off by anglo marco as
if this woman was some wacko weirdo.

1028
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:14,110
It who'd come from recess deville.
And you see this all throughout.

1029
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:17,980
Let me give you one other very quick 
example of their least paquita protests,

1030
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,070
which I don't aGree with.
I'm,

1031
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,580
I'm concerned about them.

1032
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,560
Uh,
but I think that they are,

1033
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,093
there are all sorts of things.
They are obviously an anti islam 

1034
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:29,150
protests.
They will spend 90 migration process and

1035
00:48:29,151 --> 00:48:32,140
all sorts of other things,
but it's a legitimate,

1036
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,383
uh,
I'm used to be with time as legitimate 

1037
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,430
political grievance and needs to,
needs to have an eric angle,

1038
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,273
merkel users her new year message to say
that the piggy to protesters have a 

1039
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:44,913
coldness in their hearts if instead of 
that she had said the islamists who the 

1040
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:50,404
buggy to protests are mainly concerned 
about have coldness in their hearts and 

1041
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:54,094
we as germans must be careful not in 
response to this hatred to become 

1042
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,650
hateful ourselves.
Then that might be something.

1043
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:00,484
But because he,
angela merkel's problem is she can only 

1044
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:05,790
deal with secondary problems.
She can't deal with the primary ones.

1045
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:06,371
Very,
very.

1046
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:08,050
I said that will be a final,
final,

1047
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:08,884
final point.

1048
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,133
I don't know if you saw it,
but the other week a fascinating thing 

1049
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:12,664
happened at the un in New York angle.
Merkel was sitting next to mark 

1050
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,290
zuckerberg for lunch and,
uh,

1051
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,420
unfortunately,
uh,

1052
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,810
angela merkel's microphone was hot.
Everyone in politics and how the hot mic

1053
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:24,710
moment,
but how mike was still on it.

1054
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,410
Possibly the worst moment of could have 
been.

1055
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,300
I'm amazed it hasn't been picked up 
more,

1056
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,403
but she sat down to lunch beside mark 
zuckerberg in september in New York and 

1057
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:34,170
said,
whilst the mic was on tomorrow,

1058
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,043
looking at what can we do to stop people
writing anti-immigration things on 

1059
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:41,500
facebook,
and mark zuckerberg says,

1060
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:43,330
we're working on it now.
Look,

1061
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,403
I say This just as possible.
If you wanted to create a volcano in 

1062
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:49,384
europe,
the best way to do it will be to shut 

1063
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,533
down and stop legitimate public feeling 
about things and to say that is no good 

1064
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,250
saying that you objected to the 
migration on facebook.

1065
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,520
It should be stopped.
That is the biggest way,

1066
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,730
the fastest way to make sure the volcano
blows out of the site.

1067
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,673
Yeah,
and it seems so obvious to me that this 

1068
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:13,500
is what the regressive left has done by 
labeling everyone who doesn't agree with

1069
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:14,334
them racist.
They've created a situation where good 

1070
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:17,214
intentioned people,
liberals are now finding themselves 

1071
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,160
agreeing on a lot of things with people 
on the far right who they agree with.

1072
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:25,490
nothing else on the danger,

1073
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,830
I think.
I think.

1074
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:27,980
I think the fact

1075
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,050
is,
is that what the left has done in recent

1076
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,120
years with the term racist has basically
ended up,

1077
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:33,563
uh,
denuding the term of having any meaning 

1078
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,760
and,
or am or much meaning anyway,

1079
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:38,594
because if,
if everybody can be called a racist at 

1080
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:42,500
some point,
and generally very often,

1081
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,334
at least for various various grounds,
it means that you basically got no 

1082
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:46,724
terminology left when an actual racist 
comes along and I can sort of sense the 

1083
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:53,060
people just,
I'm not going to end up not caring.

1084
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,050
Uh,
in the future.

1085
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,760
I've always said,
I want this solved.

1086
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:56,923
I want this problem.
These sorts of problems dealt with in 

1087
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:00,194
order.
They're not dealt in the coming decades 

1088
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:06,701
by marine le pen and the,
your hydration elements in Austria,

1089
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,870
but a few people listen.
Yeah,

1090
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,733
I mean,
I totally hear that and that's why I'm 

1091
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:17,120
trying to bring this message that if we 
have to get the left back,

1092
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,970
otherwise we're just going to hand 
everything over to the right,

1093
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:20,870
which would be a disaster.

1094
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,703
All right.
Let's talk a little more about the 

1095
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:23,750
middle east.
Let's talk about Israel.

1096
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:24,584
Palestine.
We can probably knock that out and just 

1097
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,560
a few minutes and everyone will be 
satisfied.

1098
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:28,870
Right?
Um,

1099
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,560
okay.
So buddy seconds,

1100
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,760
thIrty seconds.
Let's do it.

1101
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:36,470
So I thought maybe the best way to do 
this because I do know how much you know

1102
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,980
about history.
Um,

1103
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,900
where should we start with this because 
what I'm noticing lately is that,

1104
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,933
you know,
as we're seeing the stabbings and the 

1105
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:45,224
shootings and all this,
the debate is rarely about what's 

1106
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:48,254
happening right now,
but now the debate is starting to be on 

1107
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,560
the partition plan.
Ah,

1108
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:52,394
the british mandate.
Like now it's starting to be unfurled 

1109
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,640
and people don't understand history as 
we alluded to earlier.

1110
00:51:58,730 --> 00:51:59,563
So where is a good place if we're going 
to have a decent discussion and try to 

1111
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:05,750
get some common ground here,
where is a good place to start with the,

1112
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,910
with the Israel palestine situation?

1113
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:13,450
I think the only place you to start is 
from where we are really,

1114
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,723
and an acceptance that on the part of 
people who are broadly anti as well and 

1115
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:21,780
acceptance by those people that Israel 
exists and that it's not going anywhere.

1116
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,730
You know,
I've,

1117
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,563
I,
I've spent a lot of time there in the 

1118
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:25,844
surrounding areas and the west bank and 
so on and spoken with a lot of 

1119
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,693
palestinian representatives and so on.
And one of the saddest things is when 

1120
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:34,074
you hear them talk about the occupation 
and you discovered that talking about 

1121
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:40,800
the occupation from 1948 because then 
you say,

1122
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:42,170
you know what,
you're,

1123
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,600
you're giving your future generations 
know,

1124
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:46,434
hope you're selling them a lie.
You're telling them that we'll get back 

1125
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,540
to tel aviv,
you know,

1126
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,510
we'll get back to the whole of jerusalem
will get back heifer.

1127
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,130
And so it's not going to happen is 
they're a bit,

1128
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,180
they're selling the young people a 
crock.

1129
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:05,250
And,
and I think it's a tragedy if it's,

1130
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,440
if they accepted that Israel is not 
going anywhere and Israel felt confident

1131
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:13,770
enough that the palestinians accepted 
that,

1132
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,580
then the negotiations for the border 
dispute,

1133
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,120
uh,
uh,

1134
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,190
frankly quite straightforward.
Um,

1135
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,380
uh,
you can see,

1136
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,090
you can,
you can see them on the ground.

1137
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,340
You can see basically,
uh,

1138
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,770
you know,
the israelis have one and basically when

1139
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,560
the palestinians have one and you can 
see that,

1140
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:31,931
you know,
the,

1141
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:32,580
the,
the,

1142
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,413
the,
the basis for what's often been called 

1143
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,260
the world's ugliest border.
Uh,

1144
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:37,950
but,
but,

1145
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,110
you know,
you have to start from the premise,

1146
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,380
let Israel is not going anywhere.
And,

1147
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,900
and I think it is one of the most 
striking things,

1148
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,420
uh,
that in 2015,

1149
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,350
so many debates on college campuses and 
in the media and so on,

1150
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:54,420
don't accept that fact.
And you know,

1151
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:59,230
if we had a conversation about a 
Pakistan and uh,

1152
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:01,740
and we started by saying,
you know,

1153
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,230
should Pakistan have been created or not
as a mistake?

1154
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:07,140
And we wonder If we could rectify this 
error.

1155
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,160
You know,
people would say,

1156
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,830
what are you talking about?
It's 20 slash 15.

1157
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,510
Pakistan's got all sorts of problems we 
need to talk about.

1158
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:15,240
But uh,
why are we talking about this?

1159
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:16,074
This is,
this is a problem from seven decades 

1160
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,350
ago.
you'd be a maniac.

1161
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:20,853
But,
but,

1162
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,400
but on Israel that's thought quite 
normal.

1163
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:26,370
Israel and Pakistan to the same age,
and these,

1164
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:29,460
these crazy Israel obsessives uh,
uh,

1165
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:33,450
keeP going back to the basis and they're
not going to win.

1166
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,830
That's over.
That's done.

1167
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,870
So what do you make of these people?
so because I see that,

1168
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:38,704
I see very clearly,
I try to tweet as much stuff as I can 

1169
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:41,674
about coexistence.
I want there to be two states for two 

1170
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:47,290
people and understand that people can't 
live in occupation.

1171
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,273
And I want everyone to be treated with 
dignity and have the right to self 

1172
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:54,190
determination and all that.
but I see nothing except on the,

1173
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:55,024
on the left.
All I see is just this relentless 

1174
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,900
demonization of Israel.
No matter,

1175
00:54:58,930 --> 00:54:59,950
no matter what they do.
Look,

1176
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:02,400
they left gaza.
There's not one jew and guys,

1177
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:03,700
a hitler would love the place,
right?

1178
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,860
Yeah.
No,

1179
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,530
yeah,
you'd feel right at home in certain Way.

1180
00:55:06,531 --> 00:55:07,580
Is that.
Yeah.

1181
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:08,740
But,
uh,

1182
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:13,670
but the problem is that by the way,
when you said tuesday,

1183
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:15,710
the tuesday solution doesn't exist.
It's dead.

1184
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,210
It's gone.
Uh,

1185
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,083
the best you can hope for now as a three
state solution because it's in no one's 

1186
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,660
gift to unite the palestinian.

1187
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:22,391
Right?
So I want to,

1188
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:24,860
I wanted to ask you about that too 
because it really is a three states.

1189
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:25,110
Okay.

1190
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:25,690
Yeah,
I mean,

1191
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,523
I don't know.
It'd be which you'd stopped using the 

1192
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,310
two to state idea.
Um,

1193
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:34,670
but you then have to ask some serious 
questions about the negotiating partners

1194
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:39,270
on both sides.
Now people like to say here and again,

1195
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:40,500
the clever thing to say is,
well,

1196
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:41,340
you know,
six of one,

1197
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,174
half a dozen of the other and so on.
It is simply not the case that the 

1198
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:46,224
israeli prime minister,
it Uses the rhetoric about the 

1199
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:50,880
palestinians like palestinian,
moderate,

1200
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,863
so called moderate leader.
Mahmoud abbas is used in recent weeks 

1201
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,860
about the jews.
Uh,

1202
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,260
you know,
mahmoud abbas was talking about the,

1203
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,110
we,
we,

1204
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:04,050
we don't want the filthy feet of the 
jews on our holy sites.

1205
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:08,850
I mean this doesn't even get very much 
coverage outside of the region.

1206
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,440
And if benjamin netanyahu had made a 
speech where he said,

1207
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:17,790
we don't want any filthy muslim or arab 
feet in our land,

1208
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,570
I reckon that would've made the front 
paGe of the New York times,

1209
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:23,070
you know,
I think it would be being,

1210
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,393
I think people would know about it,
does the most extraordinary incitement 

1211
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,760
now in the most extraordinary 
denigration and,

1212
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,350
and all that,
all that,

1213
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,370
uh,
allegedly,

1214
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:34,204
right thinking people in the west can do
is to say this is the man with whom you 

1215
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:41,460
must do piece because he's not as,
um,

1216
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,120
I,
I think that the world should,

1217
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,960
should concentrate less on the israeli 
palestinian dispute.

1218
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,070
You know,
I think it's,

1219
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,300
um,
it's over egged.

1220
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:52,750
It's got too much attention on it.
None of the attention helps.

1221
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,020
there are intractable problems around 
the world.

1222
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,880
Uh,
the sovereign question,

1223
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,580
the western starland question,
a cypress,

1224
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,850
all sorts of ones.
And,

1225
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,873
and actually a massive amounts of 
international opprobrium and attention 

1226
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:10,330
do nothing to solve these conflicts.
Uh,

1227
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:11,280
um,
you know,

1228
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,880
we have seen in recent years the,
the,

1229
00:57:13,881 --> 00:57:14,714
the,
the motif of our time fall apart in the 

1230
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:17,890
middle east.
And that was,

1231
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:18,903
and it was said by everybody from light,
from right and left throughout my 

1232
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:22,390
upbringing.
At any rate,

1233
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,530
if you could only unlock the problem of 
the paleStinian israeli dispute,

1234
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,780
the rest of the middle east will be 
solved.

1235
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,530
I heard this for years.
Uh,

1236
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,423
you know,
some of the israeli palestinian border 

1237
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:38,710
dispute and the economy of Yemen will 
boom and the iranians will see the point

1238
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:41,550
of gay rights and the saudis will 
understand,

1239
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,473
you know,
the potential utility of women in this 

1240
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,500
society.
It was obviously nonsense then,

1241
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,663
but we've seen it's nonsense in recent 
years we've seen it because the middle 

1242
00:57:51,671 --> 00:57:55,780
east has managed to fall apart with zero
israeli involvement.

1243
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,200
YeAh.
So is that the bigger issue here?

1244
00:57:59,201 --> 00:58:00,034
Is that sort of,
that we're really talking about a three 

1245
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,353
day thing because gaza and the west bank
are totally separate ruled by different 

1246
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:09,100
people.
And there's no reason to think that if a

1247
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:12,850
boss signed an agreement that hamas 
would abide by it.

1248
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:13,870
I mean,
in their,

1249
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,130
in their,
uh,

1250
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,023
you know,
their,

1251
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,830
what do they call it,
their charter.

1252
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,670
It says Kill all the jews.
So they're not going to suddenly change,

1253
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:22,563
so they're not.
So that's the strange part as I see 

1254
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:27,040
people in the west saying,
well,

1255
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,900
you know,
just make a solution,

1256
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:31,330
make a magical solution,
and they'll stop wanting to kill you.

1257
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:33,000
But it doesn't seem like there's a

1258
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,790
connection for those people.
It's not about the middle east.

1259
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,330
They've gfo never been there.
They don't,

1260
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,290
they don't know anyone there.
Uh,

1261
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,430
it's about them.
Goes back to that point I made the star.

1262
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,000
It's about them.
Uh,

1263
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:46,780
if,
if,

1264
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,890
if you say how concerned you are about 
this situation,

1265
00:58:49,891 --> 00:58:54,290
you come across as virtuous and 
knowledgeable cad.

1266
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,200
It's way out,

1267
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,213
right?
And yet there's one place in the middle 

1268
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,940
east that stands for their progressive 
values

1269
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,660
now and now they use the progressive 
values against it.

1270
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,490
Totally.
But if you highlight the fact that,

1271
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:06,520
you know,
uh,

1272
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:07,680
that in isRael,
uh,

1273
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:12,240
gays have everyone in one and in every 
other country in the region,

1274
00:59:12,241 --> 00:59:13,710
you get hanged people,
god said,

1275
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,260
detail why you bother,
why,

1276
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,460
why you pink washing,
why,

1277
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,970
why you doing this house for them and 
you,

1278
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,890
you're actually,
you know,

1279
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,360
for me it's not a detail.
I mean,

1280
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:25,910
I,
I mind whether I'm hanging with or not,

1281
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:27,050
uh,
uh,

1282
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:30,410
mind whether other gays are hanged on 
our mind,

1283
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,800
what their views are,
and a whole range of things in mind.

1284
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,520
There's a difference between a society 
in Israel is actually talking about what

1285
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:42,260
you do about ivf rights for lesbian 
couples and a few miles away,

1286
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,330
uh,
lesbians,

1287
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,203
lesbians don't get a look in on the ivf 
treatment or anything else I mind about 

1288
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:48,710
that.
These are details,

1289
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,440
but all of these things that used to be 
the things we used to say,

1290
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,850
well,
what we used to call me,

1291
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:57,530
the things that matter are now a brushed
aside as being odd.

1292
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:59,650
Don't you bore me with all that,
all that,

1293
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,540
all that,
all that,

1294
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,660
all those facts.
So you keep comIng up with.

1295
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,940
Yeah.
All right,

1296
01:00:03,941 --> 01:00:06,760
well you gave me a great segue there 
because I wanted to discuss one personal

1297
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:08,220
thing with you because you're,

1298
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,690
I personal.
You're going to get.

1299
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,501
Well,
we'll see.

1300
01:00:10,501 --> 01:00:12,990
We'll see how far I can push it.
You're openly gay.

1301
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,140
That phrase seems silly to me.
You're gay.

1302
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,380
Um,
and I wonder if for you.

1303
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:20,820
I'm gay also.
I don't know if you know that,

1304
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,260
um,
or,

1305
01:00:22,261 --> 01:00:25,170
and it shouldn't matter in any context 
of anything we're talking about here,

1306
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,153
but I wonder for you,
how much of the principles that you're 

1307
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:29,994
talking about and wanting to help when 
you talk about the lesbian that might 

1308
01:00:33,001 --> 01:00:36,330
live in gaza under hamas or any of this 
stuff,

1309
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,790
you know,
the people being thrown off the roofs by

1310
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,560
isis or women's rights here,
there,

1311
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,710
how much of whAt you talk about and what
you care about,

1312
01:00:43,711 --> 01:00:44,544
do you think has been colored by the 
fact that you and a lot of respects are 

1313
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:49,710
the other at the same time?

1314
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,820
Yeah,
a bit.

1315
01:00:51,821 --> 01:00:56,490
I think it's easy to over again most of 
my political ideas or not,

1316
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,920
uh,
not based on I know who I am or,

1317
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,410
or,
you know,

1318
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,280
then I like to think they're not me 
centric.

1319
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,253
Um,
I didn't like in politics on me centric 

1320
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:09,610
because I'm something therefore I have 
to,

1321
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,833
I like to think I,
I try to use reason and go beyond 

1322
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:14,803
identity politics.
I suppose there was some things which 

1323
01:01:16,031 --> 01:01:18,610
you notice some things which you might 
notice first.

1324
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,090
I do have a sort of view that when it 
comes to radical islam,

1325
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,273
of what we've seen in recent years,
a set of early warning sirens going off 

1326
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:31,030
basically around the world and some of 
those early warning sirens are gay.

1327
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:33,240
Um,
some of them,

1328
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:34,660
I mean bruce banner,
for instance,

1329
01:01:34,661 --> 01:01:38,740
the gay writer in scandinavia who went 
off as an early warning signal,

1330
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:39,790
you know,
uh,

1331
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,720
some of them are feminists,
some of them are,

1332
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:44,803
um,
some of them are from our religious 

1333
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:50,500
dissidence or you know,
minorities within a minority.

1334
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:53,080
And,
and of course some of jews.

1335
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,213
And I,
I think in a way that's interesting 

1336
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:57,154
because as I said,
I do think it's a basis for my interest 

1337
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:03,390
or focus on these areas.
But I think it's true that the,

1338
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,330
there's,
um,

1339
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,280
there's a lovely phrase that the 
composer benjamin britten volunteers,

1340
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,000
and I'll let her to another composer.
He said that,

1341
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,133
um,
the composers have one less layer of 

1342
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:12,364
skin than everyone else.
And I've often often thought that might 

1343
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:16,894
apply in some of these very programmatic
world events that were sort of starting 

1344
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:23,754
to go through at the moment,
is that there are a set of people who 

1345
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:29,610
feel it just a little bit before 
everyone else.

1346
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:32,940
And I think that's true of gay people.
A lot of gay people,

1347
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:33,774
a lot of them have raised close to that 
and don't care a lot or don't take 

1348
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:39,210
notice.
I think it's true of a lot of jews.

1349
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,350
I think it's true of a lot of minorities
within islam who suffered,

1350
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,810
um,
and,

1351
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,610
and others.
So it's true that it might be a habit,

1352
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:50,550
sort of early warning effect.
But apart from that,

1353
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:51,384
I,
I like to think that my politics don't 

1354
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:55,890
come from any rabbit.

1355
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,801
Yeah.
No,

1356
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:57,634
I,
I think the same thing about myself 

1357
01:02:58,511 --> 01:03:00,910
because I hate identity politics 
obviously.

1358
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,013
And yet I do.
I feel this kinship when I hear about 

1359
01:03:04,211 --> 01:03:07,750
gay people being killed somewhere in the
middle east just for being who they are.

1360
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:10,480
And then at the same time,
they're also,

1361
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,710
when you repress all these people,
it's fertile ground for all of the awful

1362
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:18,250
religious stuff to also take root.
So it's so multilayered.

1363
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:18,900
Right?

1364
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,480
But,
but,

1365
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:19,861
you know,
I mean,

1366
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:20,694
I do think that the,
I do think the big problem of our time 

1367
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:24,100
is the identity in,
in,

1368
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,610
in the western side is,
is this,

1369
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:30,530
is this basically self centered way of 
looking into the world.

1370
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:31,683
I haven't absolute bugbear,
which is people who start Questions by 

1371
01:03:34,761 --> 01:03:37,310
saying,
speaking as a and then say,

1372
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:39,440
you know,
speaking as a gay man or whatever.

1373
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,080
I mean,
you,

1374
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,550
you do it if you know it's going to wind
the hell out of someone I suppose.

1375
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,460
But I don't like that.
I don't like it when people start off as

1376
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,850
either speaking as a woman of puerto 
rican descent or anything.

1377
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:50,750
I get it again,
you know,

1378
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,670
if your point is good,
it'll be valid,

1379
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:54,900
whoever's saying it.
Um,

1380
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,700
but unfortunately,
uh,

1381
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,970
um,
I mean the whole,

1382
01:03:58,971 --> 01:03:59,250
the,
the,

1383
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,083
the amazing thing.
We're seeing a moment of that sort of 

1384
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,390
breakdown.

1385
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:05,610
I think of identity politics.
It's having a breakdown.

1386
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,453
I at the moment and that partly is it is
coming because it was always going to 

1387
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,413
collapse under the,
the way to its own absurdities and the 

1388
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,474
only answer to that when you sift 
through the rubble of that strange 

1389
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,393
spasmic collike movement in recent years
and the only way out of it will be 

1390
01:04:23,601 --> 01:04:25,160
through reason and,
and,

1391
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,990
and using rationalism and,
and,

1392
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,560
and,
and not trying to work out what we think

1393
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:34,700
about the world from what is most 
convenient for me because I may,

1394
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,193
but uh,
but trying to work things out on 

1395
01:04:37,521 --> 01:04:40,490
principles and there's quite a lot of 
work to do.

1396
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,510
Right?
Which is so crazy because when you think

1397
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,630
about it now I've sat here with you for 
probably about 50 minutes or so.

1398
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,673
I got no indication that you Were racist
or a xenophobe or any of the other 

1399
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:50,574
things that people might say about you.
I only got an indication that you want 

1400
01:04:53,521 --> 01:04:57,570
to deal with the realities as they are 
not sort of as you want them to be.

1401
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,240
A.
So my last question for ya,

1402
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:00,074
and I barely looked at my notes because 
we could do this for hours and I hope 

1403
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,810
next time you're in town,
we'll,

1404
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:08,040
we'll do it in person.
But my last question is gimme gimme some

1405
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,270
hope.
What can we,

1406
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,210
what can we take at this interesting 
moment as you said,

1407
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:15,390
you see identity politics crumbling.
I see the same thing.

1408
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:20,500
What can we as a secular people as,
as atheists,

1409
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:23,110
as people that care about gay people,
all of that stuff.

1410
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,720
WhaT can we take from this sort of 
precarious moment where at and,

1411
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:29,260
and sort of feel good for,
for the future.

1412
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:34,480
Good luck.
I think optimism is overrated.

1413
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,453
I don't like the idea.
One has to be optimistic or pessimistic 

1414
01:05:39,491 --> 01:05:40,324
or anything.
I wouldn't have to sort of look at 

1415
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:41,644
things as they are.
And sometimes you might wake up in the 

1416
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:46,420
morning feeling optimistic and you might
lose it by lunchtime.

1417
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:47,254
Sometimes you might go out in the 
evening feeling pessimistic and come 

1418
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,410
home optimistic.
Who knows?

1419
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:53,860
These are things that come and go.
Um,

1420
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,053
I,
I think there's a lot that one can be 

1421
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,870
optimistic about.
Um,

1422
01:05:59,110 --> 01:05:59,721
you know,
I,

1423
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:03,400
I do have a view that I'm trying to 
finish a book about this at the moment.

1424
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:04,234
I do have a view that I'm,
one of the things that multimedia and 

1425
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:12,230
social media things has done and is 
doing at the moment is,

1426
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:13,103
is it going to create a reform within 
islam or change within islam because 

1427
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:23,251
what people are having to face up to is 
now coming to them at a speed which in,

1428
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,703
for instance in christianity took a 
couple of centuries to drift down from 

1429
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:33,850
learning institutions in Germany,
for instance,

1430
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:36,970
down to the person on the street,
um,

1431
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,890
that took a couple of centuries in the 
past.

1432
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,650
And now it's happening with unbelievable
speed.

1433
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:43,900
I think it's going to be a,
this is the bad news,

1434
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:47,560
quite bloody and a very bad for a 
period.

1435
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:48,773
Um,
but after that it means that we'll be 

1436
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:54,160
out of it within a fairly short space of
time.

1437
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,440
Um,
as for other things,

1438
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:57,210
I mean,
you know,

1439
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:00,220
people,
people's access to ideas and things,

1440
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:01,840
you know,
obviously we hear a lot about all of the

1441
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:03,880
craziness that goes on the web and 
elsewhere,

1442
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,750
but people's access to ideas now,
it's never been better.

1443
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,520
Um,
and people,

1444
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,370
people geT to find out the good things 
as well.

1445
01:07:12,371 --> 01:07:13,930
you know,
what,

1446
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:14,764
you can open your computer in the 
morning and read about a train crash 

1447
01:07:18,191 --> 01:07:22,030
somewhere that you've never heard of 
until that day.

1448
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,103
And you can feel sad for a bit and 
people do and people feel overwhelmed 

1449
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:28,030
with the amount of information,
the,

1450
01:07:28,031 --> 01:07:29,500
well,
the amount of negative things.

1451
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:30,820
But,
uh,

1452
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,500
I,
I think in middle of that as well,

1453
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:33,334
you know,
you have to have a life and you have to 

1454
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:37,420
try to think your way through the things
that are going on.

1455
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,030
And I,
I think the,

1456
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:43,830
the most important thing is the appeal 
for something beyond a,

1457
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:47,170
a utopia.
Something other than utopia.

1458
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,303
Religions and others constantly told 
people how to get utopia in the 

1459
01:07:51,731 --> 01:07:52,564
afterlife when this life,
most political movements promise people 

1460
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:59,290
utopia.
Utopia is called utopia for a reason.

1461
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:02,470
It's no place it doesn't exist,
it never did.

1462
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:05,410
It never will,
but in the meantime,

1463
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,633
it's a much better thing to think of how
You can make the lives of the people 

1464
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:10,384
around you better and how you can 
broadly have a good influence in the 

1465
01:08:13,511 --> 01:08:14,344
world at the time you've gone,
but not to think that your role is to 

1466
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:19,004
make everything else better for everyone
else in the world when you come to even 

1467
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:27,280
help mom with the dishes unit and and,
and,

1468
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,280
but as I say,
I mean,

1469
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,113
the only thing I can think of that 
that's positive is the fact that all 

1470
01:08:32,181 --> 01:08:33,014
this is happening so fast now that just 
as things can screw up at an amazing 

1471
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:39,710
speed,
it's possible.

1472
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,550
It is possible that they can also be 
sold at an amazing speed,

1473
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,940
but that won't bring us nirvana.
It just is an appeal that,

1474
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,490
that will have to keep on paying 
attention.

1475
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:53,660
I have to keep on concentrating and 
reading and thinking about these things.

1476
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,960
All right.
I actually,

1477
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:57,140
I think that was pretty lofty right 
there.

1478
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:58,933
It was a pleasure chatting with you and 
I fully get why so many people wanted 

1479
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:03,320
this to happen.
By the way,

1480
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:05,870
I should mention that your ebook,
islam ophelia,

1481
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,480
isn't available online anymore.
Uh,

1482
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,403
but you're,
you're rolling it into a new book that 

1483
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,080
you're working on right now.
Right.

1484
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:13,103
I'm very proud is affiliate with an 
ebook I wrote a quite swiftly a couple 

1485
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:17,363
years ago and,
uh,

1486
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:18,203
I was very proud of the fact we 
immediately beat the chron and the best 

1487
