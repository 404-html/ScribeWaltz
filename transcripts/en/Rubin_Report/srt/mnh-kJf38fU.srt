1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,473
Joining me today is an activist and 
advocate who co founded the student led 

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,360
gun control advocacy group.
Never again MSD.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,433
He also helped organize the march for 
our lives nationwide student protest 

4
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,080
earlier this year.
Cameron Caskey.

5
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,700
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,480
I'm really happy that you're here for 
for many reasons.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,483
Mostly because you strike me suddenly as
someone that's trying to find some 

8
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,870
common ground these days and we're gonna
get into that in a whole bunch more.

9
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:33,561
But,
uh,

10
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:34,394
of course I have to mention up top you 
are a survivor of the parkland shooting 

11
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,310
in Florida.
Um,

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,693
before we go whole into that and 
everything that you've been through 

13
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,414
since,
just tell me a little bit about life 

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,863
before [inaudible].
I assume you have a life before and now 

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,573
a new life.

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,661
Well,
you know,

17
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:54,494
I spent most of my life as your typical 
little shitster who just said whatever 

18
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:59,414
you wanted to have a voice.
I was always so convinced that I was 

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,294
right about everything.
Whether that was nature and nurture is 

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,803
kind of up to interpretation,
but I really grew up just dead set on 

21
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:10,904
the fact that I knew everything.
Everything I said was right and I was a 

22
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:14,624
genius.
I learned the hard way recently little 

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,790
to recently that I'm not and that was a 
crazy awakening.

24
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,624
Learning that you don't know everything 
in the entire world is actually an 

25
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:23,894
interesting experience,
but one of the things that helped me a 

26
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:27,014
lot was doing theater.
I was a big theater kid because I had 

27
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,910
this voice.
I always wanted to express myself.

28
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,170
I was a flippantly loud all the time and
do.

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,440
I didn't know what to do with it.

30
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,653
You know?
I was knocking doors for Obama when I 

31
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:39,770
was seven.
Wow.

32
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,663
Yeah.
I was really interested in being active 

33
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:43,371
with all that.
I mean,

34
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,204
I knew nothing.
I thought that John Mccain was running 

35
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,144
with Tina Fey,
not Sarah Pailin because I had really 

36
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:52,700
only seen the news and I,
I guess I got it mixed up with seven.

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,610
I didn't expect myself to be a policy 
expert,

38
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,680
but you know,
again,

39
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,690
I think the point is I was always really
excited to speak and,

40
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,480
and I got involved with drama and drama.
Said,

41
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,530
hey,
you have a voice,

42
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,483
here's the way to use it.
And you learn a lot of lessons from 

43
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:09,950
doing theater.
Have you,

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,020
have you ever done anything else,

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,800
steve at school?
Not In high school.

46
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,710
I did spend 12 years doing standup 
comedy in New York City,

47
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,360
which is a whole other nightmare,
but

48
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,931
I,
um,

49
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,764
I always wanted to do stand up and then 
I tried it once when I was seven years 

50
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:24,004
old I was on a cruise with my family and
there was a kind of adults only 

51
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:28,744
nightclub.
It wasn't really you're able to get in 

52
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:31,894
if you were younger,
but I was the only person there under 

53
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,470
maybe 40 and they had an open mic and I 
kept on,

54
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,170
I kept on raising my hand to get on and 
the hosts was saying,

55
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,004
know what the,
what the,

56
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,883
what the hell is this kid doing?
And finally he just caved in and was 

57
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:42,281
like,
all right,

58
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,114
let's let the kid get up here.
And I walked out there and I drop a 

59
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,290
three minute routine.
I make a joke about my dad's penis,

60
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,693
which was an interesting experience.
And the thing is I did not know that 

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,130
while I was sitting alone in the front 
row,

62
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,973
I snuck out of my room,
my went to the club and I didn't see 

63
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,410
them.
Wow.

64
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,920
So I'm A.
I'm out there,

65
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,850
I'll say it,
I'll send you the,

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,853
the clip privately.
I'm out there and I'm four foot three 

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,553
and,
and everybody's drunk so they think I'm 

68
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,310
a riot.
So I think I'm a riot.

69
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,144
And I just kept going and going to the 
point where the guy who was running the 

70
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,680
open mic was just looming behind me 
waiting for me to be done.

71
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,573
But I guess he just didn't want to grab 
the mic from a small child without 

72
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,970
looking kind of weird.

73
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,860
Stand up is probably best done once.
It's seven years old and never again.

74
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:32,340
So exactly what you're doing.
Everybody's had their 15 minutes of fame

75
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:33,810
when they were seven on a cruise.
Yeah.

76
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:34,560
Alright.
So,

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,950
so you were a theater kid.
Um,

78
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,470
anything else we should know about?
Just like high school life,

79
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:44,190
like high school life for a kid in 2017,
2018,

80
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,090
like what's it like?
I'm,

81
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,130
I'm not that old but I ain't 17 anymore.

82
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,881
Well,
you know,

83
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,100
I,
high school was really fun for me.

84
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,340
I really enjoyed it on a social level.
I was a shitty student.

85
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,683
My test scores were always good,
but my grades were awful because they 

86
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,354
never bothered to do homework.
I thought I was too smart and cool for 

87
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,570
that.
But um,

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,513
I,
I liked high school a lot because I 

89
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,560
never really subscribed to one social 
circle.

90
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:07,080
I kind of hung out with a lot of people,
you know,

91
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,370
kids who were the stereotypical popular 
kids,

92
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,213
you know,
I was just the guy they knew that was 

93
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,684
funny.
I would hang out with that sometimes 

94
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,573
kids who were the stereotypical nerds,
we would talk about movies and comic 

95
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:19,230
books,
which I want to get into your comic book

96
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,064
collection suit.
And I'd say that my core group was the 

97
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:26,620
theater kids.
I love my friends from drama and um,

98
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,710
it's really fun having a group of 
friends where you'll,

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,610
you'll be hanging out on the weekend 
shooting the Shit and then you'll get to

100
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:33,444
school and either be falling in love 
with each other and making out on stage 

101
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,380
or killing each other on stage.
You know,

102
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,240
we just did fiddler on the roof and I 
got to marry one of my best friends.

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,980
It was really fun.
I'm sure you're familiar.

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,490
I am familiar with the lyrics is a 
classic so.

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,473
Alright.
So it sounds like a pretty normal 

106
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
childhood that so far

107
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,970
I don't think someone like me can be 
created by normal childhood,

108
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,920
but it was a great childhood.
I'm very happy.

109
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,763
My parents divorced when I was 10 and 
I'm lucky enough to have four 

110
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:01,911
grandparents,
parents,

111
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,220
you know,
I've got two brothers and a step sister.

112
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,173
It's a great group.
I'd like to think that I'm a pretty 

113
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:09,830
moral guy and when I'm the shittiest 
person in a family,

114
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,690
it's a great family.
So,

115
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,430
um,
you have a standup comic in you.

116
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:14,264
I can see it.
Hopefully it doesn't come out anytime 

117
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,190
soon.
Alright.

118
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,400
So now bring me to that day or earlier 
this year.

119
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,020
So on February 14th there was a,
it was a regular day.

120
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,243
It was actually a really nice day and 
there was a period of time during the 

121
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,140
day that I always remember where I 
thought that he's gone a little too.

122
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,050
Well,
I was sitting reading John Walsh's book,

123
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,940
a tears of rage,
I believe,

124
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,160
if you're familiar.
I don't remember the title exactly,

125
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:37,994
but I was a big fan and um,
I was planning out a Valentine's Day 

126
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:43,650
gift for a girl that I really liked.
Uh,

127
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,533
she had,
uh,

128
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,430
she had an endoscopy that day and she 
was,

129
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,413
she was on a lot of medicine and I was 
going to give her cousin some gifts for 

130
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:50,744
her and have her bring it to her.
And I made her a card that said I would 

131
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:54,310
have brought you this myself,
but I didn't have the stomach

132
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,203
or Andra.
I printed a picture or a picture of her 

133
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,410
doctor

134
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,243
and put it in the cart and everything.
And then I'm were in rehearsal for a 

135
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,700
musical we were doing,
he'll vikings,

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,700
which I'm sure nobody's ever heard of.
I don't know it.

137
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,660
And uh,
I was,

138
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,660
we had just finished up a song I was 
doing and I realized,

139
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,494
wait a second,
I have to go pick up my brother because 

140
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:15,860
that's stillman Douglas School lets out 
at 2:40,

141
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,350
but the special needs kids are out at 
2:10

142
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,940
so the parents can pick them up before 
the buses come and my little brother has

143
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:26,660
autism and he's hanging out there with 
all of his friends and the ESC class.

144
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,280
And by the way,
the autistic scene,

145
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,010
stoneman Douglas is awesome.
Those kids are the best.

146
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,990
And the school specialized in that.
Is it like a magnet school for kids with

147
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,860
autism or.
No,

148
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:37,694
but it has,
it has a great program with great 

149
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,164
teachers.

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,033
And I actually went back to Portland 
this weekend to see them off to 

151
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,370
homecoming.
And boy,

152
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,570
let me tell you,
that squad is wild of them.

153
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,150
And um,
my little brother,

154
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,550
I don't want to brag is kind of the 
ringleader over there.

155
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,450
Um,
and,

156
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,340
and I went to go pick them up because on
days like that when my mom was at work,

157
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,174
I would take him to drama and he would 
just hang out and he really loved it 

158
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,650
because all the girls would give them 
attention and you know,

159
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:04,660
he's,
he's a bit of a cocky little bastard and

160
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:07,430
I'm a and I realized that it's maybe to 
20,

161
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,470
let's say,
and we're halfway through the song and I

162
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,304
say I forgot to pick up holding.
So we finished the song and I asked my 

163
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,120
teacher if I could go run and pick them 
up.

164
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,983
Of course she said yes,
and I'm picking up holding and suddenly 

165
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:18,644
there's a fire alarm.

166
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,603
And that was a little scary because we 
were close to pickup and I was with the 

167
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,820
special needs kids.
Some of them were in wheelchairs,

168
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,210
some of whom were not,
were a little physically disabled.

169
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,110
And we had to go to the parking lot 
where the buses would come.

170
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,670
And I said,
oh no,

171
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,250
what if this,
what if this is a real fire?

172
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,070
And I have to sit out here and make sure
that nobody gets hit by a bus.

173
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,900
There were teachers there of course,
but you know,

174
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,670
it's a public school.
There maybe two teachers for 10,

175
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:49,030
15 students who will need a lot of help.
Sure.

176
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,233
So we're out there sitting in the 
parking lot and there were students out 

177
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,950
there from other classes nearby who,
uh,

178
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,150
because again,
this is a fire drill.

179
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,410
There were students out there who were 
with us and it was the Ese class,

180
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:01,760
it was a couple of the nearby classes.

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,280
And one of the kids jokingly said,
as a shooter,

182
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,690
I said,
Dude,

183
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,003
shut the fuck up.
That's not cool because how could that 

184
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,454
ever happen?
Right?

185
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,380
And suddenly I see everybody running 
back inside and the teacher says,

186
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:16,580
get inside,
get inside.

187
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
And I said,
okay,

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,960
it wasn't a real fire.
And they want to get all the kids inside

189
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:21,794
before the buses come.
And then we're told to go in a room and 

190
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:25,784
we're told to hide,
get away from the window and turn the 

191
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,151
lights off.
And I say,

192
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,050
okay,
someone's going on.

193
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,783
And that experience was,
was an interesting one because I was in 

194
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:36,380
the leadership room with a lot of the 
leadership students,

195
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,214
which is a class that specializes in 
leadership and they planned prom and 

196
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:41,804
everything,
sort of student government and it was 

197
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,804
also the special needs kids because it 
was the nearest room and some of the 

198
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:47,744
students being nonverbal does not mean 
you can't make noise and some of the 

199
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,070
students were yelling and wailing.

200
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,903
Unfortunately they had shadows and the 
special needs teachers at Douglas are 

201
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,650
fantastic and we're able to keep 
everybody calm,

202
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,150
but we didn't know what was going on.
And we were there for a couple hours and

203
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,380
slowly more details began to emerge.
I assume you're hearing gunfire and.

204
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,573
No,
no.

205
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,250
Douglas is a huge school and I wasn't.
Now mind you,

206
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,900
I thought I heard gunfire,
but when you're being told you're school

207
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,320
is getting shot up and you hear 
anything,

208
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:20,010
you might think it's gunfire.
But I'm sitting there holding.

209
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,780
My little brother has no idea what's 
going on.

210
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,470
And.
And slowly I realized,

211
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,304
okay,
there's a shooting I heard and people 

212
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,200
were whispering around the room.
It was maybe 20 kids in the room,

213
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,900
people saying 50 people are dead,
two people are dead.

214
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,670
One person,
his dad.

215
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,243
There were conflicting stories.
I heard conflicting stories of who was 

216
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,150
who the shooter was.

217
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
I heard five different names.
Wonderful of it was somebody I knew.

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,433
Somebody I knew would not pick up a 
weapon to harm a butterfly because 

219
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,160
that's hysteria and that and that's 
natural and I understand it.

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,540
Then I saw something that was a terrible
exhibit of humanity.

221
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,374
If you asked me which was.
There was a snapchat video going around 

222
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,823
that was that with the caption Yo with 
multiple owes my school getting shot up 

223
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
and it was a video of a dead teacher.
Look,

224
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,643
if you're gonna film shooting from 
inside a room so you can have evidence 

225
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:17,790
to show the police good on you.
If you're going to fill my shooting in a

226
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,940
room and say,
Yo my school getting shot up and send it

227
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:21,870
to everybody,
you know,

228
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,423
that's pretty awful.
And when you're sitting there in a room 

229
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,094
not knowing what's going on and you see 
videos of people you know and love 

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,050
deceased.
In the end,

231
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:32,880
the only video I saw was with somebody 
who had,

232
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,730
I had cared about for many years.
He was a mentor in my life.

233
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,470
You start to realize that nothing is 
ever going to be the same again.

234
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,383
Yeah.
So

235
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,373
wait,
let's pause for one sec because that we 

236
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:44,344
shouldn't gloss over that part where the
social media component of this is so 

237
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,304
important because you guys all grew up 
on this and then you grow up hearing 

238
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,690
about school shootings all the time.
And I could,

239
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,700
I don't know who this kid is.
It doesn't matter.

240
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,534
I'm sure I'm curious.
Perfectly fine person or he or she even 

241
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,580
know what it's like,
you know,

242
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,640
doing that.
It's like,

243
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:01,960
it just,
it almost feels like,

244
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,320
oh,
that's the normal thing to do.

245
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,370
Like there's a shooting like on 
snapchat,

246
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,490
you know,
several people I knew were just treating

247
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,290
it like it was normal.
I mean not the shooting,

248
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,124
but the fact that there was a video and 
so I understand how some people might 

249
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,740
like to not like,
but you know,

250
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:20,460
understand having to see that because 
they need to understand what's going on.

251
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,730
But I saw it and I said,
how could you do that?

252
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,360
This is somebody who is deceased and 
you're filming them to show,

253
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,223
just send it to all your friends and 
that's a reflection of the social media 

254
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,560
era we're in where everything that's 
going on.

255
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,580
You got to show everyone.

256
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,870
So for how long were you actually in 
that room?

257
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,330
Not knowing if you were going to be 
okay,

258
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,800
not knowing what was happening.

259
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,793
I think it was about two hours.
I could look at interviews I did a days 

260
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,290
after and have a much better gauge,
I forget,

261
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,820
but I would call it around two hours.
And you know the.

262
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,663
When the swat team broke the door,
there was the big issue that there are 

263
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,714
students who are developmentally 
disabled in here who might not be able 

264
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,404
to put their hands up.
And fortunately one of the only good 

265
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:02,614
things you'll see from broward handling 
of the shooting was the swat team was 

266
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,830
very understanding and was very quick to
help these students,

267
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,664
which was good.
But when that glass broke and the first 

268
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,140
thing that walked into a room was a,
was a rifle.

269
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,280
How are we supposed to know that that 
wasn't us taken our turn,

270
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,910
but and I,
everybody was texting their parents.

271
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,223
Everybody at the phone lines were kind 
of jammed because everybody in Parkland 

272
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,380
was making a call.

273
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,960
I mean it was Parkland.
It was a city with.

274
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,353
I don't even know how many people,
but it was a small town where there's 

275
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,650
one high school.
Is there one high school?

276
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,203
It was around one high school and we.
I mean nobody should be equipped for 

277
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:44,170
this,
but we weren't.

278
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,240
Yeah.
Have you guys been taught at all?

279
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,074
Like are they teaching in high school?
Like what to do if this actually does 

280
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,010
happen.
If a shooter,

281
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,040
she comes to school and we had the 
discussion of having a code red drill.

282
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,400
We had long discussions about dealing 
with a shooter,

283
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,590
but we had never participated in code 
red drill,

284
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,710
at least not while I was at school.
I used to skip school a lot.

285
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,360
Tell me a little bit more about the 
makeup of Parkland because you mentioned

286
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:10,000
something interesting that it's kind of 
like a little liberal,

287
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,250
pretty liberal area.

288
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,210
It's not homogeneous when it comes to 
being liberal,

289
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,010
you know,
there's a lot of different perspectives,

290
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:18,844
but the majority of people in Parkland 
are pretty liberal and pretty classic 

291
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:22,804
liberal and um,
and that's why you'll see a lot of the 

292
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,850
activism to come out of snowmen.
Douglas was less,

293
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,983
you know,
let's,

294
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,440
let's,
I dunno,

295
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,830
it was very gun control related.
Yeah.

296
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,521
So let's,
we'll,

297
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:35,354
we'll get to that in a little bit 
because obviously so much has happened 

298
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,240
in the spotlight that has been put on 
you guys and everything else and,

299
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:45,320
and several of you have stepped into it 
and I think there's probably a good part

300
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,163
of that and bad parts of that.
I think that's probably why you were 

301
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,740
here right now.
Double Edge Sword.

302
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,170
Um,
okay.

303
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:54,580
So it ends now what you,
they tell you.

304
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:55,810
All right.
You could walk out of this room,

305
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:56,500
I mean,
sure,

306
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,370
I can't imagine that.

307
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,070
So we ran,
we ran with our hands up,

308
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,190
we sat outside for a bit.
Um,

309
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,220
I was able to go on a city bus with my 
little brother's class to the Marriott,

310
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,530
which is the hotel only hotel.
And Parkland,

311
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,880
and so they weren't letting parents come
no to the parents were coming to pick us

312
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,714
up at the hotel,
but there were a lot of different ways 

313
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,080
students got out of the school,
a lot of different places.

314
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,330
They went,
some kids I know just ran,

315
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,513
which was understandable.
Normally when there's a mass shooting 

316
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,440
nearby you run.
And um,

317
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,790
my brother and I were at the Marriott 
Hotel and our father picked us up,

318
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,710
took us over an hour to get home 
because,

319
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,380
as I'm sure you can understand,
the streets were very jammed.

320
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,551
I mean,
after the shooting,

321
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,940
Parkland was a no man's land.
It,

322
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,220
this wasn't mad max and arche where 
everybody was wearing leather spikes,

323
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,770
but it was a no man's land.
There was,

324
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,680
it was as if time and space had been 
suspended.

325
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,850
The rules of physics and matter didn't 
really exist.

326
00:14:55,851 --> 00:15:00,020
It was eerie.
It was seven days,

327
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,854
at least for me.
That was when that period of really 

328
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:08,351
surreal fear with existed that nothing 
felt real.

329
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,293
And,
um,

330
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,313
the news was there,
there was the most we got was somebody 

331
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:17,330
at the sunset and we'll talking about 
our production of fiddler on the roof,

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,833
the,
um,

333
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,143
did you in that period?
And I'm sure it's very hard to even 

334
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,130
remember it clearly.
Did you have a real chance to mourn,

335
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,110
to figure out what happened?
Um,

336
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,083
I don't know.
You can maybe let me know how close you 

337
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,750
were to maybe some of the students 
because it seems like,

338
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:33,584
and I think this was part of the problem
with the way we deal with these things 

339
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,650
is that we go from the incident to 
immediately,

340
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,800
especially on social media,
just attacking each other and destroying

341
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:43,634
each other.
Then you guys all get thrust into the 

342
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,550
spotlight and it's like,
Whoa,

343
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,010
this would be hard on,
on an adult,

344
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,720
you know,
impossibly hard.

345
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,853
Meanwhile you have these kids who are 
now out there talking about these 

346
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,820
things.
These kids need to mourn.

347
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,923
We need to figure out what's going on 
with life and find some reality and 

348
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:00,484
decency.

349
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,413
So I,
I think that there's really no formula 

350
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:07,210
for recovering for from a mass shooting,
especially when at a school,

351
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,410
I mean enough of happened that they're 
starting to develop a precedence,

352
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:15,340
which is a horrible thing,
but there's really nowhere to look.

353
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,410
You can,
I could have hidden away.

354
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:20,620
I could have locked myself in my room 
for weeks and maybe that would have been

355
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:22,480
the right thing to do.
I could have.

356
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,430
I didn't know what to do and my way of 
coping has always been doing something.

357
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,630
I had dealt with some tragic loss this 
past year and I had the.

358
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,533
There were some really dark things that 
happen to people that I loved and the 

359
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,930
way I always handled them was by doing 
something.

360
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:38,764
I never liked to have a clear head 
because while I think it's important to 

361
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,880
process your pain and deal with it,
I also think that the.

362
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,173
If I,
if something like that happens and I do 

363
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,720
nothing,
I'm never going to forget myself.

364
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,670
I had survivor guilt.
Why?

365
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,504
Why should I have left that day?
There were 15 year old girls that were 

366
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:56,284
murdered and I made it out and if I 
could have pressed a button to trade my 

367
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:00,500
life for theirs,
it,

368
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,410
it wouldn't have even been.
Hm.

369
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,120
Well,
maybe I should say goodbye to people.

370
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,200
Maybe I should think about this.
No,

371
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,750
I would have broken my finger pressing 
it to heart.

372
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,943
So what made me deserve life when other 
people who did nothing wrong it people 

373
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:14,850
more innocent,
more kind than I am.

374
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,970
Didn't get to make it out.
And I realized while I'm alive and,

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,470
and one of my mentors wasn't Scott 
Eagle,

376
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,200
one of the nicest guys I've ever met.
He's the reason that I'm a snarky little

377
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:28,240
asshole.
I develop that from him.

378
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,163
Um,
he didn't make it out there and he's 

379
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,493
somebody who changed the young people's 
lives by making them better and making 

380
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,030
them more proud of themselves.
So,

381
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,840
so what makes me as what has me 
deserving of this.

382
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,390
I'm not a very religious or spiritual 
person.

383
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,530
So I,
I don't,

384
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,170
I didn't think there was some great plan
that got me out of school,

385
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,603
but I think that I had a responsibility 
at a responsibility to do right by the 

386
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:53,514
people we lost and to do what I thought 
would make the world a better place 

387
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,410
while they can't,
because there were marriages that didn't

388
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,244
happen.
There were people who would have had 

389
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:04,950
children and didn't get a,
I don't know,

390
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,133
it's a horrible thing to think.
But at the end of the day lives ended 

391
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,530
and I still had mine.
So I said after the shooting,

392
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,720
what I'm going to do is something.

393
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,520
And I was uh,
you know,

394
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,850
I've been a big liberal most of my life 
and I,

395
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,170
and I've always been an advocate for gun
control.

396
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,263
I was a big debater of other students 
after the shooting in Las Vegas where I 

397
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,714
said nobody needs.
These were wearing a point in our 

398
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,014
society where we're advanced enough that
nobody needs an assault weapon to take 

399
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,250
care of themselves.
Look at the,

400
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,330
look at the way these guns are made.
We can defend ourselves in hand.

401
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,310
Guns.
My father has multiple in the house.

402
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,640
He's a reserve police officer.
He was Miami shores for awhile.

403
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,683
I didn't.
I instantly said the thing we can do 

404
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,770
here,
stop folks like the shooter at my school

405
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,604
from getting these weapons because this 
is a 19 year old who if he had spent 

406
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,840
five minutes with the psychologist would
have been sent to a therapist,

407
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,950
not a gun store.

408
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,641
Yeah.
Okay.

409
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,474
So let's.
Before we get specifically to far down 

410
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,590
the road here,
which obviously we're going to touch on.

411
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,323
Okay.
You guys are trying to more and you 

412
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,060
know,
you're having survivor guilt.

413
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:09,894
All of these things I'm sure just in,
in your family and your brother and 

414
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,320
everything else.
Just I can't even imagine then the media

415
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,870
because I think this is,
we have to hit media stuff before we get

416
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:21,090
to the gun part.
The media then descend.

417
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,920
What was that like?
I mean,

418
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:27,090
I assume everybody and their brother was
trying to reach out to all of you guys.

419
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,130
They were putting you guys on TV.
I mean,

420
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:31,740
I probably even that very day.
Um,

421
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,630
what was that like for you guys

422
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,160
or for you?
Uh,

423
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,150
you know,
the whole,

424
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,103
our whole situation with the media,
whether it be anything from CNN to Fox 

425
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,870
News to Ellen was a double edge sword 
because on the one,

426
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,763
on the one hand there are bodies that 
are warm and right here on TV and in 

427
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,030
retrospect I might have done that 
differently.

428
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:53,800
I'm not sure.
On the other hand,

429
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,160
I couldn't let this be like Sandy Hook 
for example.

430
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,680
They couldn't let this be people coming 
in to film crying,

431
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,830
mothers talking about how bad these guns
are and leave.

432
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,650
I wanted to get out there and say,
no,

433
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,040
okay,
this,

434
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,900
how many of these do we need before we 
do something that I don't.

435
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,743
I didn't want people to see Parkland as 
a place where everybody was crying and 

436
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:14,524
everybody was throwing a pity party.
I wanted to people to see Parkland as a 

437
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:20,020
place where a terrible tragedy happened 
and the city stood up and said,

438
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:20,854
no,
we're not going to be like these other 

439
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:22,570
places.

440
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,350
We are going to be a catalyst.
I mean,

441
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,320
before before Stoneman Douglas,
I would send.

442
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,263
I would hear the word sandy hook in a 
room and everybody would get quiet and 

443
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,790
it would be weird.
I couldn't have that be stoneman Douglas

444
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,620
at this place.
That was my school.

445
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,230
I loved my school.
I was a big school spirit fellow.

446
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,633
It was about to become a statistic.
It was about to become that one dark 

447
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:46,390
thing that somebody will make a joke 
about or somebody will say something bad

448
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:50,560
about or really anything.
So I got out there and said no.

449
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,870
And so many people got out there and 
said,

450
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,080
this cannot be another example of 
everybody.

451
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,130
Everybody crying.
We're not here to cry.

452
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:02,380
We're here to tell you what we can do to
make this a better world.

453
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,380
Were there people swim,
parents,

454
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,550
advisors,
whoever,

455
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:09,460
that were kind of guiding you through 
the media part of this?

456
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:12,400
Because there were so many strange 
moments where it seemed like,

457
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,773
like I said to you right before,
I don't want to make this about any 

458
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:16,444
specific student especially,
and I don't want to throw anyone out on 

459
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,234
the bus,
but when we see someone like David Hogg 

460
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:23,030
who obviously is very public now,
uh,

461
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,243
you know,
saying things that didn't quite seem 

462
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,120
right or,
or talking about laws and all this stuff

463
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:29,954
like going from just surviving to 
suddenly advocacy with almost no space 

464
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,500
in between,
you know,

465
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,923
in general.
I think the general idea of going right 

466
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,534
to advocacy,
while it might not have been our best 

467
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:46,210
call to immediately go to it was these 
cameras are only here for so long and we

468
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,250
couldn't have them leave a double edged 
sword.

469
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:49,870
Exactly.
So do we,

470
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,823
do we wait our respectful time and then 
go out and advocate or what people not 

471
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:58,630
care.
And I think I stand by advocacy.

472
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,590
I'm not sure.
I think on a moral level I might not but

473
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,150
on a.
But generally,

474
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:06,520
I think that while everybody was 
looking,

475
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,110
we had to say,
let's,

476
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,330
let's look at what we really want to 
look at here.

477
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,850
These like give these families.
There's

478
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:14,763
base were,
were any of you guys afraid that you 

479
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:16,814
were being looked at as experts suddenly
where as horrific as what happened to 

480
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:24,500
you was it doesn't make you an expert 
either in law or in guns or any of those

481
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:27,110
things like you can very eloquently as 
you're doing right now.

482
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,240
Tell me your story.
Tell me what you think.

483
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,370
All of those things.
But especially at the beginning,

484
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm sure you know way more now.
You don't know everything.

485
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,474
Nobody knows everything.
And they were throwing a bunch of 17 

486
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:40,520
year olds out there as if they were 
experts on all of these things.

487
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,350
And I think that also added to some of 
the,

488
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,210
the tumbled around everything.

489
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,170
Well at the time it was awesome.
Yeah.

490
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,150
I mean I was an expert.
I,

491
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,620
I felt,
I felt phenomenal.

492
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:52,350
I was somebody that everybody was 
looking to as if I,

493
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,080
as if I knew everything.
And as I said before,

494
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,800
that was what I wanted.
And it wasn't a good feeling.

495
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,150
I,
I'll be honest with you,

496
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,180
some things about it felt good.
Most of it felt like a terrible

497
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,440
interesting.
You just said it's awesome and it wasn't

498
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,060
a good feeling.
That probably sums it up,

499
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:08,510
I guess.

500
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,640
Yeah,
it was awesome to me that I got to the.

501
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,820
I spent my whole life watching people 
talk about laws and watching people talk

502
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:20,810
about politics and now I got to say this
and my word got to be respected.

503
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,240
But every time I went out there I 
thought there are people then.

504
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,300
And it's,
it's just,

505
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:26,980
it's a,
it's a,

506
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,690
it's a moral qualm.
Am I out here at,

507
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,613
I'm doing this because I believe in it 
and I'm doing this because I don't want 

508
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:35,120
the world to lose people again.
Uh,

509
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,590
yeah.
Nobody deserves to be shot.

510
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,453
Nobody at all.
Nobody who's a good person deserves to 

511
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,680
be shot.
So,

512
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,860
so I,
it was,

513
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,660
it was difficult for me because on the 
one hand,

514
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:51,620
it was this amazing feeling of,
here's my voice.

515
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,573
Everybody's listening.
Let me tell you what you all need to 

516
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:56,150
hear.
And what everybody needed to hear was we

517
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,080
need to pass gun laws.

518
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,080
It's been enough.
If,

519
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,070
if,
if people did nothing after columbine,

520
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,680
I would have understood it because that 
was supposed to be an anomaly.

521
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,320
I'm sure you remember.
That was a shocker.

522
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,300
And then stoneman Douglas happened and 
it was more of an,

523
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,470
another not a woe.
So,

524
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,710
so it felt it.
It felt great that people were carrying.

525
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,873
That was the,
that was what I would say it was the 

526
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,000
awesome part was that I was afraid 
everybody would.

527
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,660
Everybody in the country would feel 
helpless and cry and be done.

528
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,093
But it was amazing to see that the 
country was saying maybe there's 

529
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,020
something we can do here,
maybe we can make some change.

530
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,753
And the thing that was awful was I was,
I was going from news hits two memorial 

531
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:37,330
services.

532
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,163
Yeah.
So you've had a sort of interesting 

533
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:40,174
evolution about all this and it.
And it sort of leads to where we're 

534
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:43,600
going to end,
which is what you're doing now,

535
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:46,050
which is pretty awesome.
Um,

536
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,170
so,
all right,

537
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,930
you're part of the.
Now you're part of the media machine.

538
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,540
You guys are trying to figure out what 
can you do?

539
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,433
I assume that's sort of how march for 
our life started and if I'm not 

540
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,160
mistaken,
it started in your house,

541
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,600
right?
Started in my bathroom.

542
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,220
Yeah,
I was,

543
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,080
um,
I was coming out of the shower,

544
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,580
putting on my ghostbusters PJ's.
It was a slimer.

545
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,740
It wasn't old school ghostbusters.
Yes,

546
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:07,510
of course.
Of course I am.

547
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,540
We can talk about the new ghost busters 
maybe after this part.

548
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,060
How much eight do you want to get 
online?

549
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,400
I love.
I'll tell you this.

550
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:18,170
Everybody in that cast is incredibly 
talented.

551
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,603
I didn't like the movie very much,
but there's really nobody who is in it 

552
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:25,520
that I think was not in.
It's not an incredibly funny person.

553
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,170
But anyway,
I,

554
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:28,700
um,
started in my home and,

555
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,593
and I got a lot of my friends together.
Some I called everyone who I knew was 

556
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,213
intelligent and well spoken and was 
willing to put their time to grieve 

557
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,840
aside to demand action because if you 
know,

558
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,674
I felt like it was in some ways public 
service because people are grieving and 

559
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,810
we're out here saying,
we're gonna.

560
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,410
Put that aside as as much as I wanted to
cry every day and mind you,

561
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,960
I really want to do,
and I did a lot.

562
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,340
I knew that I had to put that aside.
I had to do something so I got everybody

563
00:25:58,341 --> 00:25:59,174
that I knew could do something to mostly
my drama friends because I knew that 

564
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,700
they could speak and we all got together
at my house and said,

565
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,190
well,
what do we do with this whole,

566
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
this whole country?

567
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,630
People on both sides or all morning 
together.

568
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,530
How can we get everybody on both sides 
together to do something now?

569
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:16,520
Mind you,
that didn't happen.

570
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,980
Getting people on both sides didn't 
really happen.

571
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,753
That can be a tough one and it is a 
tough one and then it will always be a 

572
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:24,764
tough one,
but it's something that needs to be 

573
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:26,900
done.
And,

574
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,630
and you know,
from,

575
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,630
from my home,
we were sleeping two hours a night.

576
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,420
I would go entire days only eating one 
protein bar,

577
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,254
not even realizing we were.
So it was such a tornado that we were 

578
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:41,534
all,
we all kind of forgot what it was like 

579
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:43,784
to be a normal person.
So you come up with the idea for March 

580
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,990
for our lives,
now,

581
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,820
get us to that day.
And what was it supposed to be?

582
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,430
What,
what were the actual original intentions

583
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,140
beyond,
let's not forget about this.

584
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Original intentions were let's get gun 
control passed and I'm still a big,

585
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
let's get gun control pass guy.
And um,

586
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,663
and that's what we wanted to do.
We want to say everybody out here 

587
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:11,581
saying,
we should do this.

588
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,390
Let's get everyone together.
Let's,

589
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,670
let's get a,
a big march together where people say,

590
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,980
I want.
I'm coming all the way out here.

591
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm standing out here today to demand 
this.

592
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,490
And seeing everybody together was 
amazing.

593
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,893
I,
um,

594
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,080
you get getting up on the stage and 
seeing all those people.

595
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,140
I didn't care about the being in front 
of him.

596
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,880
I mean,
I was a drama kid,

597
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,180
I stood in front of people and taught 
for the past five years,

598
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,510
but I saw all those people and I said,
these people believe in something.

599
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,440
The these people come from different 
places.

600
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,420
These people that are all completely 
different,

601
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:49,254
but they're all together because they 
believe in one thing and that was 

602
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:53,520
magical and I don't use the word magical
very often.

603
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,870
I think it's Cliche,
but that was magical and it was.

604
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,380
It was.
It was amazing to see.

605
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,640
But from the beginning of our advocate 
advocacy to the march,

606
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,763
it was,
it was a lot of personalities together 

607
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,010
and we were able to make it through the 
pain we felt together.

608
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,960
I mean,
so often people said,

609
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,080
well,
why are you guys at your school got shot

610
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:18,720
up a month ago?
Your school got shot up three weeks ago.

611
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:20,520
Why are you smiling?
And I said,

612
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,354
well,
at least from my own personal 

613
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:23,814
perspective,
the teacher that I was dear friends 

614
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,490
with,
that I lost.

615
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,790
Scott wouldn't want me to cry.
Scott would want me to do something.

616
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,080
Scott would want me to do what I 
believed in.

617
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,570
He wasn't a very political guy.
He will,

618
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,670
after the shooting,
he probably wouldn't have focused on any

619
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:39,504
politics.
He would have focused on getting 

620
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,540
everybody at Douglas to feel better,
to laugh,

621
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,374
to smile.

622
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,170
But if I believed in something and I 
wanted to advocate for it,

623
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,580
I knew that if he were here,
he'd say,

624
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:48,414
well,
go do it.

625
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,153
So the time I spent,
I was sitting at his memorial and I was 

626
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,370
crying and my,
I was,

627
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,220
it was in the dirt.
I was all snotty.

628
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:57,054
I,
I tried to wipe my face and my dirty 

629
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:58,974
hands and I,
it was what many would consider the low 

630
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,470
point in a movie when the person feels 
like they've lost everything.

631
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,630
And then I thought about it and if Scott
Yoda to behind me as a ghost,

632
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,980
which he and I used to talk about.
Actually,

633
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I used to talk about Yoda Ang,
if he yoda behind me and he would say,

634
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,720
Cameron,
do something.

635
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:19,554
You must.
He used to talk to me in Yoda voice a 

636
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:21,894
lot and not go.
We were going to get your Yoda 

637
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:24,510
impression there and it's not gonna 
happen.

638
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,623
Um,
somebody else has the exclusive on that 

639
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:28,670
one?
No,

640
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,920
there were points where Scott was my 
teacher in fifth grade.

641
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,950
He Yoda voice to me while I was asking 
him a genuine question,

642
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,530
which frustrated me a lot,
but it's time.

643
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,840
I could do a three hour interview on 
him,

644
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,130
but he would said do something.
So,

645
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,280
so when we were all smiling together,
when we were all laughing together,

646
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,114
it was because I knew that somebody that
I love would have wanted me to and we 

647
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,620
had each other.
That's the thing.

648
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:51,454
If I were,
if I was advocating for gun control 

649
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:53,830
alone,
it wouldn't have worked.

650
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,900
Not only because I couldn't have done it
alone.

651
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,063
I'm not good enough to do it alone,
but also because we were each other's 

652
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,110
lifeline when I was,
when,

653
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,003
when everything seemed awful and 
everything seemed like the world was 

654
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,090
this dark,
terrible place.

655
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,950
I had my friends around me to say,
we were here for you.

656
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,690
We've got this together.
And I was,

657
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,490
you know,
some people's shoulder.

658
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,280
Many people were in my shoulder.
I'm more emotional than many.

659
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,114
I'm a theater student.
So more people had to help me that I 

660
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,484
need to help them and feel beyond the 
emotional part and getting everybody 

661
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,180
together.
And as you said,

662
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:30,010
you're still a gun control advocate and 
all that.

663
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,903
I sent that part of what happened around
March for our labs was you saw things 

664
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:39,550
getting bizarrely political or or more 
than perhaps you were.

665
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,200
You guys wanted.
Is that fair to say?

666
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,320
I think what march for our lives should 
have.

667
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,220
See it's a political issue.
I think the way it should have come off,

668
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,400
and I think this is what everybody I 
worked with believes.

669
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,050
I know that for a fact is that kids 
don't want to get shot.

670
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,760
That's what we are at the end of the 
day.

671
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,580
We are kids who are out here saying we 
don't want to die.

672
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,090
And back then I thought that if you 
didn't believe in gun control beliefs,

673
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:04,060
you didn't care if kids died.
I learned that that's not the case,

674
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,870
but that's a pretty interesting 
evolution for someone at 17 to have with

675
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:09,704
him.
You know,

676
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,330
five or six months I spoke to people who
disagree with me.

677
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,320
I learned that they want the country to 
be a better place,

678
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,723
you know,
that they might not agree on how we 

679
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:19,800
might think.
I might think that their views are horse

680
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:22,740
shit,
but every.

681
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:23,883
We all agree on basically 90 percent of 
things and I'm sure there are plenty of 

682
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:28,570
political things you and I will disagree
on,

683
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,643
but at the end of the day,
Tom Mcfarland is one of the most gifted 

684
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,280
spiderman writers to agree on that.

685
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,640
Do you ever do anything with DC?
I'm more of a marvel guy,

686
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:38,830
but I had a pretty good Batman 
collection for awhile.

687
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,440
Nightwing is my favorite superhero,
if you're familiar.

688
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,274
I think.
I think in comic books they're very 

689
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,214
afraid to make real change and nightwing
actually was able to make it through 

690
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:47,981
that.
You know,

691
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:48,400
if,
uh,

692
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,233
if a robin became his own superhero,
normally that would only be for 10 

693
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,220
issues and then he'd go back.
But night we actually made that jump.

694
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,560
I encourage you all to read.
Going back,

695
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,420
we can focus on Mcfarlane Spiderman from
to 98 to 3:35.

696
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,633
That the idea of venom is brilliant,
but I saw the movie trailer for the 

697
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,900
movie.
We'll talk about that off camera.

698
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,760
Um,
sounds good.

699
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,290
Tom Hardy's gifted.
So,

700
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,693
so the way,
the way people should have seen us in 

701
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:17,550
the way I failed really in the messaging
because I was so deeply involved with it

702
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:18,384
was we just don't want to get killed and
quickly because of the perfect storm of 

703
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:27,010
everything it became left versus right.

704
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,493
And,
and I don't think anybody in my group 

705
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,514
wanted that.
I don't think anybody in my group wants 

706
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:32,734
that at all.
But it's in one way the media is the 

707
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:39,410
media's portrayal.
It's in one way my personal inability to

708
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:42,350
express it correctly and another way,
my arrogance,

709
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,380
because I was pretty arrogant.
I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

710
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,630
I mean everybody else I worked with a 
march for our lives was a,

711
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,693
a kid who wanted to help the world,
but I was a cocky little son of a bitch 

712
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,300
and that,
and that translated a lot because I said

713
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,980
I'm right.
That's the thing.

714
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,193
I'm right.
Everything I say about gun control is 

715
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,810
completely right.
So,

716
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,100
so why?
Why don't,

717
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:07,934
why aren't you listening to me?
Because I'm obviously in the right here 

718
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,573
and everybody else again was,
was basically saying I don't want to 

719
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:15,500
die.

720
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,150
Here's how I think it could work.
But I said,

721
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,930
I'm right politically.
This is my political movement.

722
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
Listened to my politics.
That's my fault.

723
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,280
And that's okay.
I'm playing myself.

724
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,203
I was a kid who lost friends and I 
thought that this is what we needed and 

725
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,720
I still do,
but my,

726
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,740
my big error,
my what?

727
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:36,020
What's the,
what's the word from a tragic hero?

728
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:37,550
That's their flaw.
Hamartia.

729
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:39,380
Hubris.
Well,

730
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:40,880
this is your Hubris,
I suppose.

731
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,190
Let's call it the Hubris.
I again,

732
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,024
I didn't take ap Lang or ap lit.
I can tell you my favorite tragic 

733
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,680
heroes.
I love tragic heroes,

734
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,780
but my hubris was an.
Again,

735
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:54,410
I could be interpreting this wrong.
I just thought I was right.

736
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,600
I thought that anybody who didn't agree 
with me because I was so right,

737
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,290
wanted kids to die one percent of the.
No,

738
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,213
I wouldn't say that.

739
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,150
My guess is that three percent of the 
country doesn't care when kids die three

740
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:10,850
percent.
Just as not my kid or you know,

741
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,760
it's not where I am,
but the rest of the country doesn't want

742
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,560
kids to die.
And you know,

743
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,113
I learned about that,
that family in Texas where the mom and 

744
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:22,550
the dad both carry weapons because they 
wanna protect their family.

745
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,833
I learned about the people in,
in everywhere who want to protect their 

746
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,024
families.
I have guns in my house and while I 

747
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:33,740
believe in an assault weapons ban,
or at least much more restrictive laws,

748
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,310
if you want to hurt my autistic brother 
and I have a gun,

749
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,940
you're in trouble.
So when you see

750
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,800
someone like David Hogg,
and I'm only mentioning him because he's

751
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:43,940
been so vocal on,
uh,

752
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:44,774
you know,
I try to talk about ideas and not 

753
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:46,574
people,
but when you see someone like him 

754
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,760
tweeting all of these things,
but you know,

755
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,630
I don't want to get an exact quote 
crossed up here,

756
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:56,150
but to the effect,
if you don't agree with me,

757
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:58,670
you want dead kids.
Republicans want dead kids.

758
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:01,490
Marco Rubio doesn't want to save 
anybody.

759
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,383
All of these things,
you now realize that's just not the way 

760
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,630
to do it.
That is not true and it's not.

761
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,980
It's not actually effective.

762
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,130
The reason I criticize myself and not my
friends,

763
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:14,740
because I know David,
David is a dear friend of mine.

764
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:15,574
I've known him for a couple of years,
but I've only known him really well 

765
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,900
since the shooting.
I had a class with him once.

766
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:22,540
He was nice guy.
Everything David does,

767
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,523
and I know we're not talking specifics,
but I'll just use David as an example 

768
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:28,240
because much like everybody else in 
March for our lives,

769
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,343
everything David does,
he does because he wants the country to 

770
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:32,224
be a better place.
He and I don't always see perfectly Idi 

771
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,463
on what exactly to do,
but every time I something he tweets 

772
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:41,970
that I don't like and I looked,
I think about it and I say,

773
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,030
I've spent hours with David.
I've known him.

774
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,060
I know him so incredibly well because we
have this dark,

775
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,283
tragic,
terrible bond that was really created 

776
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:51,894
after the worst case scenario.
But when David says something that I 

777
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,550
don't agree with you saying it because 
he doesn't want another kid to die.

778
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,880
So you know,
messaging with everybody in the group is

779
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,240
occasionally not really in sync.
We agree.

780
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,133
We disagree on things sometimes,
but if I thought that people in March 

781
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:11,700
for our lives like David or anyone was 
in this for the wrong reasons,

782
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,530
I would be instant.
I would instantly call them out.

783
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,060
I don't think that's the case.

784
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,183
Yeah.
Unfortunately the road to hell is paved 

785
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,860
with good intentions and I don't want 
to.

786
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,130
SMIRCH has intentions.
It was fine.

787
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:21,964
I believe you.
I believe you that his intentions are 

788
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,490
pure.
I of course,

789
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:26,324
I believe that

790
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,313
David's a guy who cares so deeply about 
the world around him and we'll do 

791
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,140
whatever it takes to make it a better 
place.

792
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,063
But it's funny that you say the road to 
hell is paved with good intentions 

793
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,763
because our summer tour where we went 
around advocating for more voter 

794
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,714
registration and more accessible voting 
around the country was called road to 

795
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:42,954
change.
And there was a counter protester I one 

796
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,490
of our events that said more like the 
road to hell.

797
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,153
I said,
hey,

798
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,483
that's not very nice.

799
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,920
Okay.
So after the march,

800
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,440
during the march,
before the march,

801
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:56,270
this thing is just becoming more and 
more political.

802
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:57,104
As you said.
You guys are getting up there and you 

803
00:36:58,131 --> 00:36:59,120
want to,
you know,

804
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,163
sort of have your moment.
But there are certain issues you don't 

805
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,360
understand.
We're politicians reaching out to you.

806
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,440
Uh,
I know that,

807
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,333
you know,
Kyle [inaudible] shoe of his talk to 

808
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,820
Marco Rubio a couple of times.
I mean,

809
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,303
how,
how deep did this go in terms of 

810
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:16,220
reaching every part of American society?
Sure.

811
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,140
We,
um,

812
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,410
we reached out to a lot of people and a 
lot of people reached out to us.

813
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,820
There were a lot of conservatives that 
we,

814
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,823
we were speaking to about the issue.
I have a couple friends who went to gun 

815
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:27,634
groups to talk about it,
sat down with some very big gun 

816
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:31,264
advocates in their areas,
not really in the country but notable 

817
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,150
where they were to talk about the issue 
and I know that the rest of my group was

818
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,030
really interested in opening up and 
talking about this.

819
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,133
Again.
I was the shitty one in March for our 

820
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:47,470
lives.
I wanted to stir some shit.

821
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,540
You know,
I wanted to cause trouble.

822
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,523
I wanted to make,
I wanted to own the conservatives the 

823
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:54,940
same way a lot of conservatives want to 
own the libs.

824
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,690
I mean that's what it's about right now.
People,

825
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,250
people play games where they're trying 
to one up each other and you know,

826
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,810
I just,
I was trying to do that.

827
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,733
I was trying to make politicians.
I didn't like look bad as opposed to 

828
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:08,320
say,
what can we do when I went up there

829
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,980
and I was where your folks or anyone 
saying,

830
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:13,250
you know,
maybe ease up on twitter or like,

831
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,390
you know,
just just because you're going to get no

832
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,224
matter what,
even if everything you said was 

833
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:18,960
factually right and came from the right 
place and all that,

834
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,350
just the amount of hate you're going to 
get while you're still a young person in

835
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:24,000
the morning.
So it cannot be fun.

836
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,963
My mom is her sole existence in the 
world is to make everybody in the world 

837
00:38:31,031 --> 00:38:33,340
happy and love each other.
So she said to me,

838
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,310
be nice and loving.
My Dad,

839
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,980
who is a bit of a political advocate 
himself,

840
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,220
agrees with me on a lot of things and 
sometimes he would tell me to ease up.

841
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,530
Sometimes he would tell me to,
you know,

842
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,250
be be a little bit rougher.
But he also said,

843
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:50,950
and this is why I think my parenting 
from my mom,

844
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,440
Stepdad,
dad step mom was so great,

845
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:57,250
was they said,
do what you think is right and don't let

846
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,010
people put their hooks in you.
And I did.

847
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,580
I let I let I let people manipulate me a
bid because I,

848
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,290
I thought that they were kindred 
spirits.

849
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,030
But you know,
my parents,

850
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:08,680
I'm lucky enough to have parents who 
say,

851
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,690
believe what you believe if my,
you know,

852
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:12,250
my parents are all liberal.

853
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,670
But if I came home and said,
I'm,

854
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,713
if I came home with a trump 20 slash 20,
which I do not expect to do unless some 

855
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:21,460
drastic change happens in my life.
Although I know you're not thrilled with

856
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,150
the Democrats with moment.
Come on,

857
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,993
throw the Democrats at the moment.
But I'm not thrilled with Democrats at 

858
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,280
the moment because they're not being 
good Democrats.

859
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,520
Not because they're Democrats.
But we'll get to that.

860
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,623
I,
um,

861
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,583
if I came home and I told my parents 
that I would vote for the opposite of 

862
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:35,884
what they would vote for,
they would say if you're doing it 

863
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:38,950
because you think it's right,
you're going to do it.

864
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,870
And I'm very grateful for that.
So we're.

865
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,540
Do you stand on gun control?
Generally?

866
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:50,260
Because I think what happened was they 
at the event at March for our lives,

867
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,303
there were a lot of people getting up 
there and they were saying things that 

868
00:39:53,081 --> 00:39:53,914
implied,
and I think this is the way a lot of 

869
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,750
people on the right took it.

870
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,400
It's not about sensible gun control.
This is ultimately about taking away all

871
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:01,234
the guns.
And that of course is the fear of most 

872
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:05,170
of the people on the right.
And there were a couple of the students,

873
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:07,300
there was one young girl,
I don't remember who said we're going to

874
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,134
start with bump stocks,
but we're coming for all the guns or 

875
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:11,164
something to that effect.
And that that feeds right into the 

876
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:15,100
people on the right who go,
all right,

877
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:19,600
well now we're not going to talk you 
guys to negotiate who like better law as

878
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,490
you guys are Mao Zedong.
Exactly.

879
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:25,120
And then because of that,
then the people on the left and you guys

880
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:25,954
go,
well,

881
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,640
right now they don't want to talk at 
all,

882
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:28,474
so we're not going to talk.
And then you end up sort of exactly 

883
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:32,190
where we're at at the moment.
It's an.

884
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,330
This is.
Somebody told me this the other day.

885
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:35,164
It's a brilliant point.
The left and the right attack each 

886
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:39,760
other's worst arguments and that does 
nothing for us.

887
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,700
But when it comes to my personal stance 
on guns,

888
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:43,534
there's some.
There are some differing opinions 

889
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,880
amongst my friends from our for our 
lives,

890
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,950
but we all,
we all agree with some similar things.

891
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,083
Personally,
I think that as long as people who are 

892
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:54,010
responsible can carry concealed 
firearms,

893
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,240
particularly handguns in the country,
in many situations,

894
00:40:58,241 --> 00:40:59,074
the country is a safer place.
I also think that there is not a strong 

895
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:02,734
vetting process for people to purchase 
these firearms and a lot of people just 

896
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,334
get guns and a lot of these people are 
not the good guy with the gun because I 

897
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:12,580
think the good guy with a gun argument 
is just a hasty generalization.

898
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,803
I understand it in some ways because I 
intend to concealed carry when I'm an 

899
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:21,961
adult because I intended to have a 
family and I intend to shoot anybody who

900
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:27,361
tries to kill my family and I assumed 
that that even that position right there

901
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,500
probably puts you on the outs with a lot
of,

902
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,330
a lot of your crew.

903
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,850
Conceptually,
you know,

904
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,480
we respect each other's opinions.
So if somebody in March for our lives,

905
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:37,610
and this is nobody in our lives,
but if somebody said,

906
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:40,340
I want to eliminate all guns,
I'd say,

907
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,470
okay,
well let's talk about that.

908
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,663
So you know,
my friends respect me for what I think 

909
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:48,620
and I respect them some.
It's difficult.

910
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,720
It's a difficult thing to respect people
who disagree with you for those things.

911
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:52,554
So you find that,
you know guys and girls your age are 

912
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:57,950
able to have these conversations without
killing each other.

913
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,010
There was a terrible choice of words 
without sure,

914
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,400
without being at each other's throats.
I think more than adults are right now.

915
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,263
Is that possible because that seems to 
be a through line with you that you're 

916
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,380
friends with.
A lot of people have different opinions.

917
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,010
I think we want to.
I think that a lot of people who want to

918
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:16,430
orange taking the right steps because 
they're saying yes we can.

919
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,670
We can come to some common ground if you
agree with me and there's a,

920
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,533
there's a want out there and that's 
something I'm really interested in 

921
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,523
because I come from a generation that I 
believe puts principles and morals over 

922
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,083
money and political victories and I 
think that we've actually got a bright 

923
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:35,330
future now.
People will call me in insane.

924
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,790
Bobby Kennedy more for saying that we 
have a bright future,

925
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:38,624
but I think we do.
I think we need to de stigmatize the 

926
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,324
conversation.
I had a lot of friends who who before 

927
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,110
seven months ago I would have thought 
were racist,

928
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:48,950
sexist,
bigoted,

929
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:49,784
homophobes who want the country to 
explode and want to destroy everybody 

930
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:52,754
who isn't exactly like them,
and then I learned maybe that's not the 

931
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:55,634
case and I have a lot of friends who 
would have thought that I was some 

932
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,560
leftist,
Beta Kuk shill who who wanted,

933
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,640
who wanted the communists to take 
everybody's guns and kill them,

934
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,073
and then they learn.

935
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,003
Maybe that's not the case.
I think our generation really is moving 

936
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:17,810
in a good direction when it comes to 
smart conversations.

937
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,480
I just think we need a bit of a social 
revolution.

938
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:23,270
They're not a huge social revolution.
I love social revolutions.

939
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:26,280
This isn't a big revolutions.
Cool.

940
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,680
At Beatles,
la,

941
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,260
ms dot level,
yet we're not.

942
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,510
We're not hearing that people sing the 
song and making me men yet,

943
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,260
but we there.
We need some.

944
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,650
We need a.
We need a,

945
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,120
a movement towards respecting each other
because look,

946
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,130
before all of this,
if I could have gotten rid of the right,

947
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:43,964
I would have,
and I know people who would have gotten 

948
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:47,480
rid of the left if they could have,
but it's not going to happen.

949
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,090
The parties might evolve over time.
I mean,

950
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,490
the parties or the parties are flipping 
in a lot of ways.

951
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,693
Think about this.

952
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,370
The party of Lincoln is the only party 
that currently we're not the Democrats.

953
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,720
There are some Democrats who are like 
this,

954
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,554
but the majority of people who are 
running as admitted white supremacists 

955
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,350
are part of the party of Lincoln.
So a Lotta,

956
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,340
a Lotta switches happen there.
Um,

957
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,643
I mean,
you've got some really awful rhetoric 

958
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:14,240
out there from folks like Candice Owens 
who will say,

959
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,180
we will talk about the left plantation.
Look,

960
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:21,620
I think identity politics are dangerous,
but calling saying that the real racists

961
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:24,890
or the Democrats is a hasty 
generalization,

962
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,113
I think.
I think there's actually some truth to 

963
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:28,394
it.
There's a difference between the 

964
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,240
liberals and the left.
Now you're speaking my language.

965
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:35,400
The thing is you can't pigeon hole them 
together.

966
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,010
Aspirational the right word for that.
Yeah.

967
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,410
Okay.
You can't pigeonhole them together.

968
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,663
I'm a liberal,
but I think that all men and women are 

969
00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:44,530
created equal and need to be respected 
equally.

970
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,230
Whereas people farther to the left will 
say,

971
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,420
as a,
as a white,

972
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,070
cisgender,
heterosexual male,

973
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,810
I don't have the right to say any of 
that.

974
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,020
Look you.
A friend of mine,

975
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,880
Michael Skolnik,
who I've worked with before,

976
00:44:57,881 --> 00:44:59,500
said something to me that I really 
appreciated,

977
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:02,320
which was you can't judge somebody by 
the hand they're dealt.

978
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,110
You judge them by how they elect to play
that hand.

979
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,650
People farther to the left will judge me
by the hand I'm dealt.

980
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:13,200
I grew up in a pretty well off family.
I had a pretty easy childhood.

981
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,300
I could've walked around my neighborhood
without fearing death,

982
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,150
which is something that some of my 
friends I made in Chicago,

983
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:19,984
we're not able to have,
but they'll say that my opinion is less 

984
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:25,900
valid than anybody's because I don't 
deal with the struggles they do.

985
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,123
I have an incredible amount of empathy 
for people who are not as privileged as 

986
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:31,750
I am.

987
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:35,860
I believe that white privilege exists.
I don't believe it's as systematic or,

988
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,550
or,
um,

989
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,423
really structural as people say it is.
I don't think the government exists to 

990
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:45,850
oppressed people,
but white privilege I believe exists.

991
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,120
I believe that there are certain 
situations where I will be,

992
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,013
where I will be in a better place 
because I'm a white cisgender 

993
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,730
heterosexual male.
Again,

994
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:58,060
it's not this large oppressive force 
that people treat it like,

995
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,760
but it's something we need to address 
and that's it.

996
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,840
That's the real thing I'm talking about 
recently,

997
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,823
which is we can find common ground on 
these issues and not try to push each 

998
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:11,350
other away because in my view,
in my view,

999
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,470
white privilege exists and people will 
say,

1000
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,550
well no,
because in many situations on the sat,

1001
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,240
African American students were given 
points and Asian students were,

1002
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,820
were deducted points.
And,

1003
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:27,430
and that proves that,
that,

1004
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,320
well,
I got myself into,

1005
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,650
yeah,
well I don't want.

1006
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,663
We don't have to go too far down down 
that road because we could have a whole 

1007
00:46:33,681 --> 00:46:35,300
other conversation on that because I,
I,

1008
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,190
I actually don't agree with you on that,
but,

1009
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:39,950
but that's the point of this.
That's the point.

1010
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,490
And I'm still learning.
You're still learning it.

1011
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,930
It's kind of a beautiful thing.
Yeah.

1012
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,920
I'm 17.
I can hardly smell.

1013
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,800
I'm not the expert on Shit.
And that's actually the point of the new

1014
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:52,670
podcast I'm putting out pretty soon.
It's called Cameron knows nothing.

1015
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,590
Uh,
do you watch game of thrones?

1016
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,970
I do.
Look at Grit.

1017
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:59,150
Told me,
and it's true,

1018
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,730
you know,
I had my own personal views on abortion.

1019
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,250
I actually,
I watched a video of yours where you and

1020
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:06,710
I have this pretty much the same exact 
view on the 20 weeks guy.

1021
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,620
Um,
but I also have not taken enough science

1022
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:10,454
classes.
I also do not have not conversed with 

1023
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:16,000
enough women who have had abortions.
My opinions mean Jack Shit to have them,

1024
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,843
you know,
it's just,

1025
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,853
I'm a 17 year old boy,
so there's only so much I can truly say 

1026
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:25,540
about pro lifers pro choice,
but I'm allowed to say it.

1027
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,860
Yeah.
And you know,

1028
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,040
in Cameron knows nothing.
I'm to tell you guys what I think

1029
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,873
but doesn't mean it's right.
Where do you think that attitude comes 

1030
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:34,804
from within you?
Because it seems to me that I think a 

1031
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:37,594
lot of what's happening right now is I 
see adults that are now afraid to say 

1032
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:43,600
what they think and you know,
they think that the mob is going to come

1033
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,130
after them,
which is completely legit.

1034
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:45,964
They think it might hurt.
There are job opportunities or things 

1035
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:48,581
like that.
Yeah,

1036
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:49,241
the mob,
whichever,

1037
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,410
whichever way it is.
Right.

1038
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:51,244
I mean,
I think what we see boycotts on both 

1039
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:55,720
sides and I think a lot of misguided 
anger off and uh,

1040
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:58,960
but I think most people need a little 
bit more of what you just did there,

1041
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:02,050
which is I just am what I am,
you know,

1042
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,690
maybe convinced me as some other stuff,
but I'm trying to learn here.

1043
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,730
I don't want to hurt anybody,
you know,

1044
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,210
I,
I don't,

1045
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,550
I want the government to crack down on 
guns.

1046
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,410
That doesn't mean I want the government 
to oppress you.

1047
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,773
Uh,
I believe that there's a certain amount 

1048
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:14,464
of time somebody should have access to 
an abortion and I think that abortion 

1049
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,200
should be more accessible just for a 
certain amount of time,

1050
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,230
but I don't want to kill babies and I 
don't want to oppress women.

1051
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,010
I want the world to be a better place.
You want the world to be a better place.

1052
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,750
Um,
I don't know about,

1053
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:29,740
about,
you know,

1054
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,890
anybody up in the booth,
but they seem really nice.

1055
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,380
They're pretty good.
Todd Macfarlane,

1056
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,250
I hand selected these people.
Exactly.

1057
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:37,870
Todd Mcfarlane wants the world to be a 
better place.

1058
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:39,490
David Hogg wants the world to be a 
better place.

1059
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,410
Uh,
Jordan Peterson wants the world.

1060
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,600
We all pretty much all of us.
Do I,

1061
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,110
I'm actually glad you mentioned Jordan 
Peterson because you know,

1062
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:48,370
I'm on tour with him right now.

1063
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,260
And one of the things that I find is 
first,

1064
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,094
if I meet a ton of people your age,
I'd say the bulk of the people that are 

1065
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:57,010
coming there are young people probably 
probably right around your age,

1066
00:48:57,011 --> 00:48:58,550
17,
18 into,

1067
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,760
into their probably early thirties and 
it's male,

1068
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:01,600
female,
gay,

1069
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:02,470
straight,
black,

1070
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:03,310
white,
the whole thing.

1071
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,693
But it's very obvious to me that he's 
providing some level of guidance that 

1072
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:12,130
somehow it seems that your generation 
kind of missed.

1073
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,203
Now it sounds like your,
your folks are pretty great and your 

1074
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:15,274
extended family and all that.
But do you sense that there is some 

1075
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:22,790
missing piece here that partly.
I don't know that there's some.

1076
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:23,703
I,
I discussed this last week with Peter 

1077
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,833
Teal,
that there was some disconnect between 

1078
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,660
the baby boomers,
my parents age and that,

1079
00:49:29,661 --> 00:49:31,390
that my guys,
the gen x people,

1080
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,830
we never had our moment or something.

1081
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,900
And then we've sort of handed it off to 
you guys,

1082
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:39,100
the millennials and Gen x,
Gen z actually.

1083
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,520
Wow.
When did those are?

1084
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:44,550
Three or four years older than I am.
Alright man,

1085
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,393
we're all in trouble.
I don't want to feel bad that we handed 

1086
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,064
it off to the,
to the generation of people who grew up 

1087
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:53,170
with cell phones,
immediate access to knowledge.

1088
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,840
We are the best and worst thing to ever 
happen to us.

1089
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,320
If I wanted to get to a hospital,
I can get to a hospital much easier with

1090
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:02,200
the cell phone if I want to look up a 
fact,

1091
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,783
forgetting the fact that facts are 
difficult right now because it's a fact 

1092
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:08,040
that facts are difficult to find.
Guide is if,

1093
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,620
um,
you know,

1094
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,320
I can do it,
but also I,

1095
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:13,690
I've,
before all of this,

1096
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,850
I was very,
very obsessed with my own image,

1097
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,610
not because I thought I had a good one,
but because I wanted it to be good.

1098
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,953
I was posting things online because I 
wanted people to think I had a cool 

1099
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:23,500
life.
I mean,

1100
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:24,820
I did.
I had a great life,

1101
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,890
but I want people to know that.
And,

1102
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,070
and it,
it the

1103
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,903
hyperconnectivity of social media,
which is a term I stole from many Ben 

1104
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,980
Platt interviews where he's talking 
about his musical.

1105
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:34,814
Do you Evan Hansen?
I don't want him to see this and think 

1106
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:39,860
I'm stealing the hyperconnectivity of 
social media is,

1107
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:41,520
um,
is,

1108
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,850
is a good and bad thing.
But I think the problem here,

1109
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:45,080
and I think that,
you know,

1110
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:46,590
folks like Jordan,
I'm a big fan of Jordan.

1111
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,330
I'm a big fan of yours.
Don't get a big head of people.

1112
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:51,164
People like you guys.
One of the things that you advocate for 

1113
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,910
his,
his conversation and people on the right

1114
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:57,800
young people on the right that I know 
and I'm friends with,

1115
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,830
they want to own the lips.
This is all about proving them wrong and

1116
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:02,510
saying like,
facts don't care about your feelings.

1117
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,583
I agree.
Facts by definition don't care about 

1118
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:06,524
your feelings,
but there's also logic which is kind of 

1119
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:09,380
the middle between the two really.

1120
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,210
And that's the interpretation and the 
insight and the fact where we,

1121
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,580
if we,
if we only based everything in fact,

1122
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:17,100
which a lot of young people have the 
right to,

1123
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,970
we're just talking about the past.
You can't look at the future and you can

1124
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:20,804
assess facts,
but a lot of a lot of young people on 

1125
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:25,850
the right one to prove people wrong and 
a lot of young people on the left,

1126
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:26,684
I've seen wants to want to make,
want to make people who disagree with 

1127
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:30,884
them look worse.
It's all about making the other look 

1128
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:33,044
worse,
the right ones to show that the left is 

1129
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,790
a bunch of copies and left wants to show
that the rights of bunch of fascists and

1130
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,960
that's a waste of time.
That is a.

1131
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,050
That is what is harming our country 
right now.

1132
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,560
I think Donald Trump's rhetoric is 
dangerous and harms our country,

1133
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,693
but trump is is the is a symptom of 
something greater like President Obama 

1134
00:51:51,621 --> 00:51:54,740
said when he made his return,
the made all of my liberal friends think

1135
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:56,630
Jesus came back,
which is,

1136
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,220
you know,
trump.

1137
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,450
Trump is the result of a country where 
the people who love trump are loving him

1138
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:03,880
more than ever in the people who hate 
trump.

1139
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,050
I hated it more than ever because we're 
divided.

1140
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,200
You know our rhetoric is,
is driving,

1141
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,150
is driving everybody in different 
directions.

1142
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:11,984
That's why you see the rise of 
democratic socialism and that's why you 

1143
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,104
see the rise of more and more people 
coming out and saying things that are 

1144
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,060
stupid because they have the first man 
right to do it.

1145
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,980
Look,
if you say something I don't like,

1146
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,190
I will defend it with my life.
I will defend with my life.

1147
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:27,410
You're right to say it,
but people are mixing,

1148
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,440
being not pc and being a jerk and and 
right now we're driving apart.

1149
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,910
We need to come together,
stop attacking each other.

1150
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,863
Both sides are equally as guilty in 
certain sides in certain situations are 

1151
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,190
obviously guilty gear,
but it,

1152
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,210
it's,
it's,

1153
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:44,390
it's,
it's bullshit.

1154
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,373
So do you sense a little more 
flexibility on the ability to talk to 

1155
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:54,350
people on the right than on the left 
because you know that that's been a sort

1156
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:54,780
of

1157
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,613
a big part of what's going on with me.
Like I get invited to go to these 

1158
00:52:59,070 --> 00:52:59,903
conservative things and turning point 
USA and I talk about being gay married 

1159
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:06,720
and I'm pro choice and against the death
penalty and all of these things that are

1160
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,000
thought of as leftists things,
but they invite me.

1161
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,013
We have a great time.
I take a zillion selfies with the kids 

1162
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:16,320
after and all that stuff where there 
doesn't seem to be that flexibility over

1163
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:16,880
there.
And now I get,

1164
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,050
I don't want to harp on this because I 
get your greater point,

1165
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:21,420
which is we got to get past this.
What I am,

1166
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,070
I do see something on one side,
especially young people that

1167
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,260
has become more corroded,
I would say.

1168
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:28,620
Then,
uh,

1169
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,760
then on the other side,
here's what I'll say.

1170
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:32,490
I'll say the left cares too much about 
people in the right doesn't care enough.

1171
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,040
And I'll tell you what I mean,
because they're,

1172
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,250
they're equally as wrong.
Here.

1173
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,930
The young people on the right will 
attack you with facts in,

1174
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:41,460
in,
in either positive or negative ways.

1175
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,653
And they're open to conversation very 
often I believe because they want to 

1176
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,290
prove you wrong.
That's what I've seen from that.

1177
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,990
That's not a fact.
It's an opinion.

1178
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,183
Whereas people on the left wants to 
accommodate for everybody so much that 

1179
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:55,860
if you say anything negative about 
anybody that they agree with,

1180
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,300
they jumped to their defense.
So I'll bring up the Israel argument,

1181
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:02,700
which is an argument that I don't know 
enough about to form an opinion.

1182
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,540
I truly do not,
but if you are a pro palette,

1183
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,910
that sounds like pretty much everybody.

1184
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:07,823
Exactly.
Being pro Palestine doesn't mean you 

1185
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:09,834
hate the Jews necessarily,
and being pro Israel doesn't mean that 

1186
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:16,140
you hate everybody who you hate.
Palestinians,

1187
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,890
but I'll talk to people on the right and
they'll.

1188
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,620
They'll be happier to talk about it then
people on the left,

1189
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,740
but the second I'd say that,
you know,

1190
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,640
Palestine should have land,
which again,

1191
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:28,410
I don't,
I don't have a firm opinion on.

1192
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,240
They'll say,
dude,

1193
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:31,620
you're Jewish.
How could you say that?

1194
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,293
I'll say because people are people and 
then I'll talk to people on the left 

1195
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:35,784
about it and I'll say,
there's a lot of concerns of tear and 

1196
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:39,834
they'll say,
don't you dare call everybody that 

1197
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,330
everybody who's Palestinian terrorist 
and on both sides.

1198
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:46,830
You're so,
so yes.

1199
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:48,930
I think the right is more open to 
conversation,

1200
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:51,810
but I think that more people on the 
right are trying to lure you into a cave

1201
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:52,644
where they can prove you wrong.

1202
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,950
I don't want to be proven right or wrong
right now.

1203
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:58,530
I want to discuss because my opinions on
things have changed.

1204
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:02,970
My opinions really are not taking a one 
80.

1205
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,360
I have all my opinions,
but my opinion on opinions is changing.

1206
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,973
That's that's the most important thing 
I'd like to highlight here if I'm 

1207
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,630
talking.
I used to think that,

1208
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,270
and we've talked about this.
I used to think that if you didn't agree

1209
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,104
with me,
you hate me.

1210
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,150
Now I've learned a different thing and 
I'm not,

1211
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,133
and what I'm advocating for now is I'm 
not asking people to change their 

1212
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:23,334
perspectives.
I'm asking people to stop having your 

1213
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,020
feet so firmly on the ground when you're
a child,

1214
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,060
because I'm a child.
You know I can't rent a car.

1215
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,660
I can't smoke a cigarette,
nor do I intend to,

1216
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,360
but at the end of the day,
I can't tell you about.

1217
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,900
I can't tell you with authority about 
economics.

1218
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:45,660
I can tell you what I think.
I haven't taken an econ class or finance

1219
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:50,550
class and we need young already doing 
better than most experts on CNN.

1220
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:51,384
I think people on the left and the right
need to need to realize that facts are 

1221
00:55:58,081 --> 00:55:59,790
facts.
Feelings are feelings,

1222
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:00,810
logic,
his logic,

1223
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,290
but the more and more we try to prove 
each other wrong,

1224
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:08,610
the less progress we're going to make 
because I have had the mindset.

1225
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:10,650
That's why I understand it.
I've had the mindset,

1226
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:14,190
we're all I wanted to do is just own the
conservatives and I know people have had

1227
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:17,950
the mindset where all they want to do is
own the lips by.

1228
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,960
By the way,
I know you're not.

1229
00:56:18,961 --> 00:56:20,850
You're saying this because Kyle 
[inaudible] Hsu,

1230
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,713
who I've gotten to know well,
who falls off and on the other side of 

1231
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,130
this

1232
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,963
and you,
he's now working with turning point and 

1233
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:31,120
he's trying to strengthen the second 
amendment and all sorts of other things.

1234
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,153
Uh,
you guys are friends and you guys are 

1235
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:33,934
still able to talk about these things.
And we had originally said maybe we 

1236
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:37,294
could get both you guys in here,
but we thought this would be a good 

1237
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:42,070
opportunity just to let you do your 
thing and I'll have kyle on separately.

1238
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:44,440
But you guys are,
despite your differences,

1239
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,660
you're,
you're able to talk

1240
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,780
a lot of things.
Kyle does.

1241
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,100
I don't like a lot.
Almost everything he says,

1242
00:56:50,101 --> 00:56:54,180
I disagree with some things he says that
I think are inappropriate.

1243
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,140
I've said some inappropriate stuff and,
and you know,

1244
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,480
I understand if you don't agree with me 
and you want to come out and speak,

1245
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,000
I,
I'm proud that I was able to speak after

1246
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:08,370
the shooting.
And Kyle did too.

1247
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,353
So I haven't.
I have a deep understanding of his 

1248
00:57:10,981 --> 00:57:13,710
position.
So beyond the podcast,

1249
00:57:13,711 --> 00:57:15,900
and I will give you my word that I will 
do the podcast.

1250
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,561
Oh please.
No,

1251
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,040
I was.
Yeah.

1252
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,990
Well you asked me to do it.
The email was.

1253
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:21,160
Can you do my phone that I'm lucky 
enough to be here?

1254
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,350
Yeah.
I'm more than happy to do it.

1255
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:23,460
We'll,
we'll make that happen.

1256
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,353
Um,

1257
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,230
what,
what do you want to do?

1258
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,750
Have you,
have you really been able to think about

1259
00:57:28,751 --> 00:57:29,584
it at this point?
I know it's sort of an annoying 

1260
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:32,590
question.
Can I ask a young person?

1261
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:33,500
No.
I mean,

1262
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,393
you know,
I can't tell you what college I want to 

1263
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:36,614
go to.
I can't tell you where I want to be in 

1264
00:57:37,401 --> 00:57:39,800
50 years,
but I can tell you that right now.

1265
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:40,634
I want to dedicate my time to do them 
what I think is the best thing I could 

1266
00:57:42,681 --> 00:57:43,514
do with my platform because I have a 
large platform for all the worst 

1267
00:57:46,191 --> 00:57:47,024
reasons.
And with great platform comes great 

1268
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:50,780
responsibility.
Spiderman.

1269
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,400
Exactly.
Uncle Ben said that,

1270
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:55,760
I believe it wasn't a gold band,
but when you say uncle Ben on this show,

1271
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:58,090
people might be like kindly talking 
about entropy.

1272
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:00,103
Ben Parker and I have responsibility to 
do what I think is right and what I 

1273
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:06,320
think is right is advocating for what I 
believe in,

1274
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:07,363
but also making sure that the 
conversation is mended and healed 

1275
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:12,163
because who better than the people who 
are about to become adults to try and 

1276
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:18,650
make sure that our next generation of 
adults knows how to work together.

1277
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,050
I mean,
you got Nelson and Rubio in Florida.

1278
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:24,290
I'll give you a great example.
Nelson Rubio had passed some great bills

1279
00:58:24,291 --> 00:58:27,680
together because Nelson Rubio don't see 
eye to eye,

1280
00:58:27,681 --> 00:58:30,500
but they are able to put their 
differences aside.

1281
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,440
They get along and I want more of that.
Yeah.

1282
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,500
Well man,
yeah.

1283
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,450
I know a lot of people were worried 
about the future,

1284
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:37,284
but I mean it's clear to me that your 
future is bright and if we can hand it 

1285
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:42,030
over,
we're going to hand it over to to,

1286
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,460
to people like you will.
We'll be all right because this is.

1287
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,470
This is everything that I've been trying
to do here.

1288
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:50,580
I think it's summed up in the way that 
you're trying to go forward with life.

1289
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:51,840
It's pretty awesome.
Really.

1290
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:52,400
It's inspiring.

1291
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,690
I appreciate that.
Let me ask you something,

1292
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:55,870
your show.
So I'm going to.

1293
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,670
We're going to swap your flip it and you
are in theater.

1294
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:59,121
All right.
Yeah,

1295
00:58:59,121 --> 00:59:00,410
exactly.
So,

1296
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:04,190
um,
so what,

1297
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:05,323
what are the qualities you're looking 
for in a candidate if you are going to 

1298
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:09,440
vote for them over president trump in 
20,

1299
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:10,283
20.

1300
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,193
Oh Man.
You're really putting me on the spot 

1301
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:12,940
here.
This is my show.

1302
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,170
Look,
I've said this before,

1303
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:15,004
but it seems to me that the,
unfortunately the democratic socialist 

1304
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,890
wing of the Democrats has gone really 
far left.

1305
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:22,281
I mean,
look,

1306
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:25,550
the word socialist is in the,
is in the title now,

1307
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,160
and purge,
right?

1308
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:28,994
I guess they're being honest for what 
they are and they're fighting for what 

1309
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:31,124
they believe in.
I happen to disagree with virtually all 

1310
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,340
of it,
but that they're doing that.

1311
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:38,270
They've basically purged what I think 
are the remaining liberals,

1312
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:40,160
as you said,
classical liberals before.

1313
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,580
And I think unfortunately that leaves a 
lot of us.

1314
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:44,414
It's why people watch my show because 
I've just been honest about what I see 

1315
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:47,834
here.
That leaves a lot of us suddenly with 

1316
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:53,450
allies in places that we didn't think we
were going to have allies.

1317
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:54,283
And it's sort of unfortunate in one way 
because you want to always think that 

1318
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:59,510
you can sort of stay home and fix 
things.

1319
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,373
I got to pop the bubble.
But at the moment I find my allies who 

1320
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,260
certainly are libertarians on the right,
I think I can,

1321
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,123
you know,
be allies and a lot of ways with Ben 

1322
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,493
Shapiro,
even though we have differences on the 

1323
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,440
margins with abortion and some of that 
other stuff.

1324
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,753
Um,
but I don't see at the moment from when 

1325
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,283
we're taping this right now.
I just don't see any hope in the short 

1326
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:25,310
term for the Democrats.
My hope is that this thing implodes that

1327
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:27,970
they get probably half to get crushed in
the midterms,

1328
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,813
which is not looking likely,
but that they get crushed in the 

1329
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:31,784
midterms.
And then they have a major course 

1330
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:38,060
adjustment where they go,
we've got to return to liberalism.

1331
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,490
Sure.
And that is the answer because I believe

1332
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:43,370
liberalism is the answer.
I think it's the only answer.

1333
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,490
But if you know somebody that I should 
be paying attention to,

1334
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:48,500
let me know because I don't see much.

1335
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:51,680
We'll keep in touch and I know we've got
a list.

1336
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,863
I'll send you some liberals.
That one more thing I know we're about 

1337
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,043
onto.
Yeah.

1338
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,853
What is your favorite musical and with 
which musical character do you identify 

1339
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:02,070
the most?
Oh Man.

1340
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:03,090
Yeah,
not really going for it.

1341
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:05,250
I'd rather do favorite superhero movie 
or something,

1342
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:06,870
but a superior moving.
Let's go to that.

1343
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,153
Well,
I was telling you during the break that 

1344
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:09,420
I.
I mean,

1345
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,480
I really felt infinity war was 
spectacular.

1346
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:15,510
I think it was just done right.
Loki has to be dead though.

1347
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:17,310
That's,
that's the key thing I want.

1348
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,250
But I think I love Gomorrah.
She's amazing.

1349
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,130
She's a bad ass.
But if they bring her back,

1350
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:26,160
which they will bring her back,
she was killed in the process of getting

1351
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:28,530
the soul stone.
So they can say that once they destroyed

1352
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:30,180
the stones or whatever,
however it may be,

1353
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:31,323
they could bring her back and it'll be 
nice to see her back because I love her 

1354
01:01:33,871 --> 01:01:35,550
as an actress.
I love her chemistry with everyone.

1355
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,613
But that was a powerful me.
You can't keep killing people and 

1356
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:40,824
bringing them back.
That's why Loki has to be dead this 

1357
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:43,980
time.
Which they basically made it sound like.

1358
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:47,100
Yeah.
What infinity ward did a good job with.

1359
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,370
You know Tony.
Tony has been in Mcu for what?

1360
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:52,800
Like 20 movies and he didn't die 
Gomorrah.

1361
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:57,150
This is her third film and I felt that I
felt that debt right here.

1362
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,290
I hate to tell you,
but she's,

1363
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,730
well hate to tell you or whatever.
She's good.

1364
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,420
She's going to be alive.
But putting that aside,

1365
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:02,640
musical,
you know,

1366
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,010
I'm not a huge musical guy.
I'm not.

1367
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:07,250
I know you don't want to hear that as 
well as a theater guy.

1368
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:07,890
Yeah.
No,

1369
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,890
not a huge moves or girl I liked.
I liked Mama Mia is we can,

1370
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,190
we can find some common ground.
That's what it is.

1371
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,243
It's about

1372
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:16,971
exactly what's up,
man.

1373
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:19,410
We could've talked about marvel movies 
and all these other.

1374
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,070
You gave

1375
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,440
me a lot of funny pop culture references
before we started.

1376
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,240
You have to,
uh,

1377
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,910
you have to break new ground.
And that's what I was trying to do here.

1378
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,030
That's what it's all about.
I have no doubt you have a bright future

1379
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:32,280
and you're probably going to be 
president.

1380
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,413
Is that where this is all leading 
president of Stoneman Douglas High 

1381
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:35,911
School's Drama Club?
No,

1382
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:37,500
because my dear friend,
uh,

1383
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:39,180
she ran and she's doing a phenomenal 
job.

1384
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,690
I that no guys follow camera and on 
twitter it's cameron underscore caskey.
