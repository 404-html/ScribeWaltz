1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,893
In so all of you in the good old us of a
have missed the turkeys running around 

2
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,214
for dear life this week.
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving without even a 

3
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:12,964
close second.
Thanksgiving is by far my favorite 

4
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:18,070
holiday of the year.
I find that focusing on the three F's,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,300
family,
friends,

6
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:24,100
and food usually brings out the best in 
just about everybody between the trip to

7
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:26,980
fan from the Turkey,
your booze of choice and football in the

8
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:28,270
background.
All of us,

9
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:29,104
at least in my experience,
are just a little bit better on this 

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,510
day,
which we've set aside to give thanks for

11
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:39,400
all the goodness in our lives.
Thanksgiving is the ultimate reminder of

12
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:40,234
what it means to be American.
While most of us have the usual staples 

13
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,650
of Turkey,
mashed potatoes,

14
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,960
stuffing,
and cranberry sauce around the table.

15
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,960
We also bring in traditions from our own
cultures,

16
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:51,850
ethnicities,
and nationalities.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,490
This blending of flavors,
languages,

18
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:55,324
and customs from all over the world is 
what makes Thanksgiving a uniquely 

19
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:02,680
American holiday.
No offense to Canadian thanksgiving.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,113
The melting pot that we've created here 
has given more freedom to more people 

21
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,314
for more walks of life than any other 
country in the history of the world 

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,800
today.
People still yearning to come to America

23
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,520
to take part in our freedom and pretty 
much nobody wants to leave America.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,160
No matter how often celebrities say that
they will.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,220
This doesn't mean we're perfect or 
anywhere close to it,

26
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,054
but it does mean that our tradition of 
freedom based on and rooted in the 

27
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,580
pursuit of life,
liberty,

28
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:31,414
and happiness is a pretty good starting 
point for how to build a truly liberal 

29
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:36,604
and tolerant society.
While politics will undoubtedly be 

30
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,910
discussed around the Thanksgiving table 
this year,

31
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,893
I'm going to do my best to try to veer 
the conversation always to what brings 

32
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,870
us together rather than what rips us 
apart.

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,080
Maybe your uncle is pro life and you're 
a pro choice.

34
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:56,290
Maybe your sister voted for Hillary,
but you voted for trump.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,310
Maybe you want low taxes and your dad 
wants to redistribute wealth.

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,473
Whatever those differences are,
they are actually the very reason that 

37
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:06,214
this country is so great.
We all get to have our own opinion and 

38
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:10,204
fight for what we believe,
but beyond just the ability to be 

39
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,070
tolerant of people who are different 
from us.

40
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,173
It's more important that we can still 
learn from live with and even love 

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,153
people who think differently than we do.
I hope you have a wonderful day 

42
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:25,174
tomorrow,
filled with those three f's I mentioned 

43
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,210
earlier,
friends,

44
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,780
family and food,
and maybe one more f if you get lucky.

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,123
Either way.
Let's give thanks tomorrow for all the 

46
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:35,644
goodness we have,
but often forget to even acknowledge 

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,380
happy Thanksgiving to you and all your 
loved ones.

48
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,600
Joining me today is the creator of the 
Dilbert Comic Strip,

49
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,463
author of the new book win bigly and a 
guy who seems to make some pretty spot 

50
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,010
on predictions.
Scott Adams,

51
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,290
welcome back to the Rubin report.
Thanks for me.

52
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,250
Before

53
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,130
we begin,
I gotTa Tell Ya,

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,900
I was looking at these blurbs on the 
back of this book.

55
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,200
How did you get these people,
William Shakespeare,

56
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,500
Mark Twain,
Alexander the Great Abe Lincoln,

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,510
and even this Scott Adams guy.
I mean,

58
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,344
how in the world did you pull this off?
I stick with dead people because they 

59
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,220
can't complain later.
It's like,

60
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,490
no,
not one of them has complained that I've

61
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,050
misquoted them.
You know Mark Twain,

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,390
he said nothing about his quote.
So what?

63
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,224
I saw this,
I thought immediately there must be an 

64
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:31,390
estate for some of these people that 
monitor these types of things.

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,430
Do you even have to think about that?
Does the editor or the publisher goes,

66
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,760
Scott,
you can't play in.

67
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,730
Come on.
Well,

68
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:41,260
luckily my job is parody and so,
so I know those laws pretty well.

69
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,680
As long as it's obvious parody,
you can do anything you want.

70
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,960
So we checked right before you walked 
in.

71
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,730
We had you on the show September,
first of 2016,

72
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,850
about two months before the election and
when I had you on,

73
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,684
you were one of the only people that I 
thought basically was making sense of 

74
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,260
what was going on with trump at the 
time.

75
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,240
You didn't say you were a trump 
supporter.

76
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,220
I think you actually said you were not a
trump supporter.

77
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:10,090
You had sort of said the thing about you
are in a hostage situation with Hillary,

78
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,924
but you know,
basically you were saying here's what 

79
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,340
trump is doing.
I don't necessarily support it.

80
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,100
I think you buy the election time.
You officially did support him,

81
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,940
right?
Yeah.

82
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,880
The because of one issue.
Basically when,

83
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,620
when Clinton came out with the,
uh,

84
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,454
the estate tax plan and I realized that 
I personally would pay roughly seventy 

85
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,630
five cents on every dollar I would learn
from the rest of my life,

86
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,700
which would basically make me retire.

87
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,940
I wouldn't possibly work for that.
Um,

88
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,470
so that,
that changed my mind.

89
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,423
Yeah.
I wasn't going to jump into the estate 

90
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,044
tax,
but I do find it when one of the 

91
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:42,634
interesting things,
I don't stand to make a windfall from 

92
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:45,604
the estate tax,
but I find it one of those things where 

93
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,464
it's like,
this money has been taxed for someone's 

94
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,194
entire life.
Your money that you earned through all 

95
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,590
your hard work has been taxed your whole
life.

96
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,260
Hopefully you've made good investments 
and whatever else you've done.

97
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,300
I met at the end.
The government just says,

98
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,134
okay,
we're going to just basically take more 

99
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,640
than half of it at that point after 
we've already taken it the whole time,

100
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,743
the whole tax thing.
There's no way to make it fair because 

101
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,500
there's always somebody who's going to 
complain,

102
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,543
but some things just feel less fair and 
that feels more like confiscation than 

103
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,360
tax.

104
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah.
But I guess it's easy to be one of those

105
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,420
people that just are like,
well,

106
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,970
I'm not involved in this.
I don't stand to win anything of it,

107
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,950
so why wouldn't I want to take the money
from other people?

108
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,830
Right.
Yeah.

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,450
That's the big problem with the 
democratic system.

110
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,284
People can vote a vote other people's 
money into their pocket if there are 

111
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:33,880
enough of them voting.
Yeah.

112
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,640
Alright,
so it's a little over a year ago that we

113
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,900
had you on.
You're making some sense of the,

114
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,743
of the techniques that are,
that you're writing about in this book 

115
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,410
about persuasion and what trump is doing
and all that.

116
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,190
Around that time,
just like two months before you actually

117
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053
did you really think it was real?
I did really believe that he was going 

118
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:57,550
to win those weeks that we're talking 
about and most of the time up to them,

119
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:57,830
they don't.

120
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,663
The only time my confidence was really 
shaken was the same time everybody else 

121
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,290
was after the access Hollywood pussy,
pussy gay thing dropped.

122
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,360
I don't think anybody thought that day 
that he could get out of that.

123
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,820
I haven't heard of one person who said,
yeah,

124
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:17,180
that that didn't bother me at all,
but it was just amazing.

125
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:22,070
There was so much news that that whole 
cycle and so much more came after that.

126
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,173
That even something that large didn't 
have the impact it would have had 

127
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:29,120
because it got lost and you know the.
The,

128
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,670
the enormity of it all.
Yeah.

129
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,170
What does that tell you?
Generally about truth right now.

130
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,270
Now the subtitle of your book is 
persuasion.

131
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,104
In a world where facts don't matter,
facts and truth have a little something 

132
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,944
to do with each other.
What does that actually tell you that 

133
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,374
something like that could happen 
regardless of whether you think it was 

134
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,860
just something he said or locker room 
talk or all that nonsense,

135
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,210
but that things don't stick in a way.

136
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,860
They used to.
Let me,

137
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,694
let me give some context for people who 
are new to me in addition to cartooning 

138
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,570
and writing and stuff.
Uh,

139
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,413
I'm a trained hypnotist and I've been 
studying persuasion in all its forms 

140
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,510
for,
for decades.

141
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,883
So I was looking at it through that 
filter and one of the things that 

142
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:06,854
hypnotist learned is that people are 
irrational pretty much all the time and 

143
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:11,534
they just rationalize their decisions 
and believed that it made sense all 

144
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,690
along.
And that's the normal way of things.

145
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,110
Until you get into that mindset,
the whole world looks confusing.

146
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,973
You can't understand why you gave you a 
good reasons and your facts and your 

147
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,550
logic and the person you're talking to 
didn't change their mind.

148
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,803
So my view on the election was that are 
certainly by the time that the access 

149
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:37,460
Hollywood tape dropped,
probably almost every mind was made up.

150
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,983
They didn't know why,
but they had made up their minds for 

151
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,130
emotional,
irrational,

152
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:47,210
whatever reasons,
so it's tough to dislodge somebody,

153
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,313
you know,
he would have had to murder somebody in 

154
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:50,864
public to change minds at that point,
that late stage because people were 

155
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,490
really hardened in their opinions by 
then.

156
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,260
Yeah.
What does that tell you?

157
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,910
I mean,
as we're taping this,

158
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,670
this will be up next week,
so a little right before thanksgiving.

159
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,110
We're taping this on the.
Today's the eighth today.

160
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,170
Does that sound right?
Okay.

161
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,820
That sounds good.
You're a pro.

162
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,893
Um,
what does that tell you as I'm watching 

163
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,510
all these people on twitter in the last 
day or so with this,

164
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,383
thank you,
Hillary Hashtag and all this stuff and 

165
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,230
this continued worship of her,
even though by every estimation,

166
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:23,140
she probably was the worst candidate in 
the history of American politics.

167
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,460
That might be a bit of an overblown 
statement,

168
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,040
but what does that day that they're 
still on this,

169
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,820
there's still on this thing that both 
rumble but consider that a statement.

170
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,683
We consider it now a given that she was 
one of the worst candidates we've ever 

171
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:41,540
seen prior to the election and really 
maybe up right up until election day.

172
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,823
The general thought on both sides was,
this is one of the strongest candidates 

173
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:50,000
we've ever seen for everything from 
funding to experience too.

174
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,710
It was time for a,
for a woman.

175
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,200
People were emotionally and every other 
way.

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,470
The world was for that,

177
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,620
so it's only after the fact that we've 
now reinterpreted what we saw as well as

178
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,454
she was the worst candidate ever and I 
don't know if either one of those is 

179
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:04,734
true.
I think we had two candidates who had 

180
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,530
some real big pluses.
She had lots of pluses and some real big

181
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,840
flaws in both cases.
Yeah.

182
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,500
Do you think that basically trump from 
before the election,

183
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:20,980
so,
so during the process until now,

184
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,323
after a year of governing basically or 
10 months or so of governing has 

185
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,580
basically used this book.
I know he didn't have it,

186
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,110
but you know what I mean,
like has he,

187
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,080
is this really what he has done from 
beat one that you saw before?

188
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,933
So you have to understand his entire 
life arc starts with going to a church 

189
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,730
where his pastor was Norman Vincent 
Peale,

190
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,360
the famous author who wrote the power of
positive thinking,

191
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,853
and so that's,
that's the first place you probably 

192
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:51,134
learned persuasion,
at least one corner of persuasion 

193
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,493
because in his time Norman Vincent Peale
was actually accused of being a 

194
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,670
hypnotist.
He was that influential.

195
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,803
So that optimism,
you see him using it all the time to 

196
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:05,300
make us think into the future.
When he talks about the GDP,

197
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,500
he doesn't say,
well,

198
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:08,150
we've got three percent.
That's pretty good.

199
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,280
That's what a normal president would 
say.

200
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,530
He says,
we've got three percent,

201
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,720
but without the hurricanes,
I think it would have been for.

202
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,910
We've probably got four percent.
I think we'll do better than that.

203
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,420
He was actually talking us into the 
future and if you,

204
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,040
if you consider how an economy works,
unless you have shortages of stuff,

205
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,450
and we're,
we're really,

206
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,343
you know,
in a great time because we don't have 

207
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,780
shortages of anything.

208
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,830
It's psychology that drives it.
So if people think we're heading to four

209
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,664
percent,
they're going to invest a little bit 

210
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:39,680
more this year to get ready for that,
and that's what makes it four percent.

211
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,640
He's actually taking what he learned as 
a child and you know,

212
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,730
that,
that persuasive thinking into the future

213
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,820
of driving the economy that way.
And then if you look at his full,

214
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,450
full range of he knows how to sell 
marketing,

215
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,613
branding,
nobody doubts any of those skills at 

216
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,420
this point.
Um,

217
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,900
and then negotiating,
he wrote literally,

218
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:01,390
you know,
authored with a coauthor,

219
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,630
a book on negotiating.
So he's seen persuasion from every,

220
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,480
every angle including design,
you know,

221
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,533
he's,
he's the one who I believe came up with 

222
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,360
or at least approved the hats,
make America great again.

223
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,583
And I think people will look back at 
this for 40 years and say that was the 

224
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,460
best branding we've ever seen.

225
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,493
Yeah,
it's interesting to me because you said 

226
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,240
the positive way he speaks and then you 
gave some examples.

227
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,390
But if you listen to the,
just the general narrative out there,

228
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,530
this is the most divisive president at 
the time.

229
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,610
He says all these horrible things,
what do you make of that portion of him,

230
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,553
the twitter portion that's fighting with
people still all the time doing things 

231
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,334
that in my opinion are below the office 
of the presidency and I say that as 

232
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,970
someone that that I really did.
The reason I wasn't surprised when trump

233
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:49,804
won was because I actually sat down with
you right before and I listened and I 

234
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,190
started seeing

235
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,320
this stuff,
so I wasn't thoroughly.

236
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:59,050
I was on Rogan,
Joe Rogan the day before the election,

237
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,720
or maybe it was election day actually,
and I was like,

238
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,890
yeah,
I think it's possible.

239
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,170
And did I actually change your mind on 
that?

240
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,303
Well,
I don't know that you can fully changed 

241
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:08,484
my mind,
but you made me aware of what was 

242
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,370
happening.
I think basically before I sat down with

243
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,204
you,
I was sort of where I think a lot of 

244
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:14,974
people still are,
which is they're just grabbing for 

245
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,590
anything.
You know what I mean?

246
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:18,424
Like they're just,
they have nothing that they're really 

247
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,790
basing any decisions on.
They see the tweets,

248
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,460
they scream about the tweets or they 
don't even have a chance to scream about

249
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,160
the tweets because the media gets 
outraged before they can even process it

250
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,243
and,
and you sort of framed it in a way that 

251
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,270
basically said to me,
there's something sensible about this is

252
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,800
what I think most people have kind of 
missed that.

253
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,843
One of the things that is deeply 
important for persuasion is first you 

254
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:45,391
have to get people's attention.
That's like phase one at this point can,

255
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,200
can anybody argue that he's the best 
we've ever seen at getting attention,

256
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,940
right?
That's that one.

257
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,810
Even his biggest haters and say,
yeah,

258
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:56,470
I like the way he has dominated the 
media and every conversation,

259
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,304
yes,
so step out and get attention and the 

260
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,290
way he does that is he.
He operates in what I call a narrow band

261
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,124
of wrongness,
meaning that if this is appropriate 

262
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:05,974
behavior,
he just takes it up to this band with 

263
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,140
the nicknames and the provocative things
he says,

264
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,780
but he never does up here where you'd 
get impeached.

265
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,020
You'd be putting in the insane asylum 
and start a nuclear war.

266
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
If you look how long he's been doing 
this and how,

267
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:21,274
uh,
how consistently stays in that narrow 

268
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:23,884
band of wrongness,
which is persuasion perfection because 

269
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:30,070
you can't look away and then you're 
thinking about why he wants you to think

270
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:34,780
about now consider also that he's also 
been meeting with a lot of world leaders

271
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,614
at this point.

272
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,633
He doesn't do that in that context,
so it's clear that he can modify his 

273
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:44,980
behavior to get the effect he needs.
We didn't know that for sure.

274
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,960
I'll say other people didn't know that 
for sure.

275
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,113
You know,
when he was running it looked a little 

276
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,134
crazy and maybe under control,
but now we've seen the fine control he 

277
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:54,210
puts on it,
you know,

278
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,053
on twitter,
that narrow band that wrongness every 

279
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:57,574
time in real life you can modulate 
everything being equal as a smart guy 

280
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,214
and a bright guy and an author and 
someone that cares about words and all 

281
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,340
of those things.
Putting trump aside for a moment,

282
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,233
would you prefer that we just had a 
president that was a little more within 

283
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:19,870
the common standards of decency or seem 
to really appreciate.

284
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:20,704
You know,
I keep telling this story that I was in 

285
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,930
DC a couple weeks ago and I went to all 
the monuments.

286
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,580
I was reading all the great things that 
Jefferson wrote in George Washington all

287
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,723
like,
it's very different than when they look 

288
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:31,510
back and they put trump's tweet next to 
all of it.

289
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,450
Well,
I have mixed feelings for one lot.

290
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,730
One of the things that the people on the
left,

291
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,950
let's say the the anti trumpers,
whoever they are,

292
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,870
don't get is how entertaining he is to 
his base.

293
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,063
The people who actually like what he's 
got to offer find it amazingly 

294
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,670
entertaining and funny.
So the things that people are saying,

295
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,380
oh,
I can't believe you said that.

296
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:58,310
These using a front to all civilization.
That's why it's funny.

297
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,950
It's funny because we know he does it 
intentionally.

298
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,173
We know the effect it'll have on a of 
group of people and that's sort of the 

299
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:08,540
joke that it has that effect that as to 
your question,

300
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,890
we were never offered somebody who had 
his,

301
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,843
his talents and his specific policies 
that appealed to a lot of people who 

302
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,060
voted for him without the flaws.

303
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,060
You're nobody offered the,
you know,

304
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:25,970
the trump without the tweets that make 
people angry.

305
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,193
And I would argue that probably 80 
percent of the things that feel like 

306
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,754
they're over the live actually are 
functional and the 20 percent then 

307
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:36,174
maybe,
you know,

308
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,030
how do you mean functional gets 
attention.

309
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,983
That puts a nickname on somebody that 
actually takes them completely out of 

310
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,704
the primaries.
We saw that with low energy jeb and I 

311
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,080
think the crooked hillary thing was,
was quite effective.

312
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,200
But there are other things that are 
maybe just too far,

313
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,640
you know,
a little they don't have.

314
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,883
They're not so far.
He gets impeached but they're not 

315
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,130
useful.
Um,

316
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,680
but they also don't seem to hurt him in 
the long run.

317
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,040
We've seen something we may never see 
again,

318
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,120
which is a complete disconnect between 
approval ratings,

319
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:12,980
which are terrible and people's image of
what the economy is doing.

320
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,440
For example,
business confidence is great.

321
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,580
I don't think we'll ever see those 
disconnect again and it's because of his

322
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,740
style.
Does that also show you that people just

323
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,420
don't care about Paul's anymore?
I mean,

324
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:25,580
I saw Paul on Sunday on CNN and it's 
said,

325
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,440
you know,
half of Americans don't trust trump,

326
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:27,861
and I thought,
well,

327
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,500
half of Americans don't trust CNN.
I mean all of the.

328
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,573
You know what I mean?
It's like you guys through all these 

329
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,194
numbers at us before you through all 
this nonsense at us before and now 

330
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:40,160
you're still throwing nonsense and I 
don't try.

331
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,810
I really almost trust none of it and I.
It makes it harder to,

332
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,790
to siphon some truth out and now the 
onus is on a.

333
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,840
I was just saying a pole that was saying
that something about,

334
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,224
boy,
people think the leaders think of the 

335
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:54,584
president and I'm thinking,
how do we know what leaders of other 

336
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:58,250
countries think of the president?

337
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,130
What,
what good is that?

338
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,140
Apple,
right.

339
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:01,130
So yeah,
we're a little while.

340
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,260
Is that even relevant in,
in an odd way,

341
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,200
you know,
so if they fear us,

342
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:06,034
certain countries,
we want them to fear so they probably 

343
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,204
won't like the president,
whether it's trump or obama or anyone 

344
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:10,341
else.
Well,

345
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,490
I've been saying from the beginning,
one of the big things that scared people

346
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,324
about,
uh,

347
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,770
a president and trump was that our other
leaders going to deal with this guy,

348
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,460
you know,
is,

349
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,030
are they going to be frightened?
Will they make you know the nucleus just

350
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,760
in case.
No problem so far.

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,833
It turns out that if you're the 
president of the United States and you 

352
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,810
have good table manners when you,
when you talked to other leaders,

353
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,003
there's,
there's nothing that they would rather 

354
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:39,260
do than deal with you because it's in 
their best interest and it works.

355
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,243
So I listened to you on Sam Harris' 
podcast and Sam obviously been here a 

356
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:44,924
bunch of times.
I find him to be one of the brightest 

357
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:46,694
and most thoughtful people that I know.
You guys obviously differ greatly on 

358
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:51,900
the,
on the trump thing,

359
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,303
probably more than anything else,
but when you hear him make a couple of 

360
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,380
those arguments,
whichever one you can pick anyone.

361
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,960
Um,
does any of it get to you?

362
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,070
Does any of it,
you know,

363
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,260
the moral center,
just what the,

364
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,303
what's really going on?
If things really escalated with North 

365
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,000
Korea,
you can pick one out of the bag.

366
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,893
Well,
for those who didn't hear my 

367
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,890
conversation with Sam on his podcast,
um,

368
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,000
I was not addressing the moral,
ethical dimension because I figured that

369
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,430
people are out on their own for that.
In other words,

370
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,060
my moral center is not much different 
than everybody else's.

371
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,290
I have exactly the same preferences.
If you could do things without lying,

372
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,500
without insulting people,
of course I prefer that,

373
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,660
but nobody gave us that choice.
You know,

374
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,130
we,
we didn't get that candidate.

375
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,160
We had to lead the choices that we had.
So,

376
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,390
uh,
I think there was,

377
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,930
there's an illusion that Sam and I 
disagreed on the ethical,

378
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,640
moral stuff.
Uh,

379
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:47,700
I simply take the position fair.
Yeah.

380
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,653
Right.
Because it really wasn't addressed 

381
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,530
specific.
I wasn't,

382
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,890
wasn't directly asked,
I don't think I'm,

383
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,010
I take the position that if,
if a,

384
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,873
if a terrorist was holding your child 
and the only way I could save them is 

385
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:02,790
lying to the terrorist.
I will lie to the terrorist to save your

386
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,050
child.
Now,

387
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,913
if you wouldn't,
I'm not sure that you can claim the 

388
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:07,614
moral high ground.
There are some situations such as 

389
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,610
beating Isis,
you know,

390
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:12,810
having a good economy.

391
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,280
These are fantastically good things for 
human beings.

392
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,473
If you had,
if the only way you could get there is 

393
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,880
Ben's been some truths.
Um,

394
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,370
then I'm a little bit more flexible 
about that,

395
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,690
but I don't think my moral look on this 
as any different than anybody else's.

396
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,883
Yeah.
But what about just the concerns that 

397
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:34,194
Sam and others,
like the people that are the real 

398
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:35,850
critics.
Forget,

399
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:36,684
forget.
We can put them aside because if people 

400
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,120
haven't listened to it,
it's not boring.

401
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,590
But when you hear people say,
well,

402
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,813
trump is so erratic and he's dealing 
with erratic leader in North Korea and 

403
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:45,441
all of the things,
you,

404
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,790
you basically think that that's all just
playing that,

405
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,953
that other higher bar this way,
and that in reality we're still doing 

406
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,320
it.
Well,

407
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,153
we could talk about North Korea 
separately because that's really kind 

408
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,370
of,
there's nothing like that that's sort of

409
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:57,630
its own situation.

410
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,430
And at the moment I think he's handling 
that.

411
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,620
Right.
Well,

412
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,420
let's talk about that.
Let's do it.

413
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,950
What do you think about North Korea?
So for,

414
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,813
for however many decades,
we haven't really had any pro progress 

415
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,194
because we,
they promise things and then they don't 

416
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:12,534
do them.
This is probably the first time that 

417
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,370
little rocket man shall we call him,
um,

418
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,170
is literally worried that he will be 
dead in the next 30 days.

419
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,720
I don't think they've ever had that 
thought before.

420
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,350
And that's got to help in negotiations.
Now if you're thinking,

421
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,720
but that might make him,
you know,

422
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,060
fire off a nuke.
Well that's the only way you can be sure

423
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:33,894
your dad.
So right now he's only two choices are 

424
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,043
dead for sure.
I don't think he wants to make that or 

425
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,010
worrying about being dead unless he 
comes to the negotiating table and there

426
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:44,844
seems to be some,
maybe a little bit of a hint of a 

427
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,960
movement there.
Yeah.

428
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,210
So,
um,

429
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,650
but to your bigger question,
what about all the other stuff that,

430
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,730
that is problematic if you were to list 
all the things that people consider that

431
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,070
the criticisms of trump on one column 
and then all the things that people,

432
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,440
even his critics would say,
okay,

433
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:06,274
these things are going well.
You would find that the things that are 

434
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:13,651
going well or generally real meaning 
that there is less isis stocks are up.

435
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,703
Um,
you know,

436
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,750
we,
they did,

437
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,650
he did appoint justices that least his 
side likes,

438
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,600
um,
immigration is down by 50 percent.

439
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,300
These are real and measurable things and
they matter and they're big.

440
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,780
If you look at the list of things that 
people are criticizing,

441
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,540
it's well,
we think he might cause a problem.

442
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,033
We think this could go wrong.
We're concerned that people think about 

443
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:36,664
him this way.
We think that his supporters are more 

444
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:43,190
racist than they are.
Almost all of them would,

445
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,090
would be legitimately classified as 
imaginary.

446
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,780
Now that's not to say that there 
couldn't be bad things in the future,

447
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,630
but at the moment they are purely 
imagined.

448
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,663
Yeah.
It's interesting because I was on Sam's 

449
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:57,660
Ama podcasts and we discussed this and I
mentioned,

450
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,020
or he brought up the interview with you,
but that's what I said to basically.

451
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:01,441
I said,
look,

452
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:05,250
I didn't even vote for the guy I brought
on many of the week before the election.

453
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:06,084
I had hilary Rosen,
who's a progressive operative basically 

454
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,110
to come on and talk about why not to 
vote for him,

455
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,890
but then I had people like you and 
others on and tried to talk to everybody

456
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,170
about it.
Um,

457
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,103
but I basically said that to say how 
much is the things that he's actually 

458
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,604
been able to do are basically mainstream
republican things that if any other 

459
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:24,774
republican would have done the things 
that he hasn't been able to do actually 

460
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,224
show the strength of our system.
Because if you don't like the his 

461
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:33,270
healthcare plan or the tax plan or 
whatever else,

462
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,163
congress is fighting him and that's the 
way the government's supposed to work 

463
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,420
and the other things,
the tweets and all the other stuff.

464
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:40,770
It's like,
well,

465
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,630
that's just not.
That's just nothing.

466
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:43,930
It's just stuff you know no

467
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,370
to take healthcare.
So.

468
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,810
So if you were going to make a criticism
about the president's performance,

469
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:49,644
healthcare would be at the top of the 
list of criticisms and this illustrates 

470
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:55,650
what I call the the two movies on one 
screen.

471
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,513
We're all looking at the same set of 
facts and we're producing completely 

472
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:02,040
different movies in our minds about 
what's happening.

473
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,660
So some people will say,
well,

474
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:06,150
he hasn't solved healthcare.
That's a failure,

475
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,170
but my observation is what was the 
deadline for that?

476
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,160
Is there a time you're supposed to be 
done and that that,

477
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,330
that past.
Because I don't see the deadline.

478
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,870
What I see as somebody who left the 
Republicans go first,

479
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,140
fail hard because they were going to.
They didn't have a plan.

480
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:22,974
That was gonna be popular,
scare the left while letting the right 

481
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,610
fail as hard as they can,
and then once he do,

482
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,211
he says,
well,

483
00:23:30,211 --> 00:23:35,211
maybe I'll talk to the Democrats until 
he gets both of them in this situation,

484
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,870
setting the table,
he calls it.

485
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,470
He actually has a word for this.
This is not accidental.

486
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,453
You know,
if your brand is negotiating and you do 

487
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:46,100
things that any objective person who 
understands

488
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,220
the negotiating recognizes as correct 
technique.

489
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,490
He's softening up both sides and it's 
going to take awhile.

490
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,430
It might take obamacare to fail a little
harder.

491
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,990
It might take the public to see their,
their costs going up in obamacare.

492
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:03,500
That's not a good thing,
but it might be the only way you can get

493
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:06,680
these two sides that are on such 
opposites somewhere in the middle.

494
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,270
Yeah,
so as he failed,

495
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:12,440
I would say it's a process and that's 
probably the only way it could go.

496
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,760
How much are you concerned at all that 
the people around him.

497
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,610
This is one of the things I hear about 
that the people around in bed for either

498
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:22,520
certain things aren't staffed right now.
I ain't here,

499
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,383
I don't have that much of a problem with
that because I think the government 

500
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:26,390
should be a lot smaller as a general 
rule,

501
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,860
but,
but putting that aside,

502
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,270
that people say that,
well,

503
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:32,750
the intellectual acumen around him isn't
that great.

504
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,580
Like you've got these players around 
him,

505
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:36,740
these people that understand a lot of 
things you're talking about,

506
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,310
but not sort of like a serious group of 
like intellects around him.

507
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,750
In what department does he really need 
help in the State Department because the

508
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,910
international stuff looks like it's 
going pretty well.

509
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,080
Does he need help in the economics?
Seems like it's going really well.

510
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,470
Does he need more help than general 
Maddis to be an isis?

511
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,943
Madison is doing great now.
If you get down to the Department of 

512
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,213
Agriculture and the EPA and stuff,
those are real arguments you can have 

513
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,780
about whether you've got the right 
horsepower there and I would,

514
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,860
I would listen to those arguments for 
sure.

515
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,143
But um,
in terms of how much is staffed and 

516
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:20,830
whether there's enough staff,
I'm still waiting for that to matter.

517
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,373
Well,
it sort of goes to that other point of 

518
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,020
just the other things.

519
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,853
There's some literal things that have 
happened and some maybes and could 

520
00:25:27,381 --> 00:25:28,214
issues.
Do you ever feel like you're stuck sort 

521
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,820
of acting as his counsel publicly or 
something?

522
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,963
I suddenly felt like I was like really 
grilling you on trump and it was in an 

523
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,540
odd way because we're obviously going to
talk about your book too,

524
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:39,650
but it's all intertwined.
You know,

525
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,523
it's funny in my mind it's always about 
persuasion and about a more effective 

526
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:47,220
way to see the world that does a better 
job.

527
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,620
But predicting,
you know,

528
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,230
I guess is now year and a half ago,
um,

529
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,330
I said that he would do more than change
politics and boy is he changed politics.

530
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,613
But I said he would rip a hole in our 
reality to let us look through and see 

531
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:01,904
something completely different.
And he's done that because didn't you 

532
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:08,140
used to think that facts mattered and 
didn't use?

533
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,000
You think that if somebody said as many 
things as he said,

534
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,160
that the fact checkers said,
oh no,

535
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,570
that doesn't,
that doesn't work.

536
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,900
That you couldn't possibly become 
president and if you did,

537
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,570
you couldn't possibly have a good 
economy.

538
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,490
You beat Isis and all the other things 
he's doing.

539
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,290
None of it was true.
And if you were a trained persuader,

540
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,183
you could see that early.
You could see that none of that would 

541
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:34,580
matter because you could see that his,
his persuasive skill was as strong.

542
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,640
Now I have to jump into just say one 
point.

543
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,493
Yeah.
Facts do matter to outcomes and all 

544
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,920
things being equal.
We would love to get the accurate.

545
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,490
But usually

546
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,350
when he's a nonfactual he's persuading 
in the direction that we would like.

547
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,560
So if he says the number of deaths by 
gun in Chicago or a thousand per day,

548
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,610
but it's really 10 per day,
we still need to fix that problem.

549
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,610
And he made us focus on it.
The fact that it wasn't accurate,

550
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,950
didn't matter.
It didn't.

551
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,600
Now,
uh,

552
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,370
and,
and I think he knows it and I think it's

553
00:27:08,371 --> 00:27:11,010
conscious and he calls it hyperbole.
He has a name for it.

554
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

555
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,010
Well that was gonna be my follow up 
question.

556
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:15,530
Do you think he's really conscious of 
all of this stuff?

557
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:16,364
I would feel.
I guess I would feel better if I really 

558
00:27:17,811 --> 00:27:21,230
thought he was conscious of all.
If I knew he was conscious of it,

559
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:24,080
I guess I would feel better.
He's kind yet at the same time.

560
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:27,350
That would mean he intentionally.
These are lies.

561
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:28,184
I mean if,
if he knows them and he's and he's 

562
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:30,644
intentionally doing it,
even if it's for all the reasons that 

563
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:35,680
you lay out here in the book that still 
advantage,

564
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,530
then it's an outright lie as opposed to 
just an exaggeration or hyperbole.

565
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,500
Well,
I would say that.

566
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,630
Do you have to consider intention?
Uh,

567
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,660
at this point I don't see any scenario 
in which the good of the country and how

568
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:54,031
he does personally are separated.
He has to do a good job for the country.

569
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,660
So if he's telling a lie that's good for
him and bad for the country,

570
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,020
that's just a fricken lie.
Nobody's in favor of that.

571
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,910
But if he says,
Hey,

572
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:04,744
you know,
we've got to fight extra hard to fix 

573
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:07,714
this problem that everybody wants fixed.
And there's a little bit of an 

574
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,800
exaggeration in that.
Well,

575
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:14,080
it's still the direction that we do want
to go.

576
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,580
It's,
it's so,

577
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,410
you know,
those situations,

578
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,603
you can call it a lie,
you can call it someone who didn't pass 

579
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:24,130
the fact checking.
He would call it hyperbole because he's,

580
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,160
he's,
uh,

581
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,120
it's a sort of an exaggerated truth,
if you will.

582
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,010
In other words,
directionally it's true.

583
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,360
Just the details are wrong.

584
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,740
So as a guy that wrote one of the most 
popular,

585
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,620
has written one of those popular comic 
strips of all time,

586
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,150
the whole purpose,
I mean,

587
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,133
I think of,
of comic strips and stand up and 

588
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,384
everything that you're getting to a 
kernel of truth at the end of that 

589
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:44,401
thing,
right?

590
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,990
Like every time you,
I assume,

591
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:46,824
is that,
is that fair to say that every time you 

592
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:50,010
ever rode a strip that there's a kernel 
of truth at the end,

593
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:51,030
right?
If you do it right,

594
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,330
if you do it right,
right.

595
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,270
So how can you also be the guy that's 
saying that it's okay to live in a facts

596
00:28:57,271 --> 00:29:02,271
still matter place like facts and truth?
There's a rope there,

597
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,240
right?

598
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,900
I love the US side question because this
is just a perfect way to make the point.

599
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,570
The comic strip is an exaggerated world.
It's,

600
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,780
it's just a crazy,
you know,

601
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:15,390
something that wouldn't actually happen 
in the real world.

602
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,900
But what people say about it is that has
just like my job.

603
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,333
So they're looking at something that's 
this crazy world and they're still 

604
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,710
seeing the truth.
And so if you're a good cartoonist,

605
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,603
you,
you've made both of those things happen 

606
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,090
that shouldn't be together,
you know?

607
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,333
Um,
and so that's a perfect example that I 

608
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:36,960
get to see every day where people say,
that's just like my office.

609
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,280
And I say,
no,

610
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,680
there were no aliens in your office.
Somebody had exploded.

611
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,130
That didn't

612
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,890
happen in your office.
So stuff in the comics,

613
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,690
people regard as feeling real when they 
clearly are not.

614
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,090
That's interesting.
Are you familiar with the term K Fab?

615
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,230
The,
uh,

616
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,460
it's the term that wrestlers use that,
you know,

617
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,330
that's the fakery that everyone knows.
It's fake.

618
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:00,310
We all know it's fake were.
And yet,

619
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:01,144
you're,
you're eliciting real emotions from 

620
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:07,060
people that go there and pay you to do 
something fake and have a real emotion.

621
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,240
And I think there is some connection 
with that and what you're talking about.

622
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,840
And that trump was kind of,
you know,

623
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,270
he was a fan of wrestling.
He's,

624
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,104
there's those clips of him,
I think at Wrestlemania and taken out 

625
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,720
Vince Mcmahon and the rest of it.
So he is playing that game.

626
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:24,370
He has merged theater and politics like 
nobody's ever done.

627
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,550
And he just happens to be good at the 
theater stuff.

628
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,310
And so he effectively merge them.
Um,

629
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:31,144
I don't think we'll ever see this again.
This is a very special situation and 

630
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,640
the,
as I've probably said this before,

631
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,370
but um,
he has a talent stack of,

632
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,250
of individual talents that he's a,
b plus a minus that.

633
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,530
But there's so many of them and they 
work so well together.

634
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,740
All of his persuasion stuff is.
His theater stuff is public speaking is,

635
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,550
you know,
his intelligence,

636
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,110
they're all,
they're all high,

637
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,760
but you'd say to yourself,
wow,

638
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:58,594
we've had smarter presidents.
We've had better orators orators or 

639
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,790
eight people who speak better than I do 
either one way or another.

640
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,050
We definitely have those.
Yeah,

641
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,993
but very few people have had that 
combination with business experience 

642
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,640
with,
with his ability to take criticism.

643
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,100
Even though people say he's thin 
skinned,

644
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,210
you don't get into this game unless you 
know you can handle the criticism.

645
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Do you think trump derangement syndrome 
is a real mental disorder?

646
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:26,194
I'm starting to actually.
I mean I'm being slightly facetious 

647
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:30,580
here,
but I'm actually starting to Israel that

648
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,000
it's a real psychological condition.
Yeah.

649
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,023
Because I get into these conversations 
all the time with fans and friends and 

650
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,510
family and whatever it is,
and I just try.

651
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,300
I try my hardest to take the most 
rational,

652
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,940
decent emotion and what actually has 
happened,

653
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,923
how you may not like Gorsuch,
but that was just a mainstream can you 

654
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:54,100
know that any mainstream republican 
would have put this guy in.

655
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:56,560
Now you may be a Democrat and that's 
upsetting to you,

656
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:58,510
but it's not.
It's not Hitler.

657
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,213
Hitler.
And so I've really tried to like take 

658
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,010
some of the fangs out of these 
arguments,

659
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,330
but I do find the level that people are 
obsessed with this stuff.

660
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,130
No.
In all seriousness,

661
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:13,540
this is a legitimate,
fairly major mental health issue.

662
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:14,374
And you hear psychologists are actually 
dealing with people who are coming in 

663
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,150
and crying and thinking that the world 
has exploded and there's a.

664
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,600
there's actually a good reason for it.
So if you look at the result,

665
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,390
it was a surprise to half of the 
country.

666
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,523
So the people who were trump supporters,
even if they weren't sure he was going 

667
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:33,524
to win,
what they got was a world that made 

668
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:38,290
sense to them.
They thought all along he should win.

669
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,010
And then when he did,
even though

670
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,100
it was surprising in the polls,
their world was intact.

671
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,000
Everything that they thought about the 
world seemed to be about right.

672
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,100
They just thought other people were 
wrong.

673
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,250
But if you are on the side that knew he 
couldn't win,

674
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,390
there's no way you were living in the 
country that this monster could possibly

675
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,820
become our leader.
And then you woke up and he was you.

676
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,693
That's a classic setup for cognitive 
dissonance is where you have to rewrite 

677
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:05,954
the script in your head to make sense of
this new information and here's what 

678
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,034
people don't do because we're all human,
so let me make this not a comment about 

679
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:17,300
just half of the country.
So universal comment.

680
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,200
We rarely rewrite the script in their 
head to say,

681
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,303
you know,
the best way to explain this is that I 

682
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:27,530
was a fucking idiot.
Nobody does that,

683
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,180
and there's nothing wrong with that.

684
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,770
That's normal.
We don't do it.

685
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,000
You don't do it.
Nobody does that.

686
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,560
So they have to come up with a new 
script that explains their situation and

687
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:38,390
so I think they've come up with,
my God,

688
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,910
there are more racist in the country 
than we knew.

689
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:44,750
They voted this guy in a and he must 
have,

690
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:48,200
he must have had help from Russia 
because there's no way this happens in a

691
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,034
natural way because my world wouldn't 
make sense if he could get elected just 

692
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,280
by having policies people like couldn't 
happen.

693
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,370
So in that situation,
these people are.

694
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,683
I hate to use triggered,
but it's a specific use of cognitive 

695
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:03,974
dissonance there.
World doesn't make sense and they're 

696
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:10,460
trying to make sense of it and it is an 
emotionally painful experience,

697
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:12,120
which I have genuine sympathy for.

698
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,800
Yeah.
So as a guy that deals in persuasion for

699
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,390
people that are watching this,
that are dealing with.

700
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,040
Because I get emails everyday from 
people,

701
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,480
I can't,
my brother won't talk to me,

702
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,323
my cousin or my wife won't talk to me.
I've gotten emails from people that are 

703
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:25,374
doing divorces over politics.
What techniques would you tell someone 

704
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:34,710
to do if their spouse was suffering from
this condition?

705
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,290
Well,
let,

706
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,290
let me,
let me tell you.

707
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,340
I was scrolling.
This is,

708
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,233
um,
I had postulated over the summer before 

709
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,023
the election that when a Clinton's 
persuasion game went from very weak to 

710
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,784
nonexistent,
to suddenly just weapons grade when she 

711
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:52,130
started calling everything that trump 
did dark.

712
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,503
That's the work of a real expert.
And I have some speculation about who 

713
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:00,140
that was.
But for our purposes today,

714
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:00,974
just say it was super good persuasion 
that was not like anything she'd done 

715
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:06,320
before.
And that captured the thought that he's,

716
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,850
he's a monster.
He's are racist as enough of every.

717
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,060
Everything you wanted to put it in that,
that one were captured,

718
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,583
had Clinton won,
the bomb would have been diffused 

719
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,220
because her side would have said,
oh yeah,

720
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:21,290
we got what we wanted.
We avoided the monster.

721
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,810
The trump people would've said,
oh darn,

722
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:27,470
we lost.
It wouldn't have thrown them for so much

723
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:28,304
of the loop,
but it wouldn't have thrown the loop 

724
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,150
where they sort of would have been used 
to losing.

725
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,163
So it would've,
it would've been inconsistent with the 

726
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:35,900
polls.
They wouldn't like it,

727
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,920
but they wouldn't be thrown into 
cognitive dissonance,

728
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:38,910
hesitant,
right.

729
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,470
It would have seemed like a normal 
world.

730
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,180
Um,
but this,

731
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,510
this thought that there was this,
this monster under the bed.

732
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,470
People lived with that as a real thing 
for months.

733
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,040
And then when it didn't go away,
they have to continue living with it.

734
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,690
So that,
that was a setup.

735
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,690
So to answer your question,
how do you get out of it?

736
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,613
Like how do you cure it?
I had predicted a way back before 

737
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:07,671
inauguration day that we would see the 
following cycle or story arc,

738
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:08,724
if you will,
that on inauguration day it would be 

739
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,461
Hitler,
Hitler,

740
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,294
Hitler marches in the street,
and we saw that and I said that after 

741
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,080
several months of him not doing Hitler 
things,

742
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,700
people would say,
all right,

743
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,260
well it's not as bad as we thought.

744
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,093
He's not a healer,
but he's incompetent and in and there's 

745
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,540
chaos and he's just not going to do 
things right.

746
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:30,510
And maybe that's just as dangerous.
So that was the summer.

747
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Remember I,
this was all forecast by me way ahead of

748
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,600
time because you could see that this 
would have to happen.

749
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:37,434
Right?
And then I've predicted that by the end 

750
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,290
of the year and we're getting close.
People would start to say,

751
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,750
well,
he did get a lot of things done,

752
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,650
so maybe he's effective,
but we don't like what he's done.

753
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,800
Maybe it's not the justices they wanted 
and the policies they wanted,

754
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:54,930
but that,
that part's just politics,

755
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,970
right?
We can all deal with that part,

756
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,953
but well will.
The only way you're going to get rid of 

757
00:36:59,101 --> 00:36:59,934
the,
the illusion that he's a monster is by 

758
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:02,724
him doing non monster stuff long enough 
that you just can't hold the illusion 

759
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:06,864
anymore.

760
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,850
And I think that the,
what's coming,

761
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,630
and this is the fun part and this is 
really the basis for the prediction,

762
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,780
is that every year at the end of the 
year of the news organizations,

763
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:16,614
they sort of run out of real news and 
they do the year end roundups and 

764
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,690
they're going to have to say what did he
do?

765
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,960
And that list is going to be really 
long.

766
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,920
And it's gonna be all this stuff you 
cared about minus self care.

767
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,320
I think.
I'm not even sure taxes will happen.

768
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,403
Both the economy so strong.
I'm not even sure it's important 

769
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,490
anymore.
Right.

770
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,160
Will probably get four percent with or 
without a tax change.

771
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,260
Maybe they'll be something with business
taxes.

772
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,260
Um,
but uh,

773
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,094
at this point,
I think the list of things that he's 

774
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:49,110
done that Republicans wanted is going to
be so long.

775
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:53,040
It would just be hard for people to hold
their heads that he wasn't effective.

776
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,150
And by next year,
if we get something with healthcare,

777
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,733
maybe something with taxes,
it's going to look like a hard to hold 

778
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,660
the the illusion anymore.

779
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,830
Do you think the media fits in all of 
this now?

780
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:07,664
Because I think that you can very easily
chalk up there and attitude and obvious 

781
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,930
cheering at first for Bernie,
but then ultimately for Hillary,

782
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,410
you can chalk that up to why so many of 
the trump people,

783
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:19,244
and I include myself in this,
that I'm thrilled the way the media is 

784
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:23,480
crumbling.
I think it's phenomenal.

785
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,490
I just this this past week there was 
this idiotic thing with trump in Japan.

786
00:38:28,491 --> 00:38:29,324
You saw this with the prime minister of 
Japan and CNN tweets the video out and 

787
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,201
said,
you know,

788
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:36,250
implying that he's being disrespectful 
by the fish

789
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,230
food in the,
in the Koi pond or whatever.

790
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,680
What they don't show you is literally 
the second before that.

791
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,330
That's exactly what the Japanese Prime 
Minister David,

792
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,770
right?
How do they keep doing this?

793
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,723
I mean,
I cannot chalk this up to complete 

794
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,980
idiocy and ineptitude anymore.
How do they keep.

795
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,130
How have they not fired?
I mean CNN every day.

796
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,030
Should be just firing people,
throw.

797
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,600
They should be throwing them off the 
roof of the Time Warner Center.

798
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,823
Well,
unfortunately the economics of the news 

799
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:06,454
business has changed.
It used to be you could have the three 

800
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:11,590
big networks and they can just deal with
the facts as they knew him,

801
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,903
but now I don't think you could make 
money that way because people are 

802
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:19,090
looking to feel to,
to digest the news that they like.

803
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:19,924
It makes them feel good,
so you're always going to have a media 

804
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:23,834
on the right media on the left and I 
don't think that middle may never be 

805
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:31,150
filled because there's no way to make 
money in the middle because if you go in

806
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,070
the middle,
both sides will say,

807
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,020
well half the time you're just making 
stuff up.

808
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,470
Because interestingly I think the 
middle,

809
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,513
whatever that middle is,
I think it does sort of exist in this 

810
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,620
space.
The space that you're.

811
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,700
Even though you're not a creator on 
Youtube or whatever,

812
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,760
it kind of exists in this land of of 
Rogan and de Franco and me and whoever.

813
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,670
Whatever that influence is.
I think it sort of exists at the risk of

814
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,563
complimenting you own show.
You might be the closest thing and the 

815
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:02,680
only thing I can think of that's in the 
middle right now,

816
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,603
like easily identifiable as,
as a legitimate attempt to be in the 

817
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:07,931
middle,
you know,

818
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:09,490
other people have their spin on things.
Right.

819
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,530
But I don't even see others trial one 
compliment per year on the show of me.

820
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,393
So that was it.
That's it.

821
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,460
I was waiting for someone to do it.
We're already in November.

822
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,973
Yeah.
So,

823
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,130
um,
yeah.

824
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,043
And look,
you had to go outside the TV model to 

825
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:26,140
even make this work,
but okay.

826
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,210
So you are thrilled with the way the 
media is being destroyed,

827
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:28,661
right?
I mean,

828
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,580
is there any piece of you that misses 
that?

829
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,930
We get our news from three places and 
can make some factual sense together and

830
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,270
any of that.
I know,

831
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,243
you know,
I don't find any joy in that because 

832
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,120
it's just something that's broken.
I can't get happy about that.

833
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,100
So I'm not happy about anybody's 
destruction,

834
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,353
but I understand your point that it 
feels like it feels like if people are 

835
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,240
not doing their job,
you want bad things to happen to him,

836
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,300
but I can't quite get in that mindset.
I don't mean specific.

837
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,430
I don't want him to be hurt or anything 
like that of course.

838
00:40:57,431 --> 00:41:00,760
But just the general,
the state of this nonsense.

839
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:03,880
That's why when people say to me about 
what trump lies about this all the time,

840
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,920
well Hillary lied about this all the 
time.

841
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,570
Obama lied,
but if you like your doctor,

842
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:08,780
you can keep them.
And the,

843
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,720
the Syrian red line,
it's just like,

844
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,290
well all of them lie in.
They used to,

845
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,450
they just all aligned the same way.
They lied in a politician's way.

846
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:17,284
He lies in a new way.
I don't particularly like either one of 

847
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:22,420
them but.
But there's a little bit of real politic

848
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:25,510
here and I think that's where you sort 
of operate and just sort of there's,

849
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,433
there's reality and then there's 
politics and they have a little bit 

850
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:29,674
overlay.
Sometimes it's the only way I could 

851
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:33,980
stake out a position that wasn't one of 
the crazy on the right are

852
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,100
crazy on the left is by the persuasion 
filter.

853
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,040
It was sort of a step back from politics
per se,

854
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:44,800
and that gave me a little bit of ability
to be as objective as I can.

855
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,150
Nobody is completely objective.
Um,

856
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,060
but I,
I just don't think that middle will be

857
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,050
where you make all the money.
The.

858
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,380
I mean you're,
you're,

859
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,080
you're kind of alone here.
Yeah.

860
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,680
Well,
I'm not making dilbert money.

861
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,580
I shouldn't be working on a comic strip.
That would be your major advice.

862
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:01,414
Right.
I tell everybody who started comics 

863
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,640
started kind of extreme.
That's quit your job,

864
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,100
quit your job right now.
Yeah.

865
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,023
Do you think it's kind of funny that you
end up talking about politics so 

866
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:11,710
directly because obviously before we 
mentioned it,

867
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:14,560
I mean you were always sort of giving 
people a grain of truth more about their

868
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:17,830
life and sort of the working world and 
all of that,

869
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:19,930
but it was more social commentary,
but,

870
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,880
but this is a lot of politics now.

871
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,783
You know,
his way closer than you think because 

872
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:27,560
since,
since the things I talk about are the,

873
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,730
I would say the illusions that we have,
you know,

874
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,990
in the comic I would write about the 
illusion that there's,

875
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,830
this three hour meeting was better than 
the two hour meeting.

876
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,110
That's just,
that was just an illusion.

877
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,213
Yet people buy into it.
It's a widespread practice and I just 

878
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:45,494
took that,
uh,

879
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,240
you know,
that same mindset,

880
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:49,640
which is you understand that this isn't 
real,

881
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:52,370
these things you're doing in the office,
these things don't help.

882
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,503
These don't make sense.
This new business policy just sounds 

883
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:57,920
good on paper,
completely doesn't work.

884
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,160
It's really just the same analysis.
I just took it to a different field.

885
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,031
Yeah.
I'm curious,

886
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,280
has there been some kind of cost,
uh,

887
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,610
professionally or personally for you on 
the.

888
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,310
Oh yeah,
I forgot to quote you.

889
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:13,160
I pretty sure you said that you do have 
fuck you money.

890
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,990
I think that's what you said to me last 
time.

891
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:17,840
So you may not care,
but I'm curious what the cost has been.

892
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,953
Um,
so I think I've lost 75 percent of my 

893
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:22,190
friends.
Um,

894
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,300
I mean,
do you mean that literally,

895
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,850
I mean that literally,
I mean,

896
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,083
I don't know if you were just staking 
out a trump position and then you going 

897
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,570
to scale it back the 20 percent.
I mean,

898
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,500
I haven't actually done the calculation 
but,

899
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,970
but it feels like that,
but really,

900
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,370
yeah,
I would say that's true.

901
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,930
I look at my facebook feed and it's 
just,

902
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,313
I just,
I literally thought facebook wasn't 

903
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,240
working for awhile and that's not even,
it's not working.

904
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,530
I thought,
oh,

905
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:44,570
it must be some kind of major problem 
with facebook.

906
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:45,404
I'm not,
I'm not seeing anything from all of my 

907
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,510
friends here.
Um,

908
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,280
and then financially a big part of an 
author's income is speaking.

909
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,780
Yeah.
And uh,

910
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,590
I can say this now that now that I have 
no speaking engagements lined up,

911
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,800
uh,
anytime in the future and if not for the

912
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,633
past year,
but I was making anywhere from 50 to 

913
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:04,394
$100,000
just to talk for an hour that went to 

914
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:08,174
zero,
meaning I have nothing booked in the 

915
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,290
past year and nothing booked for the 
future year.

916
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,410
And that's never happened anytime in my 
professional career after the first five

917
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:21,230
years when Dilbert became well known.
Yeah.

918
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:24,620
I find that particularly bizarre because
a,

919
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,454
you're not a hateful person or any of 
the things that people might say about 

920
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:32,460
you or be the things that you're talking
about generally have come true.

921
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,293
So the worth of having you speak there,
they're still worth and having you 

922
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:36,690
speak.
But I get it.

923
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:37,261
It's like,
well,

924
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:38,670
we're not going to pay a trump 
supporter.

925
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,420
So yeah,
that's,

926
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,253
that's all it is.
And really even the people who were 

927
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:43,710
making the decisions,
you know,

928
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,500
they understand the nuance and you know,
if you tell them,

929
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,360
well that's not,
it's not about the policies,

930
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,493
they get that,
but their job is to make sure that 

931
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,700
there's a big room full of people who 
don't feel bad.

932
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,633
Yeah.
So they're not going to take a chance 

933
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,260
that the people in the room will have a 
different interpretation.

934
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,101
Right.
That's interesting.

935
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:03,270
Was it mostly like corporate type gigs?
I thing it was almost entirely corporate

936
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:04,590
and big organizations.
Yeah.

937
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,513
So that,
that also shows you another symptom of 

938
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,540
what's happening in the world right now,
right.

939
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,860
That someone who basically is just a 
moderate,

940
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:15,480
decent guy who's saying some things and 
maybe his is a supporter of a guy that's

941
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,300
not popular in the popular sense of the 
word,

942
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,213
you know,
a corporation just doesn't want to put 

943
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:21,210
there.

944
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,130
But online.
Yeah.

945
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,340
And,
but let me,

946
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
let me state that,
uh,

947
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,730
as you said,
I'm not going to be poor like that.

948
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,550
That isn't going to happen.
Um,

949
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,880
and I knew what I was getting into.
So,

950
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,080
you know,
you and I were,

951
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,450
we're professionals.
And so people watching might say,

952
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:38,130
oh,
that poor guy,

953
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:40,830
he walked into the buzzsaw.
We see the buzzsaw,

954
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,230
we choose to walk into it because 
there's a,

955
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,470
there's a bigger something there.
And this case,

956
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:47,723
this was this weird special case where 
people's entire worldview was going to 

957
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:53,184
change.
I knew that when I saw trump enter 

958
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:57,420
because he had that kind of effect.
And I,

959
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,263
I thought it would be helpful to be sort
of a guide to help people understand 

960
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:04,800
what they were seeing so that they could
reinterpret the reality and to,

961
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,810
to something that was more functional 
and less trump derangement syndrome.

962
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,301
Yeah.
Well,

963
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,140
as I said before,
I mean,

964
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:10,974
that's why you're good at what you do 
because I listened and that's why I 

965
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:16,890
wasn't crazy.
And that's why I think my audience,

966
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,130
I have no idea which,
if I was appalling,

967
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,110
my entire audience,
which way they voted or whatever it is.

968
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,810
But I think that for most of them they 
were,

969
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,360
they didn't go off the deep end.
You know what I mean?

970
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,630
Like they actually didn't go crazy and 
they've sort of.

971
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,580
I try to keep my people dealing in 
reality,

972
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,890
which somehow is very special these 
days.

973
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:38,490
I didn't realize it was special but.
But apparently it is.

974
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,790
Yeah.
Um,

975
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:45,490
I don't know how long it will take for 
the people who are screaming at this guy

976
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,790
to,
to effect some change.

977
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,580
But I think,
I think the keys could be,

978
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,400
and I'm not predicting that these will 
happen,

979
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,263
but these would be the keys if president
trump did something useful in North 

980
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,450
Korea that really looked to people like,
oh my God,

981
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,293
I wasn't seeing.
I didn't see that common and something 

982
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:07,980
good happened with healthcare.
Which by the way,

983
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:11,280
I think both of them are entirely 
possible.

984
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,280
You know,
I'm not,

985
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,133
I'm not sure what the odds are,
but they seem very possible to me it 

986
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:17,274
would be hard a year from now,
two to feel the same way about his 

987
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:23,280
presidency.
Assuming he doesn't do any,

988
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,980
anything that's extra bad between now 
and then.

989
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,130
Is that also just the nature of basic 
human psychology that you can only

990
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,760
scream for so much time?
Like they've.

991
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,600
They've really dragged this screaming 
out.

992
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,760
Right?
But you can't do that forever.

993
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:37,594
Your brain.

994
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,623
Well,
my mother had a saying and I don't know 

995
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:41,010
where it came from.
She.

996
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,260
She said you can get used to anything if
you do it long enough,

997
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,570
including hanging hang long enough,
you just get used to it.

998
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,100
And I've predicted for a long time that 
as,

999
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,293
as provocative as president trump is,
as long as he stays provocative in the 

1000
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,870
same way,
you will get used to it.

1001
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,033
And I think you're starting to see that.
But there's certainly a big segment of 

1002
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:06,590
the population that is now close to 
getting used to it.

1003
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:08,900
Yet,
what do you make of the Russia thing?

1004
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,010
You know,
I hate to say on camera.

1005
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:13,933
Well,
there's nothing there and there's 

1006
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,720
nothing.
There never will be anything there.

1007
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,110
But at the moment,
at this conversation,

1008
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,870
there's nothing that looks like it's a 
crime that,

1009
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,960
that influenced,
that's involving the president directly.

1010
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,900
Um,
I'd be surprised if there is,

1011
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:30,970
but,
you know,

1012
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,480
certainly if there is,
it would be some kind of technical thing

1013
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:37,370
that he,
that the average person says,

1014
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,110
well,
I didn't even know that was a grime.

1015
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,360
So that's what happens when you get the 
special.

1016
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,810
The special prosecutor in there is 
there.

1017
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:48,320
They're looking for crimes now and at a 
certain level of,

1018
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,203
um,
you know,

1019
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,210
money,
power,

1020
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,973
influence,
people are doing stuff that's going to 

1021
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:56,810
violate some law,
uh,

1022
00:48:56,811 --> 00:48:58,850
or,
or an ethical violation.

1023
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,370
So if you look,
you're going to find stuff,

1024
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,660
um,
my guess is there's more smoke than,

1025
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,080
than fire and that the smoke has been 
sort of generated by the coverage of it.

1026
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,651
Yeah.
Well,

1027
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:11,930
every time they keep pushing more smoke 
out there,

1028
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:15,680
the smoke actually starts looking like 
it also has a lot to do with Hillary and

1029
00:49:15,681 --> 00:49:17,300
the DNC.
So it's like,

1030
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,283
you all better be very careful what you 
ask for here because this could take 

1031
00:49:20,361 --> 00:49:21,180
down all of you.

1032
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,390
Well,
and then the question I ask is Russia is

1033
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,360
sort of a weird relationship with the 
United States,

1034
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,280
you know,
there's sort of Frenemies,

1035
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:30,114
you know,
we want them on our side but they seem 

1036
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:35,010
to be doing stuff to,
to bother us.

1037
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,830
Um,
but we have fairly deep connections and,

1038
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,773
and have had for a long time.
So there are lots of people having lots 

1039
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:47,310
of conversations at powerful levels 
probably all the time.

1040
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,583
Um,
but when you look at them and you look 

1041
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:51,510
at them through a certain filter,
you say,

1042
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,363
well now it looks wrong.
Whereas maybe in a different time we 

1043
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:55,770
would just say,
well,

1044
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:56,604
yeah,
why wouldn't we be talking to someone 

1045
00:49:58,201 --> 00:50:01,020
who has so many interests that overlap 
with ours?

1046
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:02,180
Yeah.
That does show,

1047
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:02,310
that show the

1048
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,970
way things flipped very easily.
Now it seems like the Democrats.

1049
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:06,421
I mean,
look,

1050
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,970
if you took this thing to it's,
let's pretend there was,

1051
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,670
you know,
some legit reason for them to be talking

1052
00:50:11,671 --> 00:50:12,180
about Russia.
Well,

1053
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,013
what are we really saying then?
Are we going to depose the president of 

1054
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,673
the United States?
And you can't then put pence in because 

1055
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,520
he probably knew about it.
So you can't have his guy in there.

1056
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,070
And then what are you really saying?
Should we go down the line of succession

1057
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,170
should um,
you know,

1058
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,940
uh,
Paul Ryan then be installed.

1059
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:27,980
And

1060
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,710
really what are you saying that,
because then if they actually hacked our

1061
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:32,720
election and put the president in 
office,

1062
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,830
that's obviously an active war.
So are you saying we should do Gresha?

1063
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,240
I mean,
that's why it seems to me we've got,

1064
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,103
you know,
Obama running around the whole country 

1065
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:42,380
do and his $500,
thousand dollars speeches,

1066
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:43,214
which I don't begrudge him,
but with that shit eating grin and 

1067
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:45,914
everybody else is out there doing their 
thing where if they knew that the 

1068
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,543
president was a Russian spy or colluded,
it's like they'd be out in the streets 

1069
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:54,074
screaming about it,
but one of the things that really 

1070
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,054
strikes me is that there are things that
are alleged as a trader is illegal 

1071
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,070
activities that if you had asked me is 
this traitorous or illegal,

1072
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:09,350
I would have said it doesn't sound like 
it to me.

1073
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,130
For example,
if the Russians had some dirt on Hillary

1074
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,383
and if they offered it to the campaign,
if you had asked me without any of this 

1075
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:20,480
news coverage in which we've all learned
more about how this works,

1076
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,870
is it illegal to gather information from
someone who has information?

1077
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,060
I would say,
how is it illegal to talk to people?

1078
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,600
Why wouldn't it be illegal to know more 
if it's true,

1079
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,660
why would it be illegal to have true 
information?

1080
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,063
Now,
that's an interesting distinction 

1081
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:38,990
though.
Let's pause there for a second.

1082
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:39,824
So if the Russian government,
let's say had been falsifying 

1083
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:43,154
information and passed it on to the 
trump campaign and then the trump 

1084
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:46,574
campaign used it,
you would see that you would view that 

1085
00:51:48,711 --> 00:51:49,544
differently.
So the information itself has to be 

1086
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:52,880
true?
Well,

1087
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,953
yes.
I think people would view that 

1088
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,360
differently because that would look more
like a.

1089
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,823
well,
either way it looks like Russia is 

1090
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,624
trying to influence things,
but just because they're trying to 

1091
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:05,390
influence things,
does that mean that the person who would

1092
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:09,530
benefit from the information is is 
forbidden from having it now?

1093
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:12,740
This is where you have to be a lawyer to
know whether or not that's illegal.

1094
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,210
I look at it and go,
okay,

1095
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:18,010
I can get the argument that it might be 
unethical,

1096
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,390
like and get the argument that we 
shouldn't do it.

1097
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:23,750
I can get the argument that Russia 
shouldn't be meddling and we need to.

1098
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,613
We need to respond in some way,
but how is it illegal for a person to 

1099
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:28,814
hear information and way in what world 
does the source of the information 

1100
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:35,330
matter?
If it's actual inflammation,

1101
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,360
well that's why it's funny you saw when,
when,

1102
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,300
what was it about a month and a half ago
when trump jr,

1103
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:45,650
the whole week was that trump jr met 
with the person who may have gotten some

1104
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:46,484
information from the Russians or 
whatever it was and everyone was 

1105
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:49,760
screaming about,
you know,

1106
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,220
you get opposition research but not from
other countries,

1107
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:52,820
blah,
blah blah.

1108
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,653
And then just in the last couple of 
weeks it came out that for sure the DNC 

1109
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:57,554
was at least working at some level with 
either this Ukrainian guy or the 

1110
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:03,490
Russians to make the dossier.
I mean,

1111
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,343
just,
it's like we don't even have to go into 

1112
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,370
all of it because it's just like you're 
all dirty,

1113
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,430
your own narrative and,
and it's,

1114
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,283
it's such a confusing area that the 
public doesn't have any idea what's 

1115
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:17,420
going on.
Now with Russia,

1116
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,690
we know there's something about Russia,
something about lawyers,

1117
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,203
you know.
And if you were to ask the average 

1118
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:24,450
person,
um,

1119
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,020
you've probably seen these straight

1120
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,990
interviews where somebody goes out and 
says,

1121
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,280
name the vice president of the United 
States and they're like a mickey mouse.

1122
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:33,210
You know,
they have no idea.

1123
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,270
Right?
Imagine going out in the street and just

1124
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,373
grabbing a person and say,
can you sort out the Russia thing for 

1125
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:40,130
me?
Can,

1126
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:40,963
can you tell me who did what?
They're going to tell you that there 

1127
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,550
something about a Russian lawyer of 
uranium on a hotel bad.

1128
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,013
It's going to be this,
this mess of stuff that they've 

1129
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:53,910
conflated in their minds.
The public has no idea what's going on.

1130
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,853
Yeah.
How do you figure out what news you 

1131
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:01,350
believe and what you think is true and 
what you can actually trust?

1132
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,513
Oh,
I think every situation you got to look 

1133
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:06,270
at it differently.
Uh,

1134
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:08,220
so the first,
the first sort,

1135
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,600
if I see it on either Fox or I see it on
CNN,

1136
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,913
the first thing I do is go to the other 
one because you have two tvs next to 

1137
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:18,490
each other.

1138
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,323
Well,
I got a clicker and I wait because it's 

1139
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,060
not going to be at the same time 
necessarily,

1140
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:28,020
but I wait because my experience is that
on a factual basis,

1141
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,210
they all pretty much get the facts 
right.

1142
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,370
It's,
it's the interpretation.

1143
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:33,204
It's the priority.
It's how much attention they put it 

1144
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:38,160
switched pundits come on and say,
what about it?

1145
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:39,530
That,
that is where all the,

1146
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:41,100
uh,
the bias happens.

1147
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,890
So the first thing is that they both say
it and if they do,

1148
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:47,430
I start feeling comfortable that maybe 
there's some truth to it.

1149
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,543
Uh,
but then all the spin comes and almost 

1150
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,560
all of that is,
you know,

1151
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,300
nonfactual spin.
So I,

1152
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:57,870
I of discount all of that from both 
sides.

1153
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,793
Yeah.
Do you think anyone's doing the 

1154
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,350
persuasion game correctly on the other 
side?

1155
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,380
So whoever might be your intellectual 
opponent buys into all of the things,

1156
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,390
say of the modern Democratic Party.

1157
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,450
Is there anyone that's kind of doing it 
right?

1158
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,533
Um,
even if you disagree with all of the 

1159
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,680
conclusions are what they're trying to 
build.

1160
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,170
And let me say something that I know 
makes a,

1161
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,870
you can make at least half of your 
listeners just flip out.

1162
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,663
George Clooney has game right now.
I don't think he can run because the 

1163
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:36,711
whole Hollywood Weinstein connection.
But in a recent interview I saw,

1164
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,760
I saw so much technique that,
um,

1165
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,920
I didn't know he had that much 
technique.

1166
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,880
And he basically was setting himself up 
that if people begged,

1167
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,110
he would,
he would run a.

1168
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,440
now,
I don't know if you agree,

1169
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,690
because once they did some polling,
they might find out he has some issues,

1170
00:55:55,080 --> 00:56:00,080
but he has the charisma and he has the 
persuasion game that if he could bring a

1171
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,480
little bit of substance,
he would actually be quite formidable.

1172
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,613
I don't think he can be trump,
but he could probably really take a run 

1173
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:10,260
at someone else,
you know,

1174
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,520
a regular Republican.

1175
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,960
Uh,
likewise.

1176
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:13,794
Mark Cuban,
he's definitely making some noise in 

1177
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:17,700
this space.
Right?

1178
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,533
Right.
Now he did an interesting thing by 

1179
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:24,760
saying that he could potentially be 
either a republican or a Democrat,

1180
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,490
which was kind of clever because it 
allows both,

1181
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,120
both groups to see him until he commits 
as well.

1182
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,260
Maybe one of mine,
you know.

1183
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:33,723
Um,
but I think somebody said that he said 

1184
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,114
he would maybe run as Republican,
but the Republicans have a long memory 

1185
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,473
and there's no way.
There's no way he gets elected as a 

1186
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:47,740
Republican.
But could he be elected as a Democrat if

1187
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,980
you brought in some ideas that involve 
technology,

1188
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:51,814
for example,
that would maybe get us to better 

1189
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,033
healthcare or a way to get to free 
college because that's the part that 

1190
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,180
Bernie was missing.
He had everything right,

1191
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,840
except the connecting tissues.
Like how do you get there that you could

1192
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:05,674
afford it.
Technology could probably get there or 

1193
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:09,520
at least you could make a story that it 
could get there.

1194
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:10,990
And I think it would be believable 
because we.

1195
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,320
Because I think because I think we can.
I think Hubert could,

1196
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,780
could make that story.
I think he's got the charisma.

1197
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,680
He's got the brains.
You might be able to pull it off,

1198
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,580
but I don't know if he'll run as 
Democrats.

1199
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,150
So,

1200
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:23,983
so not that I have any love of sort of 
career politicians or people that have 

1201
00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:28,400
just been around positive about.
But it's interesting.

1202
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:30,230
You just went basically to all 
celebrities.

1203
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,900
Even Cuban in effect really is a 
celebrity at this point.

1204
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:33,980
Well,
I wouldn't charisma

1205
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,240
if there had been any standard 
politician with charisma,

1206
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,370
I would probably gravitate to them.
Van Van Jones is very good,

1207
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,780
he would be high on my list of 
charismatic democratic,

1208
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,133
um,
he agreed to do the show and then CNN 

1209
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:51,850
wouldn't let them do it.
So really,

1210
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,320
so I don't know why,
I don't know where that puts my feelings

1211
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:57,500
about him or at least he said he would 
do it on twitter and then they said no.

1212
00:57:57,501 --> 00:58:01,730
So maybe he was just playing me for,
to sort of the public credit of.

1213
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:02,564
Yeah,
I'll do it and then leave it to my guys 

1214
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:06,020
who will just say no,
I don't know the details,

1215
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:10,260
but I find him credible,
credible story with the safe.

1216
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,030
Um,
my guess is that he told you the truth.

1217
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,980
Yeah.
Um,

1218
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,353
so if we can't have sort of regular 
politicians anymore because that's real 

1219
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,223
easy,
whether they're celebrities or just 

1220
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,340
because you're saying these people don't
exist in the world.

1221
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:28,820
It seems that the longterm health of the
system,

1222
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,773
it doesn't strike me as that great.
In that case that we're just going to 

1223
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:36,410
keep you living in a world where facts 
don't matter.

1224
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:40,850
We're going to keep sort of putting 
persuasion sort of ahead of.

1225
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,040
We've always been that way

1226
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,440
world.
It's not a new world,

1227
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:44,303
it's just that we,
we have a character in the president 

1228
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,310
right now who takes it to a level where 
you can't miss it.

1229
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,770
I think before you had the luxury of 
saying,

1230
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,600
well,
my site is telling the truth,

1231
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,870
but we don't even have that luxury 
anymore.

1232
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:58,704
Like even if you're a pro trump,
you know that the fact checkers are not 

1233
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:03,294
wrong every time you just don't think it
matters because he's persuading and a 

1234
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:09,030
direction that you like,
like,

1235
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,993
all right,
well to put a nice bow than on this 

1236
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:14,820
whole conversation since you've done a 
nice job.

1237
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:16,500
I think persuading people in general,
but I,

1238
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,560
I am upfront and admit you've helped 
persuade me in certain ways.

1239
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,810
Uh,
I want some at you.

1240
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,510
Adam's,
where's this all going?

1241
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,380
Does this guy run again?
In a way?

1242
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:27,800
It will be about three years now.
Uh,

1243
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:31,400
does he step aside and the Democrats 
finally wake up to some of this stuff?

1244
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,170
Lay it out.
Give me something here.

1245
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:34,163
I think you're going to see you 
something good with healthcare maybe by 

1246
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:37,374
the summer.
I think that the economy will stay 

1247
00:59:39,511 --> 00:59:42,300
strong unless there's some surprise that
we haven't seen,

1248
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,550
but straight line it looks like it's 
going to stay strong.

1249
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,990
I think we'll hit four percent GDP.
I think that,

1250
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,230
uh,
at the end of trump's four years,

1251
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,480
unless something new happens,
it's going to look really successful and

1252
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,343
if he's smart,
he will at least consider going out on 

1253
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:02,424
top,
especially because age becomes a little 

1254
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:05,034
bit more of an issue at that point.
And for a brand or somebody who would 

1255
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:09,390
like to go out and say,
okay,

1256
01:00:09,391 --> 01:00:10,224
you know,
I also have a company with my name on 

1257
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:14,400
it.
It might make sense to go out on top,

1258
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,533
but he's also a really competitive guy 
and so he might just want to take it to 

1259
01:00:20,461 --> 01:00:21,294
the next level,
but I'm not sure that I'm rooting for 

1260
01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:26,250
that because I think age has to matter 
in that job.

1261
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,153
Yeah.
And I suspect that even if everything 

1262
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:29,554
you predict there is true and 
everything's going great and it looks 

1263
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:33,040
like he could win again,
I do think,

1264
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:33,874
you know,
this is the guy who made the apprentice 

1265
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:36,603
and that it would be like he would just 
anoint his successor and then that 

1266
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:40,504
person would have to do the job,
whether it's don junior or whoever else 

1267
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:43,834
it is,
but that he would then step off as the 

1268
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:48,620
king and you know,
not even risk,

1269
01:00:48,621 --> 01:00:50,740
you already pulled off one major coup,
so to speak,

1270
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:52,930
and not even risk the second one.
Yeah.

1271
01:00:52,931 --> 01:00:55,660
It's going to be attempting to,
to keep the brand,

1272
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:56,603
you know,
clean if he has a great four years and 

1273
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,130
just go out with that.
Yeah.

1274
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,013
All right,
well it's always a pleasure talking to 

1275
01:01:02,111 --> 01:01:03,640
you.
I feel that we should do this,

1276
01:01:03,641 --> 01:01:05,870
you know,
probably a little more than maybe once a

1277
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:05,870
year or so.

1278
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,430
And that way I can keep grading your 
predictions.

1279
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,273
Is Anyone tracking you?
Is there a blog devoted to Adam said 

1280
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:12,970
this,
he got this one wrong,

1281
01:01:12,971 --> 01:01:14,350
got this one.
I think everyone should be.

1282
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:15,184
They should drop.
What they're doing is just track my 

1283
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,520
predictions.
I have them in my book win bigly.

1284
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:19,870
Uh,
so you can,

1285
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,290
you can see them there.
Yeah,

1286
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,310
we'll put the Amazon link right down 
below and yeah,

1287
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,990
it's a pleasure as always.
Thank you so much.

1288
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:26,853
And for more on Scott Adams,
you can follow him on twitter where he 

1289
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,510
does a lot of morning periscopes with 
you.

1290
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,540
Do you always have the coffee before you
start?

1291
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,820
I could never talk to people without the
first sip.

1292
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,670
I always have coffee before I talked to 
humans.

1293
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,830
That's a good,
good strategy.

1294
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:46,120
That is a true persuasive technique that
you all should be taken into account and

1295
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:48,040
it is Scott.
Adam says on the twitter.
