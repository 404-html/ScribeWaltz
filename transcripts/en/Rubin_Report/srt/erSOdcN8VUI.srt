1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,013
Well,
mainstream media focuses on trump's 

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:11,420
locker room talk and Clinton's emails.
There are actually a whole slew of other

3
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,254
interesting political stories happening 
right now related to the presidential 

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:15,974
election.
This election has seen a massive shift 

5
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:22,610
in America's political alignment on both
the left and the right on the left.

6
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,444
We've seen a real divide between the 
Bernie wing of the Democrats and the 

7
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:27,104
Clinton camp.
Bernie's message against Wall Street 

8
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,314
money in politics,
and his chastising of the political 

9
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:37,190
establishment has been swallowed whole 
by the Political Clinton machine.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,533
While Bernie is now supporting Hillary,
it's pretty clear that many of his 

11
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:46,310
supporters aren't following his lead in 
either donations or enthusiasm.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,623
This division is one of the reasons 
hillary is still struggling with young 

13
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:53,330
people and overall connecting with new 
voters.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,980
Meanwhile,
on the right,

15
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:59,750
we've seen the absolute fracturing of 
the Republican Party as we know it.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,950
Mainstream Republicans like Paul Ryan,
John Mccain,

17
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:06,650
and Jeb Bush are now on the outside 
looking in.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,470
As trump has aggressively gutted the 
party.

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,200
It's pretty clear that if trump wins in 
November,

20
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,880
the old guard of the Republicans will be
out and his inside circle of people like

21
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,530
Rudy Giuliani,
Chris Christie,

22
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,364
and Ben Carson will be in while the list
of Republicans not voting for trump 

23
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:26,540
continues to grow.
The Republican base who voted during the

24
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:31,160
primaries is still with him and whether 
the party is supporting trump or not,

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,480
those people are trump's rise also 
fractured.

26
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:39,500
The Republican Party ideologically 
neo-cons are either and hiding,

27
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:40,334
are defecting to Hillary.
While the Christian conservatives are 

28
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:43,574
backing trump,
a candidate who is probably their last 

29
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,650
choice when this election began.
Let's not forget,

30
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,280
this is a guy who compared his own book 
to the Bible as they say,

31
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:56,990
politics makes strange bedfellows for 
both the Democrats and the Republicans.

32
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,580
Twenty 16 will be looked back on as a 
watershed year regardless of who wins.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,410
It's clear the parties are in flux and 
they both desperately need new ideas and

34
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,244
new leaders.
The fact that we have a 69 year old 

35
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,034
Democrat running against a 70 year old 
Republican tells you all you need to 

36
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,280
know about the aging state.
Of our two party system,

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,730
how is it that these two were the best?
Our system can churn out while it's easy

38
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,874
to mock millennials,
just imagine how you would feel if this 

39
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:25,994
was the first presidential election you 
ever really paid attention to or had a 

40
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,074
chance to vote it.
We've got the ultimate reality star 

41
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:36,740
running against the ultimate insider,
and while they may hate each other,

42
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:40,850
they are also perfect for each other.
By the time this thing is over,

43
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:43,430
they'll have thrown out everything but 
the kitchen sink,

44
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,910
but that'll only be because they needed 
it to wash their dirty hands.

45
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,523
One of the many issues which seems to 
have been almost totally shelved during 

46
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:52,274
this campaign is science.
I guess in some ways science is the 

47
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,454
obvious sacrificial lamb in an election 
contest focusing so much on mudslinging 

48
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,860
instead of discussing the actual issues 
that affect our lives.

49
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,023
As we discussed during my chat with 
transhumanist is all time van two weeks 

50
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:07,924
ago.
There are so many huge upcoming 

51
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,354
scientific breakthroughs coming down the
pike from stem cell research to cloning 

52
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,674
to artificial intelligence that we must 
talk about these issues now so that 

53
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,174
we'll know how to deal with the 
ramifications of them both good and bad 

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,593
when they're right in front of us.
Scientific breakthroughs will continue 

55
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,760
to happen,
whether we're prepared for them or not.

56
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,740
Perhaps we can never be fully prepared,
but we at least need leaders who believe

57
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:34,510
in the merits of science in the first 
place.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,600
My guest this week is theoretical 
physicists,

59
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,434
Lawrence Krauss Kraus,
the foundation professor in the school 

60
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,274
of Earth and space exploration and 
Physics Department at Arizona State 

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,643
University,
as well as the director of the origins 

62
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,254
project at Asu,
which focuses on the origins of humans 

63
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,003
and the universe itself.
Cross has been outspoken this election 

64
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,203
related to politics and science,
particularly the seeming lack of 

65
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,210
knowledge in this department by Donald 
Trump.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,190
We're going to dive deep both into 
science and politics as well as the many

67
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,024
places that the two intersect.
I figure if a guy can spend his adult 

68
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:15,280
life trying to figure out the mysteries 
of the universe,

69
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,323
then maybe just maybe he can figure out 
the mysteries of our current political 

70
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:24,901
existential crisis.
Joining me this week is an author,

71
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,024
a theoretical physicist,
and a professor at the school of Earth 

72
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:35,270
and space exploration at Arizona State 
University.

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,520
Lawrence Krauss.
Welcome to the Rubin [inaudible].

74
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,490
It's great to be here.
You are in the middle of like 8,000

75
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:41,324
things and we're going to have to use 
some theoretical physics to fit this in 

76
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,780
the time space time continuum.
Eighty thousand plus or minus a million.

77
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:48,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

78
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,640
Plus or minus a million.
All right.

79
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,000
Well I'm very excited to talk to you.
I think I publicly shamed you into doing

80
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,650
this several times at the reason rally.
Yeah.

81
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:56,810
Well it's hard to publicly shame me,
but you did try.

82
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:57,231
Yeah.
Yeah,

83
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:57,921
he did.
Yeah.

84
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:58,580
And,
and uh,

85
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,413
but I wanted to do it.
It's just a matter of fitting in and 

86
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:02,360
it's great that we can be here today.
Yeah.

87
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,194
All right.
So I'm very excited you're heading to 

88
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,080
ucla to do some more talk to after this,
but let's,

89
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,340
let's jump right into the election 
because I have to.

90
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,630
Maybe we'll talk about the science.
It's about,

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,180
you know,
why not as a man of science,

92
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,540
how do you feel about just the tenor of 
this and,

93
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,603
and not just the tenor,
but as someone that cares about 

94
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,090
empirical evidence,
they don't care about facts.

95
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,630
How do you feel about just the state of 
what is going on right now?

96
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,580
It's every,
every year.

97
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,820
I always wonder if it could be worse 
because you know,

98
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:32,654
let's face it,
politics and empirical evidence that 

99
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,813
don't go together very well as a rule.
I know for a long time I've been 

100
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:37,994
interested in trying to make sure public
policy is based on that and in a lot of 

101
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,070
different ways in my writing and,
and we,

102
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,400
we actually created a group in 2008 
called science debate,

103
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,533
which we tried to get a presidential 
debate on issues of science and 

104
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:52,910
technology.
Not to ask them to 10th digit of Pi,

105
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:53,744
but if the issues that really matter 
that are gonna affect the future for 

106
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,420
people are not the issues that ever 
talked about,

107
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,920
their energy,
the environment,

108
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,330
security,
all of that depends on,

109
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,193
on,
on an understanding of science and 

110
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,850
technology policy and so it's always 
been ignored and we.

111
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,683
And we've been frustrated by it,
but I have to say that this is this 

112
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,523
year,
of course with Donald trump takes the 

113
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,620
cake in so many ways.
He's the.

114
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,863
I wrote a piece in the New Yorker which 
more or less called them the anti 

115
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,700
science candidate if such a thing as 
possible.

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,713
The only person I think on the 
Republican slate that was more anti 

117
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,350
science remarkably was Ben Carson.
Right.

118
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,980
Let's just talk about Carson.
Really?

119
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,740
Yeah.
Why not?

120
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,690
Because he's such a fool.
How can you be?

121
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,880
He's an.
He's a neurosurgeon.

122
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,410
Neurosurgeon,
right.

123
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,273
How can you be a neurosurgeon and 
against so many of the things that a 

124
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,240
scientist as well,
not just against ignorant about them,

125
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,960
that that's what amazed me.
It's,

126
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,803
it's,
it's,

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,570
it's one thing to be I logic 
ideologically opposed,

128
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,550
but he would talk about evolution away 
which clear,

129
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,320
clean them under,
didn't understand evolution,

130
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,363
which is the basis of biology besides 
calling the big bang a hoax from the 

131
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,280
devil and all,
I mean just fat.

132
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,801
Yeah.
Yeah,

133
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,580
exactly.
You know,

134
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,380
that in fact we didn't land on the moon,
but uh,

135
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,480
uh,
but,

136
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,830
uh,
so what it demonstrates is,

137
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,440
and it's unfortunate,
but actually it's relevant.

138
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,370
My mother wanted me to be a doctor and,
and,

139
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:12,204
and she made the mistake of,
of sort of getting me interested in 

140
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:18,440
science and wanted to be a scientist.
And then I discovered when I was in high

141
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,860
school that doctors weren't scientists.
I apologize to all doctors,

142
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,701
they're not.
And,

143
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:26,570
and he's a perfect example,
you to be,

144
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,393
to be a good that,
that's not to say how many doctors try 

145
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:31,934
and keep up with science obviously,
but to be a good neurosurgeon requires 

146
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:35,534
eye hand coordination and a,
and an understanding of what to what to 

147
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,520
do when you open up a brain.
It's,

148
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,190
it.
I will get in trouble for saying this,

149
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,024
but it's a very sophisticated kind of 
car mechanic and so he clearly was very 

150
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:52,460
good at those technical things,
but obviously you don't.

151
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,090
Obviously he he not only did not know 
much science,

152
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:56,924
but he he willfully,
and this is the real problem with with 

153
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,553
religion it with someone like him,
he decides what's right based on the 

154
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,264
scriptures and anything disagrees with 
it must be wrong and that's that's the 

155
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,240
real difference between religion and 
science were in religion.

156
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,074
You know the answers before you ask the 
questions and in science we try and ask 

157
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,064
the questions and find out the answers 
and they may surprise us and they may 

158
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:23,060
change over the course of not only may 
they often do and the willingness to say

159
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:27,020
you're wrong or to change your mind is 
profoundly important in science.

160
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:27,854
Which brings us back to Donald Trump,
but real quick just to finish with 

161
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,920
Carson because it's such an interesting 
example of this.

162
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,330
I'm glad you made the distinction of 
saying that he's a neurosurgeon.

163
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,970
Surgeon.
Scientists now fumbled twice.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's okay because a neuroscientist has 
to really have the scientific knowledge,

165
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,480
the way you're describing the souped up 
car guy,

166
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,680
car mechanic.
It's like,

167
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,460
really?
He's doing,

168
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,330
he's doing a physical act.
He's,

169
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,000
he's repairing damage and,
and he needs to know how to do that.

170
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,060
And you know,
I,

171
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,923
again,
one doesn't want to generalize for all 

172
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,664
neurosurgeons based on Ben Carson,
but it demonstrates that there's a 

173
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,404
difference and he,
and I'm assuming he was good at what he 

174
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,220
did and it wasn't all hype.
Uh,

175
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,054
I'm willing to grant him that,
but in everything else he says he 

176
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,960
expressed more ignorance,
not just antagonism,

177
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,794
but ignorance about fundamental science 
than any other candidate in the 

178
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,960
Republican Party,
which says a lot because,

179
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,220
because they're,
you know,

180
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,073
they're,
it has unfortunately become the anti 

181
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,490
science party of late and it wasn't 
always that way.

182
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,050
There party has been a big supporter of 
science over the years right now because

183
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,570
they insist on denying the existence of 
climate change.

184
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,643
And many on the right insist on denying 
the existence of evolution or even the 

185
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,100
Big Bang,
uh,

186
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,450
and their,
their attitudes towards homosexuality.

187
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,284
They have necessity by ideology,
been forced to confront the evidence of 

188
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,970
science and ignore it or,
or disregarded or or,

189
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,080
or lie about it,
right?

190
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:59,910
So basically they've staked out a 
position based on non fact and then that

191
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,650
sort of boxes them in their own real 
problem.

192
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,360
What do you do when you're wrong and you
can't afford to say wrong.

193
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,194
And the problem actually the real 
problem with politics is people are not 

194
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,291
willing to say,
you know what?

195
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,030
We have this policy but it was wrong.
We've changed our minds because it and,

196
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:20,850
and I read the public.
One of the reasons I want to have wanted

197
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:21,684
to insert more science into,
into public policy is not not the 

198
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,423
knowledge of science,
but the process of science which is 

199
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,220
based on empirical evidence and testing 
and,

200
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:32,670
and evolving your views.

201
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,340
And if we really want to have sound 
public policy,

202
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:37,710
we can't.
We can't just be willing to say,

203
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,780
oh well someone was wrong once and 
therefore,

204
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:40,614
you know,
we're not going to listen to them 

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,833
stating that you're wrong.
And explaining why is to me raises you 

206
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,790
to a higher level.
Someone.

207
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
It's a beautiful thing,
in fact,

208
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,890
as a scientist often say as a 
theoretical physicist,

209
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,090
I say the two greatest states to be in 
our being wrong or confused because then

210
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,740
that means a lot more to learn.
Yeah.

211
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,560
There's a little room there for a of.
I mean,

212
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,394
I mean it's really learning is a process
of discovering errors and what you were 

213
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:06,840
thinking.
And,

214
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,180
and uh,
I have often said,

215
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:10,780
in fact my new book,
I said somewhere that,

216
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:15,781
that science one of the purposes of 
sciences to make people uncomfortable.

217
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,060
And I don't mean that in a bad sense,
but if we're always comfortable,

218
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,910
it means we're never going outside our 
comfort zone.

219
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,743
It means are myopic.
Views are never been questioned or 

220
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,030
confronted.
And that's what living is all about.

221
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,660
That's what mute music,
art literature all about.

222
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:31,261
I mean,
it's,

223
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,490
you know,
I'll bring in,

224
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,623
happens to be today.
I'm excited because Bob Dylan just won 

225
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,770
the Nobel Prize in literature,
but you know,

226
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,633
but you know,
people like Bob don't force us to 

227
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,410
confront.
I remember when I was young,

228
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,820
our views about waste society worked and
science should be the same way.

229
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:48,780
And,
and good politicians should be,

230
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,673
should be all about that.
It's amazing to me when I've been in 

231
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,440
some other countries and,
and,

232
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,400
and,
and uh,

233
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,350
and uh,
confronting,

234
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,593
um,
presidents or prime ministers who 

235
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,130
actually who actually

236
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,290
no something.
And then that's,

237
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,540
you know,
that's not to say,

238
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,790
I mean Obama is a.
yeah.

239
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,624
Anyway,
I don't want to hate mail no matter 

240
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,710
what.
You're going to get hate mail,

241
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,583
hate.
Well wait till you see what happens on 

242
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,040
twitter.
But uh,

243
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,530
but we can talk about Obama and Clinton 
too.

244
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,364
But interestingly,
it sounds like you're saying you don't 

245
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,703
necessarily care if the,
if the president knows that much about 

246
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,204
sites,
but you at least want them to be 

247
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:26,020
intellectually curious enough to,
to assign the right people.

248
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,663
It looked.
The president can't be an expert in 

249
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:29,254
everything,
but the president needs to know they're 

250
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,710
not.
The first thing is to know you're not an

251
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,050
expert in everything,
which is Donald Trump hasn't yet figured

252
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:36,910
out.
And secondly,

253
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,600
to be intellectually curious and 
thirdly,

254
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,613
to choose the right people.
That's really what you want a president 

255
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,200
to do,
is have good advisors,

256
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:49,180
is to know enough to distinguish people 
who are full of garbage.

257
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,690
I'll use that word.
Uh,

258
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,700
and,
and,

259
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,593
and,
and people you can trust who's opinions 

260
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,460
you can trust because you know that 
they're willing to be wrong too.

261
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,930
And so I think that's really the 
president.

262
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,260
And uh,
and uh,

263
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,460
uh,
in,

264
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,870
in,
in the current climate,

265
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,460
you obviously can't be an expert in 
anything.

266
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,070
And an amazing me when we talk about,
you know,

267
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,270
having debate on science,
they say,

268
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,650
well,
the president shouldn't be a scientist,

269
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:12,750
but you know,
you know,

270
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,693
we have a debate on national security,
but with the president doesn't have to 

271
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,774
be a military expert.
He has to be surrounded himself or 

272
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,224
herself with,
with reasonable people who know what's 

273
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,680
going on or,
or on diplomacy.

274
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,990
So is the intellectual curiosity part of
it,

275
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:28,330
is that the part that about trump gets 
you the most?

276
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,343
Well,
it's intellectual curiosity and 

277
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:33,370
skepticism.
Skepticism is a key part of science.

278
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,863
Be asking yourself,
is this evidence reasonable and why 

279
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,620
should I believe that?
Yeah.

280
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,543
The the thing that,
it's hard to know what trump is such an 

281
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,800
anomaly,
but the fact that when he says,

282
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,040
you know,
who do you take advice from?

283
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,460
He says for myself,
because I'm,

284
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,543
you know,
I know that are mad when when someone 

285
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,660
says that no matter what they're running
for,

286
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,190
whether it's president or,
or,

287
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:54,910
or,
uh,

288
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,370
or,
or head of a school board or whatever,

289
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,383
you should worry about that.
And so I think it's that and his 

290
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,180
incredible

291
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:11,240
anger and vindictiveness and you know,
people have called him a,

292
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,570
a bully,
but you know,

293
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:13,404
I did a,
I did a dialogue with the Hollywood 

294
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,284
friend of mine named Johnny Depp and he 
and he pointed out that wasn't who he 

295
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,790
actually,
he actually played Donald Trump in it.

296
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,250
You should watch it on Netflix.
And it was a great show where he,

297
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,780
he looks just like him.
It's great.

298
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,680
But he said that Donald Trump isn't a 
bully.

299
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,470
He's a brat.
And that,

300
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,393
that defines the man to me.
He's not a bully so much as just a 

301
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,630
spoiled Brat.
Who,

302
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,100
who,
if he's losing,

303
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:39,120
finds a reason to blame other people.
It does.

304
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,983
Again,
he's the center of his own universe and 

305
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,410
all of that is,
is,

306
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,610
uh,
is,

307
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,450
is terrifying and uh,
and ignorant in the extreme.

308
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:49,284
I mean,
one of the,

309
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,820
when I wrote about science and,
and the candidates this year,

310
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,703
one of the statements that trump made 
that just to me epitomizes the level of 

311
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,710
ignorance of the man because first of 
all,

312
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:03,980
a lot of what he says is just meant he 
doesn't care whether it's true or not.

313
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,790
He thinks it'll play well or not.
That I can understand when you say,

314
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,100
you know,
why are we worried about the ozone?

315
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:10,934
Why can't I have know aerosols in my 
hairspray because I only use my 

316
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,520
hairspray indoors.
So it can affect,

317
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,970
can affect you that Mr said that now 
that's the kind of thing you say.

318
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,660
Oh my goodness gracious.
So anyway,

319
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,160
yeah,
that one's tough.

320
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:26,090
So,
okay,

321
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,890
so we've got your feelings on trump,
I think.

322
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,060
I think they're clear,
right?

323
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,140
Yeah.
Well I have,

324
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,740
I've been trying to moderate them less,
uh,

325
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,621
um,
you know,

326
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:34,454
the p,
I just wrote a piece in the New Yorker 

327
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,970
Today on,
on,

328
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,100
on the nuclear threat.
And,

329
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,353
and,
uh,

330
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,590
to be more serious,
his misunderstanding of,

331
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,280
of the fact that nuclear weapons are not
meant to be used.

332
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,340
And in fact,
the,

333
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,640
as I pointed out,
it demonstrates a lot of our,

334
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,990
of the illogical nature of our nuclear 
policy.

335
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,011
But when he says,
if you're,

336
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:55,761
you know,
if we build them,

337
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,870
why can't we use them that anyone has 
thought about it,

338
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:02,100
I realized that you can't,
you can't use them in any strategic way.

339
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,213
And so it's,
and if he wants to encourage other 

340
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:05,720
countries to build them,
he,

341
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,573
he misunderstands the whole point of 
proliferation and those things are 

342
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,580
serious.
They're not,

343
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,080
you know,
we can't laugh over that stuff.

344
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,140
So I really tried and I think mostly 
people that watch your show,

345
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,020
I really tried to be fair to him and,
and,

346
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,690
and whatever.
So when,

347
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,260
when he's talking about the nuclear 
stuff,

348
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,240
and I'll say something like,
you know,

349
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,193
uh,
Japan should have nukes so that they 

350
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,930
could defend themselves potentially from
China.

351
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,410
It seems to me that there's some grain 
of truth in the,

352
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,720
in the concept of that,
that,

353
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:36,050
that we shouldn't have to feel like we 
have to defend Japan.

354
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,090
Well,
you're saying it really throws off every

355
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,880
sort of preceptive how all these nations
have.

356
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,670
Well,
it prints rolls off the precept of,

357
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,140
of,
of really what we should be trying to do

358
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:45,974
with nuclear weapons,
which we isn't talked about enough 

359
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,720
today,
which is we want to reduce the number of

360
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:53,180
nuclear weapons,
the world because there's really no good

361
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:57,170
use for the right eye.
And we built up this incredible stash of

362
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:58,004
nuclear weapons because of the Cold War 
and we had this policy of mutually 

363
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:01,064
assured destruction.
So we had to have enough to ensure that 

364
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:06,170
total annihilation of the Soviet Union 
when the Soviet Union.

365
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,590
And uh,
that's okay.

366
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,930
But we then have in,
even at the time of Nixon,

367
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:12,764
we signed the Nonproliferation Treaty.
Most people think the Nonproliferation 

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,650
Treaty,
and this is so typical of the US,

369
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,100
is designed to say no one should have 
nuclear weapons but us.

370
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,810
And that's not what it's about.

371
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,470
It's trying to say we don't want to have
nuclear weapons to spread,

372
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,143
but the other thing that the nuclear 
nations agreed to in the 

373
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:37,460
Nonproliferation Treaty was to disarm 
and so we have an obligation.

374
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,294
We are violating the Nonproliferation 
Treaty today in this country as much as 

375
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,833
North Korea may be by trying to get 
nuclear weapons are getting new weapons 

376
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:47,914
or Iran,
which happily they've been stopped from 

377
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,980
getting them for the moment because we 
are not making an open effort.

378
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:56,700
Did it's arm and Obama who whose heart 
was certainly the right place.

379
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,481
He said,
you know,

380
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:00,030
we see the world should,
should get rid of nuclear weapons,

381
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,500
and initially the,
the,

382
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,300
the,
his administration actually did an,

383
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,590
an agreement with the Soviet Union with 
the Russia to reduce the number of arms,

384
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,300
but we still have way too many.
We still have a thousand nuclear weapons

385
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,134
on hair trigger alert,
which means they can be launched 

386
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,690
instantaneously if,
if there's a warning of an attack,

387
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:19,950
whether the warning is real or not.

388
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,903
The president only has a few minutes to 
decide that is not necessary in the 

389
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,860
modern world.
And also,

390
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,510
unfortunately,
and I'm happy to see that,

391
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,250
that Hillary Clinton seems to be against
it.

392
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,900
We are barking at a $1,000,000,000,000
modernization of nuclear weapons fleet,

393
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,913
which is only reasonable if we plan to 
keep our nuclear weapons level at what 

394
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,710
it is.
If we say no,

395
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,240
you know,
eventually want to reduce them.

396
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,313
We don't have to spend that much money 
trying to maintain the arsenal we now 

397
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,584
have.
And so it's interesting to me to see 

398
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:52,890
that the nuclear issue,
which over time has been,

399
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,783
has raised and lowered in importance.
The public doesn't seem to think about 

400
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,210
it,
but it is still the major threat,

401
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,020
the major existential threat to 
civilization.

402
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:06,150
And,
and we as a country are not doing enough

403
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,043
and it is true at the same time that 
we're probably going to this more than 

404
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:11,310
you want to know.

405
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,143
But it's true that Russia is getting 
more worrisome than they were afforded 

406
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,950
the saber rattling the arguments about 
nuclear weapons are much worse now under

407
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,960
Putin in the last few years.
And they were.

408
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,030
So there's some concerns in that regard.
But,

409
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,313
but,
um,

410
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,750
we could take unilateral steps which 
would lead us in the right direction,

411
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,593
right?
So even if Russia was 10 times worse 

412
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:36,360
than you might,
if we had half of our stockpile it,

413
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,060
we'd still be more than enough to 
destroy.

414
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,920
If we had a 10th of our,
if we had a 10th of our stock pile,

415
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:41,320
we,
we,

416
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,830
we could still not only annihilate the 
Soviet Union,

417
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,380
but essentially create enough mess to 
destroy the world.

418
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,693
And,
uh,

419
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,531
uh,
it,

420
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:50,710
it,
we,

421
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,240
we need to,
we need to realize that fact and,

422
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,070
and,
and realize that we can,

423
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,993
as I say,
unilateral actions are often responded 

424
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,390
to.
For example,

425
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,840
another area where we spend money that 
we,

426
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,760
that's a waste of time for the most part
is missile defense.

427
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,250
When one of the things I love is a,
George Bush claimed that they were gonna

428
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,360
have a missile defense system ready in 
2004.

429
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,770
He was during the election.
And,

430
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,683
and of course it turned out that most 50
percent of the American public thought 

431
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,580
we already had one.
And as they was going at the time,

432
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,773
what they should say is we already have 
one just as effective as this system 

433
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,890
that doesn't work,
but it doesn't cost $100 million.

434
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,770
So it's a lot less expensive and,
and it serves the same effect.

435
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,300
So how much of this though is just that 
a huge percentage of our economy is tied

436
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,710
into the military?
It is,

437
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:40,500
but you know the.
But what you're hearing in the president

438
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,690
of the election is we're not spending 
enough.

439
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,920
And that's what scary.
What we need to do is spend rationally.

440
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,880
People said that for a long time,
you know,

441
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,714
we,
we spend almost a trillion dollars on 

442
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:51,450
the,
on,

443
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,780
on defense every year.

444
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,180
And the question is we have to look and 
say,

445
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,590
what are we need?
Look,

446
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,783
it's not as if we can disarm as a nation
completely in all ways the world is a 

447
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,310
dangerous place.
But the question is,

448
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,440
do we need to spend that kind of money?
And the answer,

449
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,890
I think for many people as we could 
spend less more effectively.

450
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,900
Do you think there's any situation where
ethically we could use nukes?

451
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:14,201
I mean,
if,

452
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:15,034
let's say,
because I don't think it's going to be 

453
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,090
through a nation state,
but let's say they,

454
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,933
you know,
somebody got a dirty bomb in here and 

455
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,760
blew up times square.
So the question is,

456
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:22,594
what do you,
I think the answer generally is no 

457
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,513
nuclear weapons right now are useful for
deterrence to stop other people from 

458
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,480
doing things,
but it is,

459
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,343
you hit an interesting point that,
that when might you use them and see 

460
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,980
what many people may not realize is that
the country has no.

461
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,430
Most people think the US has a no first 
use policy,

462
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,560
namely we would never be the first ones 
using them.

463
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,110
We don't write that because we said,
well,

464
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,420
what if not someone who uses nuclear 
weapons,

465
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,640
but what if someone launches biological 
weapons?

466
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,440
You know,
shouldn't we be allowed to nuke them?

467
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:54,274
Or what if someone nukes South Korea 
shouldn't be allowed to nuke and 

468
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,773
response?
And so these are questions that you can 

469
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,440
debate.
But uh,

470
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,250
on the whole,
the question is what,

471
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,730
what do you gain versus conventional 
forces?

472
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,700
And you know,
other than active anger,

473
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,153
right?
If the act has already been done yet 

474
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,870
here,
so the question is what do you,

475
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,220
the idea should be to stop that in the 
future?

476
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,603
Uh,
not an and inevitably the problem is 

477
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:25,960
that under many scenarios,
once you start using nuclear weapons,

478
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,630
the,
it proliferates and,

479
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,410
and what's been pointed out by a bunch 
of his sister even bout 10 years ago,

480
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,150
you may remember nuclear winter with 
Carl Sagan and that there was,

481
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
that was sort of discredited a little 
bit,

482
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,314
but in fact even at a limited nuclear 
war between India and Pakistan have 50 

483
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,980
or a hundred weapons,
which may sound like a lot,

484
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:48,460
but it's the kind of thing you might 
expect in a nuclear war would,

485
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,593
would raise enough basically dust in the
atmosphere to for a decade affect 

486
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,910
agriculture.

487
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,330
Ultimately perhaps killing a billion 
people through starvation.

488
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,850
So there's no such thing as a limited 
nuclear war.

489
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,080
And,
and it,

490
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,093
and everyone,
including the right wing guys like 

491
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,470
George Schultz and Henry Kissinger came 
up a bunch of years ago and said,

492
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,550
we need to basically work towards a 
nuclear free world because as long as we

493
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:16,120
have nuclear weapons,
we're all at risk.

494
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,870
So how do you untie that then from the 
legitimate parts of deterrent?

495
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,370
If your argument is that deterrence is 
an important piece of the strategy,

496
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,204
because might be by having deterrence,
you don't necessarily have to fight a 

497
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:28,900
ground war.
How do you untie those?

498
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,691
Well,
for example,

499
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,090
well,
how many you can ask right now?

500
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,940
How many nuclear weapons you need to 
deter a,

501
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,783
uh,
an aggressor and you certainly don't 

502
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:36,410
need.
We,

503
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,770
the United States has $5,000
over the Russia.

504
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,611
Russia,
excuse me,

505
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:40,620
I grew up in the Soviet Union.

506
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,870
You forgetting what year it is?
Yeah.

507
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:44,920
Yeah.
I know Russia has Russia,

508
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,200
another $5,000.
That's,

509
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,860
you know,
we don't need 5,000

510
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,694
weapons to deter him.
100 nuclear weapons would be more than 

511
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:56,620
enough to destroy basically any country 
and,

512
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:59,790
and dramatically affect the world.
So maybe we could immediately go down to

513
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:00,624
a hundred weapons will be indifference 
then ultimately for someone that's 

514
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:05,060
hearing you and saying,
well if we haven't but we're not using,

515
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:06,600
what's the difference whether we have 
$5,000

516
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,580
to maintain a fleet of a 5,000
weapons,

517
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,730
including the infrastructure requires an
incredible amount of money.

518
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,860
Got It.
So that alone,

519
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:17,270
in fact,
this $1,000,000,000,000

520
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:20,120
modernization gives you an example of 
the infrastructure costs.

521
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,880
So there are economic costs as well as 
security costs.

522
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:25,040
And if we decided rationally,
you know what?

523
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:25,874
It's better to know it.
It's like if you have 10 cars that cost 

524
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:30,380
you a lot more money to maintain them,
then if you have one,

525
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,880
it's not just the cost of the cars.

526
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,940
Yeah.
So as a theoretical physicist,

527
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:35,774
when you talk about all of this stuff,
you have an insight into how things 

528
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:41,660
actually work that the average person 
doesn't have.

529
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,820
Do you worry that you'll ever stumble 
upon something or you know,

530
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:47,654
somehow accidentally or maybe 
intentionally you find something and 

531
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:52,970
then realize how it can be turned into 
something horrific.

532
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:55,760
I mean that's like the big apocalyptic.
I he not happily what I,

533
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,613
I'm always pleased to say that what I 
work on has no practical significance 

534
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:01,670
whatsoever.
I heard you say that,

535
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,690
but its origins and history of the 
universe and,

536
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:06,630
and,
and uh,

537
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,610
you know,
you can never.

538
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,444
Of course,
the great thing about science is you 

539
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:10,304
never know what's going to be discovered
or what the implications so that I 

540
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,720
guess.
But if you had to pick one area that had

541
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,640
less direct practical significance,
you,

542
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,690
it'd be hard to find one that more than 
mine,

543
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:21,524
which was where I try and understand how
the universe began and how it's going 

544
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:23,960
end.

545
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,210
And these,
these questions are incredibly important

546
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:30,530
for us culturally,
but the but the kind of new physics that

547
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,364
we try and develop and understand 
affects the universe on scales that 

548
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,340
really are divorced from human scales 
directly.

549
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,580
Obviously they,
they relate to what the reasons.

550
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,560
You know,
how we got here.

551
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,394
My new book,
which I will plug called the greatest 

552
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,870
story ever told so far,
the subtitles on March 27th,

553
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,640
March 2017.
And it's.

554
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,740
But at the subtitle is called why are we
here?

555
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,700
And ultimately we want to understand 
those questions and unfortunately,

556
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,500
religion tries to usurp those questions 
that I want to point out how science can

557
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,334
dress them.
So their fundamental sort of cultural 

558
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:02,624
questions.
But,

559
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,660
but I like to say,
although it's pretentious,

560
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,360
because I don't want to meet comparison,
but my work is,

561
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,230
the work by people like me is as useful 
as a Mozart symphony.

562
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,930
I mean,
it's at its best at its best.

563
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,630
It can be as useful as a Mozart 
symphony.

564
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,670
It enhances the cultural experience of 
being human.

565
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,320
Um,
so I'm happily,

566
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,590
uh,
I'm not as worried about that,

567
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:29,320
but on the other hand,
what we need to do is for.

568
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,190
There's an old expression,
I think from Pesto,

569
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,690
but it could be from later on.
I never,

570
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,553
I've tried to track it down at fortune 
favors the prepared mind and what we 

571
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,250
need to do or think about what the 
possibilities are.

572
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,293
So we're prepared to act and we can't be
prepared to act if we put our heads in 

573
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:48,540
the sand so we can say,
oh,

574
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,950
we should never,
you know,

575
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,940
uh,
uh,

576
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,190
do genetic engineering.
But it's happening.

577
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,293
We w we,
so we can talk about artificial 

578
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:59,430
intelligence and say we need to,
we need to stop that,

579
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:00,264
but it's not going to be stopped what we
need to do or think about the 

580
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:03,090
possibilities.

581
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,923
And that's one of the reasons why the 
origins project that run at Asu is so 

582
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:07,104
for me,
so exciting because we try to bring 

583
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,500
scientists together to look at forefront
questions,

584
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,000
but then we have public events were 3000
people attend and listen.

585
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:18,390
And the point is to,
you know,

586
00:27:18,391 --> 00:27:21,090
you can't have a good democracy without 
an informed population.

587
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:21,924
And,
and so to try and raise these questions 

588
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,950
and get people to think about the 
possibilities are,

589
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,180
will allow us to be better prepared for 
an,

590
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,223
for surprising possibilities in the 
future because we don't know where the 

591
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:33,960
future lies.
Uh,

592
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,803
uh,
I,

593
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,703
I often say,
and I said it on a film recently that 

594
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,233
I'm not.
If someone tells you they're a futurist 

595
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:42,660
in my mind,
that's when he stopped listening because

596
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,183
I try not to make predictions about 
anything other than like 2 trillion 

597
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,730
years in the future because that's a.

598
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,650
What do you call that as a super future?
Well,

599
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,820
yeah,
because first of all,

600
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,800
no one will be around a test and it is 
much easier but,

601
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,933
but,
but we don't discoveries are called 

602
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,444
discoveries because there are surprises,
but we can try and at least anticipate 

603
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:00,954
the set of possibilities so it will be a
little less surprised and all of us can 

604
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:04,524
do that and that's why you know,
you say I'm a scientist and I have 

605
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,021
access.
It's true.

606
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:10,290
I have access to some information people
don't normally have access to,

607
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,363
but the process of science we can all be
at least have a perspective of what's 

608
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:14,844
happening and that's why it's important.
That's why I spend time in the public 

609
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:20,544
hat trying to,
trying to explain and explore science 

610
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,414
for the public,
not just because it's interesting and 

611
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,184
exciting and it is.
It's fun and people are fascinated by 

612
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:29,244
it,
but because hopefully it will be useful 

613
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,810
when people try and confront the 
challenges of the 21st century.

614
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,673
Alright.
So I want to spend the rest of this 

615
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:38,400
talking about your actual work and 
origins and stuff like that.

616
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:42,110
But my last question on this part,
I have no agenda but I know you don't.

617
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,710
You've made it very clear which I love 
that.

618
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:44,544
So.
Well my last part goes to your public 

619
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,210
happy because clearly you're,
you're willing to talk about politics,

620
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,710
you're willing to,
you know,

621
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,860
speak about things freely.
And as you emailed me,

622
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,600
I have no no agenda or anything.
Um,

623
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,513
do you ever fear that that will have a 
professional cost just by saying things 

624
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,490
quite already?
It does all the time,

625
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,410
but I suppose to some extent,
no,

626
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,880
I,
if I feared about that,

627
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:07,620
I would've stopped a long time ago.
I guess.

628
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,020
Look,
I think there's not a day goes by that I

629
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:17,820
don't realize I'm fortunate in a way 
that people,

630
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,010
for one reason or another want to listen
to me,

631
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:23,490
or at least I have a public profile and 
therefore I have a responsibility.

632
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,370
It seems to me to use that profile 
responsibly.

633
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:29,220
And that means of course,
to try and,

634
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,811
uh,
and,

635
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,644
and,
and,

636
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,580
and popularized science in a way,
but also to try and do what I can to,

637
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,830
to have an impact.
So in some sense,

638
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,200
you know,
it goes hand in hand with what I said to

639
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:41,034
you about my work.
My work has no practical significance 

640
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:43,564
whatsoever,
but I'm,

641
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,290
but as a human being,
I'm very political on.

642
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,480
I'm very interested in what's going on 
and therefore in some sense,

643
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:54,400
maybe I make up for the fact that my 
work has no usefulness by take advantage

644
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:57,520
of my public profile to try and,
and do useful things.

645
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:58,354
And one of the useful things can try and
be leased to provoke people to think 

646
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,220
about these things.
And so,

647
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,600
uh,
that's what I do.

648
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,700
All right,
so now let's,

649
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,510
let's get into the work part of it.

650
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,120
Part that apparently has no meaning or 
no,

651
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:12,080
it has lots of meaning but no 
significance.

652
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,740
No one has significance in a global 
sense,

653
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:17,160
in a cosmic sense and a in a,
in a,

654
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:19,750
in a,
in a existential sense,

655
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,110
but it doesn't,
it won't cause a better toaster.

656
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,963
Bob Built and you know,
that's one of the problems with science 

657
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,273
is that it has practical utility.
It's obviously not a problem because we 

658
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,060
couldn't be doing this show.
We wouldn't.

659
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,530
People wouldn't live as long as they 
live.

660
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,290
All our modern society is based on the 
results science,

661
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,230
but because science produces technology 
that changed our lives,

662
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,440
people suddenly think that unless it's 
related to the technology,

663
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:42,274
it's not an interesting.
Whereas I say art doesn't produce 

664
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,720
anything practical so people don't 
expect them to say,

665
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,793
you know what,
that Picasso painting hasn't produced 

666
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,420
something that makes me live longer and,
but,

667
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,930
and so because science has that 
practical side,

668
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,750
people forget the cultural side that 
they,

669
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,880
the knowledge side and that's to me is 
as important as anything.

670
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:04,480
What I've,
I've quoted a number of times and uh,

671
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,200
but I'll quote it again here,
one of my favorite statements from a guy

672
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,034
named Robert Wilson who was the director
of the first director of the National 

673
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,043
Accelerator Laboratory,
which is a particle accelerator near 

674
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:15,964
Chicago,
which accelerates particles to look at 

675
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,084
fundamental structure matter.
It was the largest such machine in the 

676
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:23,220
world until the large Hadron collider 
was built in,

677
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,510
in Geneva,
but when it was being built,

678
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,033
he was called by Congress to testify and
he was asked will it aid in the defense 

679
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:33,490
of the nation?
And he gave a beautiful statement,

680
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,324
but at the end of it was basically no,
it won't help aid in the defense of the 

681
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:38,614
nation.
It'll just help keep the nation worth 

682
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:40,440
defending,
uh,

683
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,550
that,
that actually is really beautiful.

684
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,320
I think it is.
So that's why I quote them.

685
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,420
So that's sort of it.

686
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:50,510
It's a problem of funding things in a 
way because if you fund something,

687
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:51,514
people want results and what you're 
saying is basically the whole 

688
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,710
playground.
If science is entitled to that.

689
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:59,680
And it's a real problem now in 
government funding and in the public.

690
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,490
People seem to want to fund things based
on,

691
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:02,324
in fact,
I wrote another piece on the House 

692
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,283
Science Committee,
which basically wanting to require an 

693
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,923
did to some extent scientists in their 
grant applications to justify why what 

694
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:14,950
they're doing is in the national 
interest and the net doesn't necessarily

695
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:16,840
have anything to do with science.
Well,

696
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,360
the point is that it seems to me the 
natural,

697
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,220
the national interest is an increasing 
our knowledge and,

698
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:25,210
and it's not in.
And so if you,

699
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,780
if you require things directly to have a
practical application,

700
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,990
then you're going to miss almost 
everything.

701
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,173
You,
it's already been well documented that 

702
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:35,104
probably 50 percent of the current gross
national product of this country is 

703
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:42,410
based on fundamental curiosity driven 
research that was done a generation ago.

704
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,610
Accidents,
you know,

705
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,910
discovery of penicillin.
They weren't looking for antibiotics.

706
00:32:45,911 --> 00:32:48,410
So even the development of transistor 
wasn't.

707
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,953
If,
if people had said we need to make 

708
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:51,704
better computers back at the time when 
they were using wheels and other things 

709
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,470
and they would have missed the use of 
transistors.

710
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,970
So all of the things that have changed 
our lives,

711
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:02,900
even the worldwide web,
which was developed at at Geneva,

712
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,853
the home of the large Hadron collider to
help scientists communicate in large 

713
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:10,040
experiments when you have 10,000
scientists around the world,

714
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,143
it was important for them to be able to 
exchange results without worrying about 

715
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:15,380
where the results were and being able to
communicate.

716
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,100
That's what developed the worldwide web.
And of course that changed the world.

717
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:24,050
So you need to support fundamental 
curiosity driven research.

718
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:24,884
If you stop doing that,
then not only do we suffer as a species 

719
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,340
by law,
not our learning going not increasing,

720
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,473
but ultimately the spinoffs that are 
going to change our lives are not gonna 

721
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,260
occur.

722
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,093
Yeah.
So you mentioned Carl Sagan before and 

723
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,354
my,
my scientific awakening was a little 

724
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,580
slow.
I hate to admit it,

725
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,533
I was always into Scifi when I was 
growing up and star wars and all that 

726
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:46,100
stuff,
but my real scientific awakening,

727
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,963
I saw the movie contact and I'd eaten 
pot brownies before and I thought I was 

728
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,700
going to see,
I think air force one,

729
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:54,230
but it was sold out.
So I just went into,

730
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,413
I had no idea what it was about,
it didn't really know much about cross 

731
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:57,801
Hagen,
but you know,

732
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:00,870
the opening Panorama universe in my mind
on pop round,

733
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:01,704
he's,
I mean,

734
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,980
it exploded.
I sensitive,

735
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,510
right?
Every Carl Sagan Book and all that.

736
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,310
Kind of what,
what was that moment for you?

737
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,340
I suspect it was a lot younger than it 
was.

738
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,210
It was.
I was a little younger and a lot earlier

739
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,073
because a lot older.

740
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,480
But I'm actually,
you know,

741
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,160
well I,
I,

742
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,993
it's hard.
I'm not sure there was an epiphany in 

743
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:18,220
that way,
but there was a.

744
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,550
But the first thing I can remember was 
when I was in grade six,

745
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,380
I'm reading a book about Galileo and um,
and,

746
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,790
and,
and it seemed romantic and remarkable to

747
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,624
me.
The fact that he was the first one to 

748
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:40,580
look up that the moons of Jupiter and it
changed everything and,

749
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,700
and also the courage he had at or,
or lack thereof at times to,

750
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,353
to confront conventional wisdom.
That seemed to me to be a romantic 

751
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:51,314
adventure that captured my imagination.
And that's probably one of the reasons 

752
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:55,904
why write books is because it was books 
about him and then books by people like 

753
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,733
Isaac Asimov,
well before Carl Sagan and George Gamma 

754
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:06,380
of and Albert Einstein,
and then Richard,

755
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,453
Richard Feynman books by people like 
that got me excited as a young person 

756
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,213
about the romantic adventure to be the,
to to be the first to understand 

757
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:15,500
something new about the world.

758
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,333
And,
and so I returned the favor and I'm old 

759
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:20,660
enough now that it's for me,
very satisfying.

760
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,360
Although a little depressing to think 
how old I am and what I mean.

761
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,860
Scientists now say,
you know,

762
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:25,694
I read the physics of Star Trek and 
that's what turned me on to be with 

763
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,363
scientists.
So,

764
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,890
um,
but it was those popular books and I,

765
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:33,500
and that's why,
although it takes time out of,

766
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,230
out of my research directly,
it,

767
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,180
I'm not sure which is more useful in the
long run.

768
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,043
And besides I don't have control.
I have to do what I have to do when 

769
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:42,901
writing.
It's one of them,

770
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:43,734
but,
but it's very satisfying to be able to 

771
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:49,560
connect because the importance of a 
university or of the research enterprise

772
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,663
is two fold.
And that's one of the reasons why my 

773
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:55,950
origins project is twofold.
University Research University should be

774
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:56,784
based on the creation of knowledge,
but if you don't disseminate the 

775
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:01,630
knowledge,
it's impotent so it has to be to,

776
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,270
to fold.

777
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,103
And,
and so,

778
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,153
uh,
I like to be involved in both for some 

779
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:06,121
reason.
Yeah.

780
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:06,954
So the origins project,
you're trying to figure out the origins 

781
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:12,750
of humans and the universe and we're 
looking at the origins of everything.

782
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:13,584
It's [inaudible].
It's a wonderful playground because we 

783
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:16,674
look at everything from the origins of 
the universe to the origins of life to 

784
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:21,000
the origins of violence and,
and,

785
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,863
and,
uh,

786
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,860
uh,
um,

787
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,390
we're,
we're having,

788
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,100
we're having and the origins of the 
future,

789
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,170
we're having a workshop,
uh,

790
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,053
in,
in February and the AI and its 

791
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,790
challenges.
So if you think about it,

792
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,983
forefront questions,
there's a relationship always between 

793
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,610
the future and the past.
And forefront questions are always based

794
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,070
about the origin.
What's the origin of disease?

795
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:46,071
What's the origin of of intelligence and
so as a curious person,

796
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,200
I can go well beyond just my area of 
physics,

797
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:51,510
which tends to be more related to the 
origin of the universe,

798
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:54,150
when which has gotten me into it,
to all these other questions.

799
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,983
I'm like a kid in a candy shop.
I get to meet and work with the most 

800
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,680
interesting people in the world and 
learn a lot about a lot of things.

801
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,380
So it's just,
it's really self indulgence,

802
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,400
which is most of my life is based on,
but it's bringing a lot of good to a lot

803
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:09,234
of people.
Me Self indulgence and individuality is 

804
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,331
good.
Yeah.

805
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,200
Well,
you know,

806
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,333
that's the other thing I guess I want to
say is that most people become 

807
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,570
scientists not because they want to save
the world.

808
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,810
It's because they like doing it.
It's fun and,

809
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,940
and there's nothing and that's fine.
I,

810
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,043
I tell kids,
that's when they asked me what they 

811
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:28,331
should do.
I say,

812
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,090
do what you enjoy because if you don't 
enjoy it,

813
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:32,730
you're not going to do well anyway.
But I do science,

814
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,593
you know,
it's great if it has an impact in one 

815
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:37,870
way or another,
but I do it because I enjoy it and,

816
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,470
and that and I and I am an unabashed 
about that.

817
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,720
Yeah.
So I'm very proud that on this show,

818
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,583
which I try to bring on people of all 
kinds of beliefs and political 

819
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,064
persuasions and all that stuff.
I get tons of emails from religious 

820
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:51,390
people even though they know that I'm 
not a believer in that stuff,

821
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,610
so we don't have to dive too much into 
the atheism thing.

822
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:54,444
But can you,
how about you give me the best sell job 

823
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,620
in like three minutes on,
on the big bang,

824
00:37:58,621 --> 00:37:59,454
like just something that someone that,
that is a believer of religion could 

825
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:04,740
say,
well maybe there's something here.

826
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,870
Maybe there's some.
Well the point is it's,

827
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,480
it,
it,

828
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,313
it's,
it's,

829
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,490
it's sad that I have to do that because.
Did I leave too much with that question?

830
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:12,850
Maybe I should untangled them.
No,

831
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:13,231
no,
no.

832
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:14,760
But I mean,
one,

833
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,903
it makes it sound like the big bang is 
on a different footing than the fact 

834
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:18,840
that the earth is round.

835
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,140
It's not the big bang happened.
Same with evolution.

836
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:23,040
It's not,
you know,

837
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,350
people get hung up in the word theory.
Well,

838
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,730
you know,
someone just wrote me and said,

839
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:27,564
well,
you know,

840
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,860
it's a theory.
And I said,

841
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:30,120
well,
gravity is a theory too,

842
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:32,610
so if you don't believe in walk up to 
the 10th floor window.

843
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,463
But the point is a theory in science 
means it's been tested theories a very 

844
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:37,834
high level in science.
It means it's satisfied the test 

845
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,150
experiment over and over and over again,
and the fact that the universe began,

846
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,153
that the universe was smaller than it is
today and smaller and smaller and 

847
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,840
smaller and was once contained in a 
microscopic region.

848
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:58,050
13 point 8 billion years ago.
That expanded dramatically is,

849
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,980
is,
is a fact.

850
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,443
And it and everything we sit,
we recognize about the university is 

851
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,940
only understandable in that context.

852
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,790
There are lots of independent ways to 
measure the age of the universe.

853
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,500
And we come up with 13 point 8 billion 
years.

854
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,600
We measure the fact the university 
expanding,

855
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,703
working backwards,
it was smaller than it is and if we 

856
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,463
extrapolate back and say what happened 
when the smaller we make predictions 

857
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,730
about things that we hadn't seen before,
people say evolution or the Big Bang our

858
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,650
historical science because no one was 
around.

859
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,330
They offer.
I mean no one was around to know,

860
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,320
so how do you know?
And I say,

861
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,393
well the point is all sciences 
historical because all science is based 

862
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:40,930
on explaining some observations but 
done,

863
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:41,764
but then making predictions of things 
that haven't been done and both 

864
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,303
evolution and the big bang make 
predictions about things that weren't 

865
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,820
seen before.
If,

866
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,380
if the big bang happened,
we predicted it was predicted.

867
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:56,650
Although a lot of sciences didn't know 
about it until after the fact that there

868
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:59,920
should be a universal background of 
radiation coming at us.

869
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,590
That was once 3000 degrees in 
temperature.

870
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:03,424
That's now three degrees.
That's been measured with exquisite 

871
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:08,050
prediction.
Exquisite precision.

872
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:08,884
Sorry.
And also we predict that 25 percent of 

873
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:13,384
the universe should be helium and almost
75 percent of the industry of the 

874
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:18,400
hydrogen and one part in 10 billion new 
universe will be lithium.

875
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,160
We go out and measure that 10 orders of 
magnitude.

876
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,740
So we make tons of predictions of 
things.

877
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,340
That's what science is,
not just a story like religion.

878
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,503
It makes predictions and if those 
predictions don't agree with the 

879
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:31,750
observations,
they're wrong.

880
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,593
So we throw the,
we throw it out like yesterday's 

881
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,830
newspaper.
So the history,

882
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,330
that word historical science,
which a lot of fundamentalist use to try

883
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:43,830
and discredit evolution,
the big bang is nonsense because they're

884
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,610
not historical anymore than anything 
else.

885
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,850
They make predictions about observations
that are gonna be made in the future.

886
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,893
And every observation we made about the 
university's consistent only with that 

887
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,480
picture and inconsistent with any other 
ideas.

888
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,363
Yeah.
So you would say the evidence that we 

889
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,770
have for the big bang is as much 
evidence as we have.

890
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:00,940
The dinosaurs existed,
right?

891
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:02,370
It's just a different that we have 
physical.

892
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,843
Moreover,
we have evidence that dinosaurs didn't 

893
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:06,630
exist when humans,
humans exist,

894
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,030
no matter what they show in that is 
wrong,

895
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,790
is that it's easy to say,
yeah,

896
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,690
I've been there.
I would there the day it opened.

897
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:17,080
And how you feel about that.
It was a remarkable experience.

898
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,410
I was there that they opened.
I,

899
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:22,570
I flew to Cincinnati and then into 
Kentucky on the other side.

900
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,404
Where was that morning to lead to be the
keynote speaker at a protest that 

901
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,600
morning.
And then um,

902
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,900
at,
because it is,

903
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,783
it,
it's,

904
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,160
it's that willingness.
The Saturn,

905
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,490
it's child abuse.

906
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,190
The idea is okay,
they believe something and,

907
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,450
and therefore they don't want kids to 
know what really happened.

908
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,943
They don't want kids to know that 
evolution happened because somehow it 

909
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:45,284
might reduce their faith in God.
And so the idea that you want your kids 

910
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:53,630
to not know how the universe works 
because for fear that the loser faith is

911
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:56,750
no different than the Taliban when they 
won't teach the kids anything but,

912
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,440
but memorizing the Koran and,
and,

913
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,900
and so it's,
it's worse than ignorance.

914
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:03,390
It's,
it's,

915
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,840
it's child abuse.
So W,

916
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,980
so I went there and protested and then I
actually,

917
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,143
I had credentials,
I was a commentator for NPR and I went 

918
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:13,880
up to the right afterwards and they 
recognize me and they said,

919
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:14,740
oh,
Professor Kraus,

920
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,640
your credentials didn't arrive.
You can't go into the museum.

921
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,140
So I said,
that's okay.

922
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:18,974
I happen to have a crew from pbs and,
and BBC are that are following me right 

923
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:22,610
now.

924
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,740
Do you mind if they filmed me not being 
allowed in the museum?

925
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,470
And then I got,
I got a tour by at that time,

926
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:28,910
the vice president of museum.
And it was,

927
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,530
it was,
it was shocking.

928
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:32,210
It's an amazing.
They do a bait and switch.

929
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,410
It was amazing.
And um,

930
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,603
uh,
they start out quite upfront in saying 

931
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,930
reason and faith.
They brought it in the front door,

932
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,813
reason to faith why should,
and they point out that the two are 

933
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,620
different and then they,
and they,

934
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:45,920
and they,
and they are,

935
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:47,690
you should believe in reason,
you should believe in faith.

936
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,524
And then,
and then they halfway through the 

937
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,740
museum,
they make it seem like a natural history

938
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:54,290
museum.
So they do this bait and switch and uh,

939
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,483
but the,
but it's hysterical because they have 

940
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:58,970
the garden of Eden With Adam and eve 
both politically correct.

941
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,120
Adam is in grass up to here and eve has 
hair down to their,

942
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,070
but they have dinosaurs,
you know,

943
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:06,640
in the garden of Eden of course.
And they trying to source wrecks,

944
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:07,430
you know,
is there,

945
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,263
it's got sharp teeth.
Why everything was a vegetarian in the 

946
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,300
garden of Eden.
You may not have realized that but,

947
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,183
but if you go to the museum will 
discover that and it's so they could 

948
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:16,334
open pineapples so they could eat.
That's why the tyrannosaurs rex had 

949
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:19,790
sharp teeth.
Wow.

950
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,370
You know,
I knew I was going to learn something.

951
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,290
There you go with you here today.
I'm glad that that will end up being.

952
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:24,800
All right.
We will.

953
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,150
We only have a couple minutes left.
I'm curious,

954
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,380
do you find that you have colleagues 
that believe in everything that you just

955
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:31,270
said there are,
you know,

956
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,380
everything that we've talked about,
the,

957
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,880
the ideas of everything you've said,
but at the same time,

958
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,310
are there some people that do take the 
leap of faith?

959
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,170
Oh,
sure.

960
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,060
Then believe in things that aren't 
quantifiable at the same time.

961
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:41,960
Yeah.
For the first,

962
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,950
by the way we should say as scientists,
we should never use the word belief.

963
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,951
I know.
No,

964
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,300
I mean,
I mean it's just.

965
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,233
I fall into that trap to believing is 
not part of science is is it likely or 

966
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:53,570
unlikely,
and that's the question.

967
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,453
Yeah,
but of course their religious 

968
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,930
scientists,
but as I like to say,

969
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:58,430
there are scientists who are 
Republicans.

970
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:00,950
I mean the scientists,
believe it or not,

971
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:01,784
are human beings and human beings are in
some sense hardwired to believe to 

972
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:07,240
mutually inconsistent things.
At the same time,

973
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,030
I often say that we all have to believe 
in impossible things before breakfast.

974
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,640
Just to get up in the morning,
you have to believe you like your job or

975
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:14,474
your spouse or whatever.
Yet we all invent stories to go by and 

976
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,040
so,
uh,

977
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:19,923
there are scientists religious as long 
as they don't let that religious faith 

978
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,033
interfere with their work,
it doesn't matter and the good 

979
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,490
scientists so that way,
but,

980
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,780
but,
but the,

981
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,093
making the claim that there are 
scientists who are religious does not 

982
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,110
mean that they're compatible.

983
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,360
Neither does making the claim that 
science derives from religion because it

984
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:40,120
does,
I mean,

985
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,953
but in the history of West,
at least all of universities were once 

986
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,150
religious institutions because as I like
to say,

987
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:49,003
the 17th century,
the church was the national science 

988
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:54,150
foundation was the only plate.
If you want it to get money,

989
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,280
then that was the place to get it if you
want it to support your ideas.

990
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:00,450
So it's not too surprising that science 
grew of religion.

991
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:01,284
But as I also like to say and again to 
plugged set in the APP and to say it in 

992
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:07,260
the new book,
that children often move away from their

993
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:08,071
parents.
Okay.

994
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,470
And so,
so talking about the background does not

995
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:15,270
mean that that science and religion are 
compatible because they're not there.

996
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,143
They're not compatible in the sense of 
being compatible with the specific 

997
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,124
doctrines of the world's great religions
sciences and incompatible with a vague 

998
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,870
notion that there might be purposed to 
the university.

999
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,800
There is no evidence of it whatsoever,
and there's no need for a god.

1000
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:29,634
As I showed in my last book,
there's no need for even supernatural 

1001
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:35,870
stuff to create a whole universe,
but science can't disprove the notion of

1002
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,680
some vague datey.
Okay,

1003
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,663
but what I can say is,
you know the earth didn't stop when 

1004
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:41,064
someone blew a trumpet and there wasn't 
a virgin birth and all of those things 

1005
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,050
that's incompatible with what we know 
about the universe.

1006
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,043
All right?
We have two minutes left is one thing 

1007
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:55,010
that people aren't thinking about,
that you were a theoretical physicist.

1008
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,050
You're thinking of something on a day to
day basis that the average person is not

1009
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,180
thinking about.
Give me something that we.

1010
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:05,640
Shots of things that we should be 
thinking about that we're not.

1011
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:06,870
Well,
I don't know whether we should,

1012
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:11,871
but something something fun is that the 
m is the future of the universe.

1013
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,650
Is is different than we might believe it
might be.

1014
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:17,783
In fact,
we may be living at a very special time 

1015
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:21,270
in the history of the universe.
And,

1016
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,290
and,
uh,

1017
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,123
when it turns out that what we've just 
discovered about the Higgs Boson tells 

1018
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:30,450
us that everything we see in the 
universe may be unstable,

1019
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:33,930
that that matter as we know it could not
immediately.

1020
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:36,150
So don't go ahead and sell your stocks 
or anything,

1021
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,283
but that in the far future that not only
we know the rest of the universe will 

1022
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:41,664
disappear because it's already expanding
away from us faster than the speed of 

1023
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:44,724
light.
At least it's receding from us faster 

1024
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:47,680
than the speed of light.
So the and,

1025
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,573
and so the longer we wait,
the less we'll we'll be able to see if 

1026
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:51,744
the universe.
But it turns out that like an icicle on 

1027
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:55,224
a window or on ice crystal on a window 
and a summer morning will eventually 

1028
00:46:58,201 --> 00:46:59,034
melt.

1029
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,593
The Higgs field that is allowing 
everything we now see to exist could 

1030
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,570
eventually melt in a different kind of 
way.

1031
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,493
And if it does,
then matter as we know it will 

1032
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:09,264
disappear.
So we should enjoy our brief moment in 

1033
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:13,890
the sun so it's not going to happen 
tomorrow.

1034
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,370
No,
we're on the hairy edge of it.

1035
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,273
It may never happen and we,
what we're trying to discover at the 

1036
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:22,050
large Hadron collider is will it 
happened,

1037
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,360
uh,
or,

1038
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,650
or might it happen?
But even if it was,

1039
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:27,840
we know it's not gonna happen for a heck
of a long time,

1040
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:32,740
so there's time to try and make sure we 
keep the present world working,

1041
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,813
which means we have to vote responsibly 
and ask yourself quit when you hear 

1042
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,800
something on TV.
It as,

1043
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,450
as a former publisher of the New York 
Times said,

1044
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:44,284
and I use as my mantra.
I like to keep an open mind but not so 

1045
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:49,870
open to my brains fall out.
Alright,

1046
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,733
well that's a perfect ending.
I hope you'll come back in March when 

1047
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:53,940
you do a proper press tour and.
Okay,

1048
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,120
that'll be fine then I can promote you 
again.

1049
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,910
Yeah.
Yeah,

1050
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,840
it's true.
It's good.

1051
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,250
And it sometimes works it occasionally 
or.

1052
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,111
All right.
Well,

1053
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:02,944
for more on Lawrence's work working,
there is a ton of it and he's written a 

1054
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:07,200
gajillion books.
I will put the link down to,

1055
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:08,034
uh,
to the new book right below a checkout 

1056
