1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,973
Alright everybody,
I'm doing something a little different 

2
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:10,540
with the direct message this week.
I'm actually in the suburbs of DC at the

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,850
moment.
You can probably hear the Cicadas in the

4
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:14,430
background.
Uh,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,303
I wanted to do a direct message about 
the RNC and everything that's going on 

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,194
in Cleveland right now.
But then last night you all have heard 

7
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:23,584
this already.
Milo Yiannopoulos was officially banned 

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,730
for all time for the rest of human 
existence.

9
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,890
He was banned on twitter.
You know,

10
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:36,490
he had lost his blue verification check 
a back A.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,210
Obviously Milo and I,
we become sort of comrades were friends.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,190
Uh,
we don't agree on everything.

13
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,024
I've brought him on the show twice and 
we've done a couple of other things 

14
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,180
where we've had a healthy exchange of 
ideas.

15
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:50,590
We've gone to ucla together where we 
were protesting for exercising our right

16
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,424
to free speech.
I've gone out of my way to show some of 

17
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,900
the differences that I have with Milo,
for example.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,733
I always make the distinction between 
the doctrine of Islam and the various 

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,863
people that are of Muslim faith who 
practice their faith completely 

20
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:07,090
differently.
Some totally nominally and some that are

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,163
violent jihadists.
All of the different things that are in 

22
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:10,534
there right now.
Milo was banned from twitter and there 

23
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:16,090
is a free speech issue here and as you 
guys know,

24
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,670
I'm all about free speech and the free 
exchange of ideas.

25
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,920
So first off,
this is not a first amendment issue.

26
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,754
The First Amendment of the United States
means the government can come through 

27
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:25,210
your for,
for your free speech.

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,810
I've said many times before at the 
moment in 2016 in America,

29
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,330
I'm not that afraid that the 
government's coming from my free speech.

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,463
I think we're taking it from ourselves 
and I think this is a good example of 

31
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:35,801
it.
You know,

32
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,530
twitter and facebook and snapchat and 
the rest of these things,

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,693
they become almost too powerful in their
ability to control speech because these 

34
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,370
are now the roadways,
right?

35
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,203
These are the super highways for us to 
communicate with each other beyond our 

36
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,074
ability to pick up the phone and call a 
friend and talk to people on the street 

37
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,804
and scream from town square.
Our ability to communicate with 

38
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,714
literally thousands and thousands and in
Myeloma case hundreds of thousands if 

39
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:04,570
not millions of people on these 
platforms.

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,703
It's hugely powerful and there is 
something that's happening right now 

41
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:10,930
where it's not necessary about the 
government,

42
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,280
but it's about companies now.
Look,

43
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,140
they have,
they're a private company.

44
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,430
They're publicly traded reit,
but they,

45
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,280
they are allowed to instill their own 
terms of service,

46
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:20,470
which they did.
And if they say he violated them,

47
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,020
then yes,
they can ban him.

48
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,300
So I'm not saying twitter can't do what 
they did.

49
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:28,450
I'm not saying the government is 
involved in this in any way.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,313
I'm just talking about the principles of
the free exchange of ideas and free 

51
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:32,950
speech.

52
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,780
These things are under threat right now.
Look,

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,710
obviously,
look,

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,520
forget the nitty gritty details of what 
happened in the last day or so.

55
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:42,280
I'm not even fully aware of what 
happened and there's a lot of tweets.

56
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:46,120
I can't follow everybody's tweets every 
second to see exactly what happened.

57
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,403
Um,
but the point is that Milo is a 

58
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:50,224
provocateur.
He intentionally shit posts and gets 

59
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:55,810
people riled up and look,
some people respond to that.

60
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,630
And some people will respond to us 
something a little more nuanced,

61
00:02:58,631 --> 00:02:59,464
right,
like might do and get into an idea a 

62
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,860
little bit differently.
But the point is,

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,410
you know,
on twitter there are all kinds of Nazis.

64
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,244
Look,
look at the responses that Ben Shapiro 

65
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,183
Milo,
who has fought with Ben Shapiro all the 

66
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,590
time and I was trying to moderate a 
debate with them.

67
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,020
I hope it's still gonna happen.
Ben Shapiro,

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,020
who was an orthodox Jew post anything on
twitter,

69
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:22,021
he gets a zillion Nazis photoshopping 
his head in ovens and horrific picked,

70
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,190
put picturing him in Auschwitz.

71
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,023
All kinds of horrible stuff.
Muslim people get all kinds of horrible 

72
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,770
imagery shown to them.
Gay People,

73
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,693
people young.
I get fag and Jus bag and rob about all 

74
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,430
the time.
My book,

75
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,293
this is,
they're exercising their free speech if 

76
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:43,540
these people are not calling directly 
for violence or acted on violence.

77
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,880
As far as I know,
Milo has never called to harm anybody.

78
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,520
He's never directly called for violence 
in any way.

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,120
He's a provocateur,
sharing his thoughts.

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,370
Uh,
and we have to understand the difference

81
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:56,800
between words and actions,
right?

82
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,634
Like just somebody sitting in their 
basement sharing a Nazi meme and Milo 

83
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,764
saying this or that.
Even if it's directed at a person 

84
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,861
saying,
well,

85
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,360
I don't like what you're doing to the 
girl,

86
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,253
the girl in ghostbusters,
or I didn't like the movie or whatever 

87
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,464
it is,
and then he can't control whether his 

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,673
people say mean things to her,
but that's what the mute button for and 

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,470
that's what the block buttons for the 
point is.

90
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,303
We have to figure out how to have a 
healthy exchange of ideas and realize 

91
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,494
that not everything that that happens.
I met online world is transferred 

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,080
directly into the real world.
If real people started using.

93
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,530
If people start,
if a Nazi party appeared and said,

94
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,170
started saying we're going to kill all 
the Jews were going to kill all Muslims,

95
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,120
all of this stuff.
Then you have a problem,

96
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,780
a direct call for violence,
but right now that's not where we're at.

97
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,900
And there's an issue here.
So there's a couple issues here,

98
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,793
but to me the primary issue is the power
that these social media companies have 

99
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,740
and we can't pretend that they don't 
have a political agenda,

100
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,430
right?
These are all pretty left organization,

101
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:57,264
so of course they're really not going to
like a guy like my look because it's 

102
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,450
easy always to attach style,
attack,

103
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,970
stodgy old conservatives and 
Republicans.

104
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,803
Milo represents something different.
He's young and cool and gay and British 

105
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,650
and blonde and has this huge groundswell
of support.

106
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,813
By the way,
it's his support is from conservatives 

107
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,090
and liberals and all sorts of other 
things.

108
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:18,160
I know that because when I went to Ucla 
with him,

109
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,430
I had liberals in the audience,
kids college,

110
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,300
kids from Ucla saying that they don't 
agree with anything he says,

111
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,310
but they were there to defend his right 
to free speech.

112
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,720
So that strikes me a little bit of a 
what Obiwan said to Darth Vader,

113
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,823
if you strike me down,
I'll become more powerful than you can 

114
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,660
possibly imagine by striking him down 
here and banning him from twitter.

115
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:40,510
They're probably making this movement 
that much stronger.

116
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,310
Anyway,
it's.

117
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,140
It's complex and there's a lot of things
here.

118
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,093
I would love to talk to someone from 
facebook about this because they band a 

119
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,094
couple of people just in the last week 
they banned my friend Feisal and my 

120
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,670
friend Melissa,
both who'd been on the show,

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,410
there'll be reinstated sense.

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,540
I would love to talk to Jack from 
twitter.

123
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,860
I'd love to talk to any of these tech 
people.

124
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,900
So they're welcome to come on the show.
Uh,

125
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,070
I'm not trying to inflame anything any 
further.

126
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,904
I,
I genuinely want to have this 

127
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,140
conversation.
Uh,

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,993
and by the way right now you can go on 
twitter and you can check Ayatollah 

129
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,660
Khomeini,
his twitter account.

130
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,670
He regularly calls for another 
Holocaust.

131
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,340
You can see what's going on with the 
president of Turkey,

132
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:18,110
who right now in the midst of literally 
just just assembling democracy there and

133
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,150
arresting protestors and sacking judges 
and not letting people leave the country

134
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:23,870
because they have no problem with him 
being on there.

135
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,210
So there's just,
there's an inconsistency in the way they

136
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,040
apply these rules.
It's just a lot of stuff here.

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,960
But let's try to have a mature 
discussion about it.

138
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,690
And my guest this week,
uh,

139
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,524
so as I said,
we normally do this from the studio in 

140
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:35,990
Los Angeles.

141
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm in DC right now.
My guest this week is Michael Ian,

142
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,800
black comedian,
actor,

143
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
writer,
great guy.

144
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,903
He is a big in fighting you controls and
we have a really interesting discussion 

145
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,460
about fighting trolls and twitter Nazis.
We talk about Milo now.

146
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,460
We shot this last week,
so everything that you're going to see a

147
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,270
is not about what happened,
uh,

148
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,270
yesterday and today we shot it last 
week,

149
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,850
but it's a great discussion about these 
very issues.

150
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,800
So the timing is perfect,
uh,

151
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,890
and I appreciate it and I'll be back in 
studio soon enough.

152
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,840
And as always,
thank you guys for your support.

153
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,733
Here we go.

154
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,540
My guest this week is a comedian and 
author,

155
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,650
an actor and a twitter Nazi hunter.
Michael Ian Black.

156
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:19,970
Welcome to the show.
Thank you.

157
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,700
Which one of those would you say you 
mostly are?

158
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,350
Is it twitter,
Nazi hunter,

159
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:26,000
or comedian?
Probably twitter.

160
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,040
Nazi hunter,
yeah.

161
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,493
Uh,

162
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,700
yeah,
because I'm not particularly funny these

163
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,533
days on twitter.
I'm just annoying you are fighting the 

164
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:39,331
Nazis constantly on twitter.
And my policy with the Nazis is,

165
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,703
congratulations,
you guys came up with a meme and you're 

166
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:48,691
alone in your basement,
but you liked engaging these people or I

167
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,280
don't know if you'd like it,
I don't want to put words in it,

168
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,020
but you do engage with these people.
I think it's,

169
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,913
uh,
I think it's valuable and important to 

170
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:57,170
engage these people.
Yeah.

171
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,503
Because I think it's worth to the larger
public knowing that they're out there 

172
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,110
knowing that there is this a sub 
subculture.

173
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
I don't even know how large it is.
I'm assuming it's very small.

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,440
It's like sub so,
but they are very vocal and uh,

175
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,230
my sense is there are

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,513
uh,

177
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,703
more sympathizers than a actual 
participants and so I feel sort of duty 

178
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,490
bound to hold to hold them up as idiots 
so that,

179
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,920
those who may be inclined to sympathize 
though.

180
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:34,970
Oh wait,
they're idiots.

181
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,680
Yeah,
they're always anonymous too.

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,850
Are you ever finding a Nazi that's like,
hi,

183
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:40,621
I'm a Nazi,
you know,

184
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,590
this is my real picture

185
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,310
new.
It's always,

186
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,144
uh,
it's always either some pre pubescent 

187
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,050
Japanese anime Avatar or some repurposed
like Hitler Youth Avatar.

188
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,370
Right.
What do you make of the Japanese

189
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,203
anime thing with related to that,
because I don't think there's any 

190
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,840
connections between Japanese and there.
No,

191
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,693
not between a Japanese anime and Hitler,
but there's absolutely some kind of 

192
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:09,180
connection between,
uh,

193
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,043
those who would move towards that 
ideology and fetishizing pre pubescent 

194
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:14,874
Japanese girls.
There's actually a connection there and 

195
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,023
I'll leave it to brighter minds than 
mine to try to tie those two things 

196
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,590
together.
But that absolutely exists.

197
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,603
You're just exposing them and now it's 
for the social scientists that's trying 

198
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,843
to figure out that you.
Are you ever afraid that sometimes that 

199
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,394
by fighting with them that it's almost 
like elevating their relevance because 

200
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,710
that's a little bit of not fighting with
them,

201
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:39,390
but by exposing them and arguing,
there's absolutely a case to be made for

202
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:41,430
that.
And uh,

203
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,923
but I think it's,
I think it's more important from my 

204
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:51,060
point of view to show that they're there
to just say,

205
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:51,960
look,
this is,

206
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,853
this is who we're living among.
And in the context of the current 

207
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,974
political climate,
I think it's important to let people 

208
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:03,720
know that these people exist and that,
uh

209
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,823
hmm.

210
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,410
Given the right circumstances,
more of them could pop up.

211
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,330
Yeah.
Now I take it you're not against.

212
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:12,680
You wouldn't be for banning them.
Right?

213
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:13,940
Like you're just,
you're exposing them,

214
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:15,640
but you wish you would let them do their
job.

215
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,580
What you do.
That's,

216
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,650
that's why we have a first amendment.
Yeah.

217
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,270
Alright,
good.

218
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,400
Um,
so,

219
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,270
and I don't report them.
I don't do any of that shit.

220
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,530
Yeah,
I just,

221
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
I,
I just showed them.

222
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,573
Yeah.
So let's back up to the first thing you 

223
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:30,140
said,
which is I used to be flooding.

224
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:31,360
Is that what you said?
I used to be funny,

225
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,080
right?
I am not.

226
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah,
just annoying.

227
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,883
Yeah.
So I feel that since I've been doing 

228
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:38,720
this,
I mean I did stand up and 12,

229
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,350
12 years in New York and a couple years 
out here I used to be funny.

230
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,483
I was,
I mean I can get you some letters to 

231
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,790
show you later.
I was funny at one time,

232
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,490
but now I'm talking about all these 
serious stuff all the time and I like to

233
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,950
try to pepper some comedy in there when 
I can.

234
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,903
But there's,
the world just feels particularly crazy 

235
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:55,250
right now,
doesn't it?

236
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Which should be ideal for comedy,
right?

237
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,243
But I'm not,
I'm not good at making light of things 

238
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:03,980
that I find deadly serious and I'm just 
not good at it.

239
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:04,814
I mean there's,
there's great political comedians out 

240
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,200
there and I'm not one of them.
Yeah.

241
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,960
I can talk about my own life,
I think in a funny way,

242
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:15,350
but I can't.
I mean there's,

243
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,430
there's,
there's people better able to talk about

244
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:23,300
trump and be hilarious than me.
So we'll get to trump in a second.

245
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,410
So,
um,

246
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,783
you,
I always think of you more so as or 

247
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,273
until the last year or so.
I always thought it'd be more as like 

248
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:32,090
social commentary,
all the bad stuff,

249
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,073
all that stuff.
And a lot of the movies you've been in 

250
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,530
seward,
more like personal social commentary.

251
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,200
Did you ever think you were going to be 
more in the political sphere?

252
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:40,970
Because that's sort of where I put you 
now.

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,860
Well,
I mean,

254
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,693
I don't,
not that insert myself in the political 

255
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:45,470
sphere now.
I mean the last thing the world needs is

256
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,020
another jerk off community spouting off 
about politics.

257
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,540
I don't,
I don't aspire to be that person,

258
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,213
but if I can set aside being a comedian 
and just be a citizen who's interested 

259
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,270
in this stuff,
that's sort of how I view myself.

260
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,250
I mean I.
I definitely am not.

261
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not an activist.
I'm not marching.

262
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,523
I take no action.
I do nothing other than I have this 

263
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:11,260
twitter platform and that's,
that's how I express myself politically.

264
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,130
You do tweet while flying first class 
because that's the first time we had any

265
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,233
face to face interaction.
I was going to go away in the back and 

266
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:22,090
you sort of dismissively wave as it was 
very.

267
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,930
It was embarrassing for both of us as a 
first class.

268
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:26,764
I've only flown first class once and it 
was on a little plane from Detroit to 

269
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,694
New York,
so it was like eight people and I was 

270
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,700
first class was just that.
I was in the first seat.

271
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,130
It wasn't anything special,
but as a first class,

272
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,750
are you.
Do you feel that we shouldn't be allowed

273
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:38,584
to look at you?
I always feel like when I'm walking 

274
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,650
through I shouldn't be allowed to learn 
misunderstanding part.

275
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,330
Maybe the main Julia first class which 
were seated first.

276
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,860
Yeah,
so that.

277
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,723
So you,
the people walking back are forced to 

278
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:55,291
look at us already ensconced in our 
blanket already ordering our beverage of

279
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,330
choice.
Maybe you're already asleep.

280
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,793
Maybe getting massaged from the chair.
Like there's all kinds of things that 

281
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:07,930
it's important for the business model of
the airlines and for my own self esteem,

282
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:11,740
they walking back to steroids that I 
have that you do not.

283
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,843
That's interesting because I always 
thought they should be one way glass so 

284
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:19,060
that you could lock it us,
but that we have no desire to see you.

285
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,620
Yeah.
You don't exist for me.

286
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,690
Very much exist for you.
Wow.

287
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,190
You're thinking about those fuckers in 
first class while you're crammed in.

288
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,050
Starting little seat stewing for the 
duration of your flight on that jet blue

289
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:32,890
flight though.
Jet Blue,

290
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,000
let's you get your own soda.

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,833
You know you can go to like a thing and 
I was almost going to peek around the 

292
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:38,620
curtain and just like,
oh,

293
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,300
they would know.
Or did you out?

294
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,163
Yeah,
and I know you would've called people 

295
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,640
and it would,
it would've been,

296
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,430
they would've landed us in Salt Lake 
City or something.

297
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,270
It would've been,
it would've been a disaster.

298
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,223
I'm glad you didn't do that.
I'm glad you had the foresight to know 

299
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,560
better than to do that.
Can Get.

300
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,120
You would have been escorted out 
immediately.

301
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,530
Well,
speaking of social,

302
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,543
full pause.
Let's move over to trump because you 

303
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:59,290
have written a children's book about 
trump.

304
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,580
Yes.
So you must love trump.

305
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:05,540
I assume if you wrote a children's,
everyone loved children's books and um,

306
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,670
here's my problem.
Despise trump wrote a book about trump,

307
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,070
uh,
a sort of

308
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,153
a

309
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,260
kind of a children's book,
a parody of a children's book,

310
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,730
but it was a children's book at the same
time.

311
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,073
Um,

312
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,290
so I am exploiting the trump brand as 
much as an actual trump and making money

313
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,660
off the trump brand.
So I don't know.

314
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,663
So you're using it right?
You're using a trumpy and tactics on 

315
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,220
trump.
That's right,

316
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,133
yeah.
Where did the idea to make it a 

317
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:44,370
children's book come from?
Uh,

318
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,204
I was at a bookstore and I saw a book 
about Hillary Clinton as sort of a 

319
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,903
children's book,
a rags to riches story about Hillary 

320
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,940
Clinton,
and an inspirational tale started,

321
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:55,774
I think at young girls,
and it made me chuckle a bit to think 

322
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:01,424
about what that would be like if you 
were to write about trump because he's 

323
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,100
not an inspirational figure in any way,
shape or form.

324
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,680
He's just a toad.
And so,

325
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,180
uh,
I,

326
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,580
I just thought level,
let me try to do that.

327
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,520
So He's a toad.
Is that why they're used?

328
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:16,760
You know,
that toad thing?

329
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,181
Yeah,
yeah,

330
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,290
yeah.
Where did that come from?

331
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,320
I Know Kiki or.
Yeah.

332
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,310
I don't know where there's a toad with 
trump hair,

333
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,010
but there's a lot of toads.
Yeah.

334
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,930
On that,
on that part of the Internet,

335
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,090
they,
what's with the Pto?

336
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,030
I don't know.
We don't know.

337
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,260
We have no idea.
I don't know.

338
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,840
It took me long enough to figure out 
what the three parentheses meant.

339
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,280
Wait,
wait.

340
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,540
So the two?
No,

341
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,030
it's three Jewish three.
Yeah,

342
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:38,661
it's,
it's.

343
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,470
Yeah.
I see.

344
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,280
Oh,
because they came.

345
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,113
There were some list or something that 
was exposed where they tried to expose 

346
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,650
people to something like that came 
later.

347
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,730
The,
the uh,

348
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,000
the three parentheses is meant to 
indicate an echo,

349
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,450
right?
Uh,

350
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,590
and it's like the Jewish Echo.
I'm not sure quite what that means,

351
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,020
but that's what the three parentheses 
are meant to indicate.

352
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,940
Is that just that,
like a nagging mother?

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,190
I don't think so.
I think it's something worse.

354
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,540
Oh,
I think it's far worse than that.

355
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,793
I'm a.
and then there was an app that just 

356
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,670
identified Jews for you.
Right?

357
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,680
I don't know.
It's insane.

358
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,693
Yeah.
So what do you make of just the general 

359
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,820
climate right now?
Because to me,

360
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,340
I've been off until this show and we did
one more.

361
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,310
We'd launched relaunched last week and 
uh,

362
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,530
for the three weeks that I took off,
so to speak,

363
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,230
you can see the world not the world was.
I was paying attention.

364
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,490
I just didn't have a show to talk about 
it.

365
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:30,920
And it seems like the world went even 
more crazy.

366
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,190
Don't you think the last month seems 
like particularly nuts,

367
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:36,450
you know,
sort of starting probably with the pulse

368
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:37,770
shooting and then,
I mean,

369
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,140
I wouldn't say I'm,
I'm,

370
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,063
I'm,
I'm past the point of being surprised 

371
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,090
that anything is happening.
Yeah,

372
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,410
it all feels of a piece to me and I feel
like I can kind of grasp the outlines of

373
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:49,244
what that piece is,
which is the larger story is sort of 

374
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:56,890
what,
what is,

375
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,780
what is fueling all of this.
Um,

376
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,600
and I think there's an,
I look,

377
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:02,434
I'm,
I'm,

378
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,350
I'm not particularly savvy about this.
I'm just regurgitating what I've read,

379
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,184
but it really does feel like we're at a 
moment where the foundations of 

380
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:18,864
capitalism are,
are crumpling and nobody knows what to 

381
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,314
do.
So is that the scary part that nobody 

382
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:29,220
knows what to because I,
I agree.

383
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:30,054
It feels like something that there's a 
real shift happening right now and it's 

384
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:35,184
almost like we have no leaders when,
where even if you love trump and if you 

385
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:41,310
have loved Clinton and Obama is on the 
way out,

386
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,144
but even if you love him,
that we don't have leaders who talk to 

387
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:47,280
us in an honest way and that that's part
of the problem.

388
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:50,070
Like we're all walking around like,
could somebody,

389
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,480
like,
I feel like everyone's looking around.

390
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,590
Somebody help here.
Is there anyone we could look to for.

391
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,373
First of all,
I don't think trump understands the 

392
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,340
problem better than the relative,
the average citizen.

393
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,050
Uh,
he knows how to exploit it,

394
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,420
but he'd,
I don't think he understands it,

395
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,130
but I agree with you that there is not,
knows,

396
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,973
sort of global leader has stepped 
forward in a articulate non 

397
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:19,840
condescending way to say this is what 
we're going through.

398
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,433
Um,
and here's where I think we need to 

399
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:24,304
move.
It would be great if somebody would do 

400
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:27,790
that.
I'd love for Hillary Clinton to spend an

401
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,880
hour just talking into the camera and 
saying,

402
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,580
this is where I think we are.
This is why I think we're here.

403
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,150
This is where I think we need to go in a
very mature,

404
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,270
not alarmist way.
Are you a hillary supporter?

405
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,433
I mean,
I think I have the enthusiasm for 

406
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,290
Hillary that a lot of people have,
which is.

407
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,613
Yeah,
I could just picture the gift right 

408
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,421
there.
I said,

409
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:49,000
are you a hillary supporter the other 
way you got?

410
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,720
Because that's what everyone does.
No one's like,

411
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,680
there's very,
very.

412
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:54,230
I know there's a couple,
but everyone supporting hillary,

413
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,780
my friends that had been democrats their
whole life and family members.

414
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,733
Are you supporting hillary?

415
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,790
Well,
but there's good reason for that.

416
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,290
It was easy to gin up that enthusiasm 
for Obama because as he himself said,

417
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:11,110
he was a blank slate.
Hillary has a 20 5:30

418
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:11,944
year record and it's very easy to cherry
pick what you like and Cherry pick what 

419
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:20,230
you don't like and say she's a villain.
Say she's a hero.

420
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,900
She's a flawed human being as we all 
are,

421
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,580
and we know what our flaws are.
So it's like,

422
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:28,650
you know,
it's,

423
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,483
it's,
it's like getting back together with an 

424
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,810
old girlfriend or something.
And you're like,

425
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,920
no,
I still love her.

426
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,913
Right.
You know,

427
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,873
I know,
I know it's going to be a pain in the 

428
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:39,880
ass.
God Damn it.

429
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,890
I still love her.
Uh,

430
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,210
that's Kinda what it's like.

431
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,670
So is that a little.
That's kind of dangerous thought though,

432
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:48,610
because Obama came in with the blank 
slate and whether you like him or not,

433
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,693
uh,
the idea that we'd only be okay with 

434
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:51,574
blank slate.
That's what sets the appeal of trump 

435
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:53,794
right now.
Yeah.

436
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:54,843
Um,
even though his sleep actually is full 

437
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:58,780
of stuff again,
whether you like it or not.

438
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,150
Well it's full of political stuff.
Yeah.

439
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,310
So he,
you know,

440
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,480
one hand races,
what the other hand wrote,

441
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,103
he can be whatever you want him to be as
long as he's a racist because that's 

442
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,680
ultimately what people want from him.

443
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,850
So what do you make of the people?
And I get this part,

444
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:16,550
here's my part of trump that I do 
actually get,

445
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,060
forget all the policies for a second,
but I do get the part about,

446
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,310
forget the policies because they were.
Because they're all over the place.

447
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:23,180
Right.
And I've even had,

448
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,480
I've had ardent trump supporters sit 
here like Milo Yiannopoulos,

449
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,450
sit here and basically tell me it's not 
about the policies,

450
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:30,284
it's about this one thing that I'm going
to tell you and I at least get this 

451
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:33,794
part,
which is that this is a cultural 

452
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,560
election this time,
it has almost nothing to do with policy.

453
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,930
But the one thing that he's getting with
people,

454
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:42,764
and I've seen this when I've been to 
colleges when liberals are coming up to 

455
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,124
me and saying this,
that he's cracking this political 

456
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,050
correctness thing.
Now.

457
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,943
The irony of that is I don't think he's 
going to be some major free speech 

458
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,420
beacon because he talks about suing 
reporters all the time,

459
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,853
but at that.
But I do get the level of people are 

460
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:03,400
feeling very repressed right now.
Like they can't say anything and they're

461
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,890
always screamed at in called racist and 
all that stuff.

462
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,360
But I don't think you're with me out of 
that.

463
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,320
Not at all.
Yeah.

464
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,483
I think

465
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,930
when Milo talks about political 
correctness,

466
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,150
that term political correctness has come
to mean,

467
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,440
I think in those circles,
um,

468
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,100
nativism,
racism,

469
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,750
xenophobia,
and what have you,

470
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,290
when you say he's cracked political 
correctness,

471
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,480
what he's,
what he's cracked is the,

472
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,400
the agreement that we had been coming to
as a society,

473
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,070
and that agreement was,
um,

474
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,003
diversity is a benefit to the nation,
and tolerance is a benefit to the 

475
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,220
nation,
uh,

476
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,113
and having different points of view is a
benefit to the nation that has all 

477
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:02,224
gotten lumped into that agreement has 
gotten lumped under political 

478
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:05,704
correctness.
And when he says he's cracked political 

479
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:10,970
correctness,
what he's,

480
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,953
what I think he means is he has,
he's attempting to unravel that 

481
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:20,141
agreement.
And what's left is white nationalism and

482
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:22,230
nothing else.
No,

483
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,340
because trump's appeal is not policy 
based.

484
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:31,780
He has none.
It's not judgement based.

485
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,430
He seems to have no better judgment than
anybody else in possibly worse.

486
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,550
It's not principle base.
He has none.

487
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,680
It's not character based.
He has very little to none.

488
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,790
All he has is on day one starting with 
Mexicans are rapists and whatever else.

489
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:55,801
He said that's what he has and he's 
built on that from that spent his entire

490
00:22:56,681 --> 00:23:01,681
campaign has been a divisiveness and 
hatred geared towards angry white males.

491
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,051
Yeah.
Well,

492
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:05,884
I love,
I love hearing your answer on that 

493
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:08,130
because obviously I've,
I love,

494
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,380
I like Milo and I've given him a 
platform and you know,

495
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,300
we work together and stuff.
But the whole point of my show is that I

496
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,610
want to hear that and I want to hear 
what you're saying.

497
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,630
Well,
and when I've watched your show,

498
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,360
I've,
I've watched him on it

499
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,980
and you know,
I think he's a disgrace.

500
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,713
I think he's an utter disgrace.
I have a feeling you're going to hear 

501
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,200
from him on twitter.
I very well might,

502
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,610
but he's not verified.
So,

503
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,800
uh,
I know,

504
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,653
so at least it starts there and it feels
very calculated and it feels very 

505
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,040
machiavellian to me and it feels very 
put on and it and it,

506
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,670
uh,

507
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,740
and he is allowing himself to be used,

508
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,910
I think,
as a,

509
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,450
a tool by a,

510
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,790
the intolerant.
Right.

511
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,890
And the fact that he's gay,
for example,

512
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,520
is,
is,

513
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,550
is,
is,

514
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,580
makes it all the more appalling to me,
um,

515
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,230
because he's giving them more license to
say,

516
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:16,310
well,
we like this guy,

517
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,490
you know,
we like this crazy Brit,

518
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,930
this crazy flaming red or whatever.
Um,

519
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,840
and that is,

520
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,840
I think it unconscionable use of moral 
licensing and that he's allowing himself

521
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:33,080
to be used in that way and,
and promoting himself in that way.

522
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,820
Moral licensing.
I like that.

523
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,240
You just come up with that right there.
That that's something somebody said that

524
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,650
before I learned it from Malcolm 
Gladwell.

525
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,071
Oh,
okay.

526
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,720
There you go.
So a moralizing.

527
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,780
So I guess part of this is that our 
system is just so broke that anyone that

528
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:48,374
had a moral license or a moral compass,
would you ever want to run for 

529
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:52,641
president?
I mean,

530
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,380
could you imagine as a,
as a,

531
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,880
as a smart person ever wanting to put 
yourself in politics at all?

532
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,080
No.
No.

533
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,173
Yeah.
Is that the bigger problem here that 

534
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,080
we're just getting,
we're just getting what we've created,

535
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:06,914
right?

536
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,373
Yeah.
I mean,

537
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,940
if you,
if you have any,

538
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,870
if you've,
if you've lived any kind of life,

539
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,120
hemingway,
for example,

540
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,643
whoever those guys could not run for 
office or anybody who's lived a life 

541
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,060
that has any

542
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,470
human experience,
right?

543
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,240
So meaning you might have cheated on 
your wife,

544
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,060
you might,
if you might need some coke.

545
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,010
Sure,
yeah.

546
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,580
He might've done any number of things 
that make us human,

547
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,880
make us flawed human beings.
You know,

548
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,590
that stuff's going to come up.
You know,

549
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:44,390
you're going to be vilified.
You know.

550
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:46,640
So if you're thinking about running for 
office,

551
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,503
somebody like Ted Cruz for example,
who's been thinking about being 

552
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:50,234
president his entire fucking life,
he's lived his life in such a way to 

553
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:58,961
make his resume the resume of a future 
president or at very least a senator.

554
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,890
You're not exaggerating by the way.
There's no video of him at like 16.

555
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,010
So I'm gonna.
I'm gonna be president.

556
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,893
Yeah.
Um,

557
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,120
and so you live your life in a way that 
is calculatedly

558
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,110
unrelatable to the rest of the nation.
You know,

559
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:16,944
someone like Bill Clinton,
who I think probably was running for 

560
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:23,640
president his whole life too,
at least he,

561
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
he wears his humanity on his sleeve.
He's like,

562
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:27,834
I'm,
you know,

563
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,640
I'm just a big goober.
Yeah,

564
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,030
and that's part of his appeal,
but I can't imagine subjecting myself to

565
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:38,220
the kind of public scrutiny that is 
required,

566
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,330
knowing that there's people whose job is
to dig up shit on you,

567
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,193
just about your life.
It has nothing to do with your ability 

568
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,830
to make good policy decisions.
Yeah.

569
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,920
What does it tell you that when a show.
What was the show with Kevin Spacey?

570
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,840
It's been blank,
but how's the cards?

571
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,820
I watch house of cards and I think,
wow,

572
00:26:56,821 --> 00:27:00,900
there's a lot more reality in that then 
anything that I'm watching on CNN,

573
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:01,734
meanwhile,
all the CNN people are pretending to be 

574
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:03,870
themselves.

575
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,681
I hate that.
By the way.

576
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:07,640
Do you wait?
Do you like that bugs me.

577
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,820
Drives me fucking crazy.
I wha.

578
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,273
What movie was I watching just these 
past couple days ago I was watching one 

579
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,424
of the unjust,
some superhero movie and it's like jake 

580
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:19,980
tapper shows every since it was dot who 
I like.

581
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,050
I think it was Jacob.
Like what?

582
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,740
What movie was it?
Superhero movies.

583
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,574
Oh,
Batman.

584
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,080
Batman.
Superman.

585
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,180
I don't know if it was jake actually.
Oh,

586
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,170
it was Anderson Cooper in that when I 
was like,

587
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,240
you guys are all pretending to be 
yourselves.

588
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:33,180
Why can't we have alternate universes 
where there are also,

589
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,750
we can have.
Kryptonite will also have alternate news

590
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,840
casters.
Don't even hit journalist,

591
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:41,970
but journalists don't show up in Batman.
Right.

592
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,490
But doesn't mad show it.
It's like they all want to be stars.

593
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:45,324
So when I say this,
it's probably with some do irony to 

594
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,980
people that are public people and share 
our opinions,

595
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,040
but it's like they all want to be in.
Right?

596
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,720
They go to the White House 
correspondence dinner.

597
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,793
They all want to have dinner with these 
people and go to the parties and all 

598
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,100
that.
That's to me,

599
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:00,720
one of the biggest problems we have in 
the whole country.

600
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,290
Well,
the,

601
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:01,811
the,
the,

602
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:05,400
the political starfucking I guess I 
don't really have a problem with it.

603
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,390
I think

604
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,443
it doesn't,
it doesn't upset me maybe the way that 

605
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:14,981
it upsets you because I do feel like,
like in any profession,

606
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,600
most people in any given profession are 
trying to do a good job.

607
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,983
Um,
so like when I see Anderson Cooper 

608
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:29,354
reporting on something,
I feel like most of the time he's done 

609
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:31,490
pretty good job,
you know,

610
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,080
I think he's pretty good.
Uh,

611
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,350
Chuck Todd who I think can be a little 
supercilious,

612
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,110
but I think he's trying to do a good job
and I think he's doing.

613
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:39,944
I think he,
I think he approaches things the way he 

614
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:42,820
approaches them for very specific 
reason.

615
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,873
It's thought it's thought it's thought 
out jake tapper the same way and you 

616
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,434
know,
these guys will land punches that kind 

617
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,660
of meshing of

618
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,620
politicos and,
and journalists.

619
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,420
It doesn't really upset me because it 
seems like,

620
00:28:58,421 --> 00:28:59,254
well,
if you're a journalist you want to have 

621
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:02,320
relationships with these people to get 
information.

622
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,243
Yeah.
I guess for me the bigger problem is 

623
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:07,810
that if you ask easy questions and look,
I'm an interviewer,

624
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:11,230
so if you ask any questions you're going
to get them to come back.

625
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,243
You know what I mean?
So if I had Obama here one time and I 

626
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:15,094
knew this is the one time that maybe 
we'll set up the rest of our 

627
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:17,824
relationship,
I don't think I would attack him in a 

628
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,374
way that I might the second time,
but even in that that causes a problem 

629
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,850
because then they always go at a press 
conference are always like,

630
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:27,190
Oh guy who I know I get easy questions 
from,

631
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:27,970
you know.
Right.

632
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,120
But there's a way to have that 
conversation.

633
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,253
Have a tough conversation with him or 
with anybody in a way that he doesn't 

634
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:37,430
feel attacked.
You can.

635
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,530
I think most politicians are receptive 
to being asked

636
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,160
tough questions in a respectful way.
I thought Jon Stewart was.

637
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,043
He was a master at that.
Jon Stewart would have any conservative 

638
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,703
on his show.
He would read their book and he would 

639
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,900
grill them about it,
but it was always respectful and I think

640
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,850
as a consequence,
they would come on the show because they

641
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:00,550
knew they would get a fair hearing for 
their ideas.

642
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,150
Then they may end up,
they may have,

643
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,370
they may walk out feeling foolish,
but it's not because of him.

644
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,204
It's because of them.

645
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,570
Yeah.
What do we do,

646
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:10,490
do you think,
to make people smarter?

647
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:11,324
Again,
I keep saying that being smart is now 

648
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:13,994
counter culture.
Culture is dumb right now and when I 

649
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:17,840
meet smart people,
I'm like,

650
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:18,650
thank God.

651
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,900
Culture is gleefully dumb.
That's the problem.

652
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,713
I don't know that as a culture,
we're probably smarter than we've ever 

653
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:26,600
been.
You're right.

654
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,660
There's this attitude that book learning
is somehow anti-american.

655
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,800
Uh,
knowledge is suspect.

656
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,260
Science is political.
It's,

657
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,960
it's very much an up is down,
down is up kind of world.

658
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,570
But I still think that's a,

659
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,080
that's a minority of the,
of,

660
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,900
of the country that really believes 
that.

661
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,370
Yeah.
I,

662
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,203
I firmly believe it's a minority,
but it's the minority that we keep 

663
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:57,290
hearing from.
I mean,

664
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,900
that's what I keep saying to the 
political side.

665
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:02,380
It's like we hear from the crazies on 
the left and we hear from the crazies on

666
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:05,230
the right and I would argue that most 
people,

667
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:06,064
I think really 80 percent of us actually
want pretty decent things and pretty 

668
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,230
similar things.
I think if you're a,

669
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,473
if you're just a regular conservative,
you don't want a world that's very 

670
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:18,430
different from what the average liberal 
really want.

671
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,290
You might have a couple of policies.
So how do we,

672
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,390
how do we get those voices to be heard 
again?

673
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,253
Well,
for one thing I think it's important to 

674
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,560
to for the larger

675
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,030
a national dialogue to state what you 
just stated,

676
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,180
which is true and I would say it's even 
larger than 80 percent.

677
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,960
We all essentially want the same things.
We want safe communities,

678
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,003
we want opportunities for our kids.
We wanted the ability to make a little 

679
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:48,251
money and feel like if we,
to use the tritus political expression,

680
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,040
work hard and play by the rules will get
ahead.

681
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,530
That's basically all people want right 
on,

682
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,423
on both sides.
So if conservatives can agree with that 

683
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,680
statement and Liberals can agree with 
that statement,

684
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:01,514
you go,
fine,

685
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,353
we know where we're going.
It's really just a question of tactics 

686
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,350
on how we get there.
That's where we disagree.

687
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,720
But as long as we keep in mind that the 
goal is the same,

688
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,520
I think we can work together,
but we become so,

689
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:18,730
and this is largely a result of,
of uh,

690
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,180
at the entertainment aspect of 
journalism,

691
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:22,014
we become so polarized because that's 
what drives eyeballs to television 

692
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:24,714
screens is people yelling at each other 
as opposed to people having comity and 

693
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:27,781
being like,
oh yeah,

694
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,670
we agree.
We basically agree,

695
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,480
right?
Yeah.

696
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,580
And that's the irony is people want 
that.

697
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:36,414
I know they want to because they're 
messaging me every day saying that what 

698
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:42,590
I'm here is what they want to see the 
guy that you're important,

699
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,270
you're doing God's work.
We get it.

700
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,740
Dave.
Listen,

701
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,583
if 100 other people were doing this,
I would gladly find something else to 

702
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:50,630
do.
You know what I mean?

703
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:51,464
I really would.
And that would show a good sign that 

704
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,280
some smarter things have had occurred 
here.

705
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,550
Yeah.
That I,

706
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,383
I,
I,

707
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,450
I wrote a book a few years ago with my 
friend,

708
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:00,740
Megan Mckenna.
I wanted to ask you about that.

709
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:01,730
Yeah.
Uh,

710
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,120
and that was essentially the central 
thesis of the book,

711
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,920
which is we all kind of want the same 
things.

712
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,540
We differ on the margins may be a bit 
about guns for example.

713
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,863
Um,
but even then we don't because 

714
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,160
conservatives and liberals both want gun
debts to fall.

715
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,053
Right.
It's just a question of how we get 

716
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:21,794
there.
There's a certain disingenuousness I 

717
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,084
think on the part of the right about how
we get there and in fact entirely 

718
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,070
disingenuousness,
but just from a,

719
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,210
from a purely philosophical point of 
view,

720
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,980
both sides would like to reduce gun 
deaths.

721
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,500
Yeah.
So then it's just how do we get there?

722
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,630
So when you wrote that book,
and that's actually when I had you on my

723
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:45,870
Sirius xm show many lifetimes ago when 
you wrote that,

724
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:48,330
and I think I had megan on maybe the 
next week or something.

725
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,070
Um,
what made you think like,

726
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,933
oh,
I should talk to her because she's 

727
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:52,944
obviously she's in it.
Her Dad's a pretty powerful guy who ran 

728
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:59,290
for president and you know,
she's on the right and I do continue.

729
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,710
I mean,
do you consider yourself on the left?

730
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,470
You just.
Yeah.

731
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,340
So,
uh,

732
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:03,240
what made you think that,
like,

733
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,860
this is the apprentice ears.
You got to do that.

734
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,850
A couple more parentheses.
Yeah,

735
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,570
yeah,
yeah.

736
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,403
What made you think like,
let me talk to her and let's do this 

737
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:13,920
because that was ahead of its.
Yeah,

738
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,500
that was,
that was the reason it was.

739
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,140
She's somebody who I should have very 
little in common with.

740
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,003
Let's go on the road together and write 
a book and see if we can sort of bring 

741
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:27,380
these issues to light a little bit.
And we did a,

742
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,040
it was fun and we wrote a good book and 
nobody bought it.

743
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,320
Nobody wants to hear more similar than 
dissimilar.

744
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,030
Yeah.
That's such a dangerous.

745
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:37,864
That's the thing I want to unpack with 
this more than anything else is like 

746
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,960
we've got to get past it and it's,
it's uh,

747
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,111
it's uh,
you know,

748
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:44,944
I turn on CNN and it's like,
people think they're watching news and 

749
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:50,890
they're not watching news.
They are literally watching Wolf Blitzer

750
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,963
debate between the trump spokesman and a
hillary spokesmen and people think that 

751
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:55,804
that's news.
Meanwhile brexit happens and we don't 

752
00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:58,720
even.
We literally,

753
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,554
I watched CNN almost a full day just 
trying to see like what are they going 

754
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,520
to show us with,
onto the background.

755
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,690
They didn't know the audio on the whole 
time,

756
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,460
but like there was nothing.
There was like one 32nd thing every four

757
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:10,120
hours.
Right.

758
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,580
So it's like our media is just making 
this dumb too.

759
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:15,810
Yes

760
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,643
and no.
I think there's a certain percentage of 

761
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:23,721
the population that will look at the 
coverage of brexit and be curious enough

762
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,033
to want to understand more what that 
means and there's a much larger 

763
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:30,444
percentage of the population that 
understands the headline of what Brexit 

764
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,600
is and doesn't need to pursue that any 
further.

765
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,130
And then there's a certain amount of the
population who doesn't give a shit,

766
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,830
but I put it,
but it hasn't.

767
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,900
That always been the way I've always 
been the case,

768
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:47,200
that,
that you know,

769
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:48,410
that I don't,
I don't,

770
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,520
I,
I,

771
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,503
if anything,
I feel like we're more engaged as a 

772
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:56,361
nation than we've ever been on almost 
because we can't help but be the.

773
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,503
And I think that that's good and bad.
I think what's going on in the country 

774
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:00,900
right now,
there's,

775
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,733
there's absolutely a pollyanna ish way 
of looking at it and saying this is 

776
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:06,090
actually quite good.
What's happening.

777
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,950
That there is a,
I mean,

778
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:10,170
aside from people just being gone down 
in the streets,

779
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,423
which is great.

780
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,653
Um,

781
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,410
so you're saying that the issues that 
are being earthed up are good.

782
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:18,244
The question is yes

783
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,750
or being dredged up.
Yeah.

784
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,180
Aren't necessarily issues.

785
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,513
Um,

786
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,793
and they're being brought to the fore by
two imperfect messengers and that's 

787
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,350
fine.
That's fine.

788
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,210
Uh,
so as we're taping this right now,

789
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:37,050
black lives matters in the throes of.
There's a lot of stuff going on.

790
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:37,884
I mean,
between the shootings of the black 

791
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,930
people that has obviously been going on 
for quite some time up,

792
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,800
but these last few in particular and now
the,

793
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,663
the bride or the protests against it and
then the cop shootings and everything 

794
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:53,010
else where,
where do you kind of fall on all of this

795
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:53,844
stuff?
Because I find it very hard and even 

796
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,633
even as I'm prefacing this,
I know that no matter what we say right 

797
00:36:58,531 --> 00:36:59,364
now,
a certain amount of people are going to 

798
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,051
hate it.
No,

799
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:01,884
you know what I mean?
Even if they agree with us on 99 

800
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,160
percent,
if we say one word the wrong way,

801
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,710
people will start freaking,
but I.

802
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,603
So I haven't talked about it that much 
because I find it's very hard to 

803
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:16,350
decipher what's actually happening by 
watching little clips of things.

804
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,393
Well,

805
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,350
there's a few things we know that are 
happening.

806
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,253
Yeah.
Let's start with the black lives matter 

807
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,053
side of it and instantly,
I don't think these are two opposing 

808
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:28,510
sides,
but just,

809
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,920
yeah,
separating them out.

810
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,100
We know that black people are being 
killed by police.

811
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,770
We know that.
We've known it for years.

812
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,780
Uh,
we've known it for generations,

813
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,990
we've known him for centuries.
Black people get killed.

814
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,440
Um,
what changed is obviously the ability to

815
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,460
live stream those debts as they're 
occurring.

816
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,653
It has changed the dialogue.
It's very hard for white people to now 

817
00:37:57,881 --> 00:37:59,130
say or not to,
to,

818
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,090
to live in any kind of denial about 
that.

819
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,983
Now,
when you see the evidence presented in 

820
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:09,340
front of you and there's a lot of white 
people trying very hard to maintain that

821
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:10,720
denial,
very hard,

822
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,240
but I think most of us look at that and 
go,

823
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,620
Oh yeah,
yeah,

824
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,190
we knew what you were saying for the 
last 300 years,

825
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,230
I guess.
That's right.

826
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,063
Yeah.
The blatant denial people are the ones 

827
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:21,894
that drive me nuts because you can say 
that we can get to the other part of 

828
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:24,954
this too.
You can say there's some legitimate 

829
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,753
issues there,
but it's the people that no matter what 

830
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:30,750
happens,
no matter what evidence they're shown,

831
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,783
they immediately go to that.
It goes to character assassination 

832
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:34,530
immediately.
Yeah.

833
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:35,861
Right,
right,

834
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:35,980
right.

835
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,040
If somebody had a weed in the car or 
whatever,

836
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,830
well they deserve to get shot.
No,

837
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,363
no,
they didn't.

838
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,243
Right,
so there's that side of it and then the 

839
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,374
other side is a,
that violence gets redirected towards 

840
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,240
police and I haven't heard anybody 
defend that in any way,

841
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:58,264
shape or form other than a couple of 
crazy people on twitter just being 

842
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,453
idiots.
The two on the two ideas are not 

843
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,063
opposed.
We shouldn't be killing people like 

844
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,763
that.
Let's just start with that central 

845
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:17,680
premise.
People are dying unnecessarily.

846
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,710
Yeah.
And there I believe that there is a uh,

847
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,840
incredibly entrenched,
I don't know,

848
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:36,621
and there's no polite word for it.
Racist Culture in police culture.

849
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,043
I've seen enough evidence and read 
enough account and spent enough time 

850
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,980
looking at,
looking at,

851
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,740
added into it to suggest that that is a 
problem,

852
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,660
a real problem,
a genuine problem.

853
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,243
Um,
for probably a plethora of historical 

854
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:02,004
and cultural reasons.
So something's broken with policing and 

855
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:11,790
I think always has been,
but now we're just seeing it.

856
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Um,
that needs to change.

857
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,943
Hm.

858
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,133
The idea that the police force,
we've come to think of more and more as 

859
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:24,370
a militarized force as an extension of 
the military.

860
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,050
That has to change.
It's weird.

861
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,070
It's weird that.
Sorry to cut you off,

862
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,390
but it's weird that people don't see 
that.

863
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:31,810
That piece of it where when we have 
these tanks out there are not taxed,

864
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:34,210
but these armored vehicles on our 
streets,

865
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,680
it happened and that doesn't truly.
Yeah,

866
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:37,960
and that doesn't feel like if you were 
just looking at it,

867
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,040
we're moving specifics.
We armored tanks on our streets,

868
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:45,070
forget why they're there,
but that in and of itself,

869
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,090
this alarm,
a problem.

870
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,283
You should.
You should have to call the national 

871
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:52,891
guard tank and pick up the phone call.
Gomer pyle haven't bring the tank.

872
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,050
There's no reason the police forces need
them,

873
00:40:56,051 --> 00:41:01,051
but what it does is it inculcates an us 
versus them mentality,

874
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,843
both from the police point of view and 
from the community's point of view and 

875
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,970
the idea of community policing is lost.

876
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,970
The idea of to protect and serve is lost
because it's become a a.

877
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,543
The the these police precincts I think 
in many communities have come to feel 

878
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:25,360
like occupying forces as opposed to 
extensions of the community.

879
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,073
That's a real problem.
The fact that the fact that police 

880
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,950
routinely recruit from the military I 
think is a problem.

881
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,930
There's no,
there's,

882
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,140
there's no real linkage between those 
two organizations.

883
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,260
The police are paramilitary to a certain
extent,

884
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,850
but the local police force in my mind 
should be essentially liaison from,

885
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,920
uh,
the law,

886
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:56,220
law enforcement to the community.
And it should be a partnership.

887
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:57,510
It should be a two way street.

888
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,363
Right?
So in army is dealing with enemy 

889
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:00,164
combatants,
but by definite way that police 

890
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,140
obviously she's right there,

891
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,750
like definition and army is dealing 
with,

892
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,830
with an opposing force.
Yeah.

893
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,980
And when you recruit from the military 
to fill out your police ranks,

894
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,493
I have a hard time believing that 
they're not going to bring that 

895
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:22,780
mentality to policing and it infects the
entire culture.

896
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,150
And it's been that way now for I think 
decades.

897
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,103
So what do you make of [inaudible]?
One of the things that I've struggled 

898
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:28,534
with,
this is what I see the protests and 

899
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:30,154
there in the middle of the street where 
they're not supposed to be on highways 

900
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:32,644
and things and you know when they've 
been burning cars or whatever it is or 

901
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,290
or looting sorts of things.
Look,

902
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,450
those things are not legal.
You're allowed to protest,

903
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:42,640
but you can't shut down highways and 
all.

904
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:43,474
That's a.
and usually the cop usually not always 

905
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:46,534
of course,
but usually you see the cops basically 

906
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:53,170
trying to keep law and order so it sort 
of a self fulfilling prophecy here,

907
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,250
right?
Because you could.

908
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,123
You create something,
you do something illegal even if the 

909
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:58,850
intentions are good.
Let's see.

910
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,703
Your motives are good,
but you shut down a highway which you 

911
00:43:01,631 --> 00:43:02,590
can't do.
Now.

912
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:03,424
The cops have to do something and now 
you've created this stalemate here and 

913
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:08,044
now of course everyone's got cameras in 
everybody's face and they're just 

914
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:11,450
waiting for the pin drops,
right?

915
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,300
To set the whole thing off.
So how do we,

916
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,830
how do we unfurl some of that?

917
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,263
This is given two different examples 
that I think are not quite the same to 

918
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,700
me.
There's a big difference between sitting

919
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:28,420
down in the middle of a highway and 
burning a car and looting a store.

920
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,310
Sure.
But both are legal.

921
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,293
Both are illegal.
One is causing a property damage and 

922
00:43:37,691 --> 00:43:39,000
destruction.
And is,

923
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:39,943
is essentially a violent act versus the 
nonviolent protest of sitting down in 

924
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:44,680
the middle of a highway.

925
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,803
You could be stopping ambulances that 
needed to get in all kinds of other 

926
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:51,160
stuff,
but you could also do those sit downs

927
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,490
in a park.
You can,

928
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,540
you know,
but,

929
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,340
but you don't get the fanfare.
Right.

930
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,460
And,
and protest is about spectacle.

931
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,380
That is,
that is it's point.

932
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,773
Um,
so I may be annoyed at the people 

933
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,740
sitting in the middle of the highway,
um,

934
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,053
but I don't have the same reaction to 
that as I do to people being 

935
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:16,160
destructive.
Sure.

936
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,380
In their community.
And I think I,

937
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,583
I,
I think sitting down in the highways a 

938
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:27,601
perfectly viable,
a nonviolent demonstration where I think

939
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,840
black lives matter is falling short.
Um,

940
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,610
and I,
I,

941
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,260
I was reading a commenter commentator on
twitter,

942
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,530
Oliver Willis,
who was talking about this all night

943
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,403
[inaudible]

944
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,160
without a directed legislative agenda.
It's so much smoke,

945
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,450
but there's no,
it can't catch fire.

946
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:59,210
There's no substance there.
Um,

947
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,660
and I think that's true.
I think,

948
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:01,494
I think at this point,
the black lives matter umbrella because 

949
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:06,054
it's not really sounded organization,
it's whoever wants black lives matter 

950
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:11,784
can claim it wherever you can claim 
yourself to be a member of black lives 

951
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:18,870
matter and you are um,
but it needs,

952
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,930
it needs more directed leadership.
It needs to have some stated legislative

953
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:25,914
and policy goals.
Otherwise all you're doing is you're 

954
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,220
raising awareness for something that 
people already know exists.

955
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,360
This is the inherent problem with that 
though,

956
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:37,440
that they feel the system has failed 
them either,

957
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,820
either true or not.
So they're there.

958
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,050
Their goal is

959
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,150
to

960
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:43,983
make waves,
not necessarily like they're trying to 

961
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,090
change the system in a way that the 
system doesn't want to change.

962
00:45:50,091 --> 00:45:51,700
Like that's where this thing's at 
loggerheads,

963
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:51,950
right?
Yeah.

964
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,783
But like if a guy came out and said,
I have this legislation that's going to 

965
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:56,020
do this and this and this,
it's almost like,

966
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,100
well,
the protesters wouldn't,

967
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,060
wouldn't be down with that.

968
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:03,110
That's possible because again,
it's the blank slate theory.

969
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,500
It's easy to say,
I'm,

970
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,900
I project all my hopes onto x,
x candidate x political movement.

971
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,770
It's much harder to go to then take the 
next step to y and Z and saying,

972
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,270
well,
here are some legislative,

973
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,213
uh,
differences we can make and it's not 

974
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:24,770
going to be perfect because it never is.
But we can move.

975
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,010
We can move ourselves forward in fits 
and starts.

976
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah,
that's what we need.

977
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,393
Wouldn't it be fun to talk about some of
this stuff with some level of comedy 

978
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:33,880
involved?
But I get ya.

979
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:34,803
I get ya.
I warned you in an email and I prepare 

980
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:39,370
for me not to be funny.
I'm not going to be funny.

981
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:41,950
And I said I wanted one applause break.
We don't even have a studio audience.

982
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:43,350
What I was hoping for.
One,

983
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,960
one,
minor applause.

984
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,813
Break there.
I don't know how to talk about this 

985
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:47,540
stuff with that.
Funny Way,

986
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,090
I mean I just,

987
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,740
I find it interesting,
I mean I'm just,

988
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,850
I'm just some dude who reads the 
newspaper and it's just interested in it

989
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:54,684
and doesn't,
doesn't pretend to know how to make it 

990
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:57,444
funny.

991
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,553
Are there any comics right now that you 
really think you're hitting this out of 

992
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:00,340
the

993
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,173
park?
Just sort of the general political 

994
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:03,790
stuff.
Yeah.

995
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,550
You know the,
the people who came from the daily show,

996
00:47:06,551 --> 00:47:07,390
I think our

997
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,530
still doing the best work in that arena.
We need John Back.

998
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:14,030
Right?
I had some issues with them,

999
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,910
but I think we need him back.
He was the best.

1000
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,410
Yeah,
I think he is coming back right?

1001
00:47:18,411 --> 00:47:21,110
He's got some HBO.
He's going to do like little snippets on

1002
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:21,944
hbo or something,
but I mean sort of that nightly long 

1003
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:25,310
form.
It would be great.

1004
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,390
It really wouldn't be.
Yeah.

1005
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:27,224
So let's,
let's shift to movies and comedy and TV 

1006
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,080
and,
but,

1007
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,913
but we can probably circle it back to 
some horrific societal stuff and end of 

1008
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:36,460
civilization stuff,
but in case society ends,

1009
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:37,294
I want you to at least be able to share 
your thoughts on some of the movies 

1010
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:41,530
you've made.
Some of the others about Wonky Shit.

1011
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,210
All right,
well we'll let you know what,

1012
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:45,880
five minutes of it.
I was going to go for 12 to 15.

1013
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,310
We'll do five minutes away and then 
we'll finish back with all this stuff.

1014
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,443
Um,
so first off I was telling you right 

1015
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:51,880
before we sat down,
uh,

1016
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:53,410
that you were in wet hot American 
summer,

1017
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:55,690
which I hadn't seen until about a year 
ago.

1018
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,580
Even though I went to one of those 
camps.

1019
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:01,390
I went to Camp Shannon wind up in 
Pennsylvania and I thought it was one of

1020
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:03,730
the most absolutely hilarious we've ever
seen.

1021
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:04,564
I watched the series on Netflix,
which now you're just telling me you're 

1022
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:07,630
writing for season two,
right?

1023
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,130
Which is pretty great.
But you didn't write for.

1024
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:10,990
She just not right for season one,
I did not write the movie.

1025
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,820
Yeah.
Is that hard for you and in a movie like

1026
00:48:12,821 --> 00:48:13,654
that where there's a,
it's so many of your friends obviously 

1027
00:48:16,571 --> 00:48:19,090
writing and you didn't get to write but 
you have to just act it.

1028
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,270
Is that harder than if you're writing 
for it and acting on it?

1029
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,330
Uh,
no.

1030
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:24,164
I mean

1031
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,720
I've been friends with all of those guys
essentially my entire adult life.

1032
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:29,763
So

1033
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,020
it says if I wrote it,
yeah,

1034
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:33,570
you know,
we,

1035
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:37,280
we share a sensibility.
So it's just,

1036
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,440
it was just fun and it's not like they 
were so precious with the words that you

1037
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:44,430
couldn't,
so they let you kind of do your thing.

1038
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,210
I would imagine you guys are having a 
great time because it's great.

1039
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,410
It's really fun.
Yeah.

1040
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:49,603
And now now I'm,
I mean I'm nervous writing for it 

1041
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:56,210
because I feel like I have something to 
live up to write as a writer,

1042
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,880
which I,
I didn't have to showing up on set.

1043
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,013
So I'm,
I'm,

1044
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,980
I'm conscious of,
of not fucking up something that I think

1045
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:05,270
is really funny.
All right,

1046
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:07,040
so we're going to pack all the comedy 
stuff in real quick.

1047
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:08,840
So you're working on like 87 other 
things.

1048
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:11,480
You're on Gaffigan,
you're doing something that I just saw a

1049
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,650
billboard when other period.

1050
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,230
Yeah,
yeah.

1051
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,130
Yeah.
So that's.

1052
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:15,780
I haven't seen it,
but it's like a,

1053
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,380
it's like a takeoff.
Downton Abbey.

1054
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:17,990
Is that

1055
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,490
abby?
It's as if,

1056
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,000
well,
they pitched it to me as the Kardashians

1057
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,280
meets Downton Abbey and that's 
essentially what it is.

1058
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,290
And it's really funny.
Yeah.

1059
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:27,851
All right.
So I,

1060
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,390
I knew what channel is it on comedy 
central?

1061
00:49:29,391 --> 00:49:31,040
I actually know that I should've,
I should've known that.

1062
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,590
I apologize.
We have ruined the whole interview.

1063
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,840
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm not here to plug shit.

1064
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,490
You're not plugging.
I'm here not plugging.

1065
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:39,050
You said.
Well let's talk about the real stuff.

1066
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,180
That's all I want to talk about.
All right.

1067
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,470
Let's circle back to the real stuff.
Um,

1068
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,770
so I mean I've got other shows out to it
doesn't matter.

1069
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,270
It doesn't matter.
I'm on a lot of shows.

1070
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,670
What's your favorite thing that you had 
up?

1071
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,430
All the things you don't see.
So I always associate you with the.

1072
00:49:51,431 --> 00:49:52,264
I love the bad stuff,
which probably does that cause you to 

1073
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,510
roll your eyes Kinda like it was,
you were like,

1074
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,990
it was almost as if they,
that whole genre of stuff,

1075
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:00,850
which,
you know,

1076
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,820
they did a zillion shows after that best
week ever.

1077
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:04,050
And I in the seventies,
I love the nineties,

1078
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:05,760
I love the twenties or whatever else 
they've.

1079
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,740
And now every channel has those shows 
too.

1080
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,660
But you were sort of the one that like.

1081
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,813
Got It.
Did you kind of feel like you figured 

1082
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:15,020
out what that thing was?
That,

1083
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:16,890
that commentary thing was?
Uh,

1084
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,270
I think in a way that some of the other 
people who maybe didn't get well when,

1085
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,590
when it first started it was much more 
sincere.

1086
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,750
It was much more like Soleil Frye going,
Oh,

1087
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,990
do you remember Wacky Wall crawlers 
crawlers.

1088
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:36,670
Right.
And that was never my approach to it.

1089
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,950
My approach was just,
just make jokes.

1090
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:40,820
Uh,
I,

1091
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,653
I,
I feel totally comfortable shitting on 

1092
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:45,290
your childhood right now.
Uh,

1093
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,850
and that,
yeah,

1094
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:50,270
they eventually,
the tone of it shifted more towards that

1095
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,100
then.
Then the,

1096
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,090
can you remember Wacky Wall crawlers?
Tell him?

1097
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,340
Yeah.
Speaking of the eighties,

1098
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,450
the Sega Genesis,
do anything for you because nothing.

1099
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,990
No,
it was after my time.

1100
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,740
That was.
So your eight bit Nintendo or colleague?

1101
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,920
A Vision or a vision?
A intellivision Atari Twenty 600.

1102
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,990
Wow.
So even eight bit Nintendo.

1103
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:12,620
We only have five years apart.
It technology changes,

1104
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:14,750
man moves very fast.
Yeah.

1105
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,770
Uh,
I was,

1106
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,240
I had graduated from video games and by 
the time the Sega Genesis came out.

1107
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,530
Yeah.
So I remember once I auditioned for,

1108
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:28,130
I shot a best week ever once and one of 
the jokes I did,

1109
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:29,790
it was right when current TV came out 
with,

1110
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,624
which was Al Gore's television and my 
joke was something to this effect that 

1111
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:34,011
was like,
Oh,

1112
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:34,844
you know,
Al Gore has a new TV channel called 

1113
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:38,024
current TV.
Can you imagine if George W dot Bush 

1114
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:40,281
did?
Oh yeah.

1115
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:41,700
Fox News.
Not,

1116
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,630
not the most brilliant thing ever,
but I thought I thought pretty solid.

1117
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:45,620
That's a solid joke.
Right?

1118
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,140
And I remember the producer kind of 
looked at me from the side,

1119
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:50,600
like,
we're not going to be doing that sort of

1120
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:51,470
thing around here.

1121
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,210
And I didn't think they aired it,
uh,

1122
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,143
my little too political for that.
That was too political for that were 

1123
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,820
pretty mild,
extremely mild.

1124
00:51:58,821 --> 00:51:59,654
But you know,
we live in corporate culture where 

1125
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:05,690
everyone's afraid to offend everybody.
How do you deal with that stuff?

1126
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,700
So now we can circle back to that.
Like when,

1127
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:09,920
where,
how you ever have you ever said,

1128
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,630
I'm sure you know you've gotten into 
some heat,

1129
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:12,483
right?
Like I'd said Shit on twitter that gets 

1130
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,540
people upset.
Yeah.

1131
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,400
I'm,
I'm not just talking about the Nazis.

1132
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:21,320
I mean like a wider,
wider.

1133
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,180
Yeah.
But I mean,

1134
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,030
it never really like widespread 
condemnation.

1135
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:26,864
It's always coming from the Michelle 
Malkin crowd who never called me whiter 

1136
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:34,550
than toilet paper once or something like
that.

1137
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,880
She said this guy is whiter than old 
toilet paper.

1138
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,250
Well,
not according to the alt right.

1139
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:42,810
You're not even like my friend.

1140
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,790
I know big Ju.
Yeah.

1141
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,680
Yeah.
Not even like,

1142
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,730
um,
I,

1143
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:55,100
I am not particularly self censorious.
Is that the word?

1144
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,420
Yeah.
But do you think about it ever?

1145
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:59,060
Because I do sometimes think,
man,

1146
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,270
like there'll be something that I want 
to say like really,

1147
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,840
and even just I'll be like,
ah,

1148
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:04,683
I gotta change this one word,
not because it's really what I mean is 

1149
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:07,994
any different,
but because there's nothing wrong with 

1150
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,194
that.
There's nothing wrong with making sure 

1151
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:19,751
that what you're trying to say is being 
heard in the way you want to say it.

1152
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,990
Right.
I mean,

1153
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:21,824
when I've gotten in trouble on twitter,
it's generally because I've been too 

1154
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:29,870
hasty in terms of how I say something,
not really about what I'm saying.

1155
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,933
Um,

1156
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,213
I have no problem with there being 
consequences for people saying stupid 

1157
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:38,234
shit.
The First Amendment allows you to say 

1158
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:42,524
whatever you want,
but it doesn't protect you from the 

1159
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:44,984
consequences of your speech.
It's just the government can come in so 

1160
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:48,914
you can use your speech and then other 
people can use their speech to counter 

1161
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,400
years.
It's actually a beautiful,

1162
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,743
beautiful thing.
And I want to be a total asshole on 

1163
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,620
twitter and say racist.
Horrible Shit.

1164
00:53:57,621 --> 00:53:58,454
I can do that.

1165
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,313
Yeah.
Um,

1166
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,083
but,

1167
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,163
you know,
my employer might get upset with me and 

1168
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:04,960
I have to be,
I have to understand that going in.

1169
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:06,183
So there's free speech,
but consequences of course there's 

1170
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:11,370
always been consequences to free speech.
Uh,

1171
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,200
I,
I think the idea,

1172
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,350
the concept of free speech is widely 
misunderstood in this country.

1173
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,720
People think they should be able to sort
of,

1174
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,150
uh,
uh,

1175
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:26,230
excrete whatever diarrhea they want from
their mouth and they absolutely can.

1176
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:27,723
But if somebody comes along and is like,
I'm going to wash your mouth out with 

1177
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:32,590
soap,
got to be prepared to deal with.

1178
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,140
Right,
right.

1179
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,300
Not Punch you all on what washing your 
mouth out,

1180
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:37,550
but they can use their speech,
not going to throw you in jail.

1181
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,241
Yeah.
You know,

1182
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:40,250
it's funny,
when I went to Ucla,

1183
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,070
as I mentioned before with Milo and I,
we just did one of these,

1184
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:43,904
which we've done many times before and 
there were all these protestors and 

1185
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:47,960
first they were blocking people from 
coming in,

1186
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:50,780
which you can't do that.
You gotta you can protest of course,

1187
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:54,230
but use your,
do a counter rally the next day,

1188
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,170
scream all you want,
but you can't throw garbage cans.

1189
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:58,790
And they were getting,
getting in cops faces.

1190
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:00,470
I mean really there were people with 
phones,

1191
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:03,200
right in touch with just begging to set 
them off,

1192
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:04,730
which goes to the whole other thing we 
discussed.

1193
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,660
But at one point,
uh,

1194
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,170
one of the protestors came in and,
uh,

1195
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,720
we started screaming in the middle of it
and I stopped and I said,

1196
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:12,554
look,
I bet you that if you ask Milo a 

1197
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:16,100
question right now,
a direct question.

1198
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,420
So we were going to do this at the q and
a,

1199
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:19,730
but if you ask him something right now,
he'll answer it.

1200
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,040
And she just screamed.
I,

1201
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:24,070
Hey,
I.

1202
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,600
and I was like,
that's the problem here,

1203
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,850
that that's my problem with what's 
happening on the left.

1204
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,863
It was like,
I opened the door for you to make a 

1205
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:34,100
point,
make let's have that exchange of ideas.

1206
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,280
But all she could come up with was that.
And it was like,

1207
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,930
that was your chance to say,
no,

1208
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:42,350
you are a whatever you want to call him.
You know what I mean?

1209
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:43,730
You're a,
you don't like Muslim people,

1210
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:45,130
you don't like that.
But whenever you want to do like,

1211
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,430
this is it,
I'm giving you a chance.

1212
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,293
That's a lot of cameras here,
but you're in front of 500 people and 

1213
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:50,114
that's what you came up with.
And that's my problem with a lot of 

1214
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:52,940
what's going on on the colleges.
It's like,

1215
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:54,920
these people don't even know what 
they're protesting.

1216
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,003
They're,
they just hear something that they kind 

1217
00:55:56,841 --> 00:55:57,674
of don't like.
And then they freak out and they want 

1218
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,390
safe spaces and trigger warnings and all
this other.

1219
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,710
Well,
I am,

1220
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,940
uh,

1221
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,730
as somebody who traffics in free speech 
for a living,

1222
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,810
I am cognizant of the concern on 
campuses that,

1223
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,850
that free speech is being shut down.

1224
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,780
And of course,
if I,

1225
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,080
I,
I oppose that.

1226
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:29,914
I oppose inviting somebody,
the campus and then because some group 

1227
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,400
has an issue with that person,
just inviting them.

1228
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,620
Uh,
uh,

1229
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,483
a college campus of all places should be
a place where every point of view is 

1230
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:42,970
heard.
Yeah,

1231
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,230
no problem with protesting those people,
but as you said,

1232
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,270
protest in a respectful way or protest 
in a way that is lawful,

1233
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,130
right?
You don't have to do it respectfully.

1234
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:58,110
You can be loud and upset and angry and.
Sure.

1235
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,350
But,
um,

1236
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,561
but I,
I agree with you.

1237
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:03,970
I don't think you can block the,
I mean,

1238
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,760
well you can,
I'm just going to get arrested.

1239
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,870
That's a,
that's on you.

1240
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,600
Um,
but,

1241
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:14,140
but I do think the,
uh,

1242
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:14,920
the,
the,

1243
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,440
the college campus thing has gotten,
from what I read,

1244
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:18,274
I mean,
I don't know because I'm not 

1245
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,323
experiencing it,
but it feels like it's gotten very 

1246
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,880
intolerant.
Uh,

1247
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:23,710
and that's a problem.
That's a real problem.

1248
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,570
And the danger is that these are our 
future leaders.

1249
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:28,850
That's what I'm contributing is I don't 
think it's a problem.

1250
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:31,760
Ultimately,
I think it's a problem in the sense that

1251
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,523
I think it speaks to a larger problem,
but I do think people will leave those 

1252
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:45,060
institutions and take their place in 
society and it will all be fine.

1253
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:45,894
I'm not,
I'm not concerned about it longterm 

1254
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,340
particularly really,
I mean you don't think like that.

1255
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,174
Just a generation of these people who 
had been sort of coddled into the safe 

1256
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:58,170
space thing that they're going to be the
20 year olds that are 25 years.

1257
00:57:59,010 --> 00:57:59,843
You know what I mean?
That eventually they'll have been so 

1258
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:03,640
used to never hearing anything that they
didn't like or,

1259
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:04,474
or everything that they don't like is 
hate speech in their eyes that they've 

1260
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,650
diminished the ability to do this.
That that's my concern.

1261
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,993
I think it's a little

1262
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:14,680
what concern.
I've seen no evidence to this point that

1263
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:16,900
it's going to be a problem down the 
road.

1264
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,040
Maybe it will be.
Maybe it won't be.

1265
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:18,874
I don't know.
I'm not,

1266
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,980
I'm not that concerned about it.
Only because I feel like my,

1267
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,230
my basic philosophy in parenting and in 
life is the kids are all right.

1268
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,480
They're going to be fine.

1269
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,740
Did you steal that from movie?
I did not.

1270
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,590
You were thinking that before?
Yes.

1271
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,060
Um,
the kids are all right.

1272
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,550
There'll be fine.
It'll all work itself out.

1273
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,683
I do think the larger point is this idea
that victimization is empowerment that 

1274
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:46,174
you,
by claiming victim status are there by 

1275
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,623
empowered and thereby take the moral 
high ground in whatever you do by the 

1276
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,180
victim status.
That's problematic to me.

1277
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,970
So what do we do about that?
Because that,

1278
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:58,990
that gets to the heart of all of this 
thing.

1279
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:02,380
Everyone's trying to figure out how they
are a victim so that they can somehow be

1280
00:59:02,381 --> 00:59:03,214
a little more moral problem.
Everyone beneath him is with very few 

1281
00:59:10,231 --> 00:59:13,200
exceptions.
A lot of people can make a claim,

1282
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,131
you know,
their,

1283
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:14,701
their,
their,

1284
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:17,550
their claims are not without merit.
Um,

1285
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,370
whether you're black,
Hispanic,

1286
00:59:20,371 --> 00:59:22,580
Muslim,
female,

1287
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,470
gay,
whatever it is you are,

1288
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:25,963
you can make an argument like you,
you have faced some problems and you 

1289
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:31,760
have to deal with them.
Um,

1290
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,553
and there's nothing wrong.
I think in asserting and stating your 

1291
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:37,094
case and saying,
this is where I feel like society is 

1292
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:40,520
coming up short and dealing with us.

1293
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,143
But

1294
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,690
there's no,
as you're saying,

1295
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:48,524
there's no,
there's no positive movement beyond 

1296
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:53,690
that.
Once you've identified your grievances,

1297
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:54,950
you can't wallow in them

1298
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,910
because the world isn't going to give 
you anything,

1299
00:59:56,911 --> 00:59:58,590
and I don't think the world should give 
you anything.

1300
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,424
We should all be treated equally.
The playing field has to be equal and 

1301
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:02,940
maybe the playing field isn't equal.
Well,

1302
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:03,774
that's I think,
the larger issue that the playing field 

1303
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,240
isn't equal.
And so

1304
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:08,043
what's so funny about trump is he's 
elevated the white male to victim 

1305
01:00:12,431 --> 01:00:13,510
status.
He's,

1306
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,373
he's,
he somehow made white men into victims 

1307
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:17,463
and

1308
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,200
you know,
that's the final frontier of hilarity.

1309
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,380
It's funny to me too because if I make 
fun of Hilary,

1310
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:25,214
which I do all the time,
they love it and it gets a zillion 

1311
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,850
retweets and if I make fun of Bernie,
of course they love it,

1312
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,833
but I make fun of anyone and the whole 
time they were telling me how much they 

1313
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:32,340
love free speech.
And I,

1314
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,493
again,
I say this as I understand that free 

1315
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,620
speech,
Lma you should on there,

1316
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,993
but then every time I make a trump on 
bullet but joke and now you're saying 

1317
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,104
you don't get it yet,
and that they can use their free speech 

1318
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:46,340
to counter me.
But I always think it's like,

1319
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,440
I just want them to understand like a 
little bit of the irony here.

1320
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,600
You know what I mean?
Like guys,

1321
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:52,400
I'm literally like,
I'm not like,

1322
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,590
kill the guy.
I'm like,

1323
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,120
right.
It's like,

1324
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:55,830
it's hard

1325
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,270
when your guys being attacked and you 
know,

1326
01:00:57,271 --> 01:00:58,200
in a,
in a,

1327
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,330
in an election season,
you know,

1328
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:03,450
even as somebody who's not like an and a
hillary supporter,

1329
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:04,650
when I hear her getting attacked,

1330
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,200
my hackles go up and I'm like,
and I have to check myself.

1331
01:01:08,201 --> 01:01:08,800
I'm like,
why?

1332
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,270
Why do you care?
But that's funny because I've had,

1333
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,123
I don't really like Hillary and I don't 
like trump and I don't know what I may 

1334
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,010
vote for Gary Johnson.
I'm still in that short.

1335
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,570
I'll say something a couple weeks I 
guess.

1336
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:23,530
But like,
I've defended Hillary at times because I

1337
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:27,070
think the attacks from a lot of the 
Bernie people were totally unfair,

1338
01:01:27,071 --> 01:01:30,580
like making it sound like she's truly 
this warm on monitoring neo-con.

1339
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,040
It's like she's not calling for war 
against anyone.

1340
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,050
You know what I mean?
I know she's made some bad choices,

1341
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,500
but Obama was the president for a lot of
those bad choices too,

1342
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,360
like,
you know,

1343
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,570
Olivia and whatever else and a lot of 
the serious stuff.

1344
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,330
But it's like every time I'd defend her 
then people say,

1345
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,650
Oh,
you're a hillary supporter.

1346
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,850
And then I make a joke about trump,
but that isn't it.

1347
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,733
Like,
it's like,

1348
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,633
it's just,
it's a lot of noise at the end of the 

1349
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,420
day.
That's,

1350
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,020
that's the world you're trafficking in 
right now.

1351
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,890
The noise world and noise.
Where's the Iot world?

1352
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,580
Uh,
come to my house in Connecticut.

1353
01:01:58,530 --> 01:01:59,550
You are from Canada.
Great.

1354
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:00,700
Quiet.
Yeah.

1355
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,320
No,
but the problem is though,

1356
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:03,154
that you're a heterosexual white man.
And I feel like being around that 

1357
01:02:07,631 --> 01:02:09,610
privilege wouldn't be that great for me.
For you.

1358
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:10,583
Yeah.

1359
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,030
Gay Married Dude.
So technically little better.

1360
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:14,170
Yeah.

1361
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:14,751
Well,
you know what,

1362
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:16,000
we're,
um,

1363
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,560
we like,
we like little,

1364
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,120
a little,
uh,

1365
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,830
diversity up in Connecticut.

1366
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,410
What do you,
what do you get a little bit?

1367
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,180
Yeah.
You're not in a,

1368
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:29,700
what's the really fat granted.
Sorry.

1369
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,780
No,
yeah,

1370
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,141
no,
no.

1371
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:32,190
Diversity over there.
I used to,

1372
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,024
when I was doing standup,
I would do catering gigs a lot in 

1373
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:36,030
Connecticut.
There was not a,

1374
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:36,973
I mean there was the widest thing here 
where it's colors of white that I had 

1375
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:40,830
never seen before.
That's how white it was.

1376
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,600
Yeah.
There's anything wrong with that.

1377
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:43,583
Where I am

1378
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:46,550
is,
is pretty white and it's embarrassing.

1379
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:48,253
It gets to the point where like every 
Sunday there's a concerts on the green 

1380
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,760
in my little town and um,
you know,

1381
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,380
the few black families that live in 
town,

1382
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:01,550
you know,
you just,

1383
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:06,080
you just stare at them like this.
I know most patronizing way.

1384
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,490
Like,
I love you,

1385
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,770
I love you.
White guilt is something,

1386
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:10,760
oh,
it's the worst.

1387
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,731
It's the worst.
I,

1388
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,320
I,
there,

1389
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,153
there are,
there are times where I feel like I 

1390
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,320
could die from white guilt.
Uh,

1391
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:21,340
I was on a cruise ship and the waitstaff
at this dinner,

1392
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:23,783
I dunno,
they're from all over the world and at 

1393
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:28,100
one point,
uh,

1394
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,660
one,
one of the evenings,

1395
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,780
they had to perform a song and dance for
us,

1396
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,560
the waitstaff,
and it was unbearable to me.

1397
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:39,190
I,
I honestly felt like if I could die from

1398
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:42,100
white guilt right now because you were 
all white patrons,

1399
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:46,540
mostly on the lady's staring at those 
people from Bangladesh going,

1400
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:47,374
thank you for coming to dinner tonight.
We hope you like your chicken or 

1401
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,140
whatever they were saying and you're 
just like,

1402
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:53,974
oh my God,
these are the songs about the first 

1403
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,690
songs are not about the food,
but that would have been.

1404
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,520
That would be pretty good.
But the subtext of like,

1405
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,630
you are eating this stuff,
we don't eat that well.

1406
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:10,830
They give us is the needs of glad.
We ended this thing on a funny note.

1407
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,890
So you see what we did there.
We went serious.

1408
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:15,903
Then we went.
I think there was something funny about 

1409
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:18,630
not really,
and it's go.

1410
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,533
I thought there was one

1411
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,680
moment of humor that phishing email to 
introduce me as comedian Michael,

1412
01:04:23,681 --> 01:04:25,860
Ian,
but just be with citizen will Ian,

1413
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:27,900
black,
American citizen.

1414
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,680
How about depressed dark?
I'm not depressed,

1415
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,431
but um,
no,

1416
01:04:32,431 --> 01:04:34,560
but I'm trying to make you give you a 
little cred,

1417
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,543
you know what I mean?
Because if you're depressed or if you 

1418
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:37,284
were going to limp or something that way
next time you come out I'll say he's 

1419
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,730
depressed.
He's limping.

1420
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,970
Being he's the first.
He was,

1421
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,003
you know,
next time I'll tell them that he 

1422
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:48,450
couldn't fly first class.
Yeah.

1423
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,230
Yeah.
I did fly first class coming out here on

1424
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,690
jet blue on jet blue again.
Are they as good?

1425
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:55,950
Those real nice,
real nice.

1426
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,570
It,
it seems like extra.

1427
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,990
Like you don't even need all that space.
Oh yeah.

1428
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,273
Well you know what it's for.
It's for a halfway through the flight 

1429
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:06,030
that come into the jerk you off.

1430
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,100
Meanwhile I'm doing it myself back in 
coach,

1431
01:05:10,101 --> 01:05:13,460
like some kind of schmuck.
And on that note I want to thank Michael

1432
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,930
Ian Black.
You can follow him on twitter and if you

1433
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:16,790
want to send them any Nazi names or 
anything like that,

1434
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:19,600
he might retweet you or comment on it.
I think that's possible.

1435
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,703
Or check out Michael Ian Black Dot com 
and the thousand shows that he has in 

1436
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:26,074
production at the moment.
Thanks for watching and we'll do it 

1437
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:28,264
again next week.
