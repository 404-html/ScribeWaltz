1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,533
As I sit here in the middle of February,
we're about eight months away from 

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,560
Election Day,
2016.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,290
Doesn't that sound completely insane?
I mean,

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,124
think about it.
We've been talking about this election 

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:16,620
for at least a year and we're still over
half a year away from it.

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,454
That is completely bonkers.
So much of the election process is just 

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,673
insider nonsense and day to day per so 
it's hard to focus on what issues are 

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,394
actually important.
Not only does the 24 hour cable news 

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,770
cycle thrive on election drama and 
distractions,

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,800
but the entire process of electing our 
politicians seems to be built on getting

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,860
the people to actually never talk about 
the big issues in an honest way.

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,520
We have debates with catered questions 
and no actual debating.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,563
We have town halls which are just forums
for talking points and social media 

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:49,344
campaigns to spread candidates messages 
without ever explaining how their ideas 

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,570
will actually solve anything.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,183
You know,
there's a strange collusion between the 

17
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,194
media and politicians to keep us all in 
the dark about what's really going on 

18
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,274
here.
What I actually want to hear candidates 

19
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,824
talking about are big ideas.
Not Political talking points to explain 

20
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,740
their economic philosophy and how it 
came to be,

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,753
to say how they came up with a moral 
argument for or against abortion and to 

22
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:18,750
let us know why America's role in the 
world should be larger or smaller.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,913
Unfortunately,
big ideas don't fit into 32nd 

24
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,810
soundbites,
leaving us with a media that wants views

25
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,644
and clicks instead of substantive debate
and a political class who of course are 

26
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,114
all the happier to provide meaningless 
slogans that sound good in a headline 

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,343
but don't mean anything at all.
That brings me to the two people really 

28
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,910
shaking up the system.
At this point.

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,773
Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.
Bernie says he wants a political 

30
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,470
revolution.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,410
While trump says he wants to make 
America great again,

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,620
I doubt they'll ever be another 
candidate like Bernie,

33
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:54,621
a world weary lifelong politician who 
wants to fundamentally change how things

34
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,710
operate from the inside.
Whether you agree or disagree with him.

35
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,500
It's a powerful message that of course 
there is trump,

36
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,334
a billionaire who's using years of board
room and TV experience to give his 

37
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,744
supporters whatever they want.
Even if they don't know exactly what 

38
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:12,030
that is,
what these two men have in common though

39
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,864
is more interesting.
They both openly mock the powerful and 

40
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,494
corrupting influence of money in 
politics while only existing as 

41
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,260
legitimate contenders because of its 
very existence.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,393
It shouldn't be lost on us that it's 
actually the very strength of our 

43
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:26,814
democratic system that allows to people 
who want to totally upend it to be 

44
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,450
surging in the polls and as warped as 
our system is.

45
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,403
If the two guys who were the most 
plainspoken who were being heard the 

46
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:37,404
loudest,
although the countdown to election 2016 

47
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,134
frustrates me as a political junkie,
I can't pretend that I don't enjoy the 

48
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,704
clown show.
It's a soap opera with characters you 

49
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,320
just can't make up.
I mean,

50
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:49,290
we've got the ex president's wife,
the Socialist Jew,

51
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,124
the billionaire and the neurosurgeon.
It basically sounds like a spinoff of 

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,960
Gilligan's island.
Unfortunately,

53
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:57,870
while Gilligan and his friends were 
eventually rescued from their island,

54
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:01,360
the only ones who can rescue from this 
shipwreck ourselves,

55
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,470
the citizens to help me navigate these 
choppy waters this week is my guest,

56
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,560
Ben Shapiro,
the editor@largeofBreitbart.com.

57
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,603
Many of you have asked us to have a sit 
down to dig into some of his 

58
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,534
conservative ideas,
can have liberal and a conservative 

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,560
coexist well.
If thirstin howl,

60
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,394
the third and ginger could do it.
I have a feeling that ben and I will be 

61
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,150
able to as well.

62
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,253
Every election year,
politicians remind us that their 

63
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,460
election is the most important of a 
generation.

64
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,890
Usually that's just more hyperbole 
nonsense,

65
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,400
but this time it could actually be true 
regardless of who wins,

66
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:36,460
whether it's one of these to hillary or 
Jeb or the skipper.

67
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,550
Our system is fundamentally shaking 
right now,

68
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,280
as evidenced by both the sanders and 
trump surgeries.

69
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,413
Can we address real issues in the months
to come or will we keep talking about 

70
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,464
sideshow nonsense?
Can we get a fair election system or 

71
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,884
will big donors always run the show?
Can we elect officials who will 

72
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,274
compromise to make the country stronger 
or will partisan points always win the 

73
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,294
day?
These are just a few of the huge issues 

74
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,340
we have to discuss and that's not even 
touching on immigration,

75
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
healthcare and terrorism.
A lot of people mock the idea of 

76
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,650
American exceptionalism,
especially on the left,

77
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,240
but I actually do believe in it.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,073
There has never been a country in the 
history of the globe that is taken more 

79
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:18,550
people from across the world and help 
them make a better life for themselves,

80
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,410
their children,
and their children's children.

81
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,940
Even now with all of our problems,
people still want to come to America for

82
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,280
a better life.
We have massive issues,

83
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,293
but underneath it all,
there's a bedrock based in democratic 

84
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,060
principles which still makes our 
position in the world truly unique.

85
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,510
It doesn't mean America can or should 
tell the world what to do,

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,750
but it does mean we have a 
responsibility to be fairer,

87
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,330
freer,
and more functional whenever we can.

88
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,763
All of these reasons are why I've made 
this show about ideas and not my new 

89
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,184
show.
There is an endless cycle of noise 

90
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,670
designed to keep us distracted and 
divided.

91
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Our politicians will only be better if 
we demand they be better.

92
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,530
Will only demand our politicians be 
better if we are better ourselves.

93
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,350
As you guys know,
I love to say the two things can be true

94
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:06,010
at the same time.
Maybe we can have a political revolution

95
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,220
while at the same time making America 
great again.

96
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,413
This change doesn't start with trump and
sanders though it starts with the 

97
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:16,330
government of the people,
by the people and for the people.

98
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,520
Just as the great Gilligan once said,

99
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,440
my

100
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,710
guest this week is editor in chief of 
daily wire.com,

101
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,633
editor@largeofBreitbart.com,
a syndicated columnist and radio host 

102
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,520
and in New York Times best selling 
author.

103
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,150
You want me to throw in anything else 
and then you've got a serious resume.

104
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,620
I mean,
I was doing some research on.

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,710
You pretty much do everything.
Yeah.

106
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,920
All right.
Well I'm.

107
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,800
I'm very happy that you're here because 
I had all of twitter basically saying to

108
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:48,200
me for about six months you've got to 
talk to this guy.

109
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,080
This is the guy who will either convert 
you to conservatism or you guys are just

110
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,340
going to hate each other.
Turned into flaming Bernie Sanders.

111
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:56,150
Socialist.
Yeah,

112
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,000
that's,
that's pretty much pretty sure.

113
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,893
That's not the direction.
It'll be a conservative by the end of 

114
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,130
the conversation.
So.

115
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,821
Well,
let's see.

116
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,880
Let's allocate territory.
Yeah,

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
let's see what happens.
But,

118
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,400
but a lot of people also said that even 
even liberals that,

119
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,121
that.
No.

120
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,954
Have you said I don't agree with this 
guy and a lot sometimes I don't even 

121
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,224
like him,
but there's some principle based around 

122
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,900
what he does.
So that's pretty much of what I do here.

123
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,760
So that's why I wanted to have you on.
Thanks for having me.

124
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,390
I got a lot of requests to come on your 
show.

125
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,400
Somebody invited me.
Yeah.

126
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,960
All right,
so let's get to it.

127
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,510
So first off,
you were actually born in La and brought

128
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,580
up in La.
I thought there were no conservatives in

129
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,690
La.
What the hell are you doing here?

130
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,723
So my parents were both.
They voted for Carter and 76 and they 

131
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,670
were Reagan Republicans.

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,873
And then because we're orthodox Jews,
religious Jews tend to vote Republican 

133
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,230
and be culturally conservative and so 
that sort of the million in which I grew

134
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,064
up,
so I became conservative basically from 

135
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,661
birth I,
I'm not,

136
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,050
I'm not a new convert.
Right.

137
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,860
So how is that growing up a conservative
as a kid?

138
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,030
Because what's that saying?
You know,

139
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:53,864
if you're not liberal in your twenties,
you have no a heart and if you're not 

140
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,060
conservative and you're 37 or something 
like that,

141
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,080
how is that as a kid?
It's hard.

142
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,690
So it works out beautifully.
Well,

143
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,240
how,
how does,

144
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,570
how is that as a kid growing up,
your conservative as a kid?

145
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,920
It doesn't,
it just doesn't sound.

146
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,420
It doesn't sound right.
Somehow,

147
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,543
again,
growing up in religious communities a 

148
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,700
little bit different than growing up in 
a nonreligious communities.

149
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,470
Religious communities tend to be more 
conservative.

150
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,530
And in La,
conservatism is all about social issues,

151
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:18,710
right?

152
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,550
When it comes to economics,
there's kind of the,

153
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:21,384
the LDLC,
the people driving around in the 

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,230
Mercedes Benz with a Bernie sanders 
sticker,

155
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,064
but everybody knows the full of it.
So it's a lot of that in beverly hills 

156
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,700
right now.
Oh yeah.

157
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Oh yeah.
And it's like,

158
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:30,794
okay,
you can just drive down to cars for 

159
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,594
kids.
I think any day now just give it away 

160
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,873
and you enjoy yourself.
Like I don't understand why you need my 

161
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,790
money.
You clearly have some of your own.

162
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,624
So anytime.
But in la it's all a cultural thing and 

163
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:41,774
conservative versus versus leftist.
And I like to distinguish leftist from 

164
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:46,220
liberals because I don't think they're 
the same thing.

165
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,303
A conservatives versus leftists in La is
very much about kind of a character 

166
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,213
assumption if he or if you're a leftist,
you're a good person and if you're a 

167
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,544
conservative that means you're an 
uptight John Lithgow type from 

168
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:57,890
footloose.

169
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,200
You don't want anybody to.
That's what it comes down to.

170
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,103
Right.
So I definitely want to dig into the 

171
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,230
difference between liberals and 
leftists,

172
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,293
you,
because it's something you focused on a 

173
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:06,824
lot from the right.
And it's something that I've focused on 

174
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:11,600
a lot in the last year from the left.
So we're going to dive into that,

175
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,280
but let's just do some election stuff.
Sure.

176
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,340
First,
let's get the easy stuff.

177
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,453
Fun stuff.
All right,

178
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,530
so this election seems completely insane
to me.

179
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,880
Uh,
let's start with trump.

180
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,210
You're big on trump.
I don't think so.

181
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,630
How you feeling?
I think that.

182
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:26,000
I think trump's a loud mouth.
I think he's a braggart.

183
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,480
I think that,
that trump is bad for American politics.

184
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,900
I think that there's a couple of things 
that I like about trump won,

185
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,150
is that he says things that are not 
politically incorrect.

186
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,013
The problem with trump is that he fails 
to distinguish politically correct from 

187
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,080
just being a jackass.

188
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,340
So there,
there is a difference.

189
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:41,174
I mean there's a difference between 
being rude and being politically 

190
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,370
incorrect.
Right?

191
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,010
Being being rude is telling Megan Kelly,
she's bleeding from her wherever.

192
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,220
Being politically incorrect is saying 
that some immigrants across our southern

193
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,320
border are criminals.
That's politically incorrect,

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,393
but it's not rude.
But saying that Megan Kelly's bleeding 

195
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,770
from her wherever,
that's not politically incorrect.

196
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,060
That's just being a jerk.
So,

197
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:02,670
so it was part of it that his people 
mistake the two.

198
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,740
So because.
Because the,

199
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:06,090
the reign of political correctness is so
strong,

200
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,073
people have now interpreted being 
politically incorrect as just anything 

201
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:12,600
you say that pisses someone off,
that means you're politically incorrect.

202
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,760
And that's not what political 
incorrectness is.

203
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,663
Sure.
So it's this conflation of just saying 

204
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,780
anything and he's really good at that.
I mean,

205
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,100
I've noticed the more I watched him,
it really,

206
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:21,934
you can whittle him down to some pretty 
basic stuff because he just says a lot 

207
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:27,580
of circular logic stuff and this 
person's great,

208
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,550
that person's great and they love me and
they hate me and that and that.

209
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,610
And he was actually never really saying 
anything.

210
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,990
But that is sort of the genius,

211
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,363
what I don't like about him.
And it is the genius of him because we 

212
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,020
live in a me culture and to me time and 
uh,

213
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,630
me media.
And so trump is all about trump.

214
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,170
I mean,
that's,

215
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,550
that's really the only thing that 
matters to him.

216
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,290
So if latimer potent insults him 
tomorrow,

217
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,290
that matters more than a flat,
unrepentant invade a country because all

218
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,124
that matters is trump.
And so he speaks about himself in third 

219
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,820
person and everything that he talks 
about is,

220
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,650
I'm going to do this,
I'm going to build a wall,

221
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm going to fix it.
I'm going to make a great deal.

222
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm good for the blacks.
I'm good for the Hispanic.

223
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,740
Nowhere in there do I hear as a 
conservative?

224
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,813
Nowhere in there.
Do I hear anything about what's the 

225
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:07,080
proper role of government in my life,
which is the part that I care about,

226
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:07,200
right?

227
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,610
The part I don't care about Donald 
Trump,

228
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,110
right?
I don't think he cares about me.

229
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,640
I don't think that we should care about 
each other,

230
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,010
but I want him to leave me alone.
I want Barack Obama.

231
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:14,844
I want all these people to leave me 
alone so I can live with that for a 

232
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:17,880
conservative principle.
They're just.

233
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
Yes.
Just just leave me alone.

234
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,800
Like the government was not meant to do 
this many things.

235
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,903
End of story.
I mean read the Constitution is very 

236
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,004
explicit about the things government is 
supposed to do and pretty much nothing 

237
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,544
on trump's list except for maybe border 
security is really something that the 

238
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:33,810
government ought to be doing.
And,

239
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,030
and again,
what that comes down to,

240
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,240
and this is the problem,
is I think that what the danger of trump

241
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,463
is that the left for 100 years has 
fallen in love with the idea of the 

242
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:43,680
strong man.

243
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,513
I mean,
you go all the way back to Woodrow 

244
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,033
Wilson and Woodrow Wilson is writing 
about the president should be the 

245
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:48,444
strongest man possible.
The only limits on his power should be 

246
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,930
his vision basically,
which,

247
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
you know,
could come straight from Mussolini and 

248
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:57,420
Woodrow Wilson was actually as close to 
a dictator is America has ever had,

249
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,540
that's carried through to FDR is credit 
to Lbj,

250
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,170
to Obama on the right.
At least they made overtures toward.

251
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,063
We're not going to have the strong man 
who gets involved in your life and fix 

252
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:08,364
all your problems.
Trump is the strong man and I think 

253
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:10,824
after,
after so many years of a lot of 

254
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:12,714
Americans on the right feeling 
emasculated by President Obama telling 

255
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,830
them that they're racist,
sexist,

256
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:17,760
bigot,
homophobes,

257
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,140
and by Hillary Clinton and telling them 
that we're there to kind of testosterone

258
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,230
in orientation toward the world.
Basically.

259
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,213
I wrote this yesterday.
I think that the response to trump from 

260
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:28,974
the right has basically been he's the 
biggest swing instead of balls in the 

261
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:31,764
race and because that's what he is.
I'm forum and you hear that from trump 

262
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:34,931
supporters.
Well,

263
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,350
he'll do something.
Maybe he will.

264
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,370
Maybe.
I don't know.

265
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,333
Will it be good?

266
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,220
My question is a conservative though.
So as a truth,

267
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,080
this must make you feel crazy,
right?

268
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:49,760
I mean you must be really enraged at 
your own party because it's looking more

269
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,840
and more everyday like he's actually to.

270
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,590
Yeah.
I mean,

271
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,220
I don't know to be most pest out 
honestly.

272
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:54,821
I mean,
have you got.

273
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:58,110
You've got the gop establishment,
which can I get off the Jeb Bush,

274
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:01,360
ran for the life of them and then just 
unify behind somebody like a Marco Rubio

275
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,343
and hate Ted Cruz.
So much they would side with trump over 

276
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:06,770
Cruz,
probably cruise to them as too far right

277
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,753
crews and they think he's unelectable 
and more than that cruise actually I 

278
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:13,000
think believes the things they say they 
believe so he says,

279
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:13,834
I believe in small government.
I think that we should cut the 

280
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,144
government.
I think the government shouldn't be 

281
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,674
important in people's lives and the RNC,
which makes its money off government 

282
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,730
being important to people's lives.
I mean,

283
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:25,000
how much money would you give to a 
political party if the government didn't

284
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,834
matter in your life or the RNC would 
raise $0 if no one cared what happened 

285
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:32,320
in Washington DC and so Cruz scares them
from that angle.

286
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,760
I don't think trump scares them.
I think trump,

287
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,210
trump annoys the establishment,
but he doesn't scare the establishment,

288
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,970
so I'm annoyed at the establishment.
I'm annoyed at.

289
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,300
You know,
Cruz is,

290
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:43,810
is a very good constitutional 
conservative,

291
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,913
but he's just an unfair.
He's not a great candidate by any 

292
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,554
stretch of the imagination,
and then there are the trump people who 

293
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,310
are so populist and in love with the,
the,

294
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,800
the feel of trump that they forget that 
they are,

295
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,300
that this guy could actually be 
president and like if he's president and

296
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,170
what is that going to look like?
So it's,

297
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,560
it's,
it's frustrating.

298
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,483
Definitely all the way across the board.
And I think maybe the most frustrating 

299
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,920
thing of all is that beating trump is 
actually not that hard.

300
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,430
Trump is a school yard bully and 
somebody needs to just say to him in the

301
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:10,570
last debate,
it was so clear.

302
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
If you actually want to stop trump,
you can't do a job dead,

303
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,170
whichever.
I mean,

304
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,550
Jeb stood there and he said,
you know,

305
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,241
Donald's,
you know,

306
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,074
you're,
you're,

307
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,113
you're bullying people.
And also stopping me and my mother 

308
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,150
really.
I mean all trump is.

309
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,013
If my thesis is correct that basically 
trump just represents the balls of 

310
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:29,050
American politics and the only way to 
beat that as to kick him in the balls.

311
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:30,390
Right?
I mean that figuratively speaking,

312
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:31,224
it's the only way to do it.
And he can't really or could work 

313
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:35,050
through and it might work literally.
I mean,

314
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:35,420
um,
but,

315
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,680
but the only way to really beat him is 
for somebody on the stage to say to him,

316
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,470
Donald,
you're,

317
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,120
you act like a big tough guy.
Your Papa gave you $40,

318
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:43,954
million dollars to play with.
You've never had anyone say no to you 

319
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:48,640
and your entire life,
you're a pathetic week specimen.

320
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,473
Every time somebody takes you off,
you turned as red as the background on 

321
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,210
that stage.
The other night.

322
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,044
I mean,
he actually faded into the woodwork 

323
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,240
during that debate.
And if anybody on the stage really needs

324
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:01,060
to shut the hell up and just listen for 
a second,

325
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,130
it might be used since you clearly know 
nothing about anything.

326
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,500
So what does that tell you about the 
rest of these guys?

327
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:06,700
That nobody does it.
I get it.

328
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,310
It's not in Jim's character,
right?

329
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,273
It's just not there.
I don't think it's in any of their 

330
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,580
character.
What does that say then about this,

331
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,260
this group of people?
This is why they lose.

332
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,570
I mean,
it isn't Obama's character upon would do

333
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:18,910
it and I think it's actually in 
Hillary's character.

334
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,863
I think these.
I think that folks on the left 

335
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,334
understand that presidential politics is
a knife fight and people on the right 

336
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:28,030
are constantly engaged in this game 
where it's a discussion over policy.

337
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,160
So Jeb Bush this morning,
for example,

338
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,113
he's on,
he's talking about trump and he says 

339
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,970
something to the effect of,
you know,

340
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:34,804
my,
my goal as president of the United 

341
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,873
States is to grow our GDP from a two 
percent growth rate to a four percent 

342
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:39,971
growth rate.
I thought,

343
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:40,804
yeah,
that's going to be trump.

344
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,123
That's solid argument.
Like they don't understand that most 

345
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,570
politics comes to.
It's unfortunate.

346
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:47,404
This is the way it is.
Most politics comes down to character 

347
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,104
arguments.
Once you get the character off the 

348
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,630
table,
then you can have a good policy argument

349
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,690
that most people on the left like to 
turn and say to people on the right that

350
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,010
you are just bad people.
You're a racist,

351
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:58,640
sexist,
bigot,

352
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,470
homophobes,
so we shouldn't listen to you.

353
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,810
And,
and that's what trump does so well.

354
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,300
And so what you see on the right is,
yeah,

355
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,440
but you're not a conservative.
That's,

356
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,630
that's an argument about policy.
It's not an argument about character.

357
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,340
Right?
So for a guy that obviously doesn't like

358
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:12,174
Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton,
do you at least envy the fact that in 

359
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,044
their debates,
it seems to me that it's much more 

360
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,230
substantive.
There's at least,

361
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:20,064
you know,
they're really saying I'm the 

362
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:23,820
progressive on the progressive.
Now you may hate all progressive ideas,

363
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,200
but at least there's a,
you know,

364
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:25,950
your,
you,

365
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,950
you got the d plus from the NRA and I 
got to see her.

366
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,313
So a little more of that.
So I think that they stay away from the 

367
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:32,850
character attacks,
which,

368
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,510
which I appreciate that.
That's good.

369
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,170
Although I think that,
you know,

370
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,360
in,
in Hillary's case,

371
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,194
some character attacks would be 
necessary if Bernie actually would like 

372
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:40,714
to win and not just run a campaign.
At some point he's going to have to say 

373
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,074
your corrupt,
because that's sort of saying it though 

374
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:47,770
right now,
and it's a little late,

375
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:48,231
right?
I mean,

376
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:49,360
and,
and by the way,

377
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,310
she's vicious.
I mean,

378
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,160
attacking him as a racist,
I,

379
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,860
I'll say a lot of bad things about 
Bernie Sanders,

380
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:56,770
but calling Bernie Sanders is racist,
is absurd.

381
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:57,604
And then she's so set on I have to win 
the ethnic minority vote that I'll send 

382
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:01,324
out my surrogates like David Brock to 
suggest he doesn't care about black 

383
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:04,570
lives,
which is absurd.

384
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,570
You know,
I,

385
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,050
I think that I'd like to see a little 
more character attacks on the,

386
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,660
on the left in between them anyway.
And uh,

387
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:14,110
and as far as policy,
I've watched a couple of their debates.

388
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:17,080
I have yet to see a significant area of 
disagreement.

389
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,480
I think they're just coming at it from.
We agree on everything.

390
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,450
It's just a question of how we talk 
about it to Bernie says,

391
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,520
let's talk about it honestly.
And Hillary says,

392
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:25,354
let's lie about it a little bit so that 
people don't really figure out what 

393
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,990
we're up to and then we'll do it and 
it'll be too late.

394
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,790
Right.
So I sense at least with them,

395
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,624
there's a,
there's a hillary's trying to hit 

396
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,930
burning on this that you're a big idea 
guy,

397
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,920
but actually I can get some of this 
stuff done now.

398
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,763
I don't know that the Republicans would 
be any more inclined to say that birth 

399
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:41,820
order.

400
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,840
I mean they say that,
but it's boring.

401
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,280
Right?
Kristy was saying that in every debate,

402
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:45,114
right?
You'd have Rubio and Cruz go at each 

403
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:48,260
other and then there's Chris Christie 
doing the La Jolla shores.

404
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,520
Governor.
I don't understand what you're saying.

405
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,280
What are you talking about?
Other.

406
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,070
Yeah,
because.

407
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,380
Because it's because it's a,
it's a dumb thing to do.

408
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,570
I mean he sounds like a,
he,

409
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,680
he acts like a hick when he does that.
Christie,

410
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,740
like if you're a governor of a major 
state acting like you don't know how the

411
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:04,380
political game is played or like you 
don't know what the Senate does.

412
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,640
I just don't know what these people are 
arguing about over here.

413
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,180
Exactly.
Here I am,

414
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:10,770
you know,
I do real things like hug Obama.

415
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,270
Is it?
Come on.

416
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,480
So it's all the politics.
Everybody is playing politics right now.

417
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,420
At this level,
and nobody's playing politics like we're

418
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,263
the real ideologies are,
which is why I would like to see what I 

419
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:20,850
would love to see.

420
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,610
I think it'd be good for the country is 
a sanders versus Cruz raise.

421
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,813
Right?
That would actually be a fascinating 

422
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,154
race because at that point may,
if standards can stay away from the 

423
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,230
whole you're a racist,
sexist,

424
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,250
bigot,
homophobic thing.

425
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,413
We could actually have a discussion 
about whether socialism is a good idea 

426
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,234
or a bad idea.
Is income inequality something that we 

427
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:41,880
ought to worry about or is it just 
ramifications of a free market system in

428
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:43,920
which people make voluntary transactions
happen?

429
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,350
It's that these would be interesting 
conversations,

430
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,090
but we,
we just don't get to them.

431
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,040
Right.
So the real of ideas

432
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,873
though,
be if it was sanders and had rand Paul 

433
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,660
not dropped that,
you know,

434
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,543
my,
my problem with Rand Paul was always on 

435
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,074
foreign policy.
I'm not an isolationist and so ran sort 

436
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,860
of is,
but it's.

437
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,460
But yeah,
I mean that,

438
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,400
that it would be a battle of ideas that 
would be worthwhile.

439
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,520
Yeah.
So the Republican Party in general,

440
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,354
and I hear this a lot on the left,
you know that it's this group of 

441
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:13,940
homophobes and racist and all this stuff
and I've been fighting against this.

442
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,900
I've been fighting from the liberal side
against the regressive left.

443
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:18,381
What I,
you know,

444
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:19,214
the people that are on the far left to 
me and I saw something interesting that 

445
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,840
you retweeted it and remind me who said 
this,

446
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,913
but somebody made a point of saying that
this morning Nikki Haley and an Indian 

447
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,503
American is a and Tim Scott and African 
American have both endorsed Marco Rubio 

448
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,950
who is Latin.
These are all Republicans.

449
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,083
So in Indian,
a black person and a Latino and these 

450
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:44,990
are Republicans and Tim Scott is a black
Republican from the south.

451
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,780
Somehow that messaging doesn't really 
make it through,

452
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:48,110
does it?

453
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,943
Well it doesn't because they're not real
black people are real Latino's or real 

454
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,270
forerunner of,
of,

455
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,680
of foreign extraction.
I mean,

456
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:56,570
Nikki Haley was born here,
but her parents are from India.

457
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,900
The,
that never

458
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,490
the point.
Isn't that the point of America?

459
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,970
That's what I would think.
Right?

460
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:01,420
But we,
we've,

461
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,253
we've broken down into this identity 
politics that really is quite sad and 

462
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,753
traps people in,
in a group identity rather than you're 

463
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:10,870
an individual go out and make something 
of yourself.

464
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:11,704
Go out and do something,
and this is a message that it's not 

465
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,040
popular in,
in certain quarters.

466
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:15,880
When you say to people,
look,

467
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:16,714
your life is in your own hands.
There's a lot of responsibility that 

468
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:19,414
comes with that,
which is you don't get to blame society 

469
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,740
for your problems.
This is why the.

470
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,210
I think that the Bernie Sanders 
argument,

471
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,420
the Hillary Clinton argument is wrong.
You know,

472
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,660
Bernie Sanders,
he's ever,

473
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,503
ever other tweet from Bernie Sanders is 
something like we live in a world where 

474
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,184
there's,
where there's massive income inequality 

475
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,270
and we need to do something about that.
And I think to myself,

476
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,370
well,
that's called a world of reality.

477
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:40,204
I mean,
every society in history has had income 

478
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,120
inequality,
including communist ones.

479
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,540
And you're not showing me a villain,
right?

480
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,210
You're saying reality is bad.
Blame Society for all the problems.

481
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,580
Show me an actual villain and I'm happy 
to fight them.

482
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,590
Show me some,
some ghost villain.

483
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,270
And I can't fight goes,
I just can't.

484
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,030
Right.
So when you hear that stuff though,

485
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:57,864
do you acknowledge at some level that 
there's some level of crony capitalism 

486
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,164
that keeps making the big companies 
bigger and crushing all of the small 

487
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,040
companies and I still think he's 
striking to that point,

488
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,040
but I guess he's not doing it in a 
really direct.

489
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,380
Right?
If you were attacking crony capitalism,

490
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:13,214
he and the tea party on the same page.
The problem with with the occupy Wall 

491
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,233
Street movement,
which was supposedly ripping crony 

492
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,154
capitalism,
is they were saying crony capitalism is 

493
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:21,434
bad.
Therefore the government should pick 

494
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:25,040
more companies to help or it should 
nationalized companies outright,

495
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,450
which is not the solution,
right?

496
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:29,120
If you used a crony capitalism is 
capitalism is bad.

497
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,343
First of all,
I don't like the term crony capitalism 

498
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,050
because it's not capitalism.
It's corporatism,

499
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,060
right?
Capitalism is not being.

500
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,923
Being a,
a person who operates in business does 

501
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:41,450
not make you a capitalist business.
People take loans and subsidies from the

502
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:42,420
government all the time.
That's right.

503
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,970
Capitalist thing to do.
Right?

504
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,721
So it's,
it's a,

505
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:45,554
it's a self interested thing to do,
but self interest in capitalism are not 

506
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,360
identical.
Yeah.

507
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,910
If you wanted to actually fight crony 
capitalism,

508
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,720
then cut off the tie between government 
and the private sector completely.

509
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,290
Which I would certainly prefer,
and this is part of the Republican Party

510
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,124
that I dislike.
I think there's a certainly corporate 

511
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,304
trust side of the establishment,
Republican Party that is very much in 

512
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:06,424
favor of government involvement in the 
economy and I don't like that in the 

513
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:09,724
slightest,
but that's not Bernie's real critique 

514
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,160
if,
if could,

515
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,410
because if it were a full of free market
system,

516
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,330
if the government weren't reaching out 
to people,

517
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:17,164
and by the way the government,
if you're going to argue against crony 

518
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:20,494
capitalism,
you also have to argue against 

519
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,190
government subsidized loans for people 
who can't afford them for houses,

520
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,260
right?
Which causes massive economic crashes,

521
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,950
which Bernie apparently doesn't oppose.
Redman.

522
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,823
He would like more of those things.
You would like all of us to subsidize 

523
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,090
bad.
You know that folks,

524
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,790
bad credit taking out loans.
If you actually,

525
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,653
if you got rid of all those things,
if you got rid of government 

526
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:39,694
involvement,
Bernie Sanders would still think that 

527
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,160
something was wrong.

528
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,490
If Bill Gates is earning a lot of money 
and somebody the bottom is earning none,

529
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,643
he see somebody in a room with $5 in 
somebody with one and he immediately 

530
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,790
says the guy with $5 must've stolen 
something from the guy with $1.

531
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,863
Whereas I say,
I have no evidence of that until you 

532
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:55,324
show me that evidence may be the guy 
with $5 produced more than the guy with 

533
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:58,384
$1.
So I'll follow you up that line of 

534
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,440
thinking.
So then we're,

535
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,323
where do we get to a point where it 
seems like to me at some level there 

536
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,970
should be some sort of progressive tax.
It shouldn't be necessarily.

537
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:10,270
You know,
when they talked about the one percent,

538
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,130
the studies were sort of all over the 
place,

539
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,140
but it sounds like if you were in about 
400 grand a year,

540
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,310
you're in,
you're in the one percent.

541
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,750
I'm not in the one percent I am.

542
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,000
You're in the one percent.
I agree.

543
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,881
All right,
well good.

544
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,580
I bet it took me a long time.
They got some money.

545
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,733
No,
that's why I'm in the one percent 

546
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,960
present that had to take care of their 
money,

547
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:27,880
but okay.
So either way I'm proud of that fact.

548
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:28,830
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna.

549
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,673
Act like everybody asks ashamed about 
how much money they earn in this 

550
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:32,044
country.
I think this is the only thing that's 

551
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,274
charming about Donald Trump is that I 
think that you should be proud of how 

552
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:38,650
much money you earned in this country 
because if you worked to get there,

553
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,484
I mean I spent a lot of money to go to 
law school and then I spent a lot of 

554
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,294
times slogging in the trenches and now I
make a really good living and I work a 

555
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,650
lot of hours to make that really good 
living and my wife,

556
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,523
you know,
we had to pay her entire medical 

557
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:49,954
education out of pocket and she's gonna 
be a doctor and she's going to make a 

558
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:52,090
really good living.

559
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,530
Good for her.
Good for me.

560
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,483
Good for good.
For anybody who earns a living in this 

561
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,440
country.
That's it.

562
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,700
That's it.
That's a good thing,

563
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,520
but as far as the progressive tax,
no,

564
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:00,970
I think the progressive tax,
a bunch of crap.

565
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,770
I think I know.
What about at some point,

566
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:07,090
so you get to $10,000,000
a year that it could be progressively,

567
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,580
you know,
you just don't believe in that.

568
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:10,414
No,
because I don't see why you deserve a 

569
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,630
bigger percentage of my money because I 
make more money.

570
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,210
The all taxes are is a is a gangster 
shakedown and so when,

571
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:20,534
when and that's all they are.
And so we can all agree that some 

572
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,850
gangster shakedowns are worthwhile 
because we have to pay for police,

573
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,320
but the idea that here's the problem 
with any sort of progressive tax.

574
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,303
There are three,
and this is just the general problem 

575
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:32,980
with progressive taxation.

576
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,440
You have three people in a room,
two of them are not bill gates in.

577
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:38,650
One of them is they vote two to one,
that they should take half of Bill Gates

578
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,670
as well.
Okay.

579
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:42,070
This is a simplified version of American
politics.

580
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,620
Yeah.
Here's my basic rule for all legislation

581
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:48,320
and all taxation.
If you pass this law,

582
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,423
are you willing to shoot the person who 
disobeys because that's what the 

583
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:52,844
government is.
The government is just a big shooting 

584
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,550
people machine,
right?

585
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,440
That's what the government does.
The install in,

586
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,510
whether you're talking national defense 
or the police,

587
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,730
there's certain laws or you pass them 
and you say,

588
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,300
if you just obey this law and if you 
resist me with a gun,

589
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,134
I'm willing to shoot you.
So what laws are you willing to shoot 

590
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,684
somebody over?
This seems to be a pretty good measure 

591
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:11,510
of am I?
Well,

592
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,100
so for example,
so for taxation.

593
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,050
Yes.
So the question is,

594
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,910
are you willing to shoot people who 
don't pay taxes?

595
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,710
If those taxes go for the national 
defense,

596
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:20,960
the Ta that protects us all.
The answer is yes.

597
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:21,794
Because if nobody pays that tax,
then presumably everybody dies in some 

598
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,900
sort of terrorist attack.
But if you're going to ask me,

599
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,880
you know,
are you willing to pay a progressive tax

600
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:31,940
for whatever stupid government bowl 
they're pushing today?

601
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,560
And am I willing to shoot somebody over 
that?

602
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,453
No,
I think the purpose of the tax is just 

603
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,320
as important as the percentage.

604
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,233
So is that really the problem that we 
have no idea at this point where our 

605
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,470
money goes?
Absolutely.

606
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:42,570
We just don't.
Even now I'm hearing,

607
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:43,840
you know,
Bernie will say I'm ready.

608
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,693
You know,
he talked to that guy at the town hall 

609
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,610
and the Guy said,
I earned $41,000

610
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,160
a year in Bernie admitted your taxes 
will go up,

611
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:51,230
and then he explains,
well,

612
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,750
the health costs are going to go down or
whatever.

613
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,770
That may or may not make no sense.
He says,

614
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:58,230
I'm going to tax you $5,000.
You're going to get $10,000

615
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,030
back in medical service.
What magic,

616
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,580
what magical box did you make that 
happen and is there.

617
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:04,100
Are there doctors in the back room 
there?

618
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,120
When he said that,
I was thinking,

619
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:07,260
well,
if you're healthy,

620
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,283
if the government that say I wish left 
to solutions work because they're the 

621
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:12,240
easiest solutions in the world,
right?

622
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,073
It's a recession tax.
Everybody at 100 percent redistribute 

623
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:17,630
the wealth in tomb days.
The recessions over there,

624
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,440
they're crap by the way.
They're also a moral,

625
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,550
you know,
the left,

626
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,320
the left talks about these things as 
though it's moral,

627
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,154
it's not moral to steal other people's 
wealth just because you're poorer than 

628
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:26,400
they are.
All right,

629
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,790
so let's dive in to the left.
So as I told you before we started and I

630
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,310
hinted at here,
so I came from the progressive world.

631
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,144
I've been,
I now view being progressive basically 

632
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:38,220
as a mental disorder or something,
but I consider myself classic liberal,

633
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,054
which really,
really is conservative in a lot of 

634
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,930
respects.
It's libertarian essentially.

635
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:44,070
Yeah.
It's technically defined.

636
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:46,950
It's conservative or libertarian as I'm 
somewhere in there.

637
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,950
Um,
and it seems to me that the Republicans,

638
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,750
if they would stick with what are 
supposed to be there principles that you

639
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,584
were talking about,
they would have a much better argument 

640
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:57,234
than what they have right now.
And that they don't stick to their 

641
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,230
argument.
That's part of the problem.

642
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,790
Well,
I think that what's happened is

643
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,953
government has gotten larger.
It turns into this giant grab bag of 

644
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:06,384
cash.
And so what you have is a bunch of 

645
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:10,380
constituencies in the United States who 
are dependent on these.

646
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:12,130
Grab bags of cash.
I remember I was,

647
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,970
I was down in Palm Beach,
Florida for a,

648
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,810
for conferences,
must've been five years ago.

649
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,913
And uh,
and Linda lingle who was then running 

650
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:19,210
for Senate in Hawaii,
uh,

651
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,270
was former governor of why Republican,
she was,

652
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,133
she was speaking at a,
at a synagogue and I was there and this 

653
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:25,110
little old lady,
Palm Beach,

654
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:25,944
a very rich area,
this little old lady titles up to her 

655
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,880
Pearl Necklace,
diamond earrings,

656
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:30,714
and she walks up and says,
what will you do to keep them from 

657
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,240
cutting my social security?
And I thought to myself,

658
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,703
who are you like you paid $50 into 
social security when you were 35 and 

659
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,390
you're probably getting out $3,000
a month now.

660
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,730
But because people have been made that 
promise,

661
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:47,100
they're now dependent on the government.
So what do Republicans do?

662
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,041
Republicans say,
no,

663
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:48,811
no,
no.

664
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,700
I would never do away with social 
security,

665
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,534
right?
We would transition it or we would save 

666
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,364
it.
Once you get into the business of the 

667
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,920
government takes care of you and your 
old age.

668
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Now we're just arguing over methodology.
We're not arguing over morality.

669
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,100
My view is that people have been made 
promises.

670
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,053
We have to keep those promises because 
otherwise we just have too many people 

671
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,470
who have no source of income.
You make a promise,

672
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:10,560
you keep a promise,
but if you are under a particular age,

673
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,360
no social security at all.
Take.

674
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,560
I want my money back.
Okay.

675
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,394
I'm getting 15 percent of my salary 
taken every year to be put in a fund 

676
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,130
that I will never see again.
Again,

677
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,983
I have.
I have one child and I have another one 

678
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,640
on the way.
I would much prefer to put that in a Sep

679
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,680
Ira and just let that grow with the 
stock market.

680
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:26,710
By the way,
you want stock market,

681
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,544
the boom,
take all the money out of social 

682
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,240
security and put it into companies on 
the stock market.

683
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:33,270
You want to see an actual economic 
growth curve that would do it as opposed

684
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:34,104
to pretending that it's in a lock box 
somewhere that doesn't exist when 

685
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:37,820
they're just rating it every two days 
for

686
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,380
the lockbox never existed.
Never.

687
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,120
Gore said he had the lockbox.
There was nobody.

688
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,170
There was no lock box.
It's,

689
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,490
it's a Ponzi scheme.
All right,

690
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,540
so to the left though,
because I'm with you,

691
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,050
I'm with you on that,
that they're not.

692
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,730
They're sort of just not holding to 
their principles.

693
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:50,564
So what I've seen in the left is that 
most people went from being liberal and 

694
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,124
then somehow over the last couple of 
years they've become these social 

695
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:02,660
justice warriors and they've divided 
everybody by what all our differences,

696
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:04,040
our skin color and religion and all 
that,

697
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,023
and they've picked a pecking order of 
who's the most aggrieved and that the 

698
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,370
victim is hierarchy,
the victim hierarchy.

699
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:12,050
And because of this,
uh,

700
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,050
it seems to me that it's just,
there's no end to it,

701
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,130
that that's what scares me the most 
about the ideology is there simply is no

702
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:19,964
end game with it because ultimately it 
has to eat itself because then one day 

703
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,493
you'll fight for everybody else and then
they'll come around and they'll come 

704
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:26,560
back.

705
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,210
I mean,
is what's happening on college campuses.

706
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,670
College campuses are about as left as 
it's possible to be,

707
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:33,010
except that the leftists are now eating 
their own right.

708
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,570
They're going to the administrators and 
saying,

709
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,613
you're all microaggressing us and we 
need trigger warnings and it's white 

710
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:38,734
privilege,
and they're ousting people who who were 

711
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:43,480
protesting in these buildings 40 years 
ago on the left,

712
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:44,800
and they're.
They're getting them fired now.

713
00:28:44,801 --> 00:28:46,270
I mean,
Larry Lawrence Summers was,

714
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,193
was Clinton Secretary of the treasury.
I was at Harvard when they throw them 

715
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:50,380
out,
right,

716
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,980
and they throw him out because he made 
the politically incorrect statement that

717
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,993
maybe there weren't that many women in 
the high reaches of science because 

718
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:57,514
women didn't want to be in the higher 
reaches of science or it's possible 

719
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:00,274
there weren't enough women who are 
qualified for that and they throw him 

720
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:02,660
out for that.
I mean,

721
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,190
the.

722
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,023
What's happened I think,
is that we've reached a point where the 

723
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,590
wealthiest society in the history of the
world,

724
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:11,650
the people here are the wealthiest that 
any people have ever been,

725
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,843
and we've also forgotten that there's a.
If there's any sort of ideological 

726
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,094
existential threat.
I was four when the Soviet Union 

727
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,673
collapsed,
so people my age and younger don't 

728
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:23,920
remember the Soviet Union.
They don't.

729
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,773
They don't recall it.
It's not important to their lives and 

730
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:27,664
when they think of socialism,
they think of kind of the happy dappy 

731
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:31,840
socialism of Denmark.
They never look at the tax rates,

732
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,561
but they think,
okay,

733
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:34,120
everything is going okay in Denmark.
They forget,

734
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,330
forget the fact that we've paid for 
Denmark's national security for the last

735
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,163
half century.
Forget the fact that they're now having 

736
00:29:38,621 --> 00:29:39,454
to cut their taxes.
Forget the fact they just elected a 

737
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,400
government to keep out the Islamic wave 
that's now swamping and all those things

738
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,210
go by the wayside.

739
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,043
So what happens is that all these people
kind of live off the fat of the land we 

740
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,044
all do and then rip away at the 
foundations because when you're living 

741
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,410
in such a rich society and you look at,
for example,

742
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:57,244
income inequality and you said there's 
some people who are earning millions of 

743
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,573
dollars and there are some people who 
are earning tens of thousands of 

744
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,063
dollars.
What we forget is that in human history 

745
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,700
and in human society,
the difference there,

746
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:07,534
there's literally millions of dollars 
and tens and tens of thousands of 

747
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,010
dollars and then there's where people 
have been historically which is here,

748
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,380
right?
And when you rip away the foundation's,

749
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,214
everybody's going to end up down here.
You can't just take all of the founding 

750
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:20,440
principles of small government and free 
markets and rip them away.

751
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,543
But what's happened is when young people
are always looking for a reason to 

752
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,081
fight,
I mean we,

753
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:26,230
we want to change the world.

754
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,520
That's our thing.
Changing the world.

755
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,200
One of the world's pretty good.
What do you change?

756
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,433
We've basically changed a lot of the 
external circumstances and now the 

757
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,930
question is,
you're rich.

758
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,360
You live a pretty free life,
right?

759
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,640
So what's wrong?
Only what I feel is wrong,

760
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,683
what's in here is what's wrong,
and so it's become very feelings based 

761
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,834
society.
Anything that said to me that hurts my 

762
00:30:44,831 --> 00:30:47,470
feelings is now no longer just something
hurtful.

763
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,940
It's a microaggression,
right?

764
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,920
And I can actually reach out and I can 
harm you.

765
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:51,850
I can.
I can ban you.

766
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,910
I can call the police if you hurt my 
feelings at University of Missouri.

767
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,130
There was actually when,
when this whole thing was going down,

768
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:57,964
there was there,
the University of Missouri Police 

769
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,780
Department put out a notice.
If somebody says something to you that's

770
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:03,280
racist,
call the police department,

771
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,570
right?
Seventy percent.

772
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,403
There was a poll that just came out that
70 percent of college students are 

773
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,210
comfortable with hate speech codes on 
campus.

774
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,910
Forty percent of college,
student of millennials,

775
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:13,744
people aged 18 to 34,
40 percent of them believe that speech 

776
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,434
that's offensive to women or minorities 
should be banned in the United States 

777
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:22,780
across.

778
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,090
So some of this though that young people
are just kind of dumb,

779
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,933
like the world is going to teach you 
some stuff and when you're at college 

780
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,990
you're going to be kind of dumb.
I had a guest on a couple of weeks ago,

781
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:31,824
Michael Shermer,
who said that they're all this 

782
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:35,090
microaggression stuff and all of this 
free speech,

783
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,410
as horrible as it sounds to us,
right?

784
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,320
He sort of was arguing that in a way you
could say,

785
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:43,830
this shows the progress because instead 
of having to fight for actual things,

786
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,770
they're fighting for these feelings and 
not that he was for.

787
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,604
That shows you that we've progressed and
that you know that black people aren't 

788
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,340
fighting so that they have separate 
water fountains.

789
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:55,380
They are now fighting over things that 
may,

790
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,300
that are just about feelings and that's 
obviously

791
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,280
awesome and you're right.
It's testament to the progress,

792
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,470
but I mean ted,
to golf,

793
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,860
what you were saying,
50 years ago,

794
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:03,694
black people were fighting to not have 
separate water fountains and today 

795
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,630
they're fighting to have separate water 
fountains,

796
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:08,890
right?
I mean they actually want separate black

797
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:09,724
housing at USC.
They actually wanted a separate black 

798
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:12,844
safe space at University of Missouri.
This is dangerous stuff and what's more 

799
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:18,130
dangerous is an entire political 
hierarchy.

800
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:18,964
The benefits from this because now 
you've got candidates who benefit by 

801
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,370
telling particular interest groups and 
racial groups.

802
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,380
You're a victim.
We're going to help you out.

803
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,243
The way we are going to help you out is 
by specifically calling the rest of the 

804
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:30,544
society racist.
You're a victim forever and the longer 

805
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:33,700
we can make you feel like you're a 
victim,

806
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,070
the more you're dependent on us.
Right?

807
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:36,331
Well,
what?

808
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,121
We'll just go.
I mean,

809
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,740
Hillary Clinton was doing this in in 
Harlem the other day.

810
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:40,574
She was saying,
yeah,

811
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,443
we haven't cured racism in the country 
and that's why I'm going to take 

812
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:43,994
hundreds of millions of dollars poured 
into Harlem is though nobody's poured 

813
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:46,874
hundreds of millions of dollars into 
Harlem before the only dollars into 

814
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:49,784
Harlem that are actually going to matter
are police dollars to clean up high 

815
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,234
crime areas so that investors will go in
and the reason that businesses aren't 

816
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:55,934
going into high crime areas is because 
they're high crime areas and just 

817
00:32:58,431 --> 00:32:59,380
dumping money in there and get help.

818
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,643
So you would agree that racism exists.
Of course there are people that are 

819
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:05,324
legitimate reasons.

820
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,173
It would be idiotic to think otherwise.
Of course there are legitimate racist 

821
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:09,464
and we should target them and we should 
find them and we should hurt their 

822
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:15,590
careers because racism is unacceptable.
But what I don't agree with is this.

823
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,750
I don't like fighting phantoms.
As I said earlier.

824
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,030
Institutional racism is a meaningless 
phrase.

825
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,850
Libraries are not racist.
Schools are not racist.

826
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:25,040
You have to show me a law,
a policy,

827
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,903
a person who is racist.
You can't just say American society is 

828
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:29,420
racist because that doesn't mean 
anything.

829
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,523
Show me the actual problem that we can 
discuss because when you just throw 

830
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:35,660
tautologies out there like that,
what am I supposed to do?

831
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:38,300
I mean there's no way to fight that.
There's legitimately no way to fight it.

832
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,143
That's right.
So I discussed that with Larry elder 

833
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,980
who's conservative,
but on the,

834
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,883
on the libertarian side,
and he basically said what you just 

835
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:45,794
said,
and I think some of my progressive 

836
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:47,660
friends would say,
well,

837
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:51,440
it may not be institutional anymore and 
that there are laws that existed,

838
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,060
no longer exists,
but they would say,

839
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:53,894
well,
a certain communities will get less 

840
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:57,494
because of racism just because of the 
idea of racism will get less qualified 

841
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:01,364
people to teach and that they will be 
treated differently by the police and 

842
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,280
all of that.

843
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,570
Well,
by by income level,

844
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:06,500
that's true,
but it's true.

845
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:09,350
By income level,
it's not a race and income level tend to

846
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:10,460
correlate.
Unfortunately,

847
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:11,300
but that's,
but that's,

848
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:13,520
that's more to do with income level than
it has to do with race.

849
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,354
It's not like there's somebody sitting 
in Sacramento today in California 

850
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,590
growing up black community.
We're not putting anybody in there.

851
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,900
I mean the real,
the real gap in the country,

852
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,230
especially between rich and poor is two 
parent households,

853
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,064
not race.
I mean the poverty rate in the black 

854
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:28,700
community for two parent households is 
seven percent.

855
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,600
The poverty rate in the white community 
for,

856
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,720
for a single parent household is 22 
percent.

857
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,633
So Larry said that to middle,
so that same thing and he got a lot of 

858
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:38,290
hate for it and then I got lumped into 
the because people.

859
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,320
So I'll just go with you on that for,
for the purposes just so I'll trust that

860
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:45,550
you're giving me a fair statistics 
statistics.

861
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,760
So fair enough,
but that,

862
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,633
that enrages people.
There's something about that concept I 

863
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:51,874
think that really upsets people and you 
would say that that's really because of 

864
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:54,930
the feeling.

865
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,590
Well,
yeah,

866
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,040
this is my catchphrase goes facts don't 
care about your feelings.

867
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,330
I mean there were.
The reality is,

868
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,500
yeah,
exactly.

869
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:04,710
This is as,
as we move forward and American society,

870
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:05,544
the only thing that's going to cure the 
ills that we have is looking at some of 

871
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,350
the real problems straight in the face.
I mean,

872
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:11,184
the fact is that when welfare was 
instituted in the sixties before it was 

873
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:14,964
instituted,
the black single motherhood rate was 20 

874
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:17,004
percent.
That is now in excess of 70 percent and 

875
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,374
it's not just.
It's not just impacting the black 

876
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,690
community.
It's impacting the white community.

877
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,713
Right?
The white community used to have a five 

878
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:25,680
percent single motherhood.
Right now it's in excess of 40 percent.

879
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,870
The fact is you are going to get higher 
crime,

880
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,140
you're going to get more poverty.
It's the Brookings Institute,

881
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:32,430
which is a left institute,
right?

882
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,264
I mean,
so it's a liberal institute at the 

883
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,380
Brookings Institute and they kind of 
straddle that line between liberal left.

884
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,020
They say that if you don't want to be 
permanently poor in the United States,

885
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,580
you need to do three things and three 
things.

886
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,340
Only graduate high school,
get a job in hold it.

887
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,770
Don't have a baby before you're married.
That's it.

888
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,903
And by the way,
those things have nothing to do with 

889
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:50,910
racism,
right?

890
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,480
There's not a white person there.
Let's.

891
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,833
They're very fee.
I would be hard pressed to find a black 

892
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:57,360
person in America,
almost straw man yourself there,

893
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,120
right?
I,

894
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,810
I'd be hard pressed to.
Maybe there's one.

895
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,863
Maybe there's one.
I don't know how many single black 

896
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:04,464
single mothers got pregnant because a 
white man was holding a gun to a black 

897
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,610
man's head and said,
I want you to impregnate this person.

898
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:09,660
Then leave.
Okay.

899
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:10,494
Be Single.
Motherhood is a decision that's made by 

900
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:14,790
the people who are involved in the 
sexual act and what happens afterward.

901
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,950
And it's the single best predictor of,
of gender,

902
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,770
intergenerational poverty.
So make good decisions.

903
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,863
So,
so is really the issue that when the 

904
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:24,140
left doesn't deal with these things,
honestly,

905
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,360
that then they're just handing it to the
right.

906
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:27,190
I mean,
I see this,

907
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,960
we've been talking about this a lot 
related to all this stuff with Islam,

908
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,720
Islam that because the left calls 
everyone a racist.

909
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,290
So anytime me or any of my friends that 
are talking about this,

910
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:39,050
there's not many of us on the left.
Every time we bring it up,

911
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,560
I mean I'm getting called a big left and
right and now and yet they can't say,

912
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:43,394
well,
can you point to something bigoted I've 

913
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:46,240
said or something racist and they can't,
but it's a feeling.

914
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,110
Feel offended.
They feel offended.

915
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,440
But is this where if the left doesn't 
deal with something?

916
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:52,274
So you know,
you can talk about Islam is or if the 

917
00:36:53,091 --> 00:36:53,924
deaf,
if the left doesn't deal with the roots 

918
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:56,234
of income inequality as you've laid out 
that you just hand it to the far right 

919
00:36:59,001 --> 00:36:59,781
ultimately,
right?

920
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:00,614
I mean,
doesn't this sort of explained trump to 

921
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,143
you?

922
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,850
Well,
to,

923
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,470
to a certain extent,
I think that that's right.

924
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:07,350
I think that what happens is that there 
is a,

925
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,503
in A.
I would never justify people reacting 

926
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,890
and racist fashion because you know,
you can react in a reasonable fashion to

927
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,733
stupidity.
People say silly things like single 

928
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:17,364
motherhood doesn't matter.
And I say no single motherhood 

929
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:22,190
absolutely does matter,
but what people tend to what some,

930
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,033
a certain segment of the population,
and this is true both on the left and 

931
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,381
the right,
is when they,

932
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:26,214
when,
when somebody says something they don't 

933
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,950
like,
they immediately go to racism.

934
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:29,784
I mean,
I can't tell you the number of tweets I 

935
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:31,644
have received after,
after I said that I don't like Donald 

936
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,953
Trump.
That's when the antisemites come out of 

937
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:36,630
the woodwork and it's in.
It's bizarre to me.

938
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,820
Like it's,
it's like what is,

939
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,820
what is my Jewishness have to do with 
not liking trump?

940
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,500
And as far as I'm aware of his daughters
natural convert to Judaism.

941
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,260
So it's,
it's,

942
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,120
it's weird,
but it's.

943
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,560
But um,
yeah,

944
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:50,060
and I think that it's,
it's polarizing the debate in a way that

945
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,820
need not.
We're not,

946
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,210
we're not trying to solve problems 
anymore in American politics.

947
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:54,570
I'll,
we're trying to do is demonize the other

948
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:58,300
side and turn them into the bad guy.
And so my goal is to demonize the people

949
00:37:58,301 --> 00:37:59,400
who try to demonize,
right?

950
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,000
The,
the,

951
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,500
those are the people who ought to be 
demonized.

952
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,334
If,
if your goal in politics is to make 

953
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,760
character attacks without regard to 
facts,

954
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,594
then I'm not interested in,
in debating you on on facts because 

955
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,900
you're clearly not interested in 
debating on fact.

956
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,650
Yeah,
so that's a.

957
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,483
that's a good segue because I read your 
11 rules for debating leftists and I 

958
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:17,750
just read.
I read the entire thing this morning.

959
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,910
Okay.
That's pretty good.

960
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,173
It's pretty short,
but it's on my mind and basically 

961
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:22,964
everything you said.
I was struggling when I was reading 

962
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:25,310
because I was like,
oh,

963
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,383
I'm agreeing with all of this because I 
still consider myself liberal and there 

964
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,134
is a part of me that I don't want to 
read something by a guy that's 

965
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:34,400
conservative and go,
I agree with this stuff,

966
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:35,234
but a lot of what I saw in there are the
exact tactics that I've seen this 

967
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:43,561
regressive left use on me and use on Sam
Harris and all these other relentlessly.

968
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,830
So you really gave the antidote to some 
of these things so you don't have to lay

969
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:48,664
out all 11,
but you want to pick some highlights 

970
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:50,430
because I think there's some really.

971
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,230
Yeah,
I mean a lot of them kind of turn into,

972
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,150
okay,
so I'm trying to remember all 11 off the

973
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,350
top of my head or at least give me a 
couple.

974
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,260
So.
So the.

975
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,010
The first one is that you have to 
embrace the fight.

976
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,900
You have to understand going in that 
you're in a fight,

977
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,883
usually any you have to sort of 
determine the purpose of the 

978
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,494
conversation that you're having is just 
base and this is true if you're left or 

979
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:09,820
right,
actually determine what your goal is.

980
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,280
Is your goal to convince the person on 
the other side,

981
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,290
is the person open to being convinced?
If not,

982
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,124
you're wasting your time.
Are you on a show and there's an 

983
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,120
audience,
in which case you're not speaking to the

984
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:22,120
person you're speaking to the audience,
and once you determine that,

985
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,490
understand that,
that if there's hostility,

986
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,770
you have to be ready to punch back twice
as hard.

987
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:28,960
You have to and be preemptive in that 
attack,

988
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,470
which by the way you say that's a left 
idea.

989
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,650
These are all left ideas.
These punch back twice as hard.

990
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,513
I mean,
it was President Obama who coined the 

991
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:35,730
phrase,
right.

992
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,563
He was the one who was saying that his 
supporters Audit Punch back twice as 

993
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:39,314
hard and I've sort of hijack dad because
I think that it's actually an effective 

994
00:39:41,871 --> 00:39:42,704
tactic and necessary.
I've also said that one of that is 

995
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:46,754
important at the very outset to ensure 
that the framing of questions is proper 

996
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,553
because one of the ways that the left is
succeeds and you see it in the 

997
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:54,344
Republican debates particularly is 
they'll ask a question and then the 

998
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:59,990
Republicans won't even bother to try 
reframing what the question is.

999
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:02,540
So John Dickerson,
the other night and in the CBS debate,

1000
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:05,540
he opens up with any tries to brow beat 
Ted Cruz on.

1001
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,113
You say that nobody should be confirmed 
in the last year of a presidents have a 

1002
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,070
presidents run.
Isn't it true that the constitution says

1003
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:16,220
the president gets to pick the nominee 
and Cruz instead of just saying,

1004
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,740
John,
I don't care about the timeline.

1005
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,573
I don't know what you're talking about.
We're not going to confirm anybody who 

1006
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:22,450
doesn't agree with Scalia.
Right?

1007
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:24,740
Instead of just saying that,
and it's not our obligation to do that,

1008
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,780
the constitution has many provisions.
John,

1009
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,820
you know,
instead of just reframing the question,

1010
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,270
he sort of bought into it and you and 
you see that from a lot of these,

1011
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,283
from a lot of Republicans,
they just accept the question as it 

1012
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:36,490
comes to them rather than thinking 
there's,

1013
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:37,324
there's a second question that's usually
kind of embedded in the first question 

1014
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,310
that's being asked in most in most 
debate.

1015
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,470
So those are a couple examples.
There's also,

1016
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,960
you don't have to accept the,
uh,

1017
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,843
you don't have to accept the kind of 
hero worship the that so many 

1018
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:51,164
Republicans do.
One of the frequent ones that you do is 

1019
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,810
somebody will say,
well,

1020
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,100
Ronald Reagan was for amnesty.

1021
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,050
Why do I care?
I was,

1022
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:58,000
I was too.
When,

1023
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,063
when,
when you did amnesty and what it will 

1024
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,270
look like.
You want to talk about regular or limb.

1025
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:04,220
When people try to misdirect to Bush,
you know,

1026
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,054
they don't,
like you were saying something about 

1027
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:06,920
Obama.
So they say something about Bush.

1028
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,710
So a proper answer should be FDR,
Woodrow Wilson,

1029
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,563
William Howard Taft.
Like,

1030
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,920
well,
you want to talk about Bush,

1031
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:15,170
we'll talk about Bush Obama,
we'll talk about Obama,

1032
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,213
like let's stick to the topic at hand.
So a lot of my basic rules for debate 

1033
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,340
can basically be boiled down to two,
two,

1034
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:27,110
which is get the character assassination
off the table if they were going to call

1035
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:27,891
you a racist,
sexist,

1036
00:41:27,891 --> 00:41:28,521
bigot,
homophobe.

1037
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,410
The proper response is not,
no,

1038
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:31,400
I'm not a racist,
sexist,

1039
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:32,031
bigot,
homophobe.

1040
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,860
Here's all the proof that I'm,
it's no,

1041
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:34,694
you're a jackass because you have no 
proof of calling me that and accusing 

1042
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,620
people of things without evidence is the
mark of being a jackass.

1043
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,240
Right?
And that's that.

1044
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,060
That is the proper response.
And then once that's all off the table,

1045
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,250
then we can actually have a policy 
argument.

1046
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,570
So what do you do about people that 
don't stop doing that?

1047
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:50,700
I,
I had some leave and I just let it be.

1048
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:51,803
You leave.
I mean you say this is not a worthwhile 

1049
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,150
debate.
You're an asshole and I'm leaving.

1050
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,041
There's,
there's no,

1051
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,340
there's no purpose to it.

1052
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,813
Think not picking up the fight.
And this would be whether you're on the 

1053
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:01,470
left or the right,
whatever,

1054
00:42:01,471 --> 00:42:04,830
whatever fight you're in that sometimes 
by not picking up the fight,

1055
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:06,330
you actually are strengthening them.

1056
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,031
No,
I mean,

1057
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:08,280
because I think you're strengthening 
here.

1058
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,290
Here's the logic,
right?

1059
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,360
If somebody calls me a racist and you 
say,

1060
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:11,631
no,
no,

1061
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:12,464
no,
let me explain to you why I'm not a 

1062
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,020
racist.
You what you're really saying,

1063
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,810
what you're really saying is you're 
irrational fellow.

1064
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,913
Let's have a conversation about why I'm 
not a racist by even granting the 

1065
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,200
predicate,
your rational fellow,

1066
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,760
he just called you a racist,
right?

1067
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:27,110
If you say to me,
I'm a racist,

1068
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,951
and then I say,
well,

1069
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:28,790
you're a rational thought.
Well,

1070
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:29,660
I'm saying to you,
you're right.

1071
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:30,494
I'm a racist.
You're rational fellow calling me a 

1072
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,114
racist.
A rational person could theoretically 

1073
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:34,880
think I'm a racist.
No,

1074
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,350
the answer is that's an irrational 
thought.

1075
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:37,910
You're being irrational.
What you're saying is,

1076
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:38,744
is ridiculous,
and you're a bad person for dropping 

1077
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:43,880
charges on me without evidence.
Only bad people do this,

1078
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,350
right?
If you're going to drop a charge,

1079
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,490
make sure he can back it up.

1080
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,331
Well,
that's the thing,

1081
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,164
I find that there's an incredible lack 
of being able to back it up and there's 

1082
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:51,794
a constant,
I don't know that you address this 

1083
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:53,144
specifically,
but I find it a lot of these debates 

1084
00:42:54,561 --> 00:42:55,394
when I had these debates with people,
there's a constant moving of the goal 

1085
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,860
post,
so you say something and you sort of get

1086
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:01,694
the point across and they they can even 
if they don't outwardly accept that it 

1087
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:05,294
is being intellectually do and then they
just move what they say and then they 

1088
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,990
just keep moving and moving it and then 
you're,

1089
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:10,960
you know,
you're back in Sir Circle.

1090
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,443
I do say in that pamphlet that arguing 
with people on the left is sort of like 

1091
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:16,460
trying to nail Jello to the wall.
The minute,

1092
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,380
the minute that you finished one 
argument,

1093
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,214
they're already onto the next and 
they're usually swiveling to places the 

1094
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,560
demo comfortable like same sex marriage 
or social issues because that,

1095
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,413
that,
those are,

1096
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,940
those are issues closer to the heart so 
they're,

1097
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,610
they're more comfortable for them to 
argue.

1098
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:29,843
And so if you're arguing economics,
invariably you find yourself talking 

1099
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:34,430
about why Republicans are mean to gay 
people or something.

1100
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,180
It's always a shifting goalposts because
you can't get an if they.

1101
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:39,950
If the left.
This is what I like about sanders.

1102
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,890
I think sanders will actually give 
honest answers to questions.

1103
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,110
If I say to Bernie Sanders,
Bernie,

1104
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:48,200
what constitutes income equality?
Forgetting income inequality?

1105
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:50,420
Like what gradation would it be?
Income equality.

1106
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,860
Does everybody have to earn the same?

1107
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,090
Because there's a name for that,
right?

1108
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:56,120
I mean if everybody earns the same,
the only way to do that is to confiscate

1109
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,950
all wealth and redistribute it.
That's called Communism,

1110
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:59,450
right?
I think that sanders would,

1111
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,510
would actually answer that,
but most people on the left won't.

1112
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,790
They'll just move the goal posts.
And what do you think you would actually

1113
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:05,820
say?
I think that would,

1114
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,673
he would probably say is you would say 
the sort of income inequality that we 

1115
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,650
see in Europe is,
is,

1116
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,710
is more beneficial to the,
to the United States.

1117
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:13,903
And you say,
well,

1118
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,400
okay,
that requires a 60 percent tax rate.

1119
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,234
It means that the car,
literally the prices of your car will 

1120
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:22,880
double because they have massive excise 
taxes over in Denmark and you know if,

1121
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,420
if that's something that you want to do,
you're also going to have to raise taxes

1122
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:28,340
on the poor,
raised taxes on the middle class.

1123
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,810
You're going to have to gauge the fact 
that every in America is going to leave,

1124
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,650
which is not going to be pleasant for 
you.

1125
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:35,970
Are you willing to.
Are you willing to build?

1126
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,190
Here's the thing about Bernie Sanders,
his economic policy.

1127
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,260
Donald trump wants to build a wall to 
keep people out.

1128
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,183
Bernie Sanders will have to build a wall
to keep businesses in because they will 

1129
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,274
leave.
They actually have to chain them to a 

1130
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,430
stake in order to keep them here.
All right,

1131
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,160
so we've talked about a lot of stuff 
that we sort of agree on.

1132
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,840
I haven't agreed with everything,
but I'm letting you talk.

1133
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,100
People always yell at me.
They say,

1134
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:54,620
you don't.
You don't yell back at your,

1135
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,280
well let's,
let's do it.

1136
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,240
Let's do this by.
So let's,

1137
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,680
let's get into some other stuff.
So the gay marriage,

1138
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,500
let's talk to a marriage or you're not 
big on gay marriage?

1139
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,390
No,
I'm not at a.

1140
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,253
not on a social level.
I think the government ought to be 

1141
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:06,510
completely out of the business of 
marriage.

1142
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,520
I think the government sucks at 
everything is my.

1143
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,413
Is My short message for today.
The government is terrible at 

1144
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:11,694
everything.
If the government's goal is to forward 

1145
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:15,510
traditional marriage,
utterly failed obviously.

1146
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:19,380
As you don't mind to being out of the 
business of traditional marriage at all.

1147
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,243
No,
I think that.

1148
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,750
I think the government should be out of 
all marriage.

1149
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,440
I think the government stinks at this,
you know,

1150
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,490
now I will say that.
Do I think that the.

1151
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,324
I think the idea of the government 
subsidizing gay marriage is silly 

1152
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:31,380
because I don't think that there's 
societal benefit to gay marriage.

1153
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:32,214
If you're going to make the argument 
that government should be involved in 

1154
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:34,434
marriage at all,
just not even an argument with which I 

1155
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:38,220
agree at this point the way it is right 
now.

1156
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,460
Let's go from that.
Okay.

1157
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:42,390
So before I get there,
one quick point.

1158
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:43,224
The reason I want the government out of 
the business of marriage is because now 

1159
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:46,860
that the government has enshrined gay 
marriage,

1160
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:47,783
the next step is going to be going to 
religious people and telling them they 

1161
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:53,730
have to engage with same sex weddings.
So as a religious person,

1162
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,713
this is problematic to me.
I want a society in which I can do what 

1163
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,504
I want and I don't have to care what you
think and you can do what you want and 

1164
00:45:59,041 --> 00:45:59,874
you don't have to cover it.
I think it doesn't mean you get to come 

1165
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:01,764
into my synagogue and get married.
It also doesn't mean that I have to go 

1166
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:04,314
to your gay wedding.
That's an interesting place to have the 

1167
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,990
discussion because I would argue for gay
marriage for the exact reasons.

1168
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:12,330
I don't want the government involved in 
all of these things.

1169
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,193
Right,
and that's exactly why gay marriage 

1170
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,190
should exist and I think it ran Paul.
It hit that point harder.

1171
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,143
It would have made a sensible 
libertarian argument of limited 

1172
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:22,480
government and you know what,
dude?

1173
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,210
Go ahead and you want to smoke weed on 
you and your bright.

1174
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,063
Well,
I tend to agree with both of those 

1175
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:26,191
things.
I agree with,

1176
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:27,600
and by the way,
I find people who smoke weed,

1177
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,970
unbelievably irritating,
but that's not my business.

1178
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,933
I mean,
this is the beauty of America is you 

1179
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:34,290
don't have to give a crap what I think 
we said this is what you end the show by

1180
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,460
taking the bong hit.
Oh yeah.

1181
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:37,500
Well that's going to be awkward then.
But,

1182
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,660
but the uh,
the,

1183
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:40,494
the uh,
as far as the secondary argument about 

1184
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:43,740
let's,
let's take the predicate that government

1185
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:44,574
is now involved in marriage.
Should government subsidized gay 

1186
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,690
marriage and straight marriage the same 
way?

1187
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:49,823
My answer is no,
because the only purpose for the 

1188
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:52,014
government getting involved in marriage 
is the procreation of the next 

1189
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,620
generation and the raising of that 
generation.

1190
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,770
And it's my belief that a man and a 
woman to a better job of raising a child

1191
00:46:58,771 --> 00:46:59,604
and producing children,
obviously biologically than two men or 

1192
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:04,350
two women.
What is it isn't the child.

1193
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:05,700
Part of it is sort of secondary.
I mean,

1194
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,710
there are plenty of people that get 
married,

1195
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,620
gay couples and straight couples that 
don't have kids.

1196
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,600
There's a siren in and of itself is in 
just about,

1197
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,523
but at a governmental level,
I don't care about those people are 

1198
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:17,850
meaning like I care that I'm happy that 
they're happy,

1199
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,160
but I don't,
I don't really care what they do.

1200
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:21,180
Like it didn't,
it doesn't.

1201
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,373
The government theoretically has an 
interest in the production of the next 

1202
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,740
generation,
right?

1203
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,110
That's the only interest in marriage.
So in fact,

1204
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,030
you could even make a case to government
ought to be giving,

1205
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
you know,
basically tax benefits for,

1206
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,270
for having kids,
um,

1207
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,070
and no benefit for marriage,
right?

1208
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,051
But,
but the truth is,

1209
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:38,884
the reason that this was created in the 
first place obviously is because before 

1210
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:41,764
the advent of,
I mean,

1211
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,260
long before the advent of modern birth 
control,

1212
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,740
the,
the fair assumption was that if you were

1213
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:50,080
having sex,
then you are going to get pregnant,

1214
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,393
right?
At least if you were having straight 

1215
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:52,930
sex,
you're going to have pregnant,

1216
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:56,200
you were going to get pregnant.
And thus we wanted to incentivize people

1217
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:58,990
to stick around for that because single 
motherhood is bad for the community.

1218
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,140
And so we're going to subsidize that 
with tax benefits.

1219
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:02,974
By the way,
there is no,

1220
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,440
there is no marriage benefit.
There's a marriage penalty.

1221
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,273
My wife and I pay a significantly higher
tax rate because we have a combined 

1222
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:08,710
income.
Right?

1223
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,280
So you're not against still despite 
coming from some sort of.

1224
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,650
It's not a religious art,
religious art.

1225
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,960
That's what I want to distinguish 
because of court,

1226
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,270
because we should be for a separation of
church and state.

1227
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,880
And I think you are for separation 
truths.

1228
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:21,723
So the separation of church and state 
means that I just want to make a quick 

1229
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,320
distinction or separation of church and 
state doesn't mean that I can't bring my

1230
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,154
religious values to bear and how I vote.
It just means that I can't leverage 

1231
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,053
Jewish ritual on you.
There's no establishment of Jewish 

1232
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:34,420
religion,
Christian religion.

1233
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:35,254
But I should be able to make a secular 
argument for why what I'm saying is 

1234
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:38,944
right is my general rule because 
otherwise we're operating in different 

1235
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:42,130
spheres.
If I cite the Bible,

1236
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:43,000
it makes no difference to you.

1237
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,100
You don't care about the Bible.
So.

1238
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,090
Right.
So I'm,

1239
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,710
I'm a secular Jew.
I would consider,

1240
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,553
I mean I'm an atheist so it doesn't.
Judaism is ethnic and irrelevant every 

1241
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:53,410
other respect.
I like her.

1242
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,510
You like her?
Who Curb your enthusiasm?

1243
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,373
Oh,
well,

1244
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:57,283
hey,
I mean that's cultural Judaism like 

1245
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,730
bagels and Matzah balls and I don't 
care,

1246
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,010
you know,
I feel pretty good it.

1247
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,801
Okay.
Okay,

1248
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:03,634
so let's not get hung up with that,
but you're making the distinction 

1249
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,050
between.
This isn't coming from a religious place

1250
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,063
now.
I think part of the problem when it 

1251
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:12,940
comes to gay marriage is that a huge 
portion of the Christian right is trying

1252
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:15,570
to impose their religious values on 
this.

1253
00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:16,404
So it itself isn't religious,
but the Po know the rationale for the 

1254
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,163
policy can.
This is one where I'm making the 

1255
00:49:20,741 --> 00:49:21,574
distinction.
The rationale for people voting can 

1256
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:25,420
still be religious,
but if the policy is not religious,

1257
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,000
if there's a secular rationality is what
Scalia said about it actually,

1258
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:31,600
if there's a secular rationale to it 
than the motivations of the voters don't

1259
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,200
matter.

1260
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,033
Like I don't care what the motivation of
the voter is in virtually any 

1261
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:36,520
circumstance,
I matter what the vote is.

1262
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,013
Right?
And if somebody wants to vote for lower 

1263
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:39,874
taxes,
I don't care whether they're doing it 

1264
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:41,284
because they're on principle for lower 
taxes or whether they personally want 

1265
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:45,154
lower taxes on their income.
I just care about the outcome of the 

1266
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:47,320
vote,
the outcome with a boat.

1267
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,154
Okay.
So basically you don't care about gay 

1268
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:53,550
marriage as the contract ends right now,
you simply don't care.

1269
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:58,060
You're one concern though,
is that ultimately this will lead to the

1270
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,750
government forcing gay marriage on 
synagogues that don't want to have it,

1271
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,610
or mosques that don't want to.
Not Ultimately.

1272
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:04,444
Like now in California,
they've already passed laws that you 

1273
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:07,234
have to teach.
Same sex marriage in public schools for 

1274
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:09,034
example.
Like it changes the nature of the 

1275
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:11,110
teaching.
My view on that is,

1276
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:11,610
I don't know why the.

1277
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,050
I went to public school for elementary 
and junior high.

1278
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,630
I don't understand why the government is
teaching me anything about this stuff.

1279
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,720
This is for my parents to teach me like 
this.

1280
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,583
This is a values thing.
So I guess that's sort of where it's 

1281
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:23,554
just values just get completed with what
we're taught like well as sort of a to 

1282
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:29,120
know.
I mean there are no values to math right

1283
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:29,954
there no valid Matthew Bright,
but there are no values to biology 

1284
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,070
there.
Their,

1285
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,370
their values to history,
which is why it's dicey and it's.

1286
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:37,520
And it's disingenuous what the left has 
done with the education system.

1287
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:41,220
There are multiple perspectives on 
history and the monopolistic takeover of

1288
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,343
the liberal arts is a real problem and 
you can have multiple perspectives on 

1289
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:45,824
that.
But we're not teaching marriage in the 

1290
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:49,550
context of history or English.
We're teaching in the context of science

1291
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,290
which has nothing to do with anything.

1292
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,880
So when again,
you a PC comes in.

1293
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:53,740
I mean when I was,
when,

1294
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:55,790
when they're doing sex ed,
when I was in junior high,

1295
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,910
they're making a big deal out of the 
idea that everybody,

1296
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,803
you know,
everybody is equally likely due to get 

1297
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:02,720
aids for example.
Not True.

1298
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:03,823
I mean it's just not true,
but it aids is a behavioral driven 

1299
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:07,760
disease or if you don't,
I will never get aids.

1300
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,683
Right.
Barring a barring a blood transfusion 

1301
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,680
that that has aids,
I don't,

1302
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:12,623
I don't do an intravenous drugs and I 
don't have promiscuous sex and I was a 

1303
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:17,350
virgin when I married my wife and she 
was a virgin when she married me.

1304
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:18,190
So we're,
so we're,

1305
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,200
we're safe,
right?

1306
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,620
We're,
we're,

1307
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,453
we're good.
We're about to save as you can get on 

1308
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:22,970
this and so.
So I don't like the,

1309
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:23,804
the again,
the facts being trumped by what we 

1310
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,270
wished the facts were so that we can 
push certain political agendas.

1311
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,133
Right.
So how do you then taking this argument 

1312
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:34,034
from a secular place?
How do you then feel being in the same 

1313
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:36,944
party that have so many people that are 
taking it from a right wing Christian 

1314
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,630
place?
Because there isn't there.

1315
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,260
There's a seemingly odd alliance there 
that I think is a.

1316
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,950
I agree with them on the end point.
I even agree with them religiously.

1317
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:50,830
I just don't think they're good 
spokespeople for their cars.

1318
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,670
I mean,
I think that if you,

1319
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,481
if you,
if you are,

1320
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:56,420
if you're a chief citation to your 
opposition to gay marriage,

1321
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,860
is leviticus 18,
22?

1322
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,993
I don't think that that's a solid 
argument that's going to convince a lot 

1323
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,534
of people.
Right?

1324
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,351
Uh,
I think that,

1325
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:04,184
you know,
there are better arguments against gay 

1326
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:06,310
marriage than that.
Right?

1327
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,220
Um,
and so,

1328
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,113
you know,
this is something I talk about at 

1329
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:09,494
religious schools and I've been asked by
pastors and rabbis and priests to talk 

1330
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,540
to students about,
okay,

1331
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,374
you have these religious principles.
Is there any justification outside of 

1332
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,840
the Bible says,
so for why this is correct.

1333
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,870
And as a religious person who actually 
thought through his positions,

1334
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,440
I tend to believe there is,
like I see it as a religious person.

1335
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:30,080
I believe that God didn't create stupid 
rules.

1336
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,300
So if you believe that God didn't create
stupid rules,

1337
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,433
then you have to come up with some sort 
of justification for the rules that are 

1338
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:37,334
being expressed.
Like there's something you can 

1339
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:40,010
understand that just an article of 
faith,

1340
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:40,810
but,
but the,

1341
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,560
the,
the big ones about human behavior,

1342
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,633
there should be a decent rationale.
You can explain to people who don't buy 

1343
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:46,880
into revelation.

1344
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,760
Sure.
So there I would just say,

1345
00:52:48,761 --> 00:52:50,410
well,
you're basing your belief in God.

1346
00:52:50,411 --> 00:52:52,660
It's just a belief,
not anything that can be proven,

1347
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:55,390
so relative.
So no,

1348
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:55,571
no,
no,

1349
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:56,404
but anyone that's basing anything on 
religion is just based on some unproven 

1350
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:01,174
thing that is,
I would say I want that nothing to do 

1351
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:02,900
with my life

1352
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,733
that which is,
which is fine and that's why we live in 

1353
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,400
America.
Good.

1354
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:05,780
Yeah,
but,

1355
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,890
but,
but I will say this,

1356
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,990
every belief system is based on 
something unproven.

1357
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,480
All of them.
Human rights means nothing.

1358
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,130
Where do you get that?
Your basis of human rights

1359
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,370
from a feeling.
How about that?

1360
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,230
Exactly.
I just get you to subjective.

1361
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,671
Well,
right.

1362
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:18,870
But that's a,
that's a blend.

1363
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:21,390
So you're saying basically where the 
liberals would say,

1364
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:22,224
I'm for this because I'm for gay people.
I want gay people to be able to do what 

1365
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,033
want to do and

1366
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,920
pursue happiness.
Like anyone else you would say,

1367
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,200
well this has nothing to do with 
government and whatever.

1368
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,770
So I can't.
There's not a lot of.

1369
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,100
Not a lot of conflict here.
Yeah.

1370
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,050
My governmental policy,
because I'm basically a libertarian is,

1371
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,200
is I don't care about that.
Again,

1372
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:41,034
the government,
what do we strengthen that group of 

1373
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,270
people so clearly we don't agree quite 
agree on this thing,

1374
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,283
but I understand your rationale and 
you're not trying to stop gay people 

1375
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,420
from getting married.
I think right now,

1376
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,430
I think right now the next conflict is 
not going to come from the right.

1377
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,990
It's going to come from the left pushing
the ball,

1378
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,890
meaning that it's going to come from the
case in Oregon with this Baker who,

1379
00:53:58,891 --> 00:53:59,351
who,
you know,

1380
00:53:59,351 --> 00:54:01,470
doesn't want to service a same sex 
wedding,

1381
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,910
doesn't want to actually have to cater 
it.

1382
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:04,290
Uh,
as uh,

1383
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,124
you know,
I think that good hearted people should 

1384
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:06,901
say,
fine,

1385
00:54:06,901 --> 00:54:07,710
you do what you want.

1386
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,080
Go across the street to the bakery.
Like,

1387
00:54:09,081 --> 00:54:10,100
okay,
that's what I would say.

1388
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,330
And this is the difference,
you know,

1389
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:13,164
liberal and leftist in a nutshell,
this is the difference between liberal 

1390
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:17,550
and leftist.
Liberal says your business,

1391
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:18,770
I don't care.
I left.

1392
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:19,630
It says,
no,

1393
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,011
no,
no,

1394
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:22,410
no.
I think it's imperative that you will be

1395
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,270
made to care.
Right?

1396
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,110
And Erik Erickson's phrase,
you'll be made to care.

1397
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:27,750
Somebody is going to,
a man will come to your house with a gun

1398
00:54:27,751 --> 00:54:29,940
and he will tell you that if you do not 
cater this wedding,

1399
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,520
this is what they were forced by a 
hundred $75,000,

1400
00:54:32,521 --> 00:54:33,354
fine for not catering,
lesbian wedding or there's a bakery 

1401
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:36,660
across the street,
you know this is,

1402
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,260
this is really an a farrier stuff,
so this is where you're asking where the

1403
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,750
momentum comes from.
This is where the momentum comes from.

1404
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:43,584
So when I make an argument to 
conservatives and religious people that 

1405
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:47,670
the government ought to get out of the 
business and marriage.

1406
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,830
I'm not saying that because I'm pro gay 
marriage,

1407
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,260
very much anti gay marriage in the 
social sense.

1408
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:54,440
I don't think that that,
you know,

1409
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,690
as as a religious person,
I think homosexuality is a sin.

1410
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:59,730
I think lots of things are sentenced 
that people engage in.

1411
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,170
I think they should be free to engage in
them,

1412
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,540
but as a religious person,
that's not.

1413
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,643
That's not my thing.
I don't think that gay marriage is a 

1414
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,104
great,
massively good thing for society on a 

1415
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,920
social level,
but on a governmental level,

1416
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,070
if you guys don't just get out of this 
business entirely,

1417
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,173
the left has no end point.
They're only endpoint is using the 

1418
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:19,920
government as a club against you.
So now that they've got gay marriage,

1419
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,230
it will go to,
it will go to.

1420
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,363
We're going to stop accrediting schools 
that don't teach gay marriage or higher 

1421
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,240
homosexual employees.

1422
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,150
Right?
And you've got Catholic churches say,

1423
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:29,984
I don't want to pay the health benefits 
of somebody gay partner that's a 

1424
00:55:32,231 --> 00:55:34,280
Catholic church.
Why should it have to write?

1425
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,340
But the left would say,
no,

1426
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:37,080
they have to be.
You will be made to care.

1427
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:39,060
This is why you're a bad person if you 
don't do this.

1428
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,860
And so if so,
what am I arguments?

1429
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,000
The rightest sensible liberal.
Right?

1430
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:43,853
Exactly.
So this is.

1431
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:44,803
But,
but this way you'd actually get heavy 

1432
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,044
argument from the not so sensible 
liberals probably including all of the 

1433
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,194
democratic nominees.
The the fact is that what I'm saying is 

1434
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:56,340
the best argument for the Libertarian 
position on the right here is gonna be a

1435
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:58,410
rear guard action.
It's not going to be.

1436
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,433
It's better for straight people be in.
It's bad for gay marriage to get it out 

1437
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:02,784
of that realm.
It's I think that if you want to fight 

1438
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:05,154
against gay marriage,
do it on the social level with your 

1439
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:06,714
church,
teach your kids what you want to teach 

1440
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,030
them,
but when it comes to,

1441
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:11,340
when it comes to making this argument to
conservatives,

1442
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,420
the real argument is if you don't take 
power out of the hands of government,

1443
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:18,990
if you don't take that ring away from 
Gollum and throw it into mount zoom,

1444
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,490
then it will be used against you.

1445
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,110
There will.
The government is just government is the

1446
00:56:23,111 --> 00:56:23,330
rate.

1447
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:24,163
So does this.
I my direct message at the top of the 

1448
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:26,474
show,
I was talking about just how stupid our 

1449
00:56:27,111 --> 00:56:30,200
election system is and how everything's 
down to soundbites and everything in our

1450
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:34,400
debate is so nonsensical and all that.
So everything you just laid out there is

1451
00:56:34,401 --> 00:56:35,234
a much more clean and clear explanation 
and where you actually are separating 

1452
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:40,790
church and state and doing the 
intellectual rigor to,

1453
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,713
to make a sensible argument where if 
they talk for the little bit that 

1454
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:44,804
they've talked about gay marriage,
which I'm glad because I don't think it 

1455
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:46,874
should be talked about that much.
It let it be and that that will be fine 

1456
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:50,340
in my opinion.
Um,

1457
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,480
but nobody,
you know,

1458
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,600
Marco Rubio,
we'll talk about the family,

1459
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,600
but he's purely doing it from a 
religious perspective.

1460
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,270
Well,
there's an identity politics that's been

1461
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:00,970
created on the right in response to the 
identity politics of the left.

1462
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:03,100
So if we're going to be attacked as 
religious people,

1463
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:06,610
we have to talk as religious people.
I have to go preach from a pulpit and if

1464
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,120
I don't cite,
you know,

1465
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,200
if I don't say genesis to talk about a 
man shall leave his,

1466
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,990
a man shall leave his parents and cling 
to his wife.

1467
00:57:12,991 --> 00:57:14,230
If I don't.
If I don't cite that,

1468
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,393
then I haven't spoken to the incode that
shows that I care about the values of 

1469
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,240
people.
Like you and the,

1470
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,850
and this is the way the political game 
is played,

1471
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:22,684
so again,
I sort of wished that Americans would 

1472
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:25,900
see through the political game on all 
sides,

1473
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,460
meaning I wish religious people would 
just say,

1474
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,593
I agree.
I understand you're anti gay marriage 

1475
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:32,920
and I also understand what you're doing 
here to protect religious people and you

1476
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:33,754
don't have to cite Bible verses at me to
prove it and it and you end up with 

1477
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,250
idiocies like Donald Trump on stage 
waving around a bible,

1478
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:40,084
pretending he gives a damn what's in it,
ms dot two after two marriages and 

1479
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:43,763
several adulterous affairs and all the 
and bragging about having his 

1480
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,550
experiences with married women standing 
up there with the Bible and going,

1481
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:52,590
this is an even better book than the out
of the deal is if this is,

1482
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,470
this is how you vote.

1483
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,150
If you're able to be pandered to that 
way,

1484
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:57,820
that's a sad commentary on American 
politics and in its way.

1485
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:00,550
It's really no different from Hillary 
Clinton going to the black community and

1486
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:01,640
saying,
you're the victims.

1487
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,790
You're the victims,
and now I'm going to speak the language.

1488
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,320
You understand?
Here's,

1489
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,060
here's how you know that I care about 
you.

1490
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,770
I'm not big into caring,
you know,

1491
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,491
I'm not,
I,

1492
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:10,324
I think that people who presumed to care
about you are generally people who want 

1493
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,480
the power to control your life.
The only people that,

1494
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:18,314
that I want power in their lives and 
they want power in my life or my 

1495
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,630
immediate family.
That's it.

1496
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,711
You know,
my parents,

1497
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,390
my sisters,
my wife,

1498
00:58:25,391 --> 00:58:27,750
my children,
and their independent human beings too.

1499
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,870
Right?
So caring,

1500
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,733
caring is the,
is the way that caring is the way that 

1501
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:33,220
the left controls.
Like they never,

1502
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:34,660
they don't come with the Jack boots 
first.

1503
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,340
They first come and they say,
we care so much about you.

1504
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:38,500
We have to do these things for you.
And by the way,

1505
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:39,790
we brought some guns to help out.

1506
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,713
Right?
So it shows sort of the beauty or the 

1507
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:45,490
scariness of identity politics because 
it sounds really good.

1508
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:48,310
I guess what they always say,
socialism will come with a big smile,

1509
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:48,660
right?
Yeah,

1510
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,800
exactly.
This is John Goldberg's point in Liberal

1511
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,040
Fascism.
Yeah.

1512
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,770
Yeah.
Um,

1513
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,990
all right,
so we only have a couple minutes left,

1514
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:53,824
but let's do it.
Let's just knock out a couple of other 

1515
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:55,444
things.
So I saw when you were on piers Morgan 

1516
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:57,844
with that whole gun thing way back when 
and I watched it again in preparation 

1517
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:03,310
for this and I never liked piers Morgan.
I thought he was doing a talk.

1518
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:05,890
Show you the wrong way.
I hope people don't view me in that way,

1519
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,413
but what you did with him in the 
argument was really kind of brilliant 

1520
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,660
and it goes to,
it goes to some of the 11th before.

1521
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:14,650
But before even ladies,
anything,

1522
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,350
I don't really agree with your,
with your stance on guns.

1523
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,413
Um,
so can you sort of recap happened and 

1524
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:22,080
then we'll show

1525
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:22,430
her?
Well,

1526
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,690
first of all,
like trump,

1527
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:26,630
now that you've complimented me like 
gluten free person,

1528
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,670
now you're a good person.
I read the,

1529
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,880
it's all good.
So what,

1530
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:31,993
what happened in that debate is that 
piers Morgan had basically been doing a 

1531
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,690
lot of the things we're talking about 
for weeks.

1532
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,524
You'd been saying after Sandy Hook that 
anybody who disagreed with him on gun 

1533
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:39,764
control,
the only possible reason to disagree 

1534
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:44,480
with him is because you don't care about
what happened on gun control and you saw

1535
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,920
Barack Obama do this,
you know,

1536
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:48,200
after the,
after the last mass shooting right after

1537
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:51,320
Umpqua community college and he got up 
there and,

1538
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,173
and he,
he did the teary eyed routine and I 

1539
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,570
don't like tears.
Stop.

1540
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,980
Like just,
just give me your policy.

1541
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,410
So what.
So what I said to the tiers,

1542
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:02,740
I think design in a weird way.
I don't.

1543
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,360
It is tiring out over here.
Bama,

1544
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,730
and I think Obama is an unusually 
skilled politician and I think he worked

1545
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:08,564
himself up to tears.
I think that I think that good actors 

1546
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:11,740
can.
I think that,

1547
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,330
you know,
the,

1548
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:15,200
the idea that the emotion is fake is 
that I don't think they motions fake,

1549
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:16,760
but the emotional factors isn't fake 
either.

1550
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,710
If you talked to actors who work 
themselves up to tears,

1551
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:20,510
they actually feel sad when they are 
crying.

1552
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,130
That's how you get yourself to cry.
Right.

1553
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,960
I think Obama worked himself up there 
because otherwise you'd be fine.

1554
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,710
Otherwise you'd be crying every other 
press conference.

1555
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:28,544
I mean,
he's talking about all sorts of crap 

1556
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:30,380
that goes on in the country.
That's terrible.

1557
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,233
Like how many.
Every time he gets out there and you 

1558
01:00:32,451 --> 01:00:34,220
talked about the economy be crying.
I mean,

1559
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,110
you'd be completely emotionally 
unstable.

1560
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,730
It's one of the two.
So it's.

1561
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:38,221
So,
uh,

1562
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:39,054
so what I said to Piers Morgan is I said
you're a bully and the way that you 

1563
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:42,884
bullied people as you stand on the 
graves of the children of Sandy Hook to 

1564
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,180
push her political agenda.
And he didn't know how to come back from

1565
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:50,330
that because that was his entire 
strategy and now it had been unmasked.

1566
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,373
And actually during the break he had 
planned to bring in a kid who had been 

1567
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,910
shot and was in a wheelchair and say,
well,

1568
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:58,040
you've said it to me now.
Say it to the small pool,

1569
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:58,883
a child.
And he couldn't do it because if you've 

1570
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:01,430
done that,
I immediately would have said,

1571
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:02,264
first you stood on the graves of the 
kids and now you're standing on this 

1572
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,390
poor guy's wheelchair.
It's terrible.

1573
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:06,883
But it's so.
So that was sort of the content of the 

1574
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:11,560
argument he tried to.
He tried to throw the.

1575
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,260
The Ronald Reagan was in favor of 
banning assault weapons at me.

1576
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,960
I don't care as I've said what Ronald 
Reagan had to say.

1577
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,250
He was a guy.
Sometimes he's right.

1578
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:21,500
Sometimes he's wrong.
So he wasn't a God.

1579
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:22,310
Is that?
Yeah,

1580
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,170
exactly.
That,

1581
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,160
that has a religious person.
I only have one and got him.

1582
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,111
Yeah,
exactly.

1583
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:29,190
So that's not the one we knew that I 
knew there was more.

1584
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,770
Right.
It's just not Reagan.

1585
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,611
Reagan.
Okay,

1586
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:32,710
got it.
And I know,

1587
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,620
cause he's not back.
Right.

1588
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,690
He could be,
he could be weird.

1589
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:37,090
But.
So.

1590
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,630
So my feelings on the gun thing is that 
basically,

1591
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,580
because I believe in the second 
amendment,

1592
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:43,930
people should have access to guns.
As you clear.

1593
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,620
It's clear after an hour together.
I'm not a huge fan of the government,

1594
01:01:46,621 --> 01:01:47,454
so I do believe people should be able to
protect themselves and all of those 

1595
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:50,970
things.
What I think is that we're.

1596
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,710
We should be able to control it a little
bit more than we are a.

1597
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,653
I think that the NRA does wield too much
power and then I would say at the same 

1598
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:00,450
time as I always say,
two things can be true.

1599
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:01,284
At the same time.
We have a massive mental health problem 

1600
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:03,624
in this country and that's the part that
we're not talking about because every 

1601
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:10,170
commercial for every cable news channel 
is for some other drug that it turns out

1602
01:02:10,171 --> 01:02:12,570
that some crazy percentage of these 
shooters are on.

1603
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,900
Right?
So when it comes to gun violence,

1604
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:14,734
there's two problems.
There's an inner city violence which 

1605
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:16,864
really is,
is a matter of gang violence and and 

1606
01:02:18,731 --> 01:02:21,960
people shooting each other unfortunately
because they're.

1607
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,800
Because they're involved in gangs and 
it's happening every day in Chicago,

1608
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:26,634
but we've never actually.
And Los Angeles and Washington DC and 

1609
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:29,994
all the major cities.
I mean this is all the heavily gun 

1610
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,610
controlled areas,
democratic areas.

1611
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:35,550
These are the places where people are 
getting killed on mass and then you have

1612
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:39,150
the mass shooting issue and the mass 
shooting issue is largely because in the

1613
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:40,500
19 sixties,
in 19 seventies,

1614
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:41,334
this is the one area where I think the 
government actually should be involved 

1615
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:43,763
in the 19 sixties in 19 seventies there 
was a decision that was made basically 

1616
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:47,484
all across the country to empty out all 
the mental facilities because there was 

1617
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:52,470
an idea that went around the country and
gained a lot of traction.

1618
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,080
That mental illness was basically one 
flew over the cuckoo's nest.

1619
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:57,900
Nobody was seriously crazy.
Everybody was just eccentric and this is

1620
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:59,580
why you have a mass growth and homeless 
people.

1621
01:02:59,581 --> 01:03:00,414
In 1960 there are.
How many people do you think in 1960 

1622
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:04,530
were in mental institutions in the 
United States?

1623
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,030
I mean,
I can't imagine.

1624
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:08,250
I would guess half a million or half a 
million.

1625
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,600
Half a million people.
Right.

1626
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,370
And we had half the population.
Then right?

1627
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,800
Today there's 25,000
people in mental facilities.

1628
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:14,873
So you've got a lot of violent people on
the streets and so you have a lot of 

1629
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:17,694
island people on the streets.
You're going to end up with more mass 

1630
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:21,450
shootings and that's why every time 
there's a mass shooting,

1631
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:22,284
almost invariably it's somebody who is 
crazy and we've known they're crazy and 

1632
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:26,304
involuntary commitment laws are really,
really difficult because you have to 

1633
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:30,024
show that the person is a threat to 
themselves or others as opposed to the 

1634
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:35,130
old standard which was they're incapable
of caring for themselves.

1635
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,930
One of the big problems with paranoid 
schizophrenia,

1636
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:41,010
which is flooded a lot of these shooters
a is that you have the.

1637
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:41,844
You have a condition where you literally
can't even recognize that you have the 

1638
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:44,544
condition,
so you won't take your drugs if we let 

1639
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,644
you out and you'll just go off the drugs
and you'll go right back to doing what 

1640
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,490
it was that you were doing in the first 
week.

1641
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,333
And the drugs often is part of the 
people that are off the drugs and it's 

1642
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:53,574
people that are on most of the.
Most of the people who are committing 

1643
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:56,814
these acts are not on heavy medication.
Most of the people who are committing 

1644
01:03:58,411 --> 01:03:59,244
these acts are people who have gone off 
their medication and they have 

1645
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:02,910
significant mental illness and they need
to be medicated.

1646
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:05,020
So you know,
this is an area where the,

1647
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:07,080
the mental health system is dramatically
underfunded.

1648
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,680
The laws are complete when it comes to 
people who legitimately cannot take care

1649
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,840
of themselves.
I'm talking and I'm speaking as somebody

1650
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:13,674
whose grandfather was,
was a schizophrenia who went into a 

1651
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:17,610
mental hospital.
They gave them lithium and then he spent

1652
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:19,440
the rest of his life as a happy,
productive human being,

1653
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,060
right?
The,

1654
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:20,893
these,
these are things that might not have 

1655
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,940
been possible now.
And then.

1656
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:24,000
So this is,
you know,

1657
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:27,840
this is an area where I,
I actually think that there's,

1658
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:28,674
there,
there is a role for the government in 

1659
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:32,190
this because this is John Locke would 
have thought the same.

1660
01:04:32,191 --> 01:04:33,370
John Locke said this in,
in,

1661
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,620
in his writings,
he said that,

1662
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,010
you know,
the problem of mental illnesses.

1663
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,640
One that sort of falls on society as a 
whole because you have a group of people

1664
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,474
who can't take care of themselves.
That's the real problem with mass 

1665
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:42,530
shootings,
you know,

1666
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,440
taking my guns away from me or taking 
another law abiding person's,

1667
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:46,283
gotten away from them,
that's not going to stop the mass 

1668
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:49,160
shooter.

1669
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:49,993
Uh,
in fact it's probably going to create 

1670
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:53,700
more mass shootings because now I can't 
defend myself.

1671
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,030
So would you say the NRA is a problem at
all in,

1672
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:57,140
in,
within the thing,

1673
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,013
the NRA is incredibly valuable 
organization because it's pushing 

1674
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:01,074
against people on the other side.
I don't have to agree with everything 

1675
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:04,974
the NRA says to think that they are an 
incredibly valuable organization that's 

1676
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,400
channeling,
uh,

1677
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,120
the,
the,

1678
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,690
the,
the legal hopes of a lot of Americans to

1679
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:13,524
protect the second amendment.
And we're about one vote away on the 

1680
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,010
Supreme Court from the Second Amendment 
disappearing entirely.

1681
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:20,740
So let's just do some stuff in that.
That's how it,

1682
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:21,574
that's how we can add this.
So with this whole thing with Scalia 

1683
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:25,600
right now and this spot,
where do you stand on this?

1684
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:28,360
It seems to me that Obama has to 
nominate someone that's his job.

1685
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:31,210
He's the president,
he's the president right now.

1686
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,460
He can,
he doesn't have to,

1687
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,250
but,
and if it was a republican,

1688
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:38,050
of course he was okay.
And now that it's up and I don't care if

1689
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:39,310
he does,
as you say,

1690
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,173
he has the capacity to do it.
It's one of the things that he's 

1691
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:42,664
actually allowed to do as president that
he's doing as opposed to all the other 

1692
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,150
things he's doing,
which she's not allowed to do,

1693
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,890
but we've got to finish up so we have to
focus on this one.

1694
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:48,581
So.
All right,

1695
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:49,414
so we're in agreement on that.
And then they say it will be up to the 

1696
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:52,600
Senate to either confirm this person or 
not.

1697
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:53,800
They don't have to give him an up or 
down vote though,

1698
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:54,910
right?
You can do whatever they want.

1699
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:56,680
So what do you make of,
of the,

1700
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:57,514
you know,
Mitch Mcconnell and the rest of these 

1701
01:05:58,181 --> 01:05:59,140
guys that are like,
ah,

1702
01:05:59,141 --> 01:05:59,974
you know,
he shouldn't even nominate anybody and 

1703
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:01,400
all that.

1704
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,800
I think it's an idiotic line of 
argument.

1705
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,073
I mean,
I think it's a really dumb line of 

1706
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:07,030
argument was I wrote my,
I went to Harvard law school and I wrote

1707
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:07,864
my third year paper at Harvard law 
school on the idea that Marbury versus 

1708
01:06:10,061 --> 01:06:10,894
Madison was wrongly decided.
I don't think that the supreme court 

1709
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,910
should have the capacity to decide for 
everyone,

1710
01:06:15,911 --> 01:06:16,744
like for conservatives to think that the
entire future of the constitution 

1711
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:22,270
restaurants,
skulled one guy not dying is really sad.

1712
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:22,821
Right?
And,

1713
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:23,654
and,
and the reason for that is because the 

1714
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:28,000
supreme court has now been seen as this 
great moral arbiter.

1715
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,073
I don't think it is.
I think that the supreme court has been 

1716
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:32,070
responsible for some of the worst 
decision in,

1717
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,210
in human history.
I mean,

1718
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,840
the supreme court is responsible for 
row,

1719
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:35,674
which is a disaster.
The supreme court was responsible for 

1720
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:38,080
plessy versus Ferguson.

1721
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,330
Everybody always wants to talk about 
Brown versus board.

1722
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,800
If they'd gotten plessy right in the 
first place,

1723
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:44,320
you don't need brown versus board and 
segregation ends in 1900.

1724
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,370
So this is.
So the,

1725
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:48,250
the supreme court is a,
is a serious problem there.

1726
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:49,084
Nine unelected people,
which I don't even care about the 

1727
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:51,154
unelected,
but their their nine people who are 

1728
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:55,630
given the power to control everybody's 
life in the name of a document that most

1729
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:58,720
of them don't even take seriously.
Is that the irony with the Supreme Court

1730
01:06:58,721 --> 01:06:59,554
that they're supposed to be above 
partisan politics and yet the whole 

1731
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:05,770
system to get them there is part of and 
then they're part of seeing themselves.

1732
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,570
I mean a lightening.
Kagan is a hardcore Democrat.

1733
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,380
Elena Kagan was the solicitor general 
for,

1734
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:10,560
for Barack Obama.
Come on,

1735
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:11,410
right?
I mean I.

1736
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:12,244
I went to the.
She was the dean when I was at Harvard 

1737
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:13,540
law school.

1738
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:14,373
She was a hardcore leftist.
Then you know the idea that people are 

1739
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:18,760
free of politics and what they call 
legal realist.

1740
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,060
I believe that that means that virtually
everybody is,

1741
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,953
is,
has their perspective on life and that 

1742
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:25,474
comes out in how they and how they 
adjudicate a and you have to work very 

1743
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,300
hard to remove yourself from that.
I think most judges don't.

1744
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:34,330
I think most judges rule based on what 
they feel like Anthony Kennedy,

1745
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,820
you can't tell them regardless what you 
think about same sex marriage.

1746
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:37,654
You cannot tell me that the constitution
of the United States or the 14th 

1747
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:41,830
amendment there too,
which was ratified in 18,

1748
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:42,664
68,
was demanding that the state's not 

1749
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:46,720
passed laws in favor of traditional 
marriage.

1750
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,300
That's absurd.
It's absurd.

1751
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:50,020
No,
but he but equal protection.

1752
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:53,710
He was using that or protection or that 
we should all be treated equally.

1753
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:56,620
It's a bunch of crap because equal 
protection does not mean that.

1754
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,330
That,
that everybody,

1755
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,090
that a law should have an equal effect 
on everyone.

1756
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:05,110
No law has an equal effect on everyone.
The question is whether the law itself,

1757
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,003
whether the law itself discriminates 
against someone on the basis of an 

1758
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:10,060
immutable characteristic,
and one of the problems with,

1759
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,970
with the whole gays are blacks,
is that gays are not black.

1760
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:17,990
I mean the fact is that a gay person who
has sex with another man is not going to

1761
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,550
manifest their homosexuality in a way 
that society cares about.

1762
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:22,403
They may be gay,
they may have sex addicts to shoot up a 

1763
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:25,040
place.
Well maybe,

1764
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,180
maybe he will.
Maybe he won't.

1765
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:27,014
I mean,
I assume that there,

1766
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,600
I assume that for the last couple of 
hundred,

1767
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:29,733
a couple of thousand years when gays 
were not treated well in Western 

1768
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:32,714
society,
that not all the scrutiny gay people 

1769
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:36,590
were going and killing folks more 
capable than that.

1770
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,450
I think that,
you know,

1771
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:39,480
the,
the gay people have the same selfcontrol

1772
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,330
the straight people do.
I don't think there are any better.

1773
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:43,670
I don't think they're any worse in terms
of their sexual self control.

1774
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,910
And I will say that I think men in 
general are less good in terms of sexual

1775
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:48,230
assault control than women's.
So,

1776
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,273
which explains why,
which is why gay men have sex with more 

1777
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:52,094
people than,
than straight men because women don't 

1778
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:54,740
want to have sex with men as much as 
men.

1779
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,610
Wanna have sex with men have strong sex 
drive.

1780
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,960
So yeah,
but that's well off topic.

1781
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:00,794
Back to the Scalia for a second.
The the problem here is that the 

1782
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,800
Republican Party,
when they say things like,

1783
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,200
it's the timeline,
it isn't the timeline,

1784
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,363
okay.
If somebody replaces Justice Scalia who 

1785
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:14,060
off the left and I don't care one,
this is if hillary gets elected,

1786
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:15,860
if we're,
if we're 20 years from now,

1787
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,950
one more vote on the Supreme Court and 
the left is on the court,

1788
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:21,140
do not see the constitution as a piece 
of law,

1789
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:21,440
right?

1790
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,440
To be interpreted like the Sherman 
antitrust act or obamacare.

1791
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,363
They see the.
They see the constitution as a piece of 

1792
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:27,554
poetry to be interpreted as their 
feelings dictate and this is the point 

1793
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:31,910
that I'm making about Kennedy through 
line,

1794
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:33,440
through everything we're talking.
That's right,

1795
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:34,274
and this is the point that I'm making 
about Kennedy specifically in the gay 

1796
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,124
marriage decision.
There is not one iota of evidence that 

1797
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:44,150
the law that when it was written meant 
anything to this effect or that it meant

1798
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:44,984
to leave an open space for the Supreme 
Court to come in and leverage down on 

1799
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:48,584
states.
Same sex marriage laws mean what they 

1800
01:09:50,211 --> 01:09:51,670
mean when they're written.
They don't mean what they are,

1801
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,390
what they mean to a hundred years from 
now.

1802
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,373
If somebody picks up this interview in 
200 years and starts to read into my 

1803
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:59,570
perspective that I'm super pro 
homosexual behavior,

1804
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,520
I would be a little bit surprised,
right?

1805
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,900
But that's essentially what happened in 
18,

1806
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:05,000
68.
He's taking a clause that was written by

1807
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:05,834
a bunch of people who were very much not
in favor of even forget homosexual 

1808
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:12,080
marriage who criminalized sodomy,
right?

1809
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,340
And saying to them,
okay,

1810
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:14,174
well those people really meant what they
really meant here was pro same sex 

1811
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:18,560
marriage.
If you want to make same sex marriage,

1812
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:19,500
legal make illegal,
you know,

1813
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,493
that's.
That's what you can do through the 

1814
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:24,770
ballot box is the beauty of a republic,
but you don't get to have nine unelected

1815
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:25,604
judges.
Who are these special moral people 

1816
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:28,850
who've been dinged by the hand of God?
I don't believe.

1817
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,620
I believe all human beings are capable 
of good.

1818
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:32,330
I believe all human beings are capable 
of evil.

1819
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:35,990
I believe all human beings are selfish 
and all of our are capable of altruism.

1820
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:36,973
I don't believe that there are nine 
perfect human beings who sit on the 

1821
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:41,900
supreme court and rule us as a magical 
angelica oligarchy.

1822
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,640
I think that's a pretty solid ending to 
this.

1823
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:45,890
What do you think?
Sounds good to me.

1824
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:46,581
Yeah.
I mean,

1825
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:47,414
well,
I think what we did here was exactly 

1826
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:49,004
what I want this to be,
that we don't have to agree on 

1827
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:51,074
everything,
but I do sense a sort of new center 

1828
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,430
coming together with people that are on 
the right.

1829
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,613
That was my left,
but it's there people that are on the 

1830
01:10:58,221 --> 01:10:59,054
left and on the right that there's a way
where you can be moral and it doesn't 

1831
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:02,804
necessarily have anything to do with 
religion or you can be moral and it has 

1832
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,673
to do with religion,
but that's not how you want to be 

1833
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:09,080
governed and I think that's gonna be my 
takeaway.

1834
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,190
I think that's exactly right.
I mean,

1835
01:11:11,191 --> 01:11:14,280
as I say to people who disagree with me,
the of the countries that you don't have

1836
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:15,114
to care what I think the minute you 
bring the government into saying that I 

1837
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:19,140
have to care what you think,
then we're at odds.

1838
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,790
So as long as the government is out of 
it.

1839
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,520
We didn't have these discussions all day
long and it's just good fun.

1840
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,230
The minute you bring the gun to the 
party or the fascist,

1841
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,093
more importantly than any of that,
Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be so 

1842
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:30,240
jealous that we sat here for an hour 
anyway.

1843
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:31,074
I want to thank a band and you can check
out his work pretty much all over the 

1844
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:34,014
place,
but I believe it's Benjamin Shapiro doc 

1845
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,130
and go to daily wire is probably the 
best place to get a wire.com

1846
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:39,660
and he's doing the breitbart thing and 
all that.

1847
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,520
Thank you guys for watching and we'll do
it again next week.
