1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,943
Joining me today is an author,
the Co founder and president of 

2
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:09,364
environmental progress.org
and a candidate to be the next governor 

3
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:15,610
of the great state of California.
Mike shellenberger.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,110
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Just having me.

5
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,270
David.
I am very jealous of your beard.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,773
Even the amount of gray here.
I just added that before I do the 

7
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,160
reverse.
What do they do?

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,560
It's just for men usually takes the gray
out.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,453
Exactly.
You do the training of the baby boomer 

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,660
votes.
Added some gray in.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,673
Yeah.
I'm very excited to talk to you because 

12
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,560
I think this is going to be a good 
political discussion,

13
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:42,340
but also we'll get to some environmental
stuff that I've wanted to touch on and a

14
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:44,590
little bit about the state of 
California,

15
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,424
this highly regulated,
highly tax state that we're in and all 

16
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,890
kinds of stuff,
but first you live in Berkeley.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,873
I do.
What the hell is going on or what's 

18
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,150
going on there?
It seems like it's become one.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,060
You know,
it was once the home for free speech and

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,710
real liberalism and it seems like it's 
become this sort of hysterical,

21
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:09,940
crazy silencing mob up there.
What's happening?

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,380
I mean in some ways it's funny because 
it's,

23
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:12,214
it's supposed to be an outlier,
but in some ways it's similar to what's 

24
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,420
happening in the rest of the country.
People aren't,

25
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,000
don't listen to each other.
You know,

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,923
it's so striking.
I think that the social media gives 

27
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,560
people a lot of confidence in their 
reviews.

28
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,394
They have a lot of information available
to them and so people are just not 

29
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,120
listening and I find that everywhere.
You Know,

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,973
Berkeley is certainly the case.
We've been smug for a long time though 

31
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:35,250
in Berkeley we pioneered it,
but have you seen a change

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,263
say in the last five or 10 years,
has something actually changed or was 

33
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,140
this all just sort of what's happening 
nationally?

34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,463
I mean when I,
when I sort of changed my views in 

35
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:48,620
particular of nuclear and dealt with 
some of the backlash against that,

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,483
that gave me a different point of view 
on the broader kind of culture and the 

37
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:55,130
ways in which people are intolerant to 
don't want to hear it,

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,323
but you know,
just because of my age I think and I 

39
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,300
hadn't been associated with the 
university.

40
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:01,430
I had a think tank in Oakland,
lived in Berkeley,

41
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,264
but I hadn't really had a lot of 
interaction with the students until 

42
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:07,190
recently so I didn't even know about 
trigger warnings like into like a couple

43
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,640
of years ago.
And I was like what are those?

44
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,570
So live in Berkeley had a think tank in 
Oakland.

45
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm just trying to think for the people 
that don't know,

46
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,670
you know,
you come from the left,

47
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:20,250
the area and all that stuff.
So before we get into the nuclear stuff,

48
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,540
which is really,
I think your,

49
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,710
your,
your key thing.

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,680
Tell me just a little bit about your 
history.

51
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,080
What do I need to know about you before 
we get into the meeting?

52
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,760
Let's see.
So I'm a gen x or a born 19,

53
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:31,594
71.
Raised you in that fear of the Cold War 

54
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,710
as you probably had,
you know,

55
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:39,310
saw the day after on television when I 
was in whatever,

56
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:44,311
12 terrified of nuclear war.
My parents were Christian pacifists,

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,950
but they also divorced.
So I was a kid of divorce,

58
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,120
a suburban Colorado.
I'm very left wing kid,

59
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,901
you know,
I had very,

60
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:57,790
my parents were pretty liberal and then 
I moved to the bay area after college to

61
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,120
work with a left activist group called 
global exchange.

62
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:01,954
So it was always.
I've always been sort of a man of the 

63
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,660
left and when my views of nuclear in 
particular change in the environment,

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,913
then I sort of was able to kind of start
to give myself permission to rethink 

65
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:11,914
other things and not not believe 
everything I thought so to speak and to 

66
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,850
start to question some of those things.

67
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,803
Yeah.
And that's why I thought you'd be a 

68
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,480
perfect guest because what we're about 
to talk about now,

69
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,314
your sort of evolution and know you're 
pushing against and where are you get 

70
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,563
support.
It sort of fits a lot of sort of where 

71
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm at and a lot of what some of my 
other guests who have dealt with.

72
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,270
So tell me as,
as you woke up to nuclear.

73
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,283
Alright.
So what was the sort of base 

74
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:37,860
environmental thinking when you just got
out of college and we're working in?

75
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,350
Yeah.
Yeah,

76
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,184
I mean I had sort of that sort of basic 
simplistic kind of lefty view that all 

77
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:45,764
of the problems in the world due to big 
corporations and capitalism and that 

78
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,710
that's what was wrong with the 
environment.

79
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,160
And I had this picture I think that a 
lot of people have still,

80
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:55,994
which is that a more beautiful world 
would be solar panels on your roof and 

81
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,910
electric car in the driveway.
And um,

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,240
and we wrote about how to achieve that.
But the more we were writing about it,

83
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,074
the more we realized the limitations of 
solar and wind in particular as energy 

84
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:10,634
sources.
And we had a bunch of friends who were 

85
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:13,350
just like,
you know,

86
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,140
if you're concerned about climate change
and air pollution,

87
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:18,050
why not nuclear?
And we had to go through a process,

88
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:21,290
really took several years to sort of 
finally answered that question and go,

89
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,980
yeah,
we got to have nuclear,

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,960
we're going to deal with climate.

91
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,590
Yeah.
So before we fully get there,

92
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:28,440
what are some of the limitations?
Because I think most people,

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,393
even now,
even though you're saying this was a 

94
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,630
couple of years ago for you sure now 
most people I think have that idea if we

95
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:37,590
just all had solar panels on our roof 
and if you'll,

96
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,750
if we had more wind turbines and all 
that,

97
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:43,770
then everything actually would be okay.
But that's actually not what you argued.

98
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,903
That's right.
And it's in and my views sort of have 

99
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:47,844
evolved,
but the biggest problem that people are 

100
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,704
aware of is that you only get 
electricity out of wind and solar when 

101
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:53,850
the sun is shining and the wind is 
blowing.

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,620
And um,
people kind of go,

103
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,454
well maybe there the sun is shining when
the wind's not blowing or the way you 

104
00:04:58,691 --> 00:04:59,640
know.
And it's like,

105
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:00,900
no,
that's not really true either.

106
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,010
So you always have to have power plants 
ready to run at any minute.

107
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,850
I'm usually natural gas because you can 
fire them up so quickly and people go,

108
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,820
what about batteries?
Batteries are really expensive.

109
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,970
Just getting enough of them to store the
amount electricity you need.

110
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:15,804
I mean I think we had.
We calculated that if you took all of 

111
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,324
the batteries in California and you 
stored all of electricity would have 

112
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,950
like a couple of hours Max,
you know,

113
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,410
so and that would be taken all the 
batteries out of cars and trucks.

114
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,480
So it's a lot of that.

115
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,613
A lot of batteries.
Yeah.

116
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,333
I think these batteries are terrible for
the environment and there's another 

117
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:33,144
problem with renewables which is that 
they take a lot of space because the 

118
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,470
sunlight and water and wind are energy 
diffuse.

119
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,333
There's just.
You have to get a lot of wind to get 

120
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,763
enough electricity out of them or you 
have to cover a lot of area to get 

121
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,250
enough concentrated sunlight to make 
sufficient quantities of electricity.

122
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,503
You actually have big land use impacts 
and if the whole point is to save the 

123
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:54,924
natural environment,
you end up doing things like a lot of 

124
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,394
desert tortoises in the mojave and then 
you have a big waste problem that we 

125
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,164
haven't solved.
Both solar panels and batteries contain 

126
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,550
high levels of toxic waste.
In fact,

127
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,403
about two to 300 more toxic waste from 
the same amount of energy in solar 

128
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,610
panels then is created from nuclear,
so when you kind of.

129
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,543
It's really the big problems with 
renewables are actually environmental 

130
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,620
problems and it also tends to make them 
more expensive.

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,793
Do you think then that there's no place 
for them or is there some place like if 

132
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,693
if you were to drive from La here,
if we were to drive towards like palm 

133
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,280
springs,
there are in the hills you see plenty of

134
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,114
wind turbines.
Obviously here in la because of the 

135
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,544
amount of sunshine,
we see plenty of people with solar 

136
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,434
panels on their roof.
Every time I go to home depot there's 

137
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,680
only five people that try to accost me 
and get me on panels and all that.

138
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,870
Do you think there's any place for those
things?

139
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,371
Oh,
sure.

140
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,204
And there's there,
there's one place for them as in my 

141
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,070
backyard.
I have,

142
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,440
um,
you know,

143
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:51,274
I mean,
I think that solar was traditionally 

144
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:53,464
used for remote applications,
so places where you don't have 

145
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,720
electrical wire or it doesn't make sense
to have electrical wire,

146
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,570
their solar panels are really cool 
technologies.

147
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,490
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with them.

148
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,443
I think there's something wrong when we 
are subsidizing the most affluent 

149
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,620
members of our society to have.
Um,

150
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,503
and that's what's happened.
So California has seen our electricity 

151
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,740
prices went up 40 percent,
um,

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,290
at a period where,
I'm sorry,

153
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,143
they went up four times more than they 
did in the rest of the country over the 

154
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:21,004
last seven years.
And a big part of that was we were 

155
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:25,090
subsidizing people to get solar and 
wind.

156
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,620
I think if you're doing some 
experimental work,

157
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:29,410
some r and d perfectly important role 
for the government.

158
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,620
That's how we got jet turbines and a lot
of the technologies in our iphones.

159
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,560
But when you're kind of constantly 
subsidizing them,

160
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,930
the people that get punished is working 
people,

161
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,973
middle class people,
poor people because their electricity 

162
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,030
prices go up and so that,
that starts to have a,

163
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,340
a,
a concern that a universal concern,

164
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,360
whether you're liberal or Conservative,

165
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,213
whatever.
So I want to get a little more to that 

166
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:50,530
and government's role in whether that's 
the answer will,

167
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:51,364
we'll show that for now.
But I'm very much aware of that because 

168
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,830
even right now is I've looked into it a 
little bit,

169
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,983
you know,
I see that a lot of subsidies have 

170
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,554
actually run out in California.
There's a lot that are expiring at the 

171
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,463
end of the year and all sorts of other 
stuff.

172
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,860
And also just by a function of having 
this studio,

173
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,420
I mean,
you see all these lights,

174
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:10,260
like these lights,
they burn hot and they suck a ton of,

175
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,910
uh,
of electricity.

176
00:08:11,911 --> 00:08:14,460
So my electricity bill is there are,
are crazy.

177
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,620
So this is something I'm very aware of.
So Tony,

178
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,753
tell me when you started realizing that 
nuclear wasn't the evil thing that 

179
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,710
perhaps it had been portrayed.
As

180
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,280
you know,
I,

181
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,113
I think,
I mean I helped to stop a proposed 

182
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:30,450
radioactive waste repository.
Actually I'm in my late twenties,

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,700
but as he got concerned about climate,
um,

184
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,490
you started hearing people talk a little
bit more about it.

185
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:39,660
I think my views are probably softening 
even before I became directly focused on

186
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:40,494
it,
but then it was really a couple of 

187
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:41,664
friends.
One of them was stewart brand who is 

188
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:44,700
sort of the originary Hippie,
you know,

189
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:45,534
whole earth catalog.
I'm advisor to Governor Brown in the 

190
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,930
seventies.
He wrote a famous essay in 2005 and then

191
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,764
a book in 2009.
And by the time I read the book in 2009 

192
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,650
was pretty persuaded because he just 
went through all the evidence,

193
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
you know,
the accidents really.

194
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,343
We're not what people think they are.
The waste is actually the best kind of 

195
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,750
waste because there's hardly any of it.
It's easy to manage,

196
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,710
never hurts anybody.

197
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,793
What do they do with the waste?
Because I think that's what we usually 

198
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:13,370
think of.
Think of the nuclear power plant and the

199
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:17,420
simpsons and the three items for damage 
for your argument.

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,230
Oh yeah,
yeah.

201
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,150
Anything else out there you have the 
first thing you learn as you go.

202
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:22,990
Oh wait,
the waste isn't green and liquid because

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,910
it was in the simpsons,
which is how I got my information.

204
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,270
Yeah.
And Mr Burns was running for governor,

205
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,021
which.
Oh yeah,

206
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:33,110
there you go.
A little bit more money than I got,

207
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,340
but um,
you know,

208
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,270
now what we do with it is fine.
I think we take it.

209
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,133
You take the spent fuel,
you take the fuel rods out of the 

210
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:42,344
nuclear reactor,
you cool them in water for a few years 

211
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,503
and then we put them in dry cask storage
right there on the site where the plant 

212
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,960
is from an environmental point of view,
that's like exactly what you'd want.

213
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:54,370
I mean,
if you,

214
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,980
when you grow up kind of learning about 
the environment,

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,200
the first thing you learn is that waste 
always has to go somewhere,

216
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,063
right?
It doesn't disappear and you have to be 

217
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:06,980
responsible for taking care of the waste
products from our consumption.

218
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,814
So that's nuclear is like the only way 
that we make electricity that does that 

219
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,313
right now we don't have any protections 
that solar panels won't just go into 

220
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,244
landfills and leach toxic chemicals or 
be sent to Bangladesh to be torn apart 

221
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:20,594
by kids in slums.
I'm only nuclear really cares for its 

222
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:25,160
waste and it's almost and really 
clinical way.

223
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:25,994
We put them in these big casks and,
and they're right there on basically a 

224
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:30,180
couple of basketball courts,
um,

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,640
at a given plant.
Um,

226
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,150
and we kind of look at them and store 
them and watch them and people go,

227
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,430
what if they leak or something?
They're in these hugely thick cast.

228
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:38,264
But even if they were,
you would be able to see it and observe 

229
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,960
it and there's not really anything to 
lead because there's no way.

230
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,130
So is there any evidence that something 
could really go awry with that as you're

231
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,600
laying it out as something that's pretty
safe?

232
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,633
No,
there's no evidence that waste from 

233
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:53,990
nuclear energy production has had any of
those problems.

234
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:54,824
People say people point to problems with
the waste that came out of weapons 

235
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,540
production,
but that,

236
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,433
that is a very different process.
You're just creating huge amounts of 

237
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,180
plutonium and highly enriched uranium 
for bombs.

238
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,014
And when we were really,
when you had really big problems even 

239
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:09,164
there,
it was like in the middle of World War 

240
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,550
II where you're just throwing bodies and
machines to fight this war.

241
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,730
So,
um,

242
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,400
it's got an incredibly good track 
record.

243
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,234
I mean,
people will talk about wanting to bury 

244
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:20,930
it under the desert in Nevada.
My.

245
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,400
And I'm always like,
I don't know why,

246
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,170
like why do you need to do that?
Like,

247
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:25,520
just,
it's fine where it is,

248
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:28,880
you just store it and maintain it.
It takes up no space.

249
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,480
It doesn't pose any harm.
Um,

250
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,641
for me,
I'm like,

251
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,474
that's like the one of the chief selling
points of nuclear is the way it manages 

252
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,280
this way.

253
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,670
Yeah.
So when they talk about that,

254
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,504
you know,
burying it in the desert somewhere 

255
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,213
underground or whatever,
are they talking more about the weapons 

256
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:43,704
grade

257
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,680
and about the nuclear energy waste?
And I tried to figure it out because I'm

258
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
like a bit of a newcomer to it.
I didn't know.

259
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,920
I'm just,
I'm glad I asked people in the industry,

260
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:53,080
why do you need to do that?
And they kind of go,

261
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,300
well,
because it's better because it's better.

262
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,940
Look,
people made a lot of money building that

263
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,680
big hole in Nevada,
you know what I mean?

264
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,360
From a libertarian point of view,
you kind of go,

265
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,194
there's just,
there was a lot of money to be made on 

266
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:05,944
these fears that were manufactured and 
that we're used to manipulate people 

267
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,594
like us.
I grew up in the seventies so that you 

268
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:12,934
would think that there's some 
relationship between like a bomb going 

269
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,340
off and the waste and there's just 
nothing.

270
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,920
The waste can't be used in that way.
Um,

271
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,800
so I have to say it's one of the things 
I find most frustrating and baffling,

272
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,610
you know,

273
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,760
is it also one of those things that you 
really.

274
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,280
And this is why I want to tag it on the 
show to,

275
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,173
to really unpack this stuff.
You really have to have some basic 

276
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:31,664
understanding of how this will work.
So when you even mentioned before that 

277
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:37,340
the different ways between weapons grade
and just,

278
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,410
you know,
civilian use for power,

279
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,860
I don't think people have any sense that
these are different things

280
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,803
right now.
I don't know a lot about it and the 

281
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,380
funny thing is,
so I'm working on a um,

282
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,533
I've got a book that I'm going to,
I'm doing on the history of nuclear and 

283
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:55,630
one of the surprising things is that 
ordinary folks knew that there was a big

284
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:56,464
difference between nuclear weapons and 
nuclear power plants from like the mid 

285
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,180
fifties to like the mid seventies,
like people kind of,

286
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,810
in fact the whole people were actually 
excited about nuclear power.

287
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,100
Like they were like,
this is great.

288
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:09,934
You mean like this thing that's really 
terrible and frightening actually has 

289
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:14,560
this really positive side.
And I was like,

290
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,394
yeah,
well let's get some of that positive 

291
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,220
side going because all we hear about is 
the negative stuff.

292
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,100
This makes sense.
I was born in 76,

293
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,260
so right when that ended probably.

294
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,320
Yeah.
And then,

295
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,154
um,
a three mile island accident occurred 

296
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,270
and blown way out of proportion,
but really importantly,

297
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:29,280
China Syndrome,
this,

298
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,114
this anti nuclear movement,
1979 came out and that really shaped 

299
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,004
perceptions and,
and that they deliberately and you can 

300
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:37,144
see what they're doing constantly.
They were trying to mix up the two 

301
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:41,230
things.
Same word,

302
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,790
you know.
Um,

303
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,163
but you know,
it's funny because we have a lot of 

304
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:45,754
dangerous things in our society that we 
actually use for positive things were 

305
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:54,331
even injecting polio virus into people's
brains to kill cancer particular kind of

306
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,390
cancers.
Um,

307
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,523
you know,
we obviously immunizer we inject our 

308
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:59,860
children with dangerous diseases because
to protect them.

309
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:00,694
So I think we're capable of having a 
more complex understanding of that 

310
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:05,884
technology,
but there is vested interests and 

311
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:10,660
ideological interests in maintaining 
people's fears.

312
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,573
Right?
So there's sort of two separate things 

313
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,880
here.
There's one is what the reality is.

314
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:15,714
And then there's the other where when 
you hear about three mile island 

315
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,073
Chernobyl or any of this stuff,
what's the argument that you're your 

316
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:21,564
best argument when there's something 
that actually is a disaster in the case 

317
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:25,930
of turnover?
I guess you're saying three,

318
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,840
not as bad as they hyped it up to me.

319
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,923
Yeah.
So I mean there's three serious 

320
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,760
accidents that involve melted reactors.
Three Mile Island,

321
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:34,990
Chernobyl,
and Fukushima,

322
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:40,180
the worst was Chernobyl.
And even the worst one killed shockingly

323
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:43,210
few people.
Mo basically killed the firefighters who

324
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:46,360
put out the fire about 50 to date.
Um,

325
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,090
and you know,
firefighters die putting out fires,

326
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:49,924
you know,
so it's not like unique to nuclear 

327
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,070
accidents.
There were um,

328
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,063
uh,
was about a one percent mortality for 

329
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,040
the several thousand people that got 
thyroid cancer.

330
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,400
And then that's it.
Like no increase in any other cancers.

331
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,910
So nothing else.
Nothing else you would have asked me,

332
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,580
just not knowing anything about this.
I think I probably would have said,

333
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,443
oh,
there's probably like some sort of even 

334
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,280
generational thing going.
No,

335
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,090
no,
definitely not.

336
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,610
That's,
I think that's really the,

337
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,813
the meme that's out there,
that's the one that they even promoted 

338
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,410
it a lot was that somehow they were 
like,

339
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:19,244
if you got exposed to radiation than 
your kids would have some problems and 

340
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:22,220
we don't see that.

341
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,480
And that's great.
I mean,

342
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,460
it's one of those things where everyone 
should have been like,

343
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,020
Yay,
Yay.

344
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,380
We discovered that nobody was harmed,
let's celebrate.

345
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,490
But people were like,
no,

346
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,680
there's got to be something wrong.
I mean,

347
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,514
I think there's also just,
it is such a different way of making 

348
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,570
heat.
That's what nuclear plants do.

349
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,730
They make heat and it heats,
used to make electricity.

350
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,740
Um,
but there's no smoke,

351
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,180
there's no fire,
there's no smoke.

352
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:45,260
And that's just weird.
I mean,

353
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:50,261
humans have been around for 200,000
years and we really evolved and our,

354
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:55,040
and our prehuman ancestors helped to 
make us with fire.

355
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,874
So fire is just a central part of human 
stories around the world and a central 

356
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,584
part of our identity.
And we look at the Greek myths and then 

357
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:05,330
we have this completely different way of
making energy and power and fire.

358
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,620
And I just think I'm not fire energy and
power and,

359
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,050
and we kind of go.
It's strange and I think we kind of go,

360
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,760
there's gotta be something wrong with 
it.

361
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,990
Um,
and of course,

362
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,824
you know,
you get really close to nuclear 

363
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,330
reactors,
it's really dangerous,

364
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,610
harmful and you can die.
So it's not like it's harmless,

365
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,700
but I think people don't understand,
you know,

366
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,240
when you consider that,
you know,

367
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,093
somewhere between five and 7 million 
people die every year from just 

368
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,580
breathing,
smoke and suffering,

369
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:32,090
respiratory illnesses.
I think we just are less scared of smoke

370
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,660
then,
then we should be part of it though,

371
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,494
that we're,
there's something about nuclear power 

372
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:41,210
and when we related to weapons in our 
minds,

373
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,600
it's become like this thing where we 
love disaster movies,

374
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,770
you know,
all of this stuff.

375
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,100
So it's sort of taken a life unto its 
own in a way.

376
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,230
Yeah.
Um,

377
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,580
yeah,
it's such an interesting problem because

378
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,414
on the one hand people like,
they want so much safety from nuclear 

379
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,680
even though it like kills,
like basically nobody,

380
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,573
you know,
compared to like every other way of 

381
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:01,670
making energy mean natural gas pipelines
explode all the time.

382
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,890
Oil Refineries go down and it's kind of 
like,

383
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,311
come on,
you know,

384
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,430
you drive your car super fast,
you smoke cigarettes when you get,

385
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,050
when you drink,
when you drink too much,

386
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,913
you know,
we do all these risky behaviors and 

387
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,790
somehow we don't want any risky behavior
from this one.

388
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,624
I think it is that association.
You think something horribly could go 

389
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,374
wrong.
Even though we've seen horrible things 

390
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,170
go wrong with nuclear accidents and it 
doesn't harm our laney buddy.

391
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:24,410
So,
you know,

392
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,600
I think it's about a lot of different 
things.

393
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,770
Um,
you know,

394
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:28,610
I also,
it was interesting,

395
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,444
I saw,
I was watching one of your earlier 

396
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:30,764
conversations where one of your guests 
talked about the infantilization of the 

397
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:34,790
public,
you know,

398
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,633
mean here we're rich and comfortable and
where we want like high levels of 

399
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:39,314
safety.
I think the other thing that happens as 

400
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,283
we've become developed and civilization 
is that our fantasies of what could go 

401
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,710
wrong get even more crazy.
Like,

402
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,720
you know,
I mean just the crazy things that people

403
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:54,120
thought about with genetically modified 
foods,

404
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,270
you know,
these kind of scenarios that we concoct,

405
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,580
it's different from.
It is 100 years ago.

406
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,473
I mean,
when you're trying to deal with the 

407
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,530
cholera epidemic or a polio epidemic,
you're not,

408
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,400
you don't need to fantasize about 
horrible things going wrong.

409
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,720
You're watching them happen.
It's interesting.

410
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,030
I'm not going to remember this story 
totally correctly,

411
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:13,590
so I have a feeling you'll be able to 
clean it up.

412
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,060
But I grew up in long island and there 
was a power plant either that was coming

413
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,920
or that they wanted to move her saying 
Indian point.

414
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,200
Does that sound right?
Sure.

415
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:21,910
Um,
yeah,

416
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,120
insurance they were,
they wanted to build the shore on one.

417
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,760
They did finish the Indian point one.
Okay.

418
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,200
So I remember just around that,
all the,

419
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,093
I think I was maybe around 12 or 
something and I remember hearing about 

420
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,500
it all the time and that's when the 
phrase Nimby got in my head,

421
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,640
you know,
not in my backyard.

422
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,430
And just this endless hysteria that 
people were talking about that,

423
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,470
you know,
we're all gonna,

424
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:40,304
you know,
tumor has growing out of our head and 

425
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:41,784
all this craziness.
And I guess you're saying there's no 

426
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,690
evidence for any of that.
No.

427
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,630
And you know,
it's always like those panics that occur

428
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:50,430
and I think you have to consider it as a
panic.

429
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,830
It's always about something else,
you know,

430
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,690
there's something going on in the 
society.

431
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,800
I mean,
the people that,

432
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,550
it's not everybody that was equally 
afraid of nuclear plants,

433
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,413
right?
It's a particular people that have 

434
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:05,100
particular views of the world and that 
are suspicious of the government,

435
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:07,710
suspicious of corporations and the 
system.

436
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,070
I'm suspicious of modern life.
And so,

437
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:12,960
um,
they're the ones that were more prone to

438
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:13,794
have those kinds of fears.
I think we see something different on 

439
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,610
the conservative side of the political,
right.

440
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,540
They have different fears,
um,

441
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,611
you know,
that.

442
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:22,140
And if they express themselves 
differently.

443
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,861
Yeah.
So,

444
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,694
okay.
So when you start having this sort of 

445
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:25,884
wake up to nuclear and you're in this 
pretty lefty field in the geographic 

446
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,940
places that,
in what kind of pushback did you get?

447
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,140
Oh,
a lot.

448
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,020
I mean a lot.
I mean and,

449
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,940
and it's.
And it's continued,

450
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:41,070
although I have to say it's gotten a lot
better.

451
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:44,370
I mean we saw one of the big 
environmental online magazines just came

452
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,500
out with a long article and supportive 
nuclear.

453
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,590
The I was in a documentary film that 
came out of 2013,

454
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,090
so it's been now,
you know,

455
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:51,983
five years almost.
And that's how long these things take 

456
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:54,954
for people to kind of calm down and look
at the evidence and you just get up 

457
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,940
every morning and you continue to 
advocate and,

458
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,051
and people,
you know,

459
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,280
facts still matter.

460
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,080
They matter.
Yeah,

461
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,220
I think they do.
I mean,

462
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,990
I think,
I think you still need time.

463
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,123
There's a way in which facts matter more
than ever because there's so much 

464
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,700
opinion out there.
Everyone's got an opinion,

465
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,080
but you know,
real facts.

466
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,011
You kind of go,
look,

467
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:14,844
it's the World Health Organization.
Like do you think there's a conspiracy 

468
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:21,630
involving thousands of scientists to 
cover up some deaths that occurred?

469
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,464
I mean,
it just doesn't really make sense for 

470
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:24,804
most people.
There's obviously a lot of conspiracy 

471
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:26,964
theorists and crazy ideas,
but I think that a lot of people have 

472
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:30,504
come around on the issue,
so a lot of my former guests had been 

473
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:38,460
progressives that have sort of had a 
kind of awakening and then they ended up

474
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,470
being hated by the very people they were
with.

475
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,200
Were you getting that?
Like,

476
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,930
I know I'm sure you were getting 
pushback on the intellectual ideas,

477
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,913
but just I just want to sort of 
understand because I think my audience 

478
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:52,150
is surely attuned to this when you start
doing something a little bit different.

479
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,983
I just want to understand sort of the 
level of hate and push back to you were 

480
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:55,820
getting.
Yeah,

481
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,830
it was hard.
I mean,

482
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,480
you know,
you get a lot of.

483
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,000
I mean it's important to remind yourself
that sort of,

484
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,010
not about you,
you know,

485
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,740
because you've take it personally.
You're like,

486
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,050
well I'm not that kind of a person,
you know?

487
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:05,501
And it was like,
oh,

488
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,300
they're just projecting stuff onto you.
Um,

489
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,343
you know,
the most painful stuff was when I had a 

490
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,623
friend on my facebook page accused me of
being on the take from the nuclear 

491
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,670
industry and I was just kinda like,
look dude,

492
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,470
the friendship is like overnight.
And I was like,

493
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,010
that's.
But I didn't.

494
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:19,844
And he apologized later.
But it was an interesting interaction 

495
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,100
because it was kinda like,
hey man,

496
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,250
you really kind of let yourself forget 
who your friend was,

497
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,380
you know,
in this kind of,

498
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,483
you know,
is in the midst of all the Bernie 

499
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,343
Sanders stuff,
or Bernie was attacking nuclear and he 

500
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,320
was a big Bernie guy.

501
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,870
And I just remember being like,
you don't,

502
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,080
you're just caught up in something and 
actually you need to kind of take us,

503
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,290
take a minute and get control and think 
about what you're saying,

504
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,110
who you're saying it too.
And he apologized for it.

505
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,973
But I was kind of like,
how do you do that at like a mass level 

506
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,860
where you kind of go,
hey,

507
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:55,210
everyone can be just a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.

508
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,044
And I love hearing that personal side of
it because I think so many people are 

509
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:01,020
going through that,
not necessarily with,

510
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,040
with nuclear power like you're going 
through it,

511
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,800
but just with whatever their own 
political evolution is.

512
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,753
So let,
let's talk about Bernie and this for a 

513
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:10,030
little bit because yeah,
he was campaigning against this.

514
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:10,864
Now if this,
if the science is as clean as what 

515
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,540
you're saying is,
then why wouldn't the progressive,

516
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,330
you know,
lefty guy who's always talking about,

517
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,470
he's talking about and what does he say?

518
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,940
And environmental revolution writing 
once a social revolution and a political

519
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:27,820
revolution in environmental.
He wants environmental justice.

520
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:28,970
I don't even know what that means.
Right?

521
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,640
But why wouldn't he be for this?
That's a very interesting question.

522
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,410
Um,
and I suspect there's a lot of different

523
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:36,071
reasons.
I mean,

524
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,040
some of it is he's an old guy,
you know,

525
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,770
it was very hard for old people to 
change.

526
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,633
It was hard for me to change my mind 
about nuclear and I was in my life like 

527
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,790
late thirties,
early forties.

528
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,853
And again,
you have to overcome a whole bunch of 

529
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,050
associations.
You know,

530
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,903
there's basically a picture what a lot 
of it gets called environmentalism 

531
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:55,570
doesn't have any to do with the 
environment.

532
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,640
It has more to do with the kind of 
society you want.

533
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:58,474
And so the idea would be we should have 
decentralized food and energy 

534
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,680
production.
You know,

535
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,350
we're all going to have our own little 
chicken coop and our own little garden.

536
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,880
I got a solar panel.
There you go.

537
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,293
You're a part of it.
My kids aren't laying there like 18 

538
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:12,064
weeks right now.
Now I can have an egg be one at the end 

539
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,250
of this aisle.
Yeah,

540
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,131
I mean we,
you know,

541
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:18,964
we have a little garden in the back and 
the amount of money and labor we put 

542
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,301
into that garden,
I'm like,

543
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,140
each tomato is like $500,
you know.

544
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,831
So,
you know,

545
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:28,780
it's a bit of that fantasy.
I mean I,

546
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:29,980
you know,
I love working in the garden,

547
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,450
right?
Like it's great to work in the garden.

548
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,760
It's great to have fresh eggs and you 
know,

549
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:34,050
and,
and,

550
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,410
and for people that can afford it and 
you might want it,

551
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,280
it might be cool to have solar panels 
for a variety of different reasons.

552
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,390
I think that when you kind of get too 
caught up in that and you start to think

553
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,140
that I'm going to produce all my food,
that way,

554
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,413
you know,
where I'm going to lose all my energy 

555
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:51,380
that way that you really started to lose
touch with kind of a basic understanding

556
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:56,381
of how materials and energy and society 
works and you're letting that desire for

557
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,160
a fantasy to take over.

558
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,560
So that's kind of what we come up 
against.

559
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,590
I think that that's where if you can 
kind of get people out of their own life

560
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,280
and their own how they want to live in 
their backyard to well,

561
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:10,010
how are we gonna you know,
there's 7 billion people on earth,

562
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,873
so how are we going to provide food and 
resources for everybody that helps to 

563
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,163
recontextualize things.
So what's the connection there between 

564
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,363
or what's the disconnect I should say,
between sort of progressivism and using 

565
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:22,754
nuclear power?
Because what you're saying is this can 

566
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:24,614
bring more energy to people that are 
lower cost than a lot of the other 

567
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,154
things that we're using it as a safer 
level and it seems to me that even 

568
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:31,461
though,
yes,

569
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:32,294
Bernie is an old guy,
it seems like this is something he 

570
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:34,850
should,
should,

571
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,610
should have come around on.
So I'm still missing that disconnect.

572
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,960
Maybe.
Maybe we just don't know.

573
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,440
Yeah,
I'm more.

574
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,343
Or is there something about the way the 
lefties with environmentalism that's so 

575
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,770
connected now to solar and wind and 
stuff like that?

576
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,633
Well,
and it's funny because it all actually 

577
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:51,224
happened here in California and you can 
see the difference between our current 

578
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,880
governor,
Jerry Brown and his dad.

579
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,923
His Dad was governor and he was what he 
was the Democratic Party that I kind of 

580
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,380
was raised on as the kids are the party 
of the people,

581
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,640
you know,
it was a party for the working man,

582
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:08,240
the working family.
Everyone gets a high wage.

583
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,590
You build highways,
agriculture factories.

584
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,060
Um,
the sixties occur.

585
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,460
His son gets elected.
Jerry for the first time,

586
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,740
1974,
it takes part 1975.

587
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:19,850
And He,
and he says,

588
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,440
he's interviewed by William F Buckley,
actually.

589
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,780
He says,
we all have to do with less.

590
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,330
We need to have less material 
consumption.

591
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,163
We have to obey.
Limits was a striking thing to be to 

592
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,040
hear from not just who he was as a 
Democrat,

593
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,440
as someone that was up for everybody 
prospering,

594
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,693
but it was also.
He's one of the wealthiest families in 

595
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,604
California.
They owned a huge oil monopoly from the 

596
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,114
Indonesian military dictatorship.
So who was the one who were the people 

597
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:50,060
that were promoting this idea of doing 
with less?

598
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:52,220
It was the wealthiest members of our 
society.

599
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:56,090
It was often kids that inherited family 
wealth.

600
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:58,930
They had land.
And so one of the most surprising things

601
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,550
running for governor as I learned more 
about the state,

602
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,443
is our housing crisis is a direct 
consequence of that same worldview that 

603
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:11,120
took over left liberal politics in the 
seventies.

604
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,983
Before that,
the idea was there should be abundant 

605
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,790
housing.
People should be able to buy a home.

606
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,270
And home ownership was really very 
progressive,

607
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,133
right?
Because homeowners have so much wealth 

608
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,920
in their homes and progressive's wanted 
to promote that.

609
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,980
Well Jerry Brown gets in and his anti 
development,

610
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,320
you know,
so called environmentalists get in there

611
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:33,620
and they seek to restrict homes,
housing,

612
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,010
consumption,
energy and it was almost like,

613
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:39,440
it was like almost the opposite of what 
came before it.

614
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,333
So you're telling me that first term,
Jerry Brown is the guy I have to blame 

615
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:43,980
for the mortgage that I'm going to be

616
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,570
paying for the rest of my life on this 
thing.

617
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,801
Yeah.
I mean,

618
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,634
and really the.
I mean he's now sort of four terms when 

619
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:50,724
he leaves office at the end of this year
and right at the beginning of next year 

620
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:54,920
I should say.
Um,

621
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,120
and yeah,
I mean,

622
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,060
and it's again,
you kind of go,

623
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,460
well then why did,
why was jerry like that?

624
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,680
I mean that's where in my book I kind 
of,

625
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,823
you kind of are like searching for it 
and I think you just kinda get to a 

626
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:09,561
backlash against basic progressive and 
liberal lists.

627
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,110
And I mean that's the funny thing you 
get.

628
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:14,550
There's a backlash against making 
prosperity for all.

629
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,590
They didn't want everybody to have 
prosperity.

630
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,670
They want it to really kick away the 
latter.

631
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,300
And kind of protect all of it for 
themselves.

632
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,390
Right.
So it's so interesting.

633
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,550
So you're saying basically in 75 he's 
going,

634
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:25,810
well we're going to have to deal with 
less,

635
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,793
but he didn't really mean we,
he may know because oil guys and 

636
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,514
obviously the guys had a lot of money 
and power for a long time through his 

637
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:34,054
family because he's,
he's still around 30 some odd years 

638
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,880
later.
Um,

639
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,550
I want to talk a lot more about what,
why you want to be governor.

640
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,863
But one other thing,
have you read that book right there by 

641
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:43,774
any chance?
Of course.

642
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,150
And I know Alex,
I had a coffee with them.

643
00:27:46,151 --> 00:27:46,691
Yeah.
Okay,

644
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:47,221
great.
So,

645
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,130
so Alex Epstein I had him on.
It's the,

646
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,900
the,
the,

647
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,733
the case.
The moral case for fossil fuels is the 

648
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,740
book I hit him on probably about two 
years ago.

649
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,480
I don't think that I've ever gotten more
hate for an interview then.

650
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,403
I mean,
I've had plenty of controversial people 

651
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,363
on here that I then get lumped in with 
and people think I endorse all their 

652
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:09,040
abuse,
which obviously is nonsensical,

653
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,240
but I truly think I got the most hate I 
ever got for having this guy.

654
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,143
Now he's basically,
his basic argument is the title of the 

655
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,114
book and he's just saying the most you 
can do for humans now is to still use 

656
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,123
fossil fuels.
I'm curious where you fall on that 

657
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,080
argument.

658
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,750
I think he gets it half right.
I mean,

659
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,710
my view is that it's very.
I mean,

660
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,150
my view is very simple in some ways.
I mean,

661
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,083
I think people.
I think now that I know more about 

662
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:37,020
housing and schools and other things,
I'm like,

663
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:38,760
well that's really complicated stuff,
but energy,

664
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:39,594
I think it's pretty simple.
So most of us start off in societies 

665
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,460
using wood and Dung as our primary 
energy.

666
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,700
Anything is better than that,
including burning coal,

667
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,840
right?
Because it's terrible.

668
00:28:48,841 --> 00:28:51,750
You breathe the smoke and and it's just 
the Labor involved,

669
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:52,584
right?
So then you get electricity from coal 

670
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:55,950
and hydroelectric dams.
Those are the first in poor countries.

671
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:56,784
Get so it was really a moral case for,
for coal and hydro if all you're using 

672
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:01,824
is wouldn't dung,
but then I also think there's a moral 

673
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:07,920
case for using cleaner burning fuels 
like natural gas and uranium.

674
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,510
Um,
so,

675
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,220
so he wants to,
I mean,

676
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,054
Alex did a good job with this book in 
the sense that he wanted to start a 

677
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:17,370
conversation about why or when it 
stopped poor countries from using fossil

678
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:19,080
fuels.
That's really unethical.

679
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,270
Um,
but I think you should go the other step

680
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:21,751
to say,
look,

681
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,700
there's,
even if you don't worry about climate,

682
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:24,534
there's air pollution,
there's other impacts of fossil energy 

683
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:27,204
use and if we've got this fantastic 
alternative and usually we go from coal 

684
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,740
to natural gas and then to uranium than 
we should keep going,

685
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,590
you know,
it's energy transitions and these energy

686
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,660
transitions,
which I don't want to get too much of my

687
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,650
campaign,
but these energy a little bit.

688
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:46,260
I do energy transitions.
Um,

689
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,153
you know,
when you go from horse and Buggy to 

690
00:29:48,331 --> 00:29:49,164
internal combustion engines and trains 
are what drives those transitions from 

691
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,280
energy sources.
So you go from wood and dung to coal and

692
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:59,270
partly because of trains but also 
factories and whatnot.

693
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,480
And then I think you eventually get to a
electric powered world electric cars,

694
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:05,130
electric heating,
um,

695
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,300
as we move towards nuclear.

696
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,490
Okay.
So we've hit than solar.

697
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,650
We pit when,
let's just do two of the others.

698
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:13,380
You mentioned one of them right there.
Uh,

699
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,403
so let's just talk about natural gas.
What do we need to know about natural 

700
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:17,824
gas generally?

701
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:18,571
Um,
I mean,

702
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:20,880
the first thing to know is that just 
like on so many of the things,

703
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:22,860
Americans are just the luckiest people 
in the world.

704
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:24,990
I mean,
we have so much oil and gas.

705
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,853
It's just incredible,
like a huge amount of our wealth in the 

706
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,510
last decade came from this fracking 
revolution,

707
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,910
which of course environmental supposedly
hate,

708
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,920
although in many ways they really like 
it.

709
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,810
That was going to be my second one to 
ask you,

710
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:38,910
but I really,
I'm really asking the same question,

711
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:39,744
right?

712
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,740
So,
um,

713
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,573
you know,
I think there's two things I think are 

714
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,674
important to know about natural gas.
The first is that it's just way better 

715
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:46,314
than coal,
like we went and looked at all the 

716
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:50,790
scientific peer reviewed research and 
it's just on every measure.

717
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,680
Water use,
water pollution,

718
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,050
air pollution,
carbon emissions,

719
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,850
everything.
Gas is just better than coal.

720
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:57,511
Of course it is,
right?

721
00:30:57,511 --> 00:30:59,360
You're using your kitchen and it's safe.
Yeah,

722
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,620
I mean still explode sometimes.
Cultural,

723
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,520
they want to talk to you about the 
exploding.

724
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,940
Yeah.
Um,

725
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,190
and it's not as good as uranium which we
use for nuclear.

726
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,440
Um,
similarly on all the same metrics,

727
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,700
uranium performance better.
So there's a way in which I just kind of

728
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,370
go,
there's just,

729
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,263
this is just basic energy density.
This basic physical facts about these 

730
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:23,640
fuels makes there,
makes a progression exist wood to coal,

731
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:25,110
to oil to natural gas.

732
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,410
You rainium.
Um,

733
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,200
I think,
I think it's important to know,

734
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,034
and I think one of the challenges I 
often make to my libertarian friends is 

735
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:32,334
that the government played a very 
positive role in all of these energy 

736
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:36,500
technologies.
Um,

737
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,970
uh,
maybe with the exception of,

738
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,290
um,
of coal,

739
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,940
although there's a little bit there,
but you really,

740
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,080
um,
oil and gas,

741
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:47,850
the US government has constantly been 
supporting r and d nuclear came out of a

742
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,650
military weapons program.
Um,

743
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,450
uh,
so I think that,

744
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,284
you know,
when you think about these energy 

745
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:53,454
transitions,
I think there is a role for government 

746
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,853
because there is a public benefit in 
terms of moving towards cleaner fuels 

747
00:31:57,901 --> 00:31:59,910
and also faster and better 
transportation.

748
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,873
Yeah.
So let's just do fracking because every 

749
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,230
time you say fracking,
people think of,

750
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,000
you know,
the fire coming out of their faucet.

751
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,760
They think of,
to make another simpsons reference.

752
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,594
They think of burns is slant oil 
drilling company that almost destroyed 

753
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,340
springfield.
Is that what fracking?

754
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,170
Um,

755
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,003
you know,
the funny thing is the sort of famous a 

756
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,380
fire,
the famous a water faucet on fire scene.

757
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,933
We now,
I think we now think came from a much 

758
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:28,420
older natural gas.
Well,

759
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,880
I'm not from fracking and um,
and the fracking itself is just breaking

760
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:35,014
up the Rock,
the shale rock and allowing the gas to 

761
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:38,464
escape.
That's not the stuff that you would 

762
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,100
worry about

763
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,650
if you cared about the environment,
which you worry about is the disposal of

764
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:46,450
the water and the sealing of the,
um,

765
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,400
of the,
of the pipes where the gas comes out.

766
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,443
Um,
so the thing is people tend to worry 

767
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,454
about or think about.
I think you just got tied up with the 

768
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:55,850
word fracking as well,
which sounds like a bad word,

769
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,860
but the funny thing is like,
I'm just like,

770
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,743
you know,
coal has actually gotten cleaner over 

771
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:03,794
the years.
Natural gas has gotten cleaner over the 

772
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,350
years.
Oil burning cars,

773
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,560
everything is cleaner and better.
Um,

774
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,120
but never as good as that next cleaner 
energy source.

775
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,983
So the better way to think about it,
I think as we get caught up in like how 

776
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,284
do you get the gas and whatever,
you need to have some protection of the 

777
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,154
environment and the public.
But really the main event is to move 

778
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:24,530
from these dirty,
your energy sources to cleaner ones.

779
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,423
Okay.
So let's talk about your campaign for 

780
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:29,540
governor of the Great State of 
California.

781
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,370
You were a lifetime Democrat and as you 
said,

782
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,900
your parents were progressive,
left these liberals.

783
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,270
Uh,
but you're running as an independent.

784
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,590
I'm running as a democrat.
Oh,

785
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:41,570
you are running.
It did change.

786
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:44,070
It did.
Dodo.

787
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,043
I,
uh,

788
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,743
I,
when I announced I saw some resident 

789
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,213
dependent and I,
and I was and am frustrated and upset 

790
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,120
with the Democratic Party.
Um,

791
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:55,761
you know,
I mean,

792
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:57,770
I was raised like this was like the 
party of the people.

793
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,873
That was what my parents taught me and 
that's what I believed and it has been 

794
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:02,924
completely taken over by basically 
landlords and energy companies and 

795
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:11,120
special interests.
And in California and things have gotten

796
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:11,960
worse,
not better.

797
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,630
Highest poverty rate in the country,
highest taxes.

798
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:16,070
Those two things aren't supposed to go 
together.

799
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,050
Those were supposed to go the other way.

800
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:18,883
Exactly.
You're just going to have the highest 

801
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,080
taxes then you should have of 
Massachusetts,

802
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:23,810
levels of poverty and if you're going to
have the highest levels of poverty,

803
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,420
then you just have like no tax or 
something.

804
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,263
Right?
So something's really wrong with the 

805
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,520
party.
And you know,

806
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,730
I'm a little bit like going from that 
scene,

807
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:32,564
from the abyss when Ed Harris takes his 
ring off and he like throws it in the 

808
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:37,190
toilet because he's so upset with his 
marriage.

809
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,990
I felt a little bit like that at the 
Democratic Party.

810
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:39,980
It was like just,
you know,

811
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,410
and then I kind of fished it out of the 
toilet,

812
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,680
you know,
put it back on my hand.

813
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:44,451
And I was like,
okay,

814
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:47,870
if I'm going to do this,
not only do I have to,

815
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,490
you know,
become governor,

816
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:51,590
we also have to clean up the 
legislature.

817
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:52,424
You have to get a serious reformers in 
and we've got to reform the Democratic 

818
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,680
Party because it's just not responsive 
to the people.

819
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,920
Maybe abyss reference in politics is 
works for me.

820
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:01,754
Good.
Okay.

821
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,380
Howard,
that ship let's just.

822
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:04,214
Exactly.
It had to be at the alien ship by the 

823
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:11,010
way.
Not to mention the alien ship fusion.

824
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,711
Wait.
So okay.

825
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,544
So you originally said Independent.
Now I get your frustrations with the 

826
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:19,010
Democrats watching this understands I'm 
with you on that.

827
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,510
What,
what caused you to shift?

828
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:23,990
Was that purely a tactical?
It's just even back to Democrat.

829
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah,
yeah.

830
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:25,754
I mean it's,
it's a little bit like it's probably 

831
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:32,780
more emotional and sort of about just 
who I am and just kind of being like not

832
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:35,090
wanting to give up on this thing that I 
believed in.

833
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:35,751
You know,
like I said,

834
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:40,751
I think the Democratic Party up until 
like 1975 was right on a bunch of stuff.

835
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,753
It started getting really crazy after 
that and frankly started becoming kind 

836
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:46,470
of the opposite of what it was supposed 
to be.

837
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,303
Particularly in California.
It became really an aristocratic party 

838
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,920
we've put in place and almost a feudal 
system in this state where you have just

839
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,754
a huge number of very wealthy people.
We subsidize a small number of lottery 

840
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,384
winning poor people who basically work 
as the servant class for the rich and 

841
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:06,270
then we drive the middle class people 
out of the state and,

842
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,420
and that is not what the Democratic 
Party was about before 1975.

843
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,313
And you truly are not being hyperbolic 
about this because just as someone that 

844
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,540
bought a house in the last year that the
house prices,

845
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,970
and you referenced this earlier about 
the housing crisis,

846
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,360
the house prices are,
are legitimately insane.

847
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:23,020
Where I used to live,
uh,

848
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,260
now I'm in a cheaper area here,
I don't want to say exactly where,

849
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,094
but where I used to live in west 
Hollywood to get literally a one 

850
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,264
bedroom,
one bathroom house that wasn't 

851
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,370
completely dilapidated,
literally a million dollar.

852
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,720
Oh yeah,
no,

853
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:37,554
I mean,
look in 2011 when Jerry Brown took 

854
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,300
office,
over half of Californians could afford a

855
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,134
middle class home today,
just 28 percent can millennials in 

856
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:47,700
California,
only a quarter own homes.

857
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,500
And the rest of the country it's over 50
percent.

858
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,710
So if you're a millennial or renter,
uh,

859
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,180
you work for your salary,
um,

860
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,840
you're on the losing side of how 
California has got this set up.

861
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,693
I mean,
so that's why I'm running is I the more 

862
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,494
I learned about the corruption and 
really just the destruction of the 

863
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:05,820
California dream,
you know,

864
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:06,654
which is,
which actually precedes the American 

865
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:08,461
dream.
You know,

866
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:12,420
historically California dream was 
opportunity owner home,

867
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,000
great schools,
beautiful weather.

868
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:20,120
We slowed the good weather when there is
in fire coming mudslide.

869
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,260
Oh no,
that's okay.

870
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,380
Um,
yeah,

871
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:24,450
so it's like the state is full of these 
contradictions,

872
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,130
right?
We say we're the most progressive state,

873
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,100
but we have the highest poverty rate and
the highest levels of inequality.

874
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,960
You know,
we say we're the land of opportunity,

875
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:33,330
but we won't let people build homes.
You know,

876
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:36,210
we have this incredible gift which is 
this tech economy.

877
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,150
Silicon Valley is really driving 
economic growth,

878
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:41,670
not just in the state but in the country
and arguably around the world.

879
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,743
And yet like we won't let people build 
like little apartment buildings are a 

880
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:46,920
little,
little new subdivisions.

881
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:47,754
I mean we've got spectacular natural 
areas that we're always going to 

882
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,680
protect.
But here's the most stunning thing.

883
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,860
The biggest use of land and the state is
cattle ranching,

884
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,860
still like a 19th century economic 
activity.

885
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,560
And we won't let people.
What?

886
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,403
We can't let people build a home because
of the cattle were putting cattle and 

887
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,750
cows before middleclass people before 
millennials that,

888
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,401
you know,
you and me,

889
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,140
a gen x,
we might be able to sneak in there.

890
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:14,460
We got our homes at the law we got in 
before they shut the door finally.

891
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,353
But millennials are really in trouble 
unless we can significantly expand 

892
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,104
housing.
So what is the solution in terms of 

893
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,730
taxes?
It seems to me,

894
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,920
I've only been in La for five years.
I'm only a homeowner for,

895
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,320
or I've only been in California for five
years.

896
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,270
I'm only a homeowner for basically a 
year.

897
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,870
We were taxed at incredibly high levels.
Uh,

898
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,040
obviously I'm not into that and as

899
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,873
you're saying,
the money that they're raising doesn't 

900
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:38,644
seem to be doing the things in terms of 
helping the people who need it the most 

901
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:43,504
doesn't even really working.
How do you fix that and how would you 

902
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,074
fix that from inside?
The machine that you're saying is 

903
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,140
actually so corrupt?

904
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,951
Well,
this is the,

905
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:52,690
this was one of the most exciting parts.
I mean,

906
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:53,800
it was funny,
um,

907
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,570
because I was so focused on energy,
you know,

908
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:56,291
and then it was kind of,
okay,

909
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,124
I'm going to try to deal with,
look at California as a whole and my 

910
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:01,630
brain's been hurting because there's so 
much to learn,

911
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,870
but when you get a broader view of it,
you what you understood,

912
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:06,070
you have a broader picture that goes,
look,

913
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:09,970
we need high levels of economic growth.
You need high paying jobs.

914
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,863
That means that we can't.
We've got to stop losing good 

915
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,880
manufacturing jobs to Texas,
you know,

916
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,760
we've got to get Toyota to stay here.
We got to get,

917
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,950
you know,
I mean really it's about supplying these

918
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:18,784
big multinationals,
Boeing and our apple making high value 

919
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,940
products for the high value components 
to those,

920
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,560
those products essentially

921
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,570
purely a tax break thing.
Is that purely the thesis?

922
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,543
Sometimes it's just infrastructure and 
sometimes it's just having housing for 

923
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:33,814
their workers.
Toyota took 3000 high paid executive 

924
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:38,110
jobs from California to Texas because 
they,

925
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,550
because they couldn't afford the 
housing,

926
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,860
the executives were like,
look,

927
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:43,210
in Texas I can buy a house for much 
less.

928
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,044
The median price home in California is 
two and a half times higher than the 

929
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:46,984
national average,
so just having more homes makes the 

930
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,270
state more able to retain high paying 
jobs.

931
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,040
So these things are all interconnected 
in that way.

932
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,350
So housing,
sometimes just infrastructure,

933
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,453
you know,
like if an Amazon or a costco or 

934
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,034
whatever,
if they need some infrastructure built 

935
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,550
and it's a good deal,
we should be doing that.

936
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,750
And the reason that we're not is because
the leaders of our state and the leaders

937
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,370
of this party really don't believe in 
it.

938
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:14,550
They really are about keeping California
expensive and elite to themselves.

939
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,053
I mean,
it's really a country club kind of 

940
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:18,500
liberalism.
It's not.

941
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,373
It's really illiberalism.
So if Jerry Brown was sitting here and 

942
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:22,480
heard you say that,
what,

943
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,510
what do you think is counter argument to
that would be.

944
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,520
He would say that he's been trying to 
get housing built,

945
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:29,920
but he's just got these powerful special
interests.

946
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:31,540
I mean,
he says that he does say it directly,

947
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:34,990
so as the unions and the 
environmentalist are opposed to it now,

948
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,913
I've looked closely at this question and
the truth is that most of the labor 

949
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,450
unions,
especially like sci,

950
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:43,630
you or the Teachers Union,
70 percent of teachers can afford a home

951
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,590
in California.
I mean,

952
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:45,424
that's just scandalous.
Most of the unions want to see more 

953
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:50,110
housing.
There's three unions,

954
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,360
tiny trade unions,
mechanics,

955
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:54,940
the mechanical,
electrical and plumbing,

956
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,953
which are basically working with the 
anti development environmental 

957
00:40:58,961 --> 00:40:59,794
organizations to prevent a reform that 
would very modest reforms that would 

958
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:08,320
basically prevent frivolous lawsuits 
under are very good environmental laws.

959
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,163
We have good environmental laws that are
being destroyed by people using them to 

960
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:16,510
block housing projects for reasons that 
have nothing to do with the environment.

961
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:18,850
In order to that they can manipulate the
projects,

962
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,013
get their way in a variety of ways.
Can you give me an example of one of 

963
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,201
those?
Yeah,

964
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:26,830
I totally can.
I'm in Berkeley in my hometown,

965
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,113
uh,
the New York Times did a great piece on 

966
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:29,914
it.
There is a single family home in 

967
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,190
Berkeley that they wanted to a nice 
sized lot.

968
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,910
They wanted to demolish the home and put
up three homes,

969
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,853
sort of switched them vertically and you
have a little driveway that would go in 

970
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,060
and one of the neighbors have organized 
against it.

971
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,153
I'm one of the reasons they gave is that
complain that it would cast shade on 

972
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,270
their garden.
And it was like they have a photo of the

973
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:51,104
garden,
The New York Times and it's just the 

974
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:53,600
most pathetic looking like,
I'm sorry,

975
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:54,290
like,
that was like that.

976
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,060
I don't even think those plants are 
alive,

977
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:56,960
you know,
and like they were like,

978
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,870
well,
we use it to produce food for ourselves.

979
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:00,681
I was like,
if that were true,

980
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,060
you'd all be starving to death,
you know.

981
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,670
So stuff like that,
um,

982
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,650
you know,
there's sort of a question,

983
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,200
is it,
is it economically rational?

984
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,080
In other words,
if you allow another house get built,

985
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,550
will your property value decline?
I just don't think there's any.

986
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,020
Supposedly you've,
you have more supply,

987
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:18,854
the prices would go down,
but there's just so much pent up demand 

988
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,780
for housing.
I don't even think that's the case.

989
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:27,520
So it's a lot of that petty stuff.
The unions use it a lot to,

990
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,823
to,
to get high wage project labor 

991
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:32,450
agreements.
I'm in favor of high wages,

992
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:35,150
especially if you have such high housing
prices but,

993
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,060
but fundamentally you need a lot more 
housing.

994
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:40,520
We need a least twice as much housing 
built annually.

995
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,800
Then we're building just to keep pace 
with demand.

996
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,020
Yeah.
Is there some argument though for that,

997
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,560
for that family that doesn't want the 
shade in their backyard?

998
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,490
Even if the garden is nothing or 
whatever like I can think to here in La,

999
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,200
you know,
in the Playa Vista area,

1000
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:57,920
that's where youtube and Google is and 
it was pretty much nothing there.

1001
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:00,680
Then they put up all of this.
Now what is insanely expensive?

1002
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:03,350
Um,
I mean I'm talking two or $3,000,000

1003
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,184
for a town home,
not even for your own home with 

1004
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:08,180
virtually no property,
but that it seems to be.

1005
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:09,014
There's some argument for the people 
that did live there for 30 years that 

1006
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,590
don't want all of this monstrous stuff 
around them.

1007
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,453
My slogan,
I say this as someone that doesn't want 

1008
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,940
the government to mitigate all of that,
but you know,

1009
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,110
and I guess,
look at the end of the day,

1010
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:23,090
they might get bought out at a really 
nice rate.

1011
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:23,924
Right.
So that's.

1012
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,833
So that would be good.

1013
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,440
Yeah.
I mean my um,

1014
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,660
the slogan that we're,
we're,

1015
00:43:27,661 --> 00:43:29,240
we're,
we're playing with is um,

1016
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,740
give change a chance,
you know,

1017
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,260
I mean here you live in a city.
Okay.

1018
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,094
You know,
you're living in a city near mass 

1019
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:35,781
transit.
I mean,

1020
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,730
you're in an industrial heavy,
you know,

1021
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:40,490
your home has increased in value 
dramatically and then you kind of go,

1022
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,324
we'll know.
No one can make any change in my 

1023
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:44,330
neighborhood.
I mean,

1024
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,970
I just think everybody is,
needs to be more reasonable.

1025
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:47,804
I mean,
my basic view is like there needs to be 

1026
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:49,904
more housing everywhere in the cities,
in the suburbs protect our natural 

1027
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:54,740
areas.
They're fine.

1028
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,603
Like there's so much land in the state,
plenty of land in the cities and the 

1029
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:01,010
suburbs.
Everyone just needs to be a bit more,

1030
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,890
give a little bit more,
be a little bit more reasonable.

1031
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,780
Um,
you know,

1032
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,623
and the reforms that I'm talking about 
are things were don't allow multiple 

1033
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:10,400
lawsuits against one project,
you know,

1034
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,980
and make sure that you have to identify 
yourself right now.

1035
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,040
You can sue anonymously,
you know,

1036
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,340
if you're gonna,
if you're gonna,

1037
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,750
try to stop an important project to 
house these really valuable workers.

1038
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:21,584
I mean,
here we have brought people from all 

1039
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:22,874
around the country,
all around the world who are these 

1040
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:27,470
talented technology programmers and 
marketing type people or whatever.

1041
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,550
And then we say to them,
oh,

1042
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:31,190
you have to pay $4,000
a month for a one bedroom,

1043
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,330
you know,
and if they want to buy a home,

1044
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:34,470
we say,
you're out of luck.

1045
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,110
You know,
I,

1046
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,410
it's just,
that's not what the California dream was

1047
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,460
about.
It wasn't about,

1048
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:41,310
I got mine and now forget everybody 
else.

1049
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,590
The California dream was expansive.
It was,

1050
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,700
it was said,
hey,

1051
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:45,534
you know,
this is a,

1052
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,530
an amazing state in the greatest state,
in the greatest country in the world.

1053
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,033
We've got to be more open.
So I sense basically you want lower 

1054
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,670
taxes basically.

1055
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,241
Right?
Which is,

1056
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,550
that's going to put you at somebody with
the Democrats.

1057
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Yeah,
I mean,

1058
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,360
on the taxes.
Let's talk about taxes.

1059
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,043
I mean the first thing you have to 
understand is that like there's sort of 

1060
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,014
like,
what would I do if I could start with a 

1061
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:09,290
blank piece of paper?
You know,

1062
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,231
and then there's like,
okay,

1063
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:11,580
if you become,
when you become governor,

1064
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:14,610
you're immediately negotiating with all 
these different interests.

1065
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,550
And by interests I don't mean just even 
organized interest groups.

1066
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,770
I just mean like homeowners who are kind
of like,

1067
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,150
you know,
don't want to change.

1068
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,830
So there's a very famous law in 
California,

1069
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:27,831
probably no prop 13 passed in 1978 and 
it restricts how much taxes can go up on

1070
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:29,754
a home.
So if you bought a home for a half a 

1071
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,430
million dollars and it increased to a 
million dollars in say five years,

1072
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,020
you would only,
you can only,

1073
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:38,760
they can only increase your taxes two 
percent a year.

1074
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,130
Um,
and um,

1075
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,053
and you know,
the reason given a sort of a sound 

1076
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:45,210
sensible,
which is that you don't want to,

1077
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:46,044
like,
you know,

1078
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,090
someone for no fault of their own 
selling,

1079
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,933
their house is worth a lot and then 
suddenly they're being hit with the tax 

1080
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:52,890
bill they can't afford.
So you basically,

1081
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,780
even though you've had a great 
investment,

1082
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,200
you can't even afford your investment.
Yeah.

1083
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,770
Yeah.
So I think that,

1084
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,653
again,
I think there just needs to be some 

1085
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,134
reasonableness,
so it's considered the third rail of 

1086
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:06,840
California politics to even suggest 
reforming prop 13.

1087
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,703
But I think we do need to reform it.
And part of the reason is that our 

1088
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:14,270
current taxes are so lopsided with the 
highest sales tax in the country,

1089
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,800
the highest income taxes on the top 
earners.

1090
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,413
And you might go,
well that's progressive because they 

1091
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:21,200
have more money.
But the problem is,

1092
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:23,580
is that every time the economy goes into
recession,

1093
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,380
we're just in massive debt,
right?

1094
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,470
So the when and then when we have a 
surplus like we had this year,

1095
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:30,270
it's because the stock market's been 
going crazy.

1096
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,550
So when the one percent,
so it's Kinda funny that people that are

1097
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:34,050
like,
we got to tax the one percent more.

1098
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,120
It's like,
well we've made the entire economy,

1099
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:37,710
all of our schools,
you know,

1100
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,544
all of these government services 
completely dependent on the fortunes of 

1101
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:41,544
the stock market.
So we're a state founded on boom and 

1102
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:47,070
bust the gold rush.
But we gotta get more stability in those

1103
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,080
finances.
So I think there's just got to be.

1104
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,060
I think these things like housing reform
I think has to be done as a whole.

1105
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,510
And I think similarly the tax and budget
form has to be done as a whole because I

1106
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:59,580
think everybody,
it's a classic prisoner's dilemma,

1107
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,510
right?
Where it's like,

1108
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,940
well I'm not going to want to think of 
anything and I'm going to stay on,

1109
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,060
stay strong because,
you know,

1110
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:07,650
make them get first.
So everyone's going to have to be.

1111
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,431
I'm still like,
I don't know,

1112
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:10,320
I can't make my slogan be a little bit 
more reasonable,

1113
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,860
but dogs.
Um,

1114
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,590
but I think you've got to get,
I mean that's what you're supposed to do

1115
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:18,070
as governor race was to bring to the 
table,

1116
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,913
kind of go look,
everyone's gonna need to make some 

1117
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:23,550
compromises and I don't think they're 
that big.

1118
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,800
I mean when you fly over,
I mean certainly la,

1119
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,380
the bay area,
it's just a lot of single family homes,

1120
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,040
like everywhere and you're kind of

1121
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,311
like,
look,

1122
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:32,020
you're right in the middle of the city,
you know,

1123
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:34,930
you gotta allow like a four or five 
story building to go up.

1124
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:35,764
And similarly you see a lot of lawsuits 
to block like additional homes in the 

1125
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:43,930
suburbs by the people that just had 
their homes built in the suburbs.

1126
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,920
You know,
it's always like,

1127
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:45,754
oh yeah,
the last guy up the ladder is the one 

1128
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:48,940
that's like most fiercely kicking it 
away.

1129
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,451
Right.
Well,

1130
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,220
West Hollywood that I mentioned before,
they put a moratorium.

1131
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,063
They were building all these sort of 
what they were kind of calling like 

1132
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:55,540
these mcmansions,
you know,

1133
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,430
these very modern,
tall things.

1134
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:58,264
And then they were basically dotting the
neighborhoods thus causing shade and 

1135
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:03,190
everyone else's.
They actually stopped them from doing it

1136
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:05,530
for awhile I think.
I think it just expired.

1137
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,630
So I mean you kind of go look,
you know,

1138
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,810
you won the lottery.

1139
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,710
You if you bought a home in California 
anytime in the last,

1140
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,860
you know,
30 years or you know,

1141
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,740
even like you've probably seen your 
prices even go up just one last year.

1142
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,993
Look,
you've done really well like you've 

1143
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:22,810
made.
You've often male.

1144
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,290
If you bought your home in like 2010,
let's say,

1145
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,124
you know,
or,

1146
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,340
or if you bought it in 2000 or 1990 or 
1980,

1147
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:33,280
you made a big chunk of money on your 
home.

1148
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,560
So then then to then turn around and 
say,

1149
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,140
well no,
my taxes shouldn't go up at all,

1150
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,160
is just unreasonable.
It's like,

1151
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,043
you know,
that's just not fair to everybody else 

1152
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:44,320
who comes in later.
You know,

1153
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,090
they show you in my home,
I bought my home,

1154
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:50,080
I pay 10 times more in taxes on my home.
Then the people that owned it prior,

1155
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,243
you know,
I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay a 

1156
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,450
little bit more in taxes coming a little
bit later and uh,

1157
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,330
know maybe a higher income,
but 10 times,

1158
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,770
you know,
that's,

1159
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,960
that's the part where it's kind of like,
what is it exactly going to be?

1160
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,793
It's like you're going to have to 
negotiate something that's just a lot 

1161
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:07,210
more fair than my current situation.
I like that you're kind of talking about

1162
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,044
this in a holistic way because it seems 
to me that you definitely still have 

1163
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:12,790
some progressive leanings,
which is totally fine,

1164
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,803
but I can tell you also have some 
libertarian leanings and I actually do 

1165
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:18,250
think that that's where most people 
fall,

1166
00:49:18,251 --> 00:49:19,084
which is why I think that this sort of 
interesting center that's developing 

1167
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:23,830
lately makes some sense.
Yeah,

1168
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:24,281
I mean,
look,

1169
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:26,820
the market is absolutely amazing,
right?

1170
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:31,630
And does so well on so many things.
It doesn't do everything,

1171
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,543
you know?
I don't think it just seems to have to 

1172
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:33,830
be so extreme,
you know,

1173
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,230
it's like,
um,

1174
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,183
like I said,
like most of the major technologies and 

1175
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:39,040
the iphone came out of the Defense 
Department,

1176
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:39,923
you know,
jet turbines which allows us to do jet 

1177
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:43,090
travel,
came out of the military.

1178
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,081
Um,
you know,

1179
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,750
a lot of the technologies that are 
making the environment better.

1180
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,950
Um,
electric cars,

1181
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,784
fuel cells,
these things are all supported by 

1182
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:50,314
government,
r and d when you're talking about 20 

1183
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:52,954
years of subsidies to industries that 
are plowing money into campaign 

1184
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:59,530
contributions and the technology's still
aren't very good.

1185
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,423
That's when you have real problems,
but it's almost impossible to beat that 

1186
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:03,491
machine,
right?

1187
00:50:03,491 --> 00:50:04,324
I mean,
that's really what you're up against 

1188
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:05,884
right there.
If you're going to really say we got to 

1189
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:10,930
stop subsidizing some of this massive 
stuff and I suspect Jerry Brown probably

1190
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:11,764
gets a lot of money from those guys and 
just just that the machine itself has 

1191
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:17,690
existed for so long.
That's really what you're up again.

1192
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,060
Well,
what's cool is that,

1193
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:22,630
so when I got into this discovery,
this really this corruption scandal that

1194
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:25,150
I think is really important,
but most people their eyes glaze over,

1195
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,950
it involves the public utilities.
Everyone's like,

1196
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:28,784
all

1197
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,200
right,
but I just,

1198
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,034
you know,
I mean what I learned about it is I was 

1199
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:32,091
like,
well,

1200
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:33,200
how do public,
how do you,

1201
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,480
how do you solve corruption?
Like there's a history here.

1202
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:36,314
So what you discover is that there's 
just these natural cycles of corruption 

1203
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:42,460
and reform and they've occurred several 
times in the 20th century.

1204
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,313
One of them occurred in the 19 twenties 
and thirties and other one occurred in 

1205
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:47,120
the 19 seventies.
So I was like,

1206
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,580
oh,
like we're overdue for another period of

1207
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:50,460
reform.
I mean that's,

1208
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,100
that's where it's,
I think people kind of go,

1209
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:53,720
you're up against this huge machine.
And it's like,

1210
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,670
yeah,
and if you knew how bad it,

1211
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,533
if you knew how corrupt it was,
like I know you will be all about 

1212
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,230
overthrowing it.

1213
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,063
Yeah.
Is that not though a purely libertarian 

1214
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:04,660
argument that it's like we keep going 
through these phases,

1215
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,940
then we put in new laws,
they gets better for a little while,

1216
00:51:06,941 --> 00:51:07,774
then it gets worse,
but that the libertarian argument would 

1217
00:51:09,071 --> 00:51:11,860
be all right,
get rid of all these laws were extremely

1218
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:12,694
overregulated here in California.
Get rid of all of this and let's just 

1219
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,630
see what the market actually does 
because we just simply don't.

1220
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,491
No.
Well,

1221
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:21,020
you know,
you got for some things.

1222
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:22,400
I think that makes sense.
And for others,

1223
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:25,460
I don't think it does.
So there are natural monopolies,

1224
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:26,294
um,
electricity things where you're just 

1225
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:28,484
doing a lot of infrastructure that is 
very expensive and then you're kinda 

1226
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,151
like,
okay,

1227
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:34,960
so we're gonna have two electric 
companies like stringing of electric.

1228
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:37,640
I mean like it's just,
that's how we got,

1229
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,060
that's why we regulate electric 
utilities and the way we do.

1230
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,580
Um,
now some of them have been privatized,

1231
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,443
but you're still,
you still have monopoly for the Poles 

1232
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:48,530
and wires.
Otherwise it's like,

1233
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:50,630
it's already really ugly.
Like all the electrical wires,

1234
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:51,680
you know,
you're an environmentalist,

1235
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:53,420
you know,
like I'll bury those.

1236
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,410
Um,
but,

1237
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,431
but you know,
it's like,

1238
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:57,140
oh no,
we're gonna have a whole second or third

1239
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,570
set of electrical wires.
So the government was like,

1240
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:01,760
look,
just you can have a monopoly and you can

1241
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:05,090
even be a privately owned company but 
you can't price gouge.

1242
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,963
Right.
So like you're going to come to us and 

1243
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,730
go,
hey gotta raise rates.

1244
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:08,721
And we kind of go,
oh,

1245
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:09,554
okay.
So some of it's negotiated and just a 

1246
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:13,310
little bit messier.
Is there corruption?

1247
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,920
Definitely some,
some extent.

1248
00:52:15,921 --> 00:52:17,330
Is it inevitable?
I think it is,

1249
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,923
but I think it's inevitable meaning that
because of the way the system worked 

1250
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,123
there eventually,
even if they're being controlled a 

1251
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:24,354
little bit,
there's still the only game in town so 

1252
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,890
they can always keep ratcheting it up.

1253
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,680
I mean like,
you know,

1254
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,220
like Jerry Brown's father I think 
achieved amazing things in California,

1255
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:34,450
you know,
the universities,

1256
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,430
the roads,
the water systems,

1257
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:37,983
it was a period of high growth as well 
and he benefited from was there some 

1258
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,670
political corruption in the sense of 
doing so,

1259
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,960
giving some contracts to sure you know,
what you want is to make sure it doesn't

1260
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:50,140
become proportions like we see in the 
developing world,

1261
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,950
spend much time in central Africa or in 
Latin America and you're just getting.

1262
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:54,993
You get to the point where the 
corruption is so severe that nothing 

1263
00:52:56,621 --> 00:52:57,454
gets built.
Like at the end of the day it was 

1264
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,510
corruption and Korea where I spent a 
bunch of time at the end of the day they

1265
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,890
get the thing built.
You know,

1266
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:04,720
in other places if you don't get a bill 
and you're like,

1267
00:53:04,721 --> 00:53:05,554
well,
so I think we've just gotten to a point 

1268
00:53:06,911 --> 00:53:09,790
where it's just gotten so excessive in 
California,

1269
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,653
the just the exchange of contributions 
for contracts and permits has just got 

1270
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:18,640
to the place where it's just obscene and
needs to be fixed and as usual,

1271
00:53:18,641 --> 00:53:19,630
the best way to fix it.

1272
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,520
It's just with sunlight and 
transparency,

1273
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:22,570
I mean,
you know,

1274
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:27,060
they all have these really bad deeds can
only occur behind the cover of darkness.

1275
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:30,600
And so once you shine a light on it,
it tends to take care of itself.

1276
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,500
Sunlight is the best disinfectant it is.
That has been a theme around here.

1277
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,423
So just tell me about a couple of the 
other issues that you actually care 

1278
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:39,300
about that you're campaigning on.
Well,

1279
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,120
one of the ones I'm really excited about
is education and you know,

1280
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:42,954
what's,
what I love about going into an issue 

1281
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:45,090
that you're sort of new to.
I mean,

1282
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,920
my mom is a public school teacher,
was a public,

1283
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:50,370
was the teacher's Union Rep and my 
sister is a,

1284
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:52,620
is an education expert.
So it's certainly something we've talked

1285
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:55,260
about for a long time,
but what's the fun to go back into it?

1286
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,163
Associate fresh and you start to see 
these fights and arguments between 

1287
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,950
people,
um,

1288
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,830
from a,
from a different point of view.

1289
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:02,663
I'm not participating in them,
but what was so striking for us when we 

1290
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:05,634
looked at the research was that what's 
clear is that we've got the school 

1291
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:12,930
schedule that makes everybody unhappy,
right?

1292
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,930
You go to school at like eight and then 
you get out at like 2:30,

1293
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,390
you know,
and like all the bad things as you,

1294
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:20,850
as you and I know from our childhoods 
occurs between 2:30

1295
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:21,684
and when your parents come up and then 
you have these after through the best 

1296
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,260
hours of like.
Exactly.

1297
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,030
I don't.
Yeah,

1298
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,550
I'm going to take them away.
That's the problem.

1299
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:29,483
You know what I mean?
So I think schools have to work for 

1300
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:32,130
parents,
so it be nine to five,

1301
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,203
like why is it you have to cobble 
together afterschool programs and these 

1302
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,290
things and that is,
we're like,

1303
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,090
often kids fall behind.
Um,

1304
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:40,800
I also think the school year should be 
longer.

1305
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,023
Um,
and I think teachers want to be treated 

1306
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,484
like professionals.
There's nothing more demoralizing for 

1307
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:46,854
teachers than like bad teachers because 
that's what my parents would come home 

1308
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:50,190
and complain about bad teachers all the 
time.

1309
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,800
So you've got to build to move out the 
bad principals,

1310
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:56,490
move out the bad teachers,
you've got to have a proper professional

1311
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:58,770
school day.
And that first part though,

1312
00:54:58,771 --> 00:54:59,604
that's it.
That's a big fight you'd be taking 

1313
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,560
against it is absolutely.
Yeah.

1314
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,810
And they've got to give.
I mean,

1315
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,670
look,
the teachers are unhappy.

1316
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:07,770
I mean the turnover rate is just through
the roof.

1317
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,311
I mean,
like I said,

1318
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:10,500
17 percent of them can't afford to live 
here.

1319
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:11,334
So.
So I do think teachers that are 

1320
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:14,154
performing should be paid better.
I think the school should be nine to 

1321
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:17,754
five.
I think the school year should be 

1322
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:19,254
longer.
What we know is that the more time that 

1323
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:21,114
kids get instructional time,
their performance goes up and our 

1324
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:26,910
performance in California has been going
down even though we put $20 million more

1325
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:29,130
in the schools over the last seven 
years.

1326
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,680
And that's what seems to be one of the 
places that again,

1327
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:33,300
libertarian,
crazy California.

1328
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,600
It's like you keep pumping money into 
things,

1329
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,533
but then every time we tested,
every time you look at the numbers and 

1330
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:40,830
we compare you state by state,
it's worse.

1331
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,690
It's worse than it is,
it's frankly,

1332
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:44,970
it's a scandal and the people that 
suffer the most,

1333
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:46,920
it's the usual,
the poor African Americans,

1334
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:48,440
Latinos,
um,

1335
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,790
performance has been flat line or even 
declining.

1336
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,811
And so because,
you know,

1337
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:52,920
if you're,
if you're wealthy,

1338
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,550
if you're,
you know,

1339
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,383
if you're privileged you can send your 
kids to private summer science camp and 

1340
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,410
stuff like that.
So.

1341
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,930
So I would like to see a significant 
reform.

1342
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:02,250
Again,
it has to go with taxes.

1343
00:56:02,251 --> 00:56:04,680
If you're going to go year round is 
probably going to cost more.

1344
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,710
How are we going to finance that?
Again,

1345
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:10,200
you just got to have a wholesale reform 
of taxes.

1346
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:12,060
I think education,
what is exciting though,

1347
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:15,570
is that a longer school day and a longer
school year,

1348
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:16,404
it means you have more time to do the 
instructional on math and science and 

1349
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:21,570
reading which kids need to get up to 
snuff.

1350
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,280
But then you also have the time for 
stuff arts,

1351
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,900
you know,
physical education.

1352
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:29,690
We need to do more physical education 
and then it allows for the dea.

1353
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,573
I mean,
here we have a digital technology 

1354
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,074
revolution happening in this state that 
we're leading and the place that it has 

1355
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:37,060
not penetrated at all is like the 
schools,

1356
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,920
I mean there's some amount of laptop 
use,

1357
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:43,440
but what you get with the digital 
revolution is that you can be a so,

1358
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,274
so math lecturer or teacher,
but the kids can get it now on Khan 

1359
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,233
Academy or they can watch Ted talks that
people that do a much better job 

1360
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:54,460
explaining it and then the teachers can 
roam and be tutors.

1361
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,473
My mom was also a tutor and when I was a
kid one time she tutored me and she 

1362
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:01,840
usually tutored learning disabled kids 
and she treated me.

1363
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:02,271
I was like,
wow.

1364
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:04,720
It was like,
I learned so much in like an hour.

1365
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,430
I was like,
tutoring works with all kids.

1366
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:07,091
And she was like,
yeah,

1367
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:10,120
tutoring works with everybody.
So you call it flipping the classroom.

1368
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,390
Kids get the lectures from digital 
devices,

1369
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,520
chromebooks or,
or smart phones or just from TV's.

1370
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:17,603
Um,
and then the teachers can roam and do 

1371
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:19,384
tutoring and then that allows,
that solves a big problem which is that 

1372
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:23,134
both the overachieving kids and the 
underachieving kids are being neglected 

1373
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,503
as,
as teachers try to get the kids in the 

1374
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:29,434
middle to pass the tests.
It's an interesting concept because 

1375
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:34,570
there is so much information accessible 
at your fingertips.

1376
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:37,210
I mean the amount of people that watch 
shows like this.

1377
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:39,790
Just for some information.
My friend Greg Gutfeld,

1378
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:40,624
he's been on the show,
wrote a great piece a couple of weeks 

1379
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,370
ago about how it's like all the stuff 
that you're supposed to learn in college

1380
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:46,204
that unfortunately now because of the 
hysteria colleges that you're not 

1381
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:49,600
learning,
right?

1382
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,433
You can go online and hear lectures from
incredible professors like Jordan 

1383
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,573
Peterson again said and listen to these 
guys tell you all of the things that 

1384
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:59,230
they're supposed to be telling you at 
college.

1385
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:00,760
And guess what?
If Youtube,

1386
00:58:00,761 --> 00:58:01,990
it's free.
It's wonderful.

1387
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:03,340
Wonderful.
It's wonderful.

1388
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,240
I mean,
Khan Academy is this beautiful.

1389
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:07,300
My daughter does it on her.
She has an iphone.

1390
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:09,250
She's 12,
which I was a reluctant about,

1391
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,540
but with what?
With Khan Academy,

1392
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:11,374
these beautifully perfect lectures that 
are designed to that we know that they 

1393
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:15,910
work,
the kids then interact with it.

1394
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,570
You still need to have a role for people
because you need the interaction,

1395
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:21,280
you need the group work between the 
kids.

1396
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,283
You knew the teachers going around.
But I mean we are just massively 

1397
00:58:25,421 --> 00:58:28,630
underperforming as a country and as a 
state when it comes to education,

1398
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:29,464
we're getting our tails beat by,
by my much poor developing countries 

1399
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:33,604
like Korea.

1400
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,133
Um,
the longer school I hear that and I 

1401
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:41,570
think suddenly I became a 12 year old 
what I know about myself.

1402
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,170
So what do you,
what do you actually mean by that?

1403
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,520
Well,
I mean,

1404
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,353
again,
I think cost is going to be something 

1405
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:49,300
we're gonna have to deal with because it
will,

1406
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,860
it will almost certainly cost more 
money.

1407
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:51,660
So,
you know,

1408
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,010
I'm Kinda like,
we've got a nine month year now.

1409
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:56,320
I'd love to see us get to 11 months.
You know,

1410
00:58:56,321 --> 00:58:59,080
some parents don't want to take their 
kids away for a month or you know,

1411
00:58:59,081 --> 00:58:59,914
travel around or whatever.
Just like overloading kids with 

1412
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:04,060
information because I think we're 
generally,

1413
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:04,894
because of our smart phones and twitter 
and everything is we're in an 

1414
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:07,114
information overload.
What about the value of that two month 

1415
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,990
break that we had as children will.
The problem is is that during that break

1416
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,580
was huge cognitive declines.

1417
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,650
It's very well documented now that we 
just.

1418
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,513
Kids will forget a lot of stuff and then
you start the next school year and you 

1419
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:22,910
review for the first several weeks or 
months.

1420
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:23,773
The older stuff,
the kids that suffer the most are the 

1421
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:27,470
less affluent kids,
African American kids,

1422
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:30,620
Latino kids whose parents don't send 
them to science camp during the summer.

1423
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,933
So,
but in terms of overloading the biggest 

1424
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,180
problem of the overloading is the school
day.

1425
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,420
You're cramming all this stuff in 
between like eight and two,

1426
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,820
you know,
and so sometimes somebody will be like,

1427
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:43,670
well what about like elementary school?
Like little kids need to take a nap,

1428
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,121
you know,
it's like,

1429
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:45,530
great,
take a nap.

1430
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,110
Maybe the teachers could take an 
attitude.

1431
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,500
What about arts?
And so I think there should be more,

1432
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,150
like,
as a writer,

1433
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:53,984
I walk a lot,
I don't know how I could ever write 

1434
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:57,770
anything if I didn't just walk and think
about it.

1435
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:01,250
So it should be more of,
there should be more downtime to respect

1436
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:02,084
the fact that our brains get tired and 
the kids need some time off and the 

1437
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:04,994
first part of the day's gonna be more 
productive than the second part of the 

1438
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,543
day.
But if you have more time you can deal 

1439
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:09,254
with that.
The other thing is that I'm going to 

1440
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:14,000
eliminate homework and I'm going to 
eliminate schoolwork for teachers.

1441
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,863
So,
um,

1442
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,550
so get yourself back in your 12 year old
mind.

1443
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,190
No more homework.
All the homework is done at school.

1444
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,043
Okay.
Because you were losing me a little bit 

1445
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:22,640
with exactly.
But now no homework,

1446
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,820
no homework.
And then my mom would come home,

1447
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,950
you know,
she would come home from school,

1448
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,480
whatever it was,
4:00,

1449
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:30,590
5:00,
make dinner,

1450
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,490
and then she would go back to work 
grading papers and preparing for lessons

1451
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:37,130
like in the evenings when it should have
been family time.

1452
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,480
Um,
and,

1453
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,910
and I think that what I'd like to say to
teachers is just go,

1454
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:42,530
look,
you get to leave work at work,

1455
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,630
you get to be what everybody else gets 
to do.

1456
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,520
You go home from work and you're not 
supposed to work anymore.

1457
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:47,363
I get to watch television,
watch a movie with your kids and then 

1458
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:52,280
the kids too,
they get to leave the work at school and

1459
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,400
so the homework and the school work,
the grading and the lesson plans,

1460
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:59,990
all that gets done at school and is 
opened up by having kids are able to get

1461
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:00,824
a personalized digital education with 
like the best world world's best 

1462
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:05,264
lecturers and teachers online.
So that's an interesting way of kind of 

1463
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:08,480
splitting the difference.
Okay,

1464
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:10,570
we're going to extend this day.
Yeah.

1465
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:11,643
Um,
which sort of goes against my feeling 

1466
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:14,024
about overloading,
but they were going to build things in 

1467
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,963
which are going to allow teachers to be 
able to do some more work and students 

1468
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:20,120
to.

1469
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,953
Absolutely.
I mean kids are kids used to learn how 

1470
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,380
to draw like properly,
right?

1471
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,214
And we have like art classes,
but like who knows how to really just 

1472
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:28,010
draw,
right?

1473
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,010
Like you look at the 19th century edgy,
you know,

1474
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:30,844
you kind of go,
that might be one of the things that 

1475
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:32,630
gets taught again,
you know,

1476
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:33,464
you have some more time to actually.
And there's also like a bunch of stuff 

1477
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:36,854
now about like you need that social and 
emotional intelligence to perform well 

1478
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:41,870
in the business world and you know,
just to not be a jerk,

1479
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,660
you know,
those are things that can all be taught,

1480
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,553
but you need to have the time for it.
This thing of rushing in 45 minutes 

1481
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:51,930
through math and rushing for the minutes
of reading in history is,

1482
01:01:51,931 --> 01:01:52,691
is just a,
it's a,

1483
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:53,630
it's based on,
uh,

1484
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,130
you know,
when we were farmers,

1485
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,173
you know,
and when we thought people were 

1486
01:01:56,391 --> 01:01:57,224
preparing people for the factories,
now we know that we're all so different 

1487
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,550
and how we learn.
We're at different levels.

1488
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,090
We can go at different paces.
I wasn't very good at math.

1489
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:05,510
I was very,
I was pretty good at reading.

1490
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:06,803
You can get an education that's really 
tailored to you once you have that time 

1491
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:15,320
and you have to open up that digital 
universe that already exists.

1492
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,550
Yeah.
Give me a couple more.

1493
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:17,750
Your,
your major thing.

1494
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,440
So yeah,
so we went through,

1495
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:20,460
so we went through housing,

1496
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,840
we went through jobs and through schools
obviously energy,

1497
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,420
cheap,
reliable,

1498
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:28,254
clean energy is essential to be able to 
bring back those good manufacturing 

1499
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:32,551
jobs.
There's,

1500
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:33,660
you know,
people have the wrong idea.

1501
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:34,230
They think,
oh,

1502
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,063
the manufacturing has to go abroad,
high tech manufacturing needs to be 

1503
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:38,304
here,
but it needs cheap energy and it also 

1504
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:41,244
needs skilled workers.
So one of the other reforms that occurs 

1505
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,094
and as the relationship between the jobs
and the school's apprenticeship 

1506
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:47,830
programs,
you know,

1507
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,313
young people want to have mentors,
they want to have masters that they 

1508
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:53,454
apprentice with will.
So let's get Boeing and apple to have 

1509
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:58,800
supplier companies here,
whether it's in the central valley or in

1510
01:02:58,801 --> 01:02:59,634
La and it should be,
have a direct relationship to the high 

1511
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:05,310
schools and the community colleges.
And then we need the cheap energy.

1512
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,173
So we've got two nuclear plants.
They've shut down one of them through 

1513
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,494
and that's what led to the corruption 
scandal that trying to shut down the 

1514
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:13,520
second one,
they,

1515
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,910
they provide total 40 percent of our 
clean electricity in the state.

1516
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,620
I want to get them started back up 
again.

1517
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,370
People worry about the safety.
I think they shouldn't be worried,

1518
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,503
but the other cool thing that's going on
is that they haven't made a lot of 

1519
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:29,880
progress in what are called accident 
tolerant fuels,

1520
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:34,710
fuels that if there is a loss of coolant
and as a risk of overheating,

1521
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,850
it would take many hours and potentially
many days before they overheat.

1522
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:42,090
So if those fuels,
those fuels should be tested in our art.

1523
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:44,940
We were innovation central here in 
California,

1524
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,820
so we should be testing these,
these innovative meltdown proof fuels,

1525
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,600
um,
and then really pioneering their use and

1526
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:53,310
their diffusion throughout the whole,
um,

1527
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:55,110
around the whole country and around the 
whole world.

1528
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,280
So I think,
um,

1529
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:56,941
and then,
you know,

1530
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,710
there's just so many other needs for 
that energy.

1531
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:00,240
Basically,
if you have abundant,

1532
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:01,620
cheap,
clean energy,

1533
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:02,880
then you can desalinate water.

1534
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:03,893
This whole water crisis that Los Angeles
and California find themselves 

1535
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:09,480
periodically in doesn't need to exist at
all with cheap,

1536
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:11,790
abundant and clean energy.
You can recycle the water,

1537
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:12,743
you can disseminate the water.
There should be plenty of water for the 

1538
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,500
farmers and for people that live in the 
cities.

1539
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:19,320
La should be green as idea that we have 
to turn off our water.

1540
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,453
Is,
is just part of that forced deprivation 

1541
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,233
and,
and manufactured scarcity that came out 

1542
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,750
of an ideological turn,
you know,

1543
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:30,180
against the prosperity in the seventies.
That's what I want to.

1544
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,460
I think that's the revolution that we 
want to offend your telling me.

1545
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:34,860
Everywhere I go,
we're in between the roads go in one way

1546
01:04:34,861 --> 01:04:35,694
or the other and they have the grass 
that's not green anymore because we're 

1547
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:39,660
saving what it is.
That's actually not necessary.

1548
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:41,100
You don't need to do it.
I mean,

1549
01:04:41,101 --> 01:04:41,934
yeah,
it will cost some energy to desalinate 

1550
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:43,840
and to recycle.

1551
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,673
But look,
we agreed to the whole desert in 

1552
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,410
California was deserts and turn them 
into farms.

1553
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:48,860
This,
you know,

1554
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,920
this whole area was very arid.
Um,

1555
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,430
we have the technology to produce 
abundant water.

1556
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,390
And abundant and greenery and,
and we,

1557
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,233
that's in abundant greenery is wonderful
for a lot of reasons that keeps the 

1558
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:02,170
city's cooler.
It captures carbon and um,

1559
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,211
you know,
so there's just,

1560
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:04,044
and it makes life more pleasant.
But this idea where we all have to sort 

1561
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:08,550
of this austerity,
this forest sacrifice,

1562
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:11,610
austerity really starts with an attack 
on cheap,

1563
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:13,950
clean energy and,
and in particular on nuclear.

1564
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,320
Anything I needed to know a lot of the 
social stuff with you.

1565
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,220
I have a of,
I could probably figure

1566
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,390
it out.
Yeah.

1567
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,920
Just buy everything else.
I know.

1568
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,410
I don't think the government should 
decide who gets married.

1569
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:28,240
We're good to go.
I mostly think that stuff has been a way

1570
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:30,550
to just drive us apart.
And I mean,

1571
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,780
Trent is.
Trent does anything.

1572
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:33,970
Transgender bathrooms.
It was like one of the big issues facing

1573
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,140
California.
Nobody does,

1574
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:35,981
you know,
um,

1575
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:36,814
I don't even think that people in North 
Carolina or wherever that now you think 

1576
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,520
it's a big issue there.
I know.

1577
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,740
So I think like,
you know,

1578
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,633
I,
I'd like to actually get to a place 

1579
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:46,720
where it's like we're talking about 
what's the common good and not,

1580
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:47,953
you know,
what effects this interest group or 

1581
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,550
this,
you know,

1582
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:52,091
I,
I just,

1583
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:55,570
I think that identity politics has just 
gone really too far.

1584
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:58,150
It's made us lose sense of who we are as
a people.

1585
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,103
Yeah.
Well I feel like that might be the 

1586
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,290
sentence we should end this on because I
had been looking,

1587
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,124
my whole audience says I've been looking
for somebody that sounded like a 

1588
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:07,720
sensible,
a Democrat that I could,

1589
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,400
you know,
try to want to support.

1590
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:09,790
Oh,
you know,

1591
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,970
real quick,
uh,

1592
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:11,853
my former guys,
Zoltan Istvan is also running for 

1593
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:18,250
California here as,
is he running well he's a transhumanist,

1594
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,750
technically a party that can run or is 
he running as an independent do?

1595
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:22,361
Well,
you can.

1596
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:23,770
Um,
what's cool is that we have,

1597
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:27,040
will told an open primary and so anybody
can go for anybody.

1598
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,143
And so if you're Democrat you can go for
a Republican and independent just means 

1599
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,070
declined to state.
So yeah.

1600
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:33,904
So,
um,

1601
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,240
but maybe you're gonna endorse me,
not talk about that after,

1602
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:40,060
but I had been looking for a Democrat 
that I go,

1603
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,290
oh,
that's what demo.

1604
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,021
Yeah,
it is.

1605
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:44,854
And yet you're not ignoring the future 
and we'll know because in some ways you 

1606
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:51,700
go like it was the Democrats pre 1975 
that believed in the future.

1607
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,370
The ones after that side kick away the 
ladder.

1608
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,353
What's unforced scarcity and let nobody 
else come and enjoy this beautiful 

1609
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:00,100
paradise that we have.
But there's plenty of room,

1610
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,983
you know,
this is a,

1611
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:02,103
this is a state I want to get back in 
touch with the values of abundance and 

1612
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:08,530
opportunity and an openness that I think
had been shot and not.

1613
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:10,900
And not just by the left either,
I think by both sides.

1614
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:11,741
Yeah.
Well listen,

1615
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:14,050
it's been a pleasure talking to you.
Good luck on the campaign.

1616
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:18,880
And for more on Mike and his campaign,
