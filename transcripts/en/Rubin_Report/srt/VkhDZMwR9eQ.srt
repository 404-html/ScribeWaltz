00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,930
Joining me today as a sex researcher,
a neuroscientist and cohost of the wrong

2
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,250
speak podcast,
Dr Deborah.

3
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,110
So welcome to the Rubin report.
Hi,

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,910
I am glad to have you here.
Finally,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,260
I'm so happy to be here.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,090
All right.
We got a lot to talk about.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,470
I thought the best way to start this 
thing.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,090
I don't like to look at my notes up 
front,

9
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:23,924
but you had a line on your patrion page 
that I thought summed up the whole damn 

10
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:27,974
thing pretty perfectly.
Your patrion bio says creating 

11
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,160
journalism that defends science and free
speech.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,230
You've come to the right show.
All right.

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,900
I think so.
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,360
Okay.
Should we talk about sex first?

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,283
Should we just start with sex and then 
can you talk about it all bleeds into 

16
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,840
one thing.
Um,

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,883
okay.
Uh,

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,950
you started as a neuroscientist,
but you were sort of more attracted,

19
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:55,040
for lack of a better word to,
to studying sex.

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,090
Tell me about that.

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,230
Yeah,
so I mean,

22
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:58,064
I decided to go back to school and do my
phd in neuroscience and along the way I 

23
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:03,050
had the chance to do a placement in 
sexology.

24
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,330
So I'd never heard of sex research 
before,

25
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,164
I had no idea what it was,
but it was so fascinating to me and I 

26
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,704
thought it's crazy that we have the 
technology to look at people's brains 

27
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:12,944
and look at sexual arousal in the brain 
and it tells us so much about what it 

28
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:18,980
means to be human.
So from from there I was hooked.

29
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:19,814
I loved it.
My Phd was in using brain imaging to 

30
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,104
look at Paraphilias,
which are atypical sexual interest and 

31
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:30,590
hypersexuality and men and I love 
research.

32
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,424
I always will.
But then I made the decision to leave 

33
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:34,754
academia and work full time as a 
journalist now because the climate had 

34
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,374
changed so much.
Even between when I started my phd and 

35
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:41,960
when,
when I finished.

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,853
Yeah.
And that's why the stuff that you're 

37
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:44,534
talking about really is at the nexus of 
everything that I'm doing here because 

38
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,224
now you're on the journalist side,
but it's because of the hostility that 

39
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:55,530
you were facing on the academic side.
So what we're.

40
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,413
What is it that you were unearthing are 
studying that was so triggering to 

41
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,854
people?

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,913
Well,
within sexology you can't really study 

43
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,210
anything that isn't triggering,
I'd say across the board,

44
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,310
someone's going to get mad at you no 
matter what,

45
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,563
but

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,300
no,
you're really looking at facts.

47
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,950
You're looking for.
You're looking to find that.

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,881
Yeah,
exactly.

49
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,080
And even with brandon machine,
I mean,

50
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,250
that's,
that's definitely,

51
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:19,160
it's a growing field.
The technology is legitimate,

52
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,310
but no matter what I think because 
sexist still considered very taboo,

53
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,144
people will either project their own 
ideas and beliefs and values onto it or 

54
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,060
they just don't see the value and they 
think,

55
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,330
why is the government funding this?
I feel really lucky being in Canada,

56
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,430
we do have a pretty amazing,
uh,

57
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,390
scene in terms of sex research.
Um,

58
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,110
and my colleagues do manage to get 
funding.

59
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,590
So I think that's excellent.
But my decision to leave academia,

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,933
uh,
in the last two years I had noticed 

61
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:50,000
things were starting to go a bit weird 
and in terms of the climate and in terms

62
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:50,834
of mainstream media,
I was seeing piece after piece about 

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,040
transgender kids and how young children 
were socially transitioning.

64
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,370
Getting on blockers,
pubertal,

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,473
pubertal blockers,
and the media was basically saying this 

66
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,360
is the greatest thing.

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,810
This is something that we should rejoice
about that these kids are so much better

68
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,510
off after,
but from a scientific perspective,

69
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,373
the research actually shows that the 
majority of kids who are gender 

70
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,450
dysphoric actually outgrow their 
feelings.

71
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,700
They're more likely to grow up to be gay
in adulthood,

72
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,760
not transgender,
and so it makes sense for them to wait,

73
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,250
not for them to socially transition at a
young age.

74
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,323
So I wanted to write a mainstream piece 
about this and there has been a very 

75
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,390
long standing history between trans 
activist and a sex researchers.

76
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,230
Very ugly history of activists going 
after sex researchers if they don't like

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,410
what someone's study says or what they 
say publicly.

78
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,573
So I thought about it for a long time.
I wrote the piece and I sat on it 

79
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,190
probably for about six months and I 
wasn't sure if I wanted to put it out.

80
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,100
I asked a bunch of my colleagues and 
mentors and they all said,

81
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:53,500
you know what?
The science is solid,

82
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,750
but you know,
you know what's going to happen.

83
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:59,290
If you do put this out and at the time I
wanted to stay in academia and I said,

84
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,200
should I wait until I get tenure?
And everyone told me,

85
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,840
even if you have tenured nowadays,
it's not going to protect you.

86
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,020
You can still lose your job.
So I decided to actually I couldn't stay

87
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:08,854
quiet and I thought I'm not going to 
stay in an environment where I can't 

88
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,124
speak the truth and I can't even pursue 
questions that are meaningful anymore 

89
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,604
because I have to worry about who's 
going to get mad and then I'm going to 

90
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,380
lose my money and my funding and I'm 
going to lose my job.

91
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,214
So that piece went out and it was called
the white transgender kids show a 

92
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,190
transition and then I haven't looked 
back since.

93
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,830
Yeah.
So I re-read.

94
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,290
I've read the piece before but I reread 
it this morning,

95
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,250
but thank you.
Got here.

96
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,503
And there's a lot here.
So how much of this is just bleed is 

97
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,670
just blatantly a misunderstanding of 
science.

98
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,693
Like I think there's partly that you 
have a misunderstanding of science and 

99
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:48,150
then you just have activists who just 
want you to bow to them all the time.

100
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,830
Are you able to sort of quantify how 
much of the backlash is each?

101
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,790
I think to be charitable,
I try to look at the other side and give

102
00:04:56,791 --> 00:05:00,480
them credit and try to think that they 
have good intentions.

103
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,430
Maybe people.
I mean,

104
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:06,330
it's pretty consistent.
All 11 studies ever done on the topic of

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,173
distance.
So this phenomenon I talked about where 

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,460
kids grow out of their feelings of 
gender dysphoria,

107
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,360
all of them say the same thing.
So the final statistic is about 60 to 90

108
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,420
percent.
So this is the vast majority of kids.

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,840
You can't really question those data.
So I think what it could be as people,

110
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:24,684
I mean trans people have a history of 
having to deal with medical gatekeeping 

111
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,870
of people telling them they don't really
what they feel isn't real.

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,590
I do think gender dysphoria is a real 
phenomenon and I do think we should have

113
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,800
empathy for people who are suffering.
Um,

114
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,380
so I think it could be coming from that,
of,

115
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,900
of that place of,
well,

116
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,123
we don't want people saying that this 
isn't a legitimate thing or that trans 

117
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,930
people should be forced to not feel the 
way they do,

118
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,800
but um,
in terms of these children,

119
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,293
we should be thinking about the best 
outcome so it doesn't make sense for 

120
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,324
them to transition if that's not 
actually going to help them in the 

121
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,480
longterm.

122
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,313
I,
I to give people the benefit of the 

123
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,930
doubt,
but I do think the activists,

124
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,940
they,
on some level,

125
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,560
I think they know that they can bully 
sex researchers because of that history.

126
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:11,230
They know that there's only so much an 
academic can do and they've won a couple

127
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,220
battles.
So I think that's part of it as well.

128
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,180
How shocking was it to you when you were
discussing this with colleagues,

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,193
um,
that they were kind of hinting you may 

130
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,560
want to wait on this thing.
I mean,

131
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,530
did you think that you'd be in that 
situation?

132
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:25,730
And I'm,
I'm wondering,

133
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,020
did any of them sit on some other things
because they were afraid to.

134
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,510
It was eyeopening.
Yeah.

135
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,540
Um,
but I,

136
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,360
I kind of knew,
um,

137
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,100
one one I guess instance I can talk 
about is one colleague,

138
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,170
Michael Bailey at northwestern 
university,

139
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,303
he wrote a book that upset transgender 
activists and they went off after 

140
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,553
ruthlessly.
I mean they really tried to destroy his 

141
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,170
life and thankfully,
you know,

142
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:53,004
he's,
he's still considered one of the 

143
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,720
foremost experts in sexology 
internationally.

144
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,370
But I would say that,
you know,

145
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:00,204
I've written about him previously.
I think he's kind of been the poster 

146
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:04,404
boys to why people are really terrified 
to say anything that goes against the 

147
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:07,900
Trans Narrative.

148
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,230
So I think you've already hinted at this
and I know your work otherwise,

149
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,920
but so you have no issue with trans 
people as people.

150
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,640
Just to be clear,
this is purely about the science related

151
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:19,474
to transitioning and hormone blockers 
and things of that nature of a certain 

152
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,560
age where they're doing it as young as I
think you're right about 14.

153
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,970
Oh,
younger than that now.

154
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,813
Well,
yeah,

155
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,680
I mean if there's parental consent,
definitely.

156
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,690
And I have to say for a transgender 
adults,

157
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:34,030
and I'd say even kids who reached 
puberty and still feel that way,

158
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,970
I think transitioning is,
is totally up to you.

159
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:39,700
If that's the path you decide to go,
then power to you.

160
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't think there's any ones,
any,

161
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,200
it's anyone's business to tell you what 
to do at that point.

162
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,870
So why are there basic parameters 
related to age then?

163
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,870
Well,
there are insurance.

164
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:52,780
So I don't work with children.
I don't do clinical work anymore.

165
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:55,780
But um,
in terms of the research literature,

166
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,973
usually clinicians will wait until 
puberty and see how the child feels at 

167
00:08:01,271 --> 00:08:02,950
that time,
when the body starts changing,

168
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,950
when they start having crushes on their 
peers and that kind of thing.

169
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,110
And the research does show that,
um,

170
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,660
when kids start to,
you know,

171
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,563
have crushes and start dating and that 
can play a role in terms of how they 

172
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,230
feel about their bodies and whether they
do outgrow it.

173
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,590
Just at that point,
your whole body is in flux.

174
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,380
Your mental states and physical states 
in flux.

175
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,441
And as you said,
what,

176
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,274
what did you say a percentage on that?
Of How many of them turn out to just so 

177
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,260
yeah,
so they,

178
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,420
so 60 to 90 percent of the children 
undergoing these feelings turn out to be

179
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,540
gay and then I assume the ones that 
don't transition,

180
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,880
probably most of them ended up being 
okay with being gay,

181
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,740
I would imagine.
Roughly.

182
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,763
Yeah.
And I would say even like I grew up in 

183
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:46,554
the gay community.
I have a lot of gay male friends and 

184
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:51,300
they've said to me when I was young,
I told my parents all the time,

185
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:52,134
I hated being a boy and I want it to be 
a girl and I am a girl and why can I 

186
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,790
become a girl?
And now as a gay man,

187
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,530
I'm so comfortable.
I'm so happy.

188
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,360
And they say to me,
you know,

189
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,194
I'm,
I'm kind of glad I'm not growing up in 

190
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:04,170
this time because I think I probably 
would have transitioned.

191
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,430
Yeah.
Well that's why the,

192
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:06,264
the external pressure seemed so crazy to
me because you just don't know at that 

193
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,820
at that age.
And even if you do know waiting a little

194
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:14,970
bit,
is that a,

195
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,830
for the science to flesh out here?
That's not going to kill you.

196
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,610
It's just hard talking about this 
evening.

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

198
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,030
I mean,
the thing is,

199
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,400
what people also aren't talking about is
that for these kids,

200
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,970
in some cases the parents don't want a 
gay child and this is what upsets me the

201
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:29,804
most.
So if you have a little boy who's very 

202
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:34,160
feminine,
he's likely going to grow up to be a gay

203
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:34,994
man,
but if you take that same level and 

204
00:09:37,191 --> 00:09:39,800
allow them to transition to female,
when he grows up,

205
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:41,210
he's going to appear to be a straight 
woman.

206
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,553
And so these parents are being lauded as
progressive when really they're 

207
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,154
homophobic.

208
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,990
Oh God.
How perverse that is.

209
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,993
That is.
That's interesting what you just said 

210
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:52,460
about a certain amount of gay men that 
grow up,

211
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,950
you know,
they wanted to be a or it felt more like

212
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:56,480
a girl or whatever,
and then eventually grew out and we were

213
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,314
okay because I never felt that.
Like I played sports and I played video 

214
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,660
games and transformers,
all the,

215
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,553
all the things that my friends did or I 
never felt like I was a girl or more 

216
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,370
feminine.
People always say to me,

217
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,870
I don't seem gay,
and I'm always like,

218
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:10,410
I don't know what that,
you know,

219
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:14,420
it ain't like I'm married to a guy 
that's pretty gay,

220
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,280
but I never had that.
But that,

221
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:20,150
that sort of just interesting about the 
psychology of gay people in general.

222
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:20,984
There are gay people that grow up 
feeling very feminine or gay men that 

223
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:24,674
grow up,
not feeling that way and I'm sure 

224
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:29,480
there's women that grow up feeling very 
butch or whatever.

225
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,820
And there's women that grew up that are,
you know,

226
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,340
lipstick,
lesbians and the whole thing.

227
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,680
Have you done any research on it,
on any of that?

228
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,050
Uh,
in terms of my research,

229
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:38,884
no.
But in terms of what studies have shown 

230
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,120
it as about hormone levels in utero.
So testosterone,

231
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:45,670
if you are exposed to higher levels of 
testosterone in Utero,

232
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:48,700
you're more likely to be male,
typical and masculine when you're born.

233
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,743
So whether you're male or female.
So most boys are exposed to high levels 

234
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,150
of testosterone.
So at that explains when they're born,

235
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:59,350
why they are interested in Male,
typical toys and activities.

236
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,423
Um,
so for gay men they were likely exposed 

237
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:06,460
to lower levels of testosterone,
which is why they're more feminine.

238
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,780
And the same with,
with girls,

239
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:08,614
if they're exposed to higher levels of 
testosterone than more likely to be 

240
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:11,500
masculine and lesbian.

241
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,030
Right.
Even though there's obvious outliers.

242
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,440
Oh yeah.
This is on average.

243
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,430
On average.
Yeah.

244
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,583
Is,
is there a danger in talking about that 

245
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:19,784
because I would imagine that the certain
amount of people in the gay community 

246
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:23,174
that would want you to never go down 
that road because then you could end up 

247
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:27,801
in a place where,
oh,

248
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:28,634
we would be able to prevent people from 
being a ultimately if we can really 

249
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,430
figure out the science behind all this.

250
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,461
Definitely.
And I mean,

251
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,120
as a straight woman,
I have to say I even,

252
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,020
I even right now feel like maybe I 
shouldn't be saying these things because

253
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,910
I'm not gay.
I can't speak for the community.

254
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,270
But as a former sex researcher,
I am very much a proponent of A.

255
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,723
I'd rather you speak as a researcher 
that a gay person or a straight person 

256
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,360
or anything else.
I mean this is,

257
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,790
this is the problem though,
you're,

258
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,180
you're know what I mean,
like you weren't,

259
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,023
you were an expert in this and it's like
even for you who's so brave on all of 

260
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,670
these issues,
it gets weird to talk about it.

261
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,690
And even for me I just,
it's like a little weird to talk

262
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,980
like a trader.

263
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,200
No,
I am what I am and that's all that I am.

264
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,043
That's it.
But like I know that just even talking 

265
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,610
about this just gets people crazy and I 
know what our,

266
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,940
what our twitter feeds are going to look

267
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,630
right after this,
get ready.

268
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,733
So I mean it's crazy because even my 
colleagues who have the best intentions 

269
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:24,764
are doing this research because they 
just want understand why are people the 

270
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,700
way they are.
It's not.

271
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,270
There are no nefarious intentions there 
but people are so quick to jump on.

272
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:36,860
I mean there was earlier this year there
was a study about using ai to be able to

273
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:39,440
detect whether someone is gay by looking
at their face.

274
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,453
And so again,
studies have shown that on average you 

275
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:45,530
can see differences between straight and
gay people.

276
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,364
Both men and women in terms of facial 
features and so everyone's freaking out 

277
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:50,354
about this study and I'm thinking,
why aren't we saying this is amazing 

278
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:55,700
that we're able to know this?
And I mean,

279
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:56,534
I think I've really good Gaydar I've 
always thought I have and now I think 

280
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,364
great,
like there's actually some quantitative 

281
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,410
data to suggest that I'm not just making
things up.

282
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
Right?
And they're also,

283
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,080
they always say,
well gay guys have Gaydar something else

284
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,060
that maybe you can see or whatever it 
is.

285
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,860
Or they'll.
I don't know the people say it anymore,

286
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:12,694
but people used to say gay face.
Like there's just something about the 

287
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:15,334
facial features sometimes of gay men.
Maybe they were a little softer or 

288
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,990
whatever it is.
I don't even know what it is,

289
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,350
but like people were talking about that 
in the gay community.

290
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,170
Then it comes out through some sort of 
science lens and it's like,

291
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,150
Ooh,
we better watch out for that.

292
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,000
And the thing is then researchers see 
that and say,

293
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:30,834
well I don't want to go through that.
So then they don't want to touch that 

294
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:33,090
topic.
So now there's,

295
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,953
they're eventually going to be only like
two different things you could probably 

296
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:37,770
study unless you know that what your 
findings,

297
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,680
what you're going to find is going to be
politically acceptable,

298
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:41,514
in which case you shouldn't be doing the
research because that means you're not 

299
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:43,974
actually doing science.

300
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,893
Yeah.
What do you think it is about you that 

301
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,070
makes you brave enough to do this sort 
of thing?

302
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Because I bet a couple of other people 
we're going to talk about James Debord a

303
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:52,274
little bit because you've also written 
about him and why the whole thing about 

304
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,264
diversity and all that,
but I've had a bunch of outliers in 

305
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,234
these communities on the show and I'm 
always curious what it is about the 

306
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:05,510
specific people that make them sort of 
put it out there and go,

307
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,120
I'm going to do it.
Whether you like it or not.

308
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,600
It's probably my personality.
Yeah.

309
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,434
I mean I just generally don't really 
care what people think about me and I'm 

310
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,610
pretty stubborn and I.
I'm very.

311
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,420
I feel very strongly about sex research 
being taken seriously and my decision to

312
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,273
go on it and gone into that field that 
you deal with a lot of stigma as I 

313
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,420
mentioned earlier.
You deal with it on both sides,

314
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:29,254
you know,
and when you make the decision to go 

315
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:34,300
into the field,
suddenly when people know what you do,

316
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:37,000
they will judge you on a personal level.
So I think that was part of it.

317
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,893
You know,
I grew up very thick skin from saying 

318
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm going to do what I find interesting 
and people can assume whatever they want

319
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,630
about me and that I think that just 
translated into now what I do as a,

320
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:48,380
as a science journalist,
but the,

321
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,560
I would say too,
and I'm sure you probably went through a

322
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,394
similar experience once you speak out,
it becomes much easier and I find I 

323
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,660
can't,
I can't stay quiet now.

324
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,950
And I find the people that are gonna,
you know,

325
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,060
turn their backs on you let them because
you don't need them in your life.

326
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,370
Yeah.
Once you start,

327
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,930
you can't stop.
Actually,

328
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,060
it's built into you.
You just can't stop.

329
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,060
So one of the things I think is really 
interesting is how,

330
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,013
you know,
there's such a movement always to say 

331
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,800
that gay people are born this way.
Right.

332
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,634
Lady Gaga even wrote it down on the 
bathroom floor in this way and yet at 

333
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:24,260
the same time,
if I know for a fact,

334
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:28,410
like I have a friend who for many years 
was my lesbian friend,

335
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,900
my one good lesbian friend and she was 
dating girls all the time and all that.

336
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,183
Then about three years ago we were 
sitting there and she told me that she 

337
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,024
met a guy and now she's been with this 
guy for about three or four years and 

338
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:46,430
they're getting married and she's 
identified as basically as bisexual now,

339
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,264
but she's only.
She's exclusively been with a guy for 

340
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:49,994
about four years.
But what I find interesting about it is 

341
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:52,994
that her lesbian friends have basically 
all turned on her and this is supposed 

342
00:15:59,121 --> 00:15:59,954
to be the.
These are supposed to be the people of 

343
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,320
tolerance and we should accept your 
sexuality and all that.

344
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,860
But when it goes the other way,
suddenly it becomes this other thing.

345
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,480
Have you have.
You seen that before?

346
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,960
Do you have.
I can imagine that I'm.

347
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm guessing they probably think that 
she sold out.

348
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,700
She's a sellout or something.
Yeah,

349
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,150
you're taking the easy road or something
like that.

350
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,130
Like every insane cliche and I know her 
to be completely authentic and real.

351
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,720
How does,
how has she dealt with it?

352
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,554
I'm curious.

353
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,590
It's been.
Well,

354
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,540
it's woken her up in a zillion other 
ways,

355
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,374
so for a lot of the other things that we
talk about about free speech and 

356
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:36,030
politics and freedom and all that,
she's started to wake up to all of that.

357
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:36,864
She was a huge lefty progressive and now
she's basically a libertarian because 

358
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:45,180
she saw that authoritarian thing.
Why do you guys want to control me?

359
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,510
The second I think differently.
You guys want to control me,

360
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,630
so now she's like the

361
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,790
good stuff.
All of my friends so to speak.

362
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,163
That's the thing.
I think all of us are eventually going 

363
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:55,044
to have a moment like that where you 
realize what you thought was the truth 

364
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,870
is not the truth and there's so many 
other things.

365
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:02,704
It's like falling down that rabbit hole 
and real and you start to question 

366
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:06,370
everything then,
and it's really liberating.

367
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,391
But uh,
you know,

368
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:08,620
in terms of sexuality,
that's.

369
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:09,970
I mean that's very common.
Women,

370
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,150
female sexuality is much more fluid than
men.

371
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:15,160
Some men tend to be very category 
specific.

372
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:17,440
If you're into women,
you really like women.

373
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,130
You're not two guys.
If you're into guys,

374
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:23,080
do you guys not to women than women tend
to be a little bit more flexible.

375
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,770
It's like you find,
you know,

376
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,683
there are supposedly straight married 
men that on the dl or sleeping with 

377
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:29,634
other guys,
but I'm pretty sure there aren't many 

378
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:31,434
gay men that are in relationships are 
married that are sneaking out and 

379
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:34,854
sleeping with women.

380
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,350
No.
Have you ever seen one of those who?

381
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,510
Your research.
Okay.

382
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,450
There's a,
you know,

383
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,620
I think the first case I think is 
probably closet gays and then the second

384
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:49,260
case I have to think about that

385
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,243
gay man.
Well,

386
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,680
I guess you might be sleeping.
Yeah,

387
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,580
I mean I did it like I slept with women 
as sort of like a,

388
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,320
an overcompensation or I was trying.
It's not even overcompensation.

389
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,750
I was really trying,
I just thought I should try.

390
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,760
I and tried.
I tried and you know,

391
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,590
eventually I tried no more.

392
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,483
Yeah.
I think also for gay men when you come 

393
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,674
out,
it's such a big thing and I think to 

394
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:18,081
make that decision to come out is really
committed to this as much as you know,

395
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,680
we don't like identity labels.
It is an identity label.

396
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:21,514
So I would see it as being less common 
for someone who's gay to be sleeping 

397
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:29,541
with women on the side because he would 
have likely just stayed in that camp.

398
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,140
That would be my guess.

399
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,730
Yeah.
So.

400
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,760
Okay.
So you mentioned that you,

401
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,990
you study a lot of this related to the 
brain,

402
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,123
how a lot of this is sort of built into 
us and you studied this across sort of 

403
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,680
fetishize the right word.

404
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,020
A paraphilia is,
yeah,

405
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,090
fetishes,
a specific pair of failure,

406
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,180
but um,
across the board basically.

407
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,000
So wait,
what's the definition of Paraphilia,

408
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,993
uh,
unusual sexual interests and how's that 

409
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,640
different than fetish?
Well,

410
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,483
if fetishes,
a specific object or body part that you 

411
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,590
have a preference for.

412
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,930
Got It.
So,

413
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,853
uh,
so let's talk about a couple of those 

414
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,460
located.

415
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,650
There are a lot of them,
so I always,

416
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,300
I tell people this and no one ever 
believes me,

417
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:12,140
but I'm actually very,
very traditional vanilla,

418
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:12,980
not kinky.

419
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,663
Love it.
You're going to ask you all that at the 

420
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,313
end about yourself.

421
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,220
Good.
Okay.

422
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,320
Yeah,
but I mean,

423
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,173
I'm fine.
It's super fascinating and I guess it's 

424
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,820
my way of living vicariously,
you know,

425
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,983
so in terms of different paraphilia is,
I mean there's a foyer ism is known as 

426
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:29,474
peeping toms and exhibitionism,
so people like to expose themselves a 

427
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,950
sadism and masochism which are different
from bdsm.

428
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,310
Bdsm is consensual masochism,
sadism.

429
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,230
So masochism being,
wanting,

430
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,510
wanting to be humiliated.
Sadism is one,

431
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,860
just your partner,
be humiliated.

432
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,873
Bdsm is very much about consent,
so it's not true masochism or sadism 

433
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,234
because a partners will negotiate 
beforehand and not do anything outside 

434
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,760
of particular boundaries and that kind 
of thing.

435
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,470
Uh,
what else is there?

436
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,783
Fraud or ISM.
So it's when people like to rub up 

437
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:03,560
against unsuspecting people,
there are tons I could go on forever.

438
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,903
Yeah.
And so how are these all connected to 

439
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:07,244
the same parts of the brain?
Is it the same mechanism that's working 

440
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:13,210
in the fetish itself is just manifested 
in

441
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,760
different targets?
Yeah.

442
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,580
So with my research,
when I was still a researcher,

443
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,750
I found that for men who are Kinky,
when they look at kinky pornography,

444
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:22,584
the same brain network activates as when
non kinky people are looking at regular 

445
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,593
or vanilla pornography.
So it's adjust that paraphilias maybe 

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,033
akin to a sexual orientation.
So it's not to say that's the same as 

447
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:36,600
being gay,
but it's the same idea conceptually that

448
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,850
it's someone's preference.
It can't be changed.

449
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,510
Um,
and it's with them from,

450
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,760
from very early on.

451
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,773
Yeah.
How does the Internet play into all 

452
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,004
this?
Because I know you've written about a 

453
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,403
porn and things like that where now all 
of this stuff is so accessible where 

454
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:56,280
obviously even 15,
20 years ago it was a lot harder to get.

455
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,590
Yeah.
I think people are probably able to test

456
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,590
out different things and go searching 
for things out of curiosity.

457
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:04,424
But if you really like something,
I don't think it's because you happened 

458
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,650
to find it on the Internet and with porn
addiction in particular,

459
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:14,330
there's no research to suggest that it's
a real thing that excessive porn viewing

460
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:15,164
is akin to an addiction.
Usually if you talk to someone with 

461
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:20,120
problems with porn across the board,
it's,

462
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,370
there's always some other reason why 
either they're anxious,

463
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:23,600
they like to procrastinate.
Well,

464
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:24,434
they don't like to procrastinate,
but they use it as a way of 

465
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,410
procrastinating and avoiding other 
things.

466
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,900
It's not that they're actually addicted 
to pornography.

467
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,880
Right?
So when you hear though that people will

468
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:32,271
say,
well,

469
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,104
you're getting that dopamine.
Isn't that partly what being addicted 

470
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,700
you?
Wouldn't you become addicted to that?

471
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,973
What?
My understanding of the term addiction 

472
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,360
slightly incorrectly.

473
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,660
That's true.
Um,

474
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,650
but dopamine is released during the 
number of different things.

475
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:48,750
If you eat a nice piece of food that you
like dopamine's released,

476
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,630
um,
if you see a nice picture,

477
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,070
dope,
mean reward,

478
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,200
but it's responsible for a lot of 
different things.

479
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,930
So I think that's one case of.
I mean,

480
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:57,764
I do have some issue with science 
journalists watering things down and 

481
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,490
liking to take one finding or one study 
in kind of a,

482
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,370
you know,
representing it or misrepresenting it.

483
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,060
So it's not really an accurate take on 
it,

484
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:11,894
but I understand why people think that 
because dopamine has been seen as the 

485
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,940
addiction neurotransmitter and then you 
see so much about porn,

486
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,701
porn,
addiction,

487
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:20,534
sex addiction.
I'd say probably a year ago it was 

488
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:22,814
everywhere.
Everyone was talking about porn and sex 

489
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:24,980
addiction even though they're,
again,

490
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:28,490
there's no legitimate research to 
suggest that those things are real.

491
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,693
Hmm.
So when you've studied all of these 

492
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:32,060
things,
what are,

493
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,893
what are you finding out about the brain
as a neuroscientist and can anything be 

494
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:37,414
done for any of these things?
If somebody was partaking in these 

495
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:40,594
things and either didn't want to or at 
least wanting to understand it or 

496
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:43,954
whatever else.

497
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,420
The biggest thing I would say is find a 
partner who accepts you for who you are.

498
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,130
Whatever you're into.
Especially for men,

499
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,353
it's not going to change.
And so the difference between someone 

500
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:54,360
who has

501
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,193
so meaning women's kinks or whatever 
will change with time where a man would 

502
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:58,914
be less inclined to.

503
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,903
Yeah.
The same with,

504
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,023
you know,
in the same way with the sexual 

505
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:02,334
orientation,
women tend to be more flexible with 

506
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:04,920
their sexual preferences.
So if are Kinky,

507
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:05,754
they might be really kinky with one 
partner or if they have a partner who's 

508
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,870
very kinky,
they might be into whatever he's into if

509
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,723
it's a straight couple.
But then if she's with someone who's 

510
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:14,760
less Kinky,
it might not be as much of a problem.

511
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,830
Whereas if it's a man who's really into 
something,

512
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,650
if his partner is not into it,
he's always going to be into it.

513
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:20,790
He's just going to have to hide it.

514
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,140
Yeah.
Have you heard of this phrase,

515
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:24,550
lesbian bed,
death.

516
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,900
I'm all,
I'm all over the place.

517
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,280
I'm just going into the fall and seeing 
come up with.

518
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,920
Have you heard this phrase before?

519
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,840
It's means that there's no sex after a 
certain amount of time.

520
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah.
That lesbians,

521
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:40,841
it sort of burns very hot for that early
period and then the u haul shows up as a

522
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,460
joke and then just like the,
the desire for sex just disappeared.

523
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,430
There's just lots of cuddling.
I haven't heard of that.

524
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,893
Well,
men on average do tend to have a higher 

525
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:52,904
sex drive,
so I could see if you're in a 

526
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,890
relationship where it's two women,
how uh,

527
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,803
this,
you know,

528
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,810
their sex drive might be a bit lower.
Not sure what else?

529
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,910
Like what,
what are you really thinking about right

530
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:05,784
now in general?
What are the topics that are really on 

531
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,090
your mind related to all this?

532
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,280
My concern number one is probably seeing
how gender is being warped to facilitate

533
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:19,120
particular political agendas.
Um,

534
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,983
as you mentioned the James Damore and 
seeing how that whole thing unfolded 

535
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:23,560
last summer.

536
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,690
Okay.
So let's talk about that.

537
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,250
Could you wrote a piece on it?
I remember the piece coming out.

538
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,561
Yeah.
Um,

539
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:31,350
so I remember when that news first 
broke,

540
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,563
uh,
that this sexist memo was going around 

541
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,330
and I read it and I thought,
okay,

542
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:39,000
this is not sexist.
And then I saw the statement from Google

543
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:42,660
that he was perpetuating gender 
stereotypes and I thought,

544
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:45,480
oh no.
And so I wrote that column for the Globe

545
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,920
and Mail to speak to the science and 
say,

546
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:47,754
you know what the science said James 
cited was absolutely 100 percent 

547
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,330
legitimate and there shouldn't be 
anything wrong with saying that.

548
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,210
And if you actually read his memo,
you'll see that he's not a misogynist.

549
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,073
And we actually saw the podcasts that I 
cohost with Jonathan Kay called wrong 

550
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,584
speak.
We actually interviewed him for our 

551
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,220
first episode and if you listened to him
speak,

552
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,090
you'll,
you can see,

553
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:06,924
I mean,
he's very much for equality between the 

554
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:11,070
sexes.
He says that if men and women don't talk

555
00:25:11,071 --> 00:25:12,780
to each other,
that's going to harm both of us.

556
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,030
Um,
but it was much easier for them to paint

557
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:19,470
him as a misogynist and as an outright 
failure because I guess,

558
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:20,850
you know,
there's nothing else going on the news.

559
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,303
Did you feel that the article,
or at least when James was able to get 

560
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:29,780
out there and say what he thought,
whether he did it here or,

561
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,010
or on Rogan or a series of other 
podcasts,

562
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,293
did you feel that that was able to break
through to some of the people that 

563
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,160
needed to break through to like,
I know it gets to the masses,

564
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,994
right?
It gets to the people who appreciate 

565
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,290
maybe what happens in here or on Rogan 
or things like that,

566
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,600
but for any of the people that really 
need to hear it,

567
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:49,500
the ones that are at Google or the ones 
that are setting the diversity agenda at

568
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:52,980
schools and all that,
is there any sign that any of this,

569
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,680
a pushback against it has taken root?

570
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,240
No,
I think it's gotten worse,

571
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,140
if anything,
honestly,

572
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,400
which is terrible.
Um,

573
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:04,990
I think they are so set in that mindset 
that you really can't.

574
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,860
You can't say anything.
I think reasonable people if you talk to

575
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:09,694
them.
I was surprised actually at that time 

576
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:13,600
because a lot of people that I knew that
were really intelligent,

577
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,703
really rational had bought into this 
narrative that he was a sexist person 

578
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:18,724
who said that women are biologically 
inferior and are not capable of 

579
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,480
engineering or working in tech,
and I said,

580
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:26,350
well,
why don't you think that?

581
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,030
Did you read the memo?
And most people had not,

582
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,940
but then because the left wing media was
so adamant about this message,

583
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,350
people just assume,
well,

584
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,710
they're not going to lie.
Why would they lie and you know,

585
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:40,600
we are in this industry,
so of course we know,

586
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,790
but I think most people just take it 
face value.

587
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:43,624
They're.
They have their jobs and so they see a 

588
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,340
headline or they see an interview.
They just think,

589
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,560
well,
I like a mainstream interview.

590
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,550
They think,
well,

591
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,700
they wouldn't be saying these things if 
there wasn't some truth to them,

592
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,500
but no,
they.

593
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,560
They're blatantly lying.

594
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,543
They're blatantly lying.
Has all of this and being part of this 

595
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,980
and being very public about your 
opinions.

596
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,814
Has this changed your politics at all?
I find that it consistently has changed 

597
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:10,500
people's politics.
Usually it shifts people to more of what

598
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,000
I would say as a classical liberal 
position,

599
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:12,834
but what a libertarian,
just more of a less government position 

600
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,343
because you want.
Because that's where I think at the 

601
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,940
moment,
the most freedom lays.

602
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,630
Yeah,
I would agree with that.

603
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:24,190
And especially the idea of the 
government.

604
00:27:24,191 --> 00:27:26,080
I used to.
I used to be definitely more left,

605
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,520
much,
much more left.

606
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,620
Um,
I was still calling myself a liberal,

607
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,753
but definitely now that I see because I 
used to think was good for the 

608
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:36,100
government to come in and help people 
and to kind of set the tone.

609
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:40,210
But now now I'm seeing things that are 
not hate speech or being considered hate

610
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:43,840
speech and genuine facts.
We're not allowed to say them anymore.

611
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:44,674
So I'm much more skeptical now of 
government intervention of policies 

612
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,200
dictating what people can and cannot do 
or say.

613
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,420
So I would say I have moved more to the 
right,

614
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,220
but I would still call myself a liberal.
I mean,

615
00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:57,680
the fact that I write about sex research
for a living is pretty low.

616
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,270
Yeah.
You're my kind of liberal.

617
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,390
So you're,
you're good to go.

618
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:01,224
In here,
so one of the things that I think is 

619
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,830
fascinating about all of what we're 
talking about here is that it's not just

620
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,664
about gender and sex and sexuality,
but this is also leaking into all sorts 

621
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:10,914
of other things,
talking about ethnicity and color of 

622
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,170
skin and all of that.
Uh,

623
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,000
you've written a bit about this.

624
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,901
I have,
yeah.

625
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:22,080
I wrote about how a university 
applications,

626
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:22,914
and particularly Harvard has been 
discriminating against Asians for 

627
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,130
decades and how to the point where 
Asians,

628
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:29,964
when they apply to university,
will want to hide their ethnicity in 

629
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:33,954
hopes of that.
That's going to give them a fair chance 

630
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:35,860
of actually getting into.

631
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,050
So the school.
So.

632
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,893
All right,
so somebody that's watching this right 

633
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:40,390
now that doesn't know about this,
they're gonna go,

634
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:41,224
wait a minute,
why would harvard discriminate against 

635
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:44,890
Asian people?

636
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,170
Because apparently there are too many 
Asians there.

637
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,100
If it's based solely on sat scores and 
meritocracy,

638
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,423
um,
there's a very high proportion of Asian 

639
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:55,714
students.
And so in the name of quote unquote 

640
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:59,830
diversity and inclusion,
um,

641
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,450
Asian students get penalized.

642
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,503
So this to me is the most blatant 
example of why this diversity stuff is 

643
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:12,440
complete nonsense because people on face
value,

644
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:14,780
it seems nice.
We want to help people,

645
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,943
we want to help groups that maybe have 
struggled more for whatever reason and 

646
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,950
there's probably many good ways to do 
that.

647
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:24,350
Maybe investing in more education or 
whatever else.

648
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:25,184
I'm happy to hear your thoughts on that,
but what they take as a good thought 

649
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,830
then they don't think all the way 
through,

650
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:33,710
which means okay,
now we're going to have to punish people

651
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,770
who have worked very hard and done 
everything right.

652
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:38,960
And by and large,
the Asian community,

653
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:41,440
whether it's Chinese or Japanese or 
Korean or whatever else,

654
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,280
have

655
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,280
worked really hard and put a focus on 
education and family.

656
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,380
And then what is the result of that?
It's now harder if not almost impossible

657
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,400
at some level to get into Harvard.
And the craziest thing,

658
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,520
I don't understand why people think is 
acceptable.

659
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,270
And even when I wrote that column,
I had a number of Asians reach out to me

660
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:02,410
and say,
you know,

661
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:03,244
don't,
don't be used as a token for the far 

662
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:06,940
right.
And I'm totally okay with this,

663
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:08,260
this is fair.
And I'm thinking,

664
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,310
you know,
what are you on the times?

665
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,263
Do an op Ed,
I think by an Asian woman coming 

666
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,960
mistaken.
Yeah.

667
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,530
Saying that this is okay.
And I just,

668
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,903
I mean,
what do you do it that you are fighting 

669
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:27,100
for true equality that is simply not 
what they're fighting for.

670
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,990
I think it's indoctrination at some 
level.

671
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:29,824
I think especially for the kids who are 
applying to these schools and who are 

672
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:37,210
okay with having to score much higher on
the sat in order to get a fair chance.

673
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,320
I think they've just been told,
you know,

674
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,530
this is how it has to be,
um,

675
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,393
but this idea that it should be equality
and equality of outcome as opposed to 

676
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,014
opportunity is,
is silly and it doesn't actually deal 

677
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:54,190
with actual differences in terms of 
opportunity,

678
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,593
in terms of the differences that we see 
and the reasons why there are these 

679
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,710
differences.
They're not actually being addressed.

680
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,783
Please tell me that you got some nice 
support from members of the Asian 

681
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:07,410
community that it wasn't just sort of 
brainwashed lefties that were.

682
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
I didn't know.
I didn't,

683
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,060
I got across the board of,
of,

684
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,350
you know,
many races,

685
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,243
so I was grateful for that because I 
wasn't sure how people were going to 

686
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,704
respond to that piece,
but I felt very strongly that I had to 

687
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,104
say something as Harvard issued a 
response to any of this or do we even 

688
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,990
know where they're at with all this?

689
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,033
No,
as far as I know that the lawsuit is 

690
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,130
still ongoing.
It's just,

691
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,380
it really is just crazy.
So are you with me on this?

692
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:30,214
I sense that there's some massive 
minority groups that are breaking right 

693
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,720
now.
I think the Asian community,

694
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:36,280
because of the,
I hate saying community,

695
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:37,114
but you know,
you have to use some words to describe 

696
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:39,004
how this.
But I think the black community is 

697
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:41,880
breaking.
This is what a lot of what candidates.

698
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,090
Oh,
is talking about.

699
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,460
I sent to this happening in the gay 
community.

700
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:46,294
I sent to this happening in the Jewish 
community on very similarly because of 

701
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:49,444
the Asian community,
because of hard work and an education 

702
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:54,280
and all that.
And so did you decide yet we have to put

703
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,740
you at the bottom of the oppression 
Olympics.

704
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,020
Um,
so there's an interesting like,

705
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,430
strange alliance now,
now building up or are you seeing that?

706
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,820
I could say yeah,
I see it coming.

707
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,730
I see.
Well,

708
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,560
we were talking about the bit about this
earlier,

709
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:13,690
about how the left is going to eat its 
own until there is only one person left.

710
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:14,524
So it's only a matter of time really.
We're all going to find each other and 

711
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:17,201
say,
yeah,

712
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,520
we've had enough of this.
I mean,

713
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,740
gay men,
you guys don't count.

714
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,900
It doesn't count to begin anymore.
So,

715
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,270
um,
but I never wanted extra credit.

716
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,770
I wanted equality,
equality,

717
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,540
equal credit,
not extra credit.

718
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,483
In a weird way.
I'm actually okay being thrown out in 

719
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:35,500
that regard of this pyramid because I 
don't want to play that game.

720
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,010
But I think actually finally some gay,
especially

721
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,280
gay white men because now they're,
they're fully thought of as the enemy.

722
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,443
I mean,
I've even seen things on college 

723
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:48,830
campuses where lgbt organizations are 
saying,

724
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:49,664
well,
you can't be a gay white man and be the 

725
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,330
president of the organization because 
you're,

726
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,880
you're one of the bad guys.
I mean that.

727
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,410
That's really dangerous thinking.

728
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,383
Well,
I saw what you had to deal with too at 

729
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:02,530
that professor who said that the lgbt 
community doesn't want you at the.

730
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,130
Was it the University of University of 
New Hampshire?

731
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,963
Yeah.
Do you know that?

732
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,840
So I didn't know at the time,
so I think much of my audience will know

733
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:10,674
what you're referring to.
But I spoke at University of New 

734
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,863
Hampshire and there were all these 
heckler's there and there was a trans 

735
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:17,130
woman who I did not know was a 
professor.

736
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:21,570
I didn't know that until literally two 
months later who was screaming at me how

737
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:23,820
much I hate trans people and all this.
And I kept saying,

738
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,863
I want you to have equality under the 
law and I want you to be treated with 

739
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:28,644
decency and respect and I hope you find 
someone that loves you and all of the 

740
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:34,380
things I would want for anyone else.
I just don't want the government using a

741
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,240
dictating what pronouns I can use to,
to refer to you and you know,

742
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:41,450
basically she was calling me all right 
and all that it did.

743
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:44,430
And of course it turns out she's a 
gender studies professor.

744
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:44,910
Yeah.

745
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,130
It should never be a surprise anymore,

746
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,050
but there's gonna be no discipline at 
the school or anything like that.

747
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:51,790
I mean I could probably make more of a 
hey,

748
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,410
have it and see what happens,
but it's like,

749
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,310
yeah,
you know,

750
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:57,600
you handled it amazingly well and I mean
it's only a matter of time.

751
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:01,110
Like I see with feminism,
they're turning on white women now too.

752
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,060
So it's insane.

753
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,103
Is that the only logical outcome of 
these disciplines because they are not 

754
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,873
held to the scientific standard of 
everything else that we discussed here 

755
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,730
in the first app that you,
that you are held to as a scientist?

756
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,910
Yeah,
I think because everything is,

757
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,763
there's so much based in subjective 
feeling and validating people's 

758
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:23,264
experiences.
You apparently can't question someone's 

759
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:26,984
experienced.
So if someone's offended or they don't 

760
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,100
like you,
what can you say?

761
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,600
So I,
I could see that and it's,

762
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,840
it's very much rewarding people for 
being emotionally driven instead of,

763
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,093
I think the best way to have a debate as
to remove emotion and just try to look 

764
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,550
at the facts as objectively as you can 
no matter what the issue is.

765
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:44,730
So,
um,

766
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,351
it's that,
it's,

767
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:48,410
that they don't really have any sort of 
method to how they do their,

768
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,030
even their research is,
I mean,

769
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,403
it's kind of a joke,

770
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,743
but rob kind of hearing that even the 
methods now are part of the patriarchy 

771
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:59,320
and all of those things that you're 
using facts,

772
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,763
they don't want facts to actually count 
because they believe in this postmodern 

773
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,004
drivel that,
that facts have been arrived to by 

774
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,990
mechanisms that they don't believe in.
That's a,

775
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,890
that's a tough thing to trick somebody 
out of.

776
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,890
Yeah.
But you know,

777
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:17,130
I think on some level,
I think some of these scholars know that

778
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:17,964
what they're doing is very lucrative.
And so they're just basically trying to 

779
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,040
shut people down in any way they can.
They can't really justified,

780
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:23,874
but you know,
they just keep screaming about it and 

781
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,383
academics who have better things to do,
like actually do real research and 

782
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:30,984
they've got their courses and their 
students and a million other things and 

783
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:36,270
their 80 hour work weeks,
they don't have time to deal with this.

784
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,104
So this is why there's a lopsided 
discourse in terms of what you see 

785
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:43,440
coming out of the universities and there
are some institutions that,

786
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,274
you know,
they won't allow academics to engage 

787
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,320
with the media without permission for.
So that,

788
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:49,710
that's part of it too.
It's just,

789
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,500
it's really an unfair battle right now 
that's being fought.

790
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,480
Yeah.
How do you think we get to a place where

791
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,140
specifically related to sexuality and 
topics related to gender and sex,

792
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,020
where we will be able to talk about it 
in a,

793
00:36:02,021 --> 00:36:04,600
in a better way.
So for example,

794
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,220
the me too movement where everybody I 
every,

795
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,243
I think basically thinking person 
understands that there were some really 

796
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,730
bad people here that did some really bad
stuff.

797
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,593
Obviously Harvey Weinstein and Bill 
Cosby and some people that really that 

798
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,213
drug people in that you know,
years of history of doing all this and 

799
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:27,490
then there's all sorts of other people 
who seem like they're just getting swept

800
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:28,324
up in it or basically accused all that.
Now you can be for the idea of the me 

801
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:36,460
too movement without being,
for taking down.

802
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:37,294
All of these other people are also,
and I guess what the real issue is 

803
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,140
litigating everyone's history where we 
could all look back and go,

804
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:46,360
I did this.
Someone did that to me,

805
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,171
this,
that,

806
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,750
the other thing.
College kids now have an assigned things

807
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:50,584
before they hook up.
I mean really where we're creating this 

808
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,274
situation where our interpersonal 
relations are going to have almost 

809
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:59,950
nothing to do with the stuff that's hard
wired into us.

810
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,150
The stuff that you study

811
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,193
[inaudible],
I think me too probably started as 

812
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:04,904
something honorable and I do agree that 
women and men have been dealing with 

813
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:12,230
harassment for far too long and that it 
doesn't get taken seriously sometimes,

814
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,080
but it's to the point now where 
relations are so strained,

815
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,500
especially between men and women.
I,

816
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,310
I sense men are terrified and that's not
going to be helpful across the board for

817
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:23,780
anybody.
Um,

818
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,780
I think especially when you look at 
shades of gray,

819
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,853
well,
I mean there's so much I could say on 

820
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,234
this.
I'm trying to think what's the best 

821
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,900
place to start would be,
um,

822
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,193
with consent.
Say I think one message that's been 

823
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,240
missing is women I've written about 
this.

824
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:39,074
Women need to advocate for themselves 
and that's not to say if you were 

825
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,690
experienced harassment or if you were 
assaulted that you are at fault.

826
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,973
I'm not advocating victim blaming,
but I think what's missing from this 

827
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:52,844
narrative,
women are portrayed as though they're 

828
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,450
helpless and if something happens to 
them,

829
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:58,150
they're helpless and that,
uh,

830
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,183
they're basically,
they have no say in terms of how men 

831
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,570
behave towards them.

832
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,433
And you,
I've written about sexism in the 

833
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:08,180
sciences and how women are basically 
being scared off,

834
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:10,310
I think of going into the field.
Um,

835
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,910
as someone with a phd in a science 
field.

836
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,253
Yeah.
You deal with sexism and it's 

837
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:17,024
unpleasant.
But I still got my degree and now I'm 

838
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:22,880
speaking out about it.
So if you want to achieve something,

839
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:23,301
you can,
uh,

840
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,660
sexism is not so terrible in the world 
that women can't achieve what they want.

841
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,460
So going back to consent,
you know,

842
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:31,020
I think women need young women 
especially,

843
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:31,940
you needed to be told,
you know,

844
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:32,774
you have a say in this if you don't like
something or if you don't want to do 

845
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,220
something,
say so,

846
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,290
don't,
don't feel like it's on the man to um,

847
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,400
I know,
read your mind and I feel like I'm going

848
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,350
to get in so much trouble for saying 
this,

849
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,980
but I think that empowers women instead 
of telling them,

850
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,413
you know,
just really hope that this doesn't 

851
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:51,610
happen to you.
And if it does,

852
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:52,444
then get on twitter and use the Hashtag 
and talk about how men are terrible and 

853
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,040
men are trash.
Men are not terrible.

854
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,410
They're lovely men in the world.
I love men.

855
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,270
You know,
there are some bad men,

856
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,860
but you can't generalize to all men.

857
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,820
Yeah.
But we love the generalizations.

858
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,010
It's easier.
I mean,

859
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,320
you even see this,
the amount of articles where I see,

860
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:09,910
you know,
we have to take down white.

861
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,160
It's always white men that we have to 
take down or,

862
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,233
or now it's women's turn to rule the 
world or all of these things and it's 

863
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,380
like,
well,

864
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,740
a woman could be president or a woman 
could be,

865
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,290
you know,
anything that a man could be,

866
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,560
but it shouldn't be because she's a 
woman.

867
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,280
It should be because she's capable,
but,

868
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,700
but we've seen this sort of hysterical 
reaction to it and I think that that now

869
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,683
is just another one of these places 
where we're on this crazy pendulum just 

870
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:38,410
bouncing back and forth.

871
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,433
Yeah.
I'm hoping it's going to come back to 

872
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,340
the middle.
Um,

873
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,230
and hopefully not too much damage will 
be done before that happens and that the

874
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,890
relations between men and women or I 
couldn't be so terribly strange.

875
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,283
Um,
I do think we're reaching that point 

876
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:54,380
though because there are only so many 
men left to have it been accused of a me

877
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:55,300
too moments.
So,

878
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,080
you know,
it's only a matter of time.

879
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,181
You know,
it's interesting.

880
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,014
I have a running joke with some of my 
friends that I know a lot of great 

881
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,250
straight girls in La that are single lot
of straight great girls.

882
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,833
I don't know,
a lot of straight guys that I think are 

883
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:11,314
great.
Like I know I know some straight guys 

884
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,744
that are kinda whatever,
but I don't know like a lot of straight 

885
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,210
guys that kind of have their shit 
together that are.

886
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,920
So I have all these girls that are like,
okay,

887
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:24,370
you set me up with a guy and I'm like 
not guys I know,

888
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:25,204
which does show that there's sort of a 
crisis I think in masculinity or 

889
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:28,831
something.
And,

890
00:40:28,831 --> 00:40:32,080
and obviously Jordan Peterson is 
addressing this at some level,

891
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,310
although now I've spent so much time 
with him.

892
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,810
I think he's addressing it in a certain 
way.

893
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:35,644
You almost equally for men and women,
although people only focus on the male 

894
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:39,760
part.
But do you know,

895
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,594
is anyone doing research on sort of what
is happening to young men in particular 

896
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:46,594
right now?

897
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,140
Hm,
that's a good question.

898
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,483
I know that uh,
levels of testosterone are lower on 

899
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:55,580
average more recently.
So I don't know if that has something to

900
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:56,414
do with it.

901
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,000
Do we know what the reasoning for that 
is?

902
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,640
Could be.
Maybe there's more estrogens that are,

903
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:02,474
that we're putting into our bodies.
I'm trying to think of what I can give 

904
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:07,340
you [inaudible].
That's an interesting.

905
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,410
So how old are your friends?
I'm curious.

906
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,523
Um,
this sort of set of friends that I'm 

907
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,840
talking about.
These girls usually are in,

908
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,240
they're sorta like early thirties.
Yeah.

909
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,050
Kind of thing.
And they're,

910
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,160
and they're single,
which,

911
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,110
you know,
most often cases,

912
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:20,944
a lot of them,
their friends are married already and 

913
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:24,310
like they're,
they're on the hunt and they've got good

914
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:25,144
jobs and they look good and they take 
care of themselves and all of those 

915
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:27,604
things.
And I just don't see the equivalent 

916
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:30,430
here.
I don't know,

917
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:31,264
maybe there's an odd subset of.
Because la is like a little bit of an 

918
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:35,300
odd place.
Maybe there's more gay people here.

919
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:35,991
I don't,
I don't know.

920
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:36,824
Exactly.

921
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,681
Yeah.
I mean,

922
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:40,290
I could say the average age for people 
getting married as 28,

923
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,153
so I don't want to,
I don't want to generalize and say that 

924
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:47,010
across the board you sciences,
it's incredible and to be fair,

925
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,130
yeah,
but I mean it could be that for guys who

926
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:53,250
are a certain age,
if there's a reason,

927
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:54,990
but at the same thing for women of a 
certain age,

928
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:56,490
and not to say that your friends of 
course,

929
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,470
but um,
you know,

930
00:41:58,471 --> 00:41:59,304
if you're focused on your career,
maybe you're not used to giving your 

931
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:04,320
time to someone else.
That could be part of it.

932
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,430
Yeah.

933
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,670
Do you think that the feminist movement,
which I know is sort of,

934
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:09,504
we sort of ancillary been talking about 
it this whole time that they really did 

935
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:14,274
give up something very special by 
putting so much focus on work and 

936
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:20,600
success in that way.
I mean,

937
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,470
you know,
I think back to my childhood now,

938
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:25,020
which I think in retrospect was so 
amazing.

939
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:28,800
My mom was home for most of it.
She,

940
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,690
she worked before.
I'm the oldest of three.

941
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:31,524
She worked before I was there and then 
she didn't work all the years that she 

942
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,510
was raising us and then went back to 
work after,

943
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,720
um,
and that having someone at home that was

944
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,823
cooking and taking care of us and making
sure we got to school and all of those 

945
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:44,070
things,
like,

946
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,650
that's like the greatest thing that 
anyone could do.

947
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,420
It happens to more often be the woman,
but that's a,

948
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,000
that's a pretty great thing.
That's often been sacrifice.

949
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:55,020
Now we're thought of it.
It's marked in a way.

950
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,210
Yeah.
I mean,

951
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:59,120
I've always been a atypical in terms of 
I've,

952
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,983
I've always been felt more masculine.
I've always been very focused on my 

953
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:03,310
career.
Um,

954
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,710
but I definitely think that feminism and
for some people it or some proponents of

955
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:10,604
feminism,
they will denigrate female typical 

956
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:13,730
roles,
um,

957
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,760
and motherhood and wanting to be a,
you know,

958
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,440
at home with your family.
And I think I've,

959
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,010
you know,
I've heard from women who say,

960
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,873
know,
I've been told that the path to 

961
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:26,990
happiness is for me to focus on my 
career and to neglect my personal life.

962
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:28,620
And then they reach a point where they 
realize,

963
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,620
no,
I do want those things and I don't think

964
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:32,180
there should be anything wrong with 
that.

965
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,350
And the same thing,
you know,

966
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:35,740
I've written about how there's such an 
emphasis for,

967
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,410
for girls to be like boys now I saw you 
tweet about babies,

968
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,583
babies.
And underlying that is a sexism that it 

969
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,850
says that girls need to be like boys in 
order to be equal or worthy of respect.

970
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,430
And no one's talking about that where 
people are just saying,

971
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:53,121
yeah,
for sure.

972
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:54,090
Let's just,
you know,

973
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,170
tell girls that they have to be the same
as boys and women have to be the same as

974
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:57,460
men.

975
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,800
Yeah.
So the article you're referring to,

976
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,723
there was this piece,
I think it was in Newsweek that these 

977
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,740
parents are raising their twins as 
Fabian t,

978
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,170
h e y babies,
babies,

979
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,900
uh,
and they're going to let them pick their

980
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:11,734
gender and it's like you're going to 
create more psychological problems then 

981
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:19,780
you were trying to hide them from most 
likely,

982
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,113
I think.

983
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,190
Yeah.
And it goes back to biology again,

984
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,660
and hormonal exposure in utero.
You,

985
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,560
I think it's great.
Yeah.

986
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,160
It might've been NBC news I think.

987
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,050
Okay.
Yeah.

988
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,650
Newsweek.
Okay.

989
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,310
Yeah.
But yeah,

990
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,143
I think there are a couple outlets that 
were so excited about this and the 

991
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:34,950
whole,
that was why I wrote about it.

992
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:36,030
Not because of the thing,
you know,

993
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:36,864
these parents can do whatever they want 
and that's what I followed up with 

994
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,293
immediately after an appearance can do 
whatever they want and then when the 

995
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,664
children are of age,
they can either decide my parents were 

996
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:46,890
crazy or not write this on the parents.
Right.

997
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:47,910
And all that.
But it was.

998
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:48,983
But that wasn't the issue for me.
It was that the way these headlines are 

999
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:53,640
always written,
it's like that this was like this is the

1000
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:54,474
new thing and the implicit piece of that
is you better do this to be a good 

1001
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:00,504
parent,
to get tolerant parent to be a 

1002
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:05,880
progressive parents and that open minded
person.

1003
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,710
And that to me is the danger here.

1004
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,783
Not The little isolated case necessarily
have these people that are doing 

1005
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:12,960
something.
That's an outlier thing.

1006
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,483
And the thing is,
I've heard stories now where people are 

1007
00:45:15,961 --> 00:45:16,794
terrified of giving their daughters 
dolls and which is what's really funny 

1008
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,674
is you have some of these really 
progressive parents who raise their 

1009
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:23,154
girls.
They only have gender neutral toys or 

1010
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,014
they give them boys toys and then the 
girl obviously goes to school and sees 

1011
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,720
girl typical toys and wants to play with
them.

1012
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:32,280
And the parents were horrified and they 
think,

1013
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:33,114
oh,
this is the patriarchy coming in return 

1014
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,580
of the is biology and we shouldn't be 
afraid of that.

1015
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:39,414
And we shouldn't.
We shouldn't shame girls for wanting to 

1016
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:42,030
be female.
Typical.

1017
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,040
Yeah.
But this is why when people say,

1018
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,050
I think to a bunch of us that are in 
this space,

1019
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:46,291
this,
oh,

1020
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,660
you guys are overstating what this thing
is.

1021
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:51,600
It's just a bunch of angry activist or 
whatever.

1022
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,980
It's like we've seen it,
in fact,

1023
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,410
academia,
which you addressed already.

1024
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,670
We've seen it,
in fact,

1025
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,620
the home and how you're supposed to 
raise your kids.

1026
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,960
Even just thinking about this now,
it's like,

1027
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,913
I think I read something on this and 
that and if not there's definite proof 

1028
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,530
of it that Disney made a decision along 
the way.

1029
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,364
Now that they have star wars and marvel 
that star wars was going to be more 

1030
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:14,700
marketed to girls and marvel was going 
to be the boy's thing.

1031
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:15,534
Now I'm a big star wars guy and I would 
see these commercials and it was all 

1032
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:19,051
girls,
you know,

1033
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,420
girls in the ships and grows with the 
light lightsabers live.

1034
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:24,750
I have no problem with that.
Obviously a rave,

1035
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,400
a leading character.
The last one is a girl.

1036
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,670
It's all good.
The girls can do that,

1037
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:28,623
but.
But pushing marketing on them seems odd 

1038
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:32,160
to me.
And,

1039
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,993
and although I'm sure there are many 
girl girls out there that want to be a 

1040
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,840
jetta I,
there's obviously more boys.

1041
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:40,674
So the way that we even market and I 
suspect they're marketing in a way 

1042
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:43,464
that's hurting their bottom line in the 
name of tolerance in the name of what I 

1043
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:49,210
don't know.

1044
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:49,961
Yeah.
So I mean,

1045
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:51,250
how did the boys feel about that?

1046
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,501
Right,
right.

1047
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:54,580
So you're going to get this odd thing,
then we'll eventually,

1048
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,443
if there enough marketing boys are going
to want to play with the girl thing and 

1049
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:58,770
then feel weird about it.

1050
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:01,160
God,
that's messed up.

1051
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,440
How much time did you have?
Too much time on their hands.

1052
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:04,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

1053
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,183
Just say like kids do what they want and
acknowledged that as long as you give 

1054
00:47:08,061 --> 00:47:08,894
them free choices,
you probably won't have too much say at 

1055
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:12,920
the end of the day,
but at least you know,

1056
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,270
they,
they'll be happy.

1057
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,810
Yeah.
Uh,

1058
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,730
is there anything else that you're 
researching at the moment or that's been

1059
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:20,250
on your mind that,
uh,

1060
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,310
that we haven't covered?

1061
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,330
Uh,
the only thing I would say is,

1062
00:47:23,331 --> 00:47:26,070
so with [inaudible],
we are going to be launching our second.

1063
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:28,500
We just launched our first season last 
month.

1064
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,280
Um,
so spoke with James Damore,

1065
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,143
Lindsay Shepherd.
We also did an episode on rapid onset 

1066
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:33,934
gender dysphoria.
So it's this phenomenon of adolescent 

1067
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:37,444
girls who were suddenly saying they're 
transgender even though they've had no 

1068
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:40,324
previous signs of gender dysphoria and 
actually their problems have nothing to 

1069
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:45,670
do with gender.
So what are the problems?

1070
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:46,504
That's just societal stuff or pressure 
or wanting attention or all of the 

1071
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,550
above.
Usually autism as well,

1072
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,870
so they either will be diagnosed by a 
mental professional,

1073
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:57,910
but the person will say,
I can't say that I have to,

1074
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,770
you know,
affirm your child's gender.

1075
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,003
Um,
because they can otherwise get a lot of 

1076
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:03,850
trouble and lose their jobs if they 
don't,

1077
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,113
um,
you repeat that again so that they will 

1078
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:11,610
lose their jobs if they don't have to 
affirm their.

1079
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,020
They have two clinicians nowadays have 
to affirm these kids.

1080
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:19,060
If a child says they're transgender and 
you have to,

1081
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,010
they'll lose their jobs otherwise.
So,

1082
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,953
so technically a therapist or a 
clinician could feel that this is some 

1083
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:28,744
other issue going on,
but they have to actually affirm what 

1084
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:34,420
the child says.
Yeah,

1085
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:38,530
the parents and in all the documents 
because they will lose their jobs.

1086
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:40,570
They're terrified.
And so in Toronto,

1087
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:41,620
what happened?
What,

1088
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,290
what the Preston case was,
uh,

1089
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:44,670
my colleague,
Kenneth Zucker,

1090
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,233
I had a clinic where he saw gender 
dysphoric children and people said that 

1091
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:52,270
he was practicing conversion therapy.
He was not.

1092
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:55,090
So conversion therapy I do not stand 
for.

1093
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,490
It's trying to turn gay children's 
straight,

1094
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,010
but sexual orientation is not the same 
thing as gender,

1095
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,090
so gender and young children is flexible
and it becomes more stable with age.

1096
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,080
So when he,
when patients would come to him and say,

1097
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,400
you know,
I want to be the opposite sex,

1098
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:10,020
he would say,
okay,

1099
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,120
what's the underlying resentment?
When you say gender is flexible,

1100
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:13,954
you don't mean the amount of genders.
You mean the feeling that you have 

1101
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:18,500
related to gender?
I just want to be clean.

1102
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,910
I know there are two genders.
Let's be clear on that.

1103
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,980
Okay.
Um,

1104
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,380
so if you have an example,
even using,

1105
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,230
if you have a little boy who says he's a
girl,

1106
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,573
he will likely be a gay man and he will 
likely grow to be comfortable in his 

1107
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:34,864
male gender identity.
So for 99 percent of us are biological 

1108
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:38,470
sex is our gender,

1109
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,500
man,
this,

1110
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,260
this thing.
It's,

1111
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,100
it's a real monster.
Yeah.

1112
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,010
There's a lot of misinformation out 
there.

1113
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,710
So what I was saying with my colleague 
has clinic got shut down.

1114
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:52,020
He wasn't doing anything unethical,
but because of that,

1115
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:53,820
it's set this chill across the field.
Now,

1116
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,833
clinicians do not do not want to have 
the same thing happened to them because 

1117
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:58,434
activists will go after them.
There's no one really practicing or 

1118
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,323
anyone sort of thought of as legitimate.
That's practicing conversion therapy 

1119
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:06,444
anymore.
Is there?

1120
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,770
I hope not.
I have nothing against it,

1121
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:10,604
like the that it just never worked.
Like it was just something that I guess 

1122
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:15,294
it's sort of twisted.
Idealogue was practicing not using real 

1123
00:50:18,961 --> 00:50:23,190
evidence or science and it just fizzled 
out basically.

1124
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,850
I do think there are some practitioners 
who are still doing it.

1125
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,520
Not,
I wouldn't call them legitimate,

1126
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,460
which it makes me very uncomfortable 
when I see that,

1127
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:33,403
but yeah,
definitely sexual orientation is 

1128
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,910
biological.
It's genetic and it can't be changed,

1129
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:41,570
so conversion therapy is completely 
useless.

1130
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,420
Yeah.
Well I'm glad we got it.

1131
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,403
At least I think.
I think most people won't be angry at 

1132
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:47,711
you on that.
Well,

1133
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,780
I guess maybe some people on the right 
might be angry on that one,

1134
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,120
maybe,
but you know,

1135
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,973
I'm all about presenting the data and 
speaking to facts and the science and 

1136
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:59,900
standing up for sex research,
whether it infuriates people on the left

1137
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:00,734
or the right.

1138
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:05,400
Yeah.
Science facts reason pretty much.

1139
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,560
Pretty much all but all sort of packaged
within,

1140
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,630
within the free speech thing.
Yeah.

1141
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,090
Can I call you a member of the 
intellectual dark web?

1142
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:15,960
Please do.
I don't know that I have that power,

1143
00:51:15,961 --> 00:51:16,794
but I'm going to go back to the 
clubhouse later and I'm going to get me 

1144
00:51:19,051 --> 00:51:19,851
a membership.
Yeah,

1145
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:20,400
yeah.
You know,

1146
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,580
we have to vote on it.
It's a weird thing and we can be a white

1147
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,590
man some days.
Oh,

1148
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,550
right.
That was the thing.

1149
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:27,970
It was like the,
you know,

1150
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:28,804
whatever.
All these idiots that are writing all 

1151
00:51:29,731 --> 00:51:32,520
these nonsensical piece is about as tall
white man and it's like

1152
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,330
there are a bunch of us that are not 
white,

1153
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:36,640
but I mean they call them.
I've been called a white supremacist.

1154
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:39,130
I've been called a Nazi,
so you know,

1155
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,320
that's the level that we're at right now
and they have nothing else.

1156
00:51:41,321 --> 00:51:42,370
So I think it's a good sign

1157
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,740
in a weird way.
It absolutely is a good time.

1158
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:45,481
Well,
it's been a pleasure.

1159
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,310
I'm so glad that we finally got to do 
this.

1160
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,770
So much fun.
Yeah,

1161
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,870
we will.
We will do.

1162
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,330
I sent these issues going away,
so we're going to have to do this again,

1163
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:54,823
right?
Very good.

1164
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,060
Uh,
for more on Deborah,

1165
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:58,960
you can follow her on twitter.
It's at Debra Hill.
