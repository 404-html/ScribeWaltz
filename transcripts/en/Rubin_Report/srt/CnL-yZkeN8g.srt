1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's talk about the l word today.
No,

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:07,530
not that l word,
the other l word liberal.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,753
I've always considered myself a liberal 
probably before I even knew what the 

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,084
word actually meant as a kid.
I remember thinking that liberals were 

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,744
the good guys.
Liberals were looking out for other 

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,474
people.
Liberals wanted a fair society and 

7
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,220
liberals didn't care about race or 
religion.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,140
Before I go any further,
you guys know I love definitions,

9
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:26,974
so let's actually define the word 
liberal according to the Oxford 

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,560
Dictionary,
one,

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,650
open to new behavior or opinions and 
willing to discard traditional values to

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,753
concerned mainly with broadening a 
person's general knowledge and 

13
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:46,170
experience rather than with technical or
professional training.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,233
All right.
Being open to new opinions and 

15
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:51,690
broadening your knowledge.
Both seem like good ideas,

16
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,970
right?
With these two definitions in mind,

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,804
you can understand why liberals have 
been on the forefront of the civil 

18
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,310
rights movement,
workers' rights,

19
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,290
women's rights,
and marriage equality.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,710
Sometimes to get everyone to a place of 
equality,

21
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:09,570
you have to throw out the societal norms
and be willing to accept a new normal.

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,220
Conservatives often argue that change 
isn't good or at least change that comes

23
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,054
to fastest and I think in certain cases 
there can be some truth to that 

24
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:18,954
mentality,
but if you're the black person sitting 

25
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,834
in the back of the bus or a woman trying
to vote or the gay person who can't get 

26
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,960
married,
change can't happen soon enough.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,000
I mentioned all of this because I don't 
want to lose my credit as a real liberal

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,910
since I've had some conservative guests 
on the Rubin report.

29
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,744
I've seen people suddenly calling me or 
conservative or claiming that I'm a 

30
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,300
Republican.
As I've mentioned before,

31
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,720
I've never voted for a Republican for 
any major office,

32
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,730
so if I'm a Republican,
I'm a pretty bad one.

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,223
Just because I talked to Ben Shapiro or 
Milo Yiannopoulos or your own Brooke of 

34
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:53,244
the Iron Rand Institute doesn't mean I 
share any or all of their beliefs and 

35
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:01,540
that's exactly the same as when I talked
to left leading guests like Jimmy Dore,

36
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,270
Riva Martin,
or my guest this week.

37
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,103
John Fugelsang saying,
I listened to people push back when I 

38
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,120
see fit and see where the conversation 
goes.

39
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,163
I know some of you want me to 
electrocute my guests every time they 

40
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,060
say saying I disagree with,
but there is a litany of legal reasons.

41
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:18,360
We just can't do that,
but beyond the legal reasons.

42
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:22,590
I'm a firm believer that good ideas 
always beat out bad ideas.

43
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,690
If you let the light shine on both of 
them,

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,853
it's not liberal or even decent to shout
down or silence ideas just because you 

45
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,254
don't like them.
That has been and always will be the 

46
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:34,104
driving force behind the Rubin report.
I view liberal thinking and liberal 

47
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,624
ideas as generally good over the past 
few months as I've explored classical 

48
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:47,310
liberalism with its focus on civil 
liberties and economic freedom.

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,473
I've come to realize in many cases,
liberal ideas aren't that far from 

50
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,280
libertarian ideas.

51
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,490
You can make excellent arguments for 
racial equality,

52
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,650
gender equality,
and marriage equality,

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,710
all from both liberal and Libertarian 
points of view.

54
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,460
The main difference is how you think the
role of government should be applied.

55
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,294
In any of those cases,
a liberal may want marriage equality 

56
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,104
because they believed that a gay couple 
deserves to be treated the same as a 

57
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,470
straight couple.
A libertarian may want marriage equality

58
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:21,610
because they don't believe the 
government has the right to tell any two

59
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:24,310
people what kind of contract they can 
partake in.

60
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,800
The silent majority of us have much more
in common than we have apart,

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,450
especially if you're a moderate on 
either side or just a good old fashioned

62
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,284
centrist.
I tend to think that most of you who 

63
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,180
watched the Rubin report fall somewhere 
on that spectrum.

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,310
I don't pretend to have every answer 
because it's preposterous to do so.

65
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,533
Unfortunately,
not having an answer doesn't stop most 

66
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,173
talking heads.
I prefer to analyze each situation with 

67
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,420
the same level of critical thinking that
I apply to the rest of my life.

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,613
Unfortunately,
many liberals have taken a turn into 

69
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:58,780
stifling descent with cries of racism 
and bigotry.

70
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,840
Every time they hear an idea that they 
don't like.

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,280
To me being liberal is a constant 
evolution of ideas.

72
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,114
As time goes on.
This concept doesn't mean changing my 

73
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,324
ideals or my morals from day to day,
but it means that I can change as the 

74
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,710
world changes.
I see the world in shades of gray rather

75
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,640
than black and white.
The world is constantly changing and I'm

76
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:25,000
not ashamed to admit that my opinions 
have changed along with it.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,880
That isn't the position of a man without
conviction.

78
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,340
It's a position of a man with a 
conscience.

79
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,983
As liberals,
we must be brave enough to have our 

80
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:38,530
ideas challenge just like we challenge 
the ideas that came before us.

81
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,770
At the end of the day,
this isn't about right and wrong.

82
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,950
It's about having the bravery to defend 
your ideals.

83
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,173
So to my liberal friends who have chosen
censorship over ideas and smearing over 

84
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,260
debate,
I challenge you to be brave.

85
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,333
If our ideas are good and our causes,
just we shouldn't be afraid to defend 

86
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,014
them.

87
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,423
John Fugal saying is a comedian host of 
tell me everything on Sirius xm insight 

88
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,320
and a good buddy of mine,
John,

89
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:09,630
it took a while,
but we've got you on the show.

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,640
Thank you very much,
David.

91
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:12,474
It's a pleasure to be back on your show.
We really should have recorded what 

92
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:17,020
happened for these last six or eight 
minutes because we had.

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,900
I think it's pretty good for your 
viewers.

94
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,040
You didn't record what just happened.
We had a little miscommunication whether

95
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,710
we were doing this at 11:30
AM or pm.

96
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:26,544
Long story short,
we just followed you as you ran across 

97
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,540
the Sirius xm hallway with your laptop 
screaming like a crazy person.

98
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,441
Uh,
well,

99
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,220
the good news is my evening is now free.
I thought we were taping.

100
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,560
I thought you were taping at 5:30
PM your time.

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,780
Uh,
so 8:30

102
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,580
PM your time.
So I apologize for the,

103
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:45,630
uh,
for the uh,

104
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:46,390
uh,
uh,

105
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,360
a grasp of the details.
But,

106
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,194
um,
my defense is that I went to public 

107
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:50,994
school.
Thank you.

108
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm bringing you on to defend 
liberalism,

109
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:59,361
to defend the left and we've already had
a time problem which has set us up here.

110
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,670
But first let.
Before we get into anything.

111
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,890
So you are at Sirius Xm.
That's where your show is.

112
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,730
You actually tape your show out of my 
old studio,

113
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,653
is that correct?

114
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,860
Oh No,
it's not.

115
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:14,280
When I first met you,
it was a very different studio and I was

116
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,114
doing it from.
They just moved us to another one and 

117
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,080
they're remodeling or here so many 
times.

118
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:19,914
I have done a pre taped interviews in 
your old studio and I always think of 

119
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:26,600
you and I always scour the room for 
narcotics you might've lived.

120
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,430
Do you dedicate each show to me?
I hope so.

121
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,760
In my heart.
I do.

122
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,810
Days in my heart.
I do.

123
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,410
Alright,

124
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,010
well let's get to it here because you 
are one of my favorite comics.

125
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:40,420
You're actually one of the only guys 
that can drag me to do standup.

126
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,600
Pretty much the only time I do stand up 
these days is when you say,

127
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:44,434
all right,
I'm in town and I'm doing one of my 

128
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:45,934
shows and you do these great comedy 
nation shows that are mostly about 

129
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,250
politics and free speech and religion.
I mean,

130
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,870
all the things that I like talking 
about.

131
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,300
Uh,
so before we get into comedy,

132
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,134
let's just talk about your history 
because you have an incredible 

133
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,430
upbringing.
Your parents background.

134
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,970
Go fugal sang one.
Oh,

135
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,883
let's go.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,833
Oh,
mine.

137
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,400
We're where to begin at the beginning.
Uh,

138
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,520
I'm,
I'm an actor.

139
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,310
I'm a stand up.
I'm a broadcaster.

140
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:11,870
I've,
I've,

141
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,690
uh,
I,

142
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,670
I come from a curiously Catholic 
background.

143
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:17,790
My parents are both a former Catholic 
clergy members.

144
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,624
My father being a Franciscan brother,
my mother being a nun who spent many 

145
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,260
years as a nurse working with lepers in 
the jungles of Malawi,

146
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,860
Africa.
Um,

147
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,163
with a background like that,
I could never afford the therapy I 

148
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:30,924
actually needed.
So I got into theater and stand up and 

149
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:35,670
uh,
over the course of my career I've,

150
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,580
I've hosted adult literacy shows for 
pbs.

151
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:41,700
I have a,
I've been murdered on CSI.

152
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,520
Um,
I've gotten drama league nominations for

153
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:48,330
off Broadway Solo shows.
I worked on MSNBC,

154
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,164
Fox News and CNN.
I hosted my own program for the late 

155
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,900
limited current channel.
I once got mid,

156
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,120
run these advisor to call ms and etch a 
sketch,

157
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,650
got George Harrison to play his final,
uh,

158
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,543
on camera performance.
And I hosted America's funniest home 

159
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,120
videos with daisy puentes.
So yeah,

160
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,430
it's a pretty schizophrenia resume.

161
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,353
That's kind of,
not many people can say they replaced 

162
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,290
Bob Saget,
but you did.

163
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,460
Oh,
I could never replace Bob Saget.

164
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,540
Even his wife agreed with that.
Um,

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,800
but I,
I was happy to,

166
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:15,280
uh,
to,

167
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,113
to take over for the show for a little,
it was only going to be for like six 

168
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:19,600
weeks and it wound up being a year and a
half,

169
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:22,840
so it was a fun little Gig and it taught
me that,

170
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:25,660
um,
that wasn't what I needed to do.

171
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,703
Yeah.
So I like doing a little bit of the 

172
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,440
pedigree stuff because it's important to
know,

173
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,274
you know,
I feel like there's so many talking 

174
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,740
heads and nobody knows what their 
backgrounds are,

175
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,630
what they studied,
where they came from,

176
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,910
and it's uh,
it's nice knowing that.

177
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:39,610
So this religious upbringing that you 
had,

178
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:43,060
when did you sort of realize,
as you said you couldn't afford therapy,

179
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:43,894
so you went into acting and comedy.
When did you realize that maybe some of 

180
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:49,540
the constructs of religion word for you?

181
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,480
That's a great question because I think 
that we,

182
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,120
you know,
one that we don't talk about too much is

183
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,790
the separation of church and faith.
Um,

184
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,763
the fact that religion and belief are 
two completely different things and a 

185
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,354
religion is a culture of middleman,
whereas faith is just a between the 

186
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,910
believer and the day the,
of their choice.

187
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,650
Um,
you know,

188
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,660
I,
I always had problems with religion even

189
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,660
when I was about.
And uh,

190
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,800
it wasn't until I went to college and 
Nyu at the Nyu Catholic Center and uh,

191
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:27,190
it was very progressive community.
I was actually asked to help teach a,

192
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,024
uh,
a course for Congress along with the 

193
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:32,850
pastor and it was a church that welcomed
gay people openly.

194
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,350
And I remember bringing my parents to,
uh,

195
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,223
to the church I went to in college and 
they were so inspired by seeing how gay 

196
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,550
couples were welcomed and loved.

197
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,220
This isn't the ABS.
Um,

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,140
and uh,
that Kinda made me realize,

199
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:46,974
well,
that's not the usual policy for this 

200
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,940
unauthorized fan club with Jesus.
You know,

201
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,963
the more I was really when I saw my dad 
gave a lecture at a college once about 

202
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,740
Martin Luther and the reformation,
that I was like,

203
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,370
why are we Catholic?
Why aren't we Lutheran?

204
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,060
These rolled in critiques.
You have the pope,

205
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,410
and so that was what really made me be 
a,

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,273
not a Catholic.
I still consider the Catholic church to 

207
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,510
be my asexual sexual orientation.
But,

208
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,620
um,
over the years,

209
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,454
uh,
I found the farther I got away from 

210
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,134
organized religion,
the more interested in theology and 

211
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,880
faith I got.
And so,

212
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:21,714
uh,
now I get to La and a everybody because 

213
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,600
the snf of them think I'm a,
I'm a,

214
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:27,434
I'm a cult member.
So you're making a really interesting 

215
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,520
distinction there.

216
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,000
So you're not into organized religion as
it stands,

217
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,040
but you are a believer,
correct?

218
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,720
Yeah,
I'm a believer.

219
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:37,610
Sure.
Uh,

220
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,110
um,
but I don't think God's an invisible man

221
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:40,944
with a beard and a penis in the sky,
but there was no lightening bolts when 

222
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,960
he's in a moody situation.
You read the Old Testament.

223
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,090
It's like the alcoholic step God.
Um,

224
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,030
and it's like this big gut cosmic game 
of candid camera and God's Allen funt.

225
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,530
Um,
so yeah,

226
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,580
I,
I make a distinction.

227
00:10:56,581 --> 00:11:00,270
I was asked to go and come out bell show
and debate Jamie Kilstein about,

228
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:01,104
uh,
uh,

229
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,060
atheism versus belief.
And I was like,

230
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:03,894
well,
I'll never tell an atheist they are 

231
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:06,084
wrong.
My definition of faith doesn't involve 

232
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,330
telling other people that they're wrong.
Um,

233
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,330
when I got into the studio they wanted 
me to,

234
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,820
to defend religion.
And I'm like,

235
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,271
no,
no,

236
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:15,770
no.

237
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,150
I like,
I'll defend anyone's right to worship.

238
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:20,790
And as long as you're not bothering 
anybody else's personal property,

239
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,060
you're putting somebody down in the name
of Jesus then good for you.

240
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,370
God bless.
Find the fan club that works for you.

241
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,271
But,
uh,

242
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,104
I'm not going to defend religion.
I'm going to descend to faith and 

243
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,870
belief.
Um,

244
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,531
and they were like,
well,

245
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:31,761
no,
no,

246
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:32,480
don't do that.
Just,

247
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,990
just,
just as I said,

248
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:34,824
I'm sorry I can't.
And so Jamie and I just told jokes and 

249
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,150
it got a million hits on Youtube.
Um,

250
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,680
because I think people are really tired 
of the whole.

251
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,970
My God can beat up your God thing.
Uh,

252
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,230
some of the best Christians I know are 
atheists,

253
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,320
some of the most godless and,
and even atheists can go crazy.

254
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:52,560
You know,
I mean,

255
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,580
there's fundamentalist atheists.
I mean,

256
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,660
I love the atheist handbook a,
it's a great set of rules for people who

257
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,980
are tired of religions set of rules.
For me,

258
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:03,340
it's like,
you know,

259
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,233
my faith is such that you believe what 
you want to believe if it makes you a 

260
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:07,804
better person.
I'm the Dalai Lama says the purpose of 

261
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,120
religion is to,
uh,

262
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,920
the purpose of religion is to improve 
yourself,

263
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,260
not criticize others.
And uh,

264
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,700
that's kind of where I come from.
Although I do enjoy mocking hypocrites.

265
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,920
Right?
And that's been my thing.

266
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,030
Yeah.
You love mocking hypocrites and that's a

267
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:27,230
lot about,
you know,

268
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:28,064
what you're about and when I see you 
going back and forth with people on 

269
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,390
twitter,
a hypocrisy.

270
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:35,600
And that's the main thing usually that 
comedians call out.

271
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,460
So when it comes to faith,
so your faith is just your faith to you.

272
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:41,294
I sense it's just something private.
You don't if you're not even defining 

273
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,380
what your faith is really,
right?

274
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,663
No,
I'm not.

275
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,320
I mean,
if anyone wants to talk to me about it,

276
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:49,370
I will.
But generally,

277
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,570
I,
I,

278
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,403
my faith is such that I don't pretend to
know all the answers and they often say 

279
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,930
the opposite of faith is doubt.
I think that's rubbish.

280
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:59,180
I think doubt is an integral part of 
faith.

281
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,470
The opposite of faith is certainty.
And I trust anybody who,

282
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:07,310
who's searching for the truth.
I generally don't trust people who claim

283
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,144
they here.

284
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,153
Right.
So it's interesting because me and you 

285
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:13,410
were sort of splitting hairs on this.
I would say I'm not a believer.

286
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:16,440
I wouldn't believe in something without 
evidence.

287
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,480
But that said,
I don't mind.

288
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,690
I know a lot of,
a lot of atheists don't like,

289
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,553
people don't like religious people or 
think that they're really just diluted 

290
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:26,790
or whatever it is.
And to me,

291
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,440
I would go with sort of what you just 
said,

292
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,540
which is I don't mind if someone's 
religious,

293
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,820
uh,
because I won't pretend to be more moral

294
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:33,654
than anyone or,
or living somehow a better life than 

295
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,414
anyone else.
I just don't want them pushing it on me 

296
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:40,830
or hitting me or put throw in gaze off 
roofs.

297
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,923
Yeah.
I don't want them using their personal 

298
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,990
faith as an excuse to put somebody else 
down,

299
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,480
and that's something I take very 
seriously.

300
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,773
There is no part of the Bible you can 
ever use to justify discrimination 

301
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,920
against lgbt people.
And I have this debate not infrequently.

302
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,350
Again,
there's no part of the Bible.

303
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,800
Anyone can honestly use to justify any 
sort of discrimination.

304
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,530
And,
and when you're starting to use Jesus,

305
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,750
when you're starting to use Christianity
as a cloaking device for Douche baggery,

306
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,450
that's what I have to call you out.
Again,

307
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,390
I've known wonderful conservative 
religious people.

308
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,224
I think that very often conservative 
Christians can be more liberal with 

309
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,090
kindness.
Then lots of liberals,

310
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,840
you'll find a lot more liberality of 
warmth and love,

311
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,920
uh,
at certain,

312
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,600
you know,
baptist meetings,

313
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,670
then you'll find it upper east side 
cocktail parties.

314
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,780
So,
um,

315
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,280
but,
but for me,

316
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:36,050
I'm in love with a mystery.
Yeah.

317
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,203
And,
and my definition of God does not 

318
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:41,000
involve a man with a penis.
And,

319
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,080
um,
you know,

320
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,000
I think that the Bible,
uh,

321
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,500
the main character,
the Bible,

322
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,930
Jesus is a guy who spoke in parable and 
metaphor.

323
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,770
I don't know why it's so hard to read 
the Bible as parable metaphor.

324
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,780
Uh,
there's a lot of truth in the Bible.

325
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,670
Not necessarily a lot of facts.

326
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,860
Yeah.
Alright.

327
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,813
I feel good about our start here.
We sort of see this a little bit 

328
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:00,844
differently,
but I respect where you're coming from 

329
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,310
and that sort of what both of us.

330
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,290
Yeah.
I just want to be vague enough to sucker

331
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,124
people.
Yeah.

332
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,980
No,
you're quite good at it.

333
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,020
And by wearing all black and with the 
long hair,

334
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,400
it's the whole thing is very effective.

335
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,483
Thank you very much.
I've got a beautiful compound that I 

336
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,494
want to invite all of your viewers down.
You'll have to turn over some account 

337
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:18,854
numbers and were rogues,
but it's a really a great safe 

338
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,800
community.
I think you'll love what we do there.

339
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,673
Yeah.
Well we'll put the link in the 

340
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,440
description down below.
Don't worry about that.

341
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,311
Um,
okay.

342
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:27,144
So let's,
let's shift a little bit to comedy 

343
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:30,960
before we jump right into politics.
So,

344
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,820
uh,
when did you really decide,

345
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:33,654
okay,
I've got something to say and people 

346
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:40,680
need to hear it because that's like,
that's a crazy thing for a person to do.

347
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:43,830
And I say that as someone that has done 
standup for a long time.

348
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,113
Well,
I don't know if anyone needs to hear 

349
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,501
anything.
I do.

350
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,510
I never really felt that.
I just knew that.

351
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:51,570
Um,
the first time I saw George Carlin lies,

352
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,530
he made me feel less alone and uh,
and I knew I wanted to do what he did.

353
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,350
I want it to come out and,
and rail against injustice and,

354
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,030
and,
and nonsense and lies.

355
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,570
Uh,
but I,

356
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,870
I didn't want to just be a propagandist.
I wanted to do it creatively.

357
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:08,780
I wanted to find ways to be funny and,
uh,

358
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,623
and make it entertaining.
And I've always tried to adhere to a 

359
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,060
principle of entertaining first and 
formative.

360
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,510
Second,
seconded preachy last,

361
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,583
um,
which is easier on stage than it is on 

362
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,570
twitter,
I'm sure.

363
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,180
But I've always,
uh,

364
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,343
Carlin was really good for me.
I was a fan of his before I saw him 

365
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,570
live,
but once I saw him lives,

366
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,630
uh,
I,

367
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,280
I knew that that's what I wanted to do 
and um,

368
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,203
I so admired how he went after 
politicians and religious leaders and 

369
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,334
um,
and just creeps in general and did it 

370
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,730
using humor,
um,

371
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,420
rather than hate or a or just propaganda
and um,

372
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,340
so for me,
I love doing stand up.

373
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,770
It's just silly nonsense.
But I also,

374
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,570
I also really love to,
uh,

375
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,920
to work out logic through,
um,

376
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,550
penis jokes.
That's my morality.

377
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,521
Yeah.
Well,

378
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:57,520
you know,
to me the real beauty of Carlin was that

379
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:01,450
key was the most political you could 
possibly be.

380
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:05,920
And yet at the same time,
very rarely commented on politics of the

381
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,753
day,
you know what I mean?

382
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,020
Like right now,
if he was alive,

383
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:08,854
I don't think he would be commenting 
that much on the race horse that we're 

384
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,500
all caught in of the trump,
hillary,

385
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,101
Bernie,
this,

386
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,760
that,
the other thing.

387
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,790
But he would be commenting on the bigger
pieces of it and then you Kinda,

388
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,380
you kinda take the same approach.

389
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,560
Yeah.
I don't know.

390
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,250
I mean,
you know,

391
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,083
he,
he spoke extensively about the Reagan 

392
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,580
administration.
Uh,

393
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:26,414
he,
he talks a lot about Clinton versus 

394
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,244
double.
I mean if you listen to the albums from 

395
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:31,010
the eighties,
so what am I doing in New Jersey?

396
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,844
And then of course I think I'm a jam in 
a jam and in New York is his best album 

397
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,554
and back in town,
the one that followed it is almost as 

398
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:38,804
good.
I think he would have flipped it up the 

399
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,354
two,
but even like you are all diseased with 

400
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,260
an album where he talked about Bush and,
and um,

401
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,520
you know,
he,

402
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,980
he talked a lot about,
uh,

403
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,820
supporting governor Bush after nine 
slash 11,

404
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,700
you know,
he didn't like him.

405
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
He would only call him governor Bush.
I mean,

406
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,410
Carlin,
he didn't make us whole sets about it,

407
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,903
but he,
he more or less took on the introduced 

408
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,390
bag in all of us and politicians were 
very often the starting point for him to

409
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,224
jump off into,
into just social hypocrisy that the 

410
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,700
politicians are just figureheads of.
So,

411
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,800
um,
he,

412
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,550
he did single out and,
and Clinton,

413
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,384
he went off on a lot.
I once saw him in Vegas where he was 

414
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,580
railing against the Bush family and just
said,

415
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,414
I hope the whole family dies and an 
airplane fire and people were walking 

416
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:21,924
out in droves,
but it was a pleasure to watch him work 

417
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,650
out as material that way and separate 
the anger from the humor,

418
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,733
separate anger from the outrage because 
anger doesn't work in comedy but 

419
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:33,780
outraged us.

420
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,613
Right?
You got to get right to that line and 

421
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:37,194
tow it properly,
and then you can tell some people the 

422
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,320
truth because if you tell them the truth
and you're being funny,

423
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:41,154
that's good,
but if you tell them the truth and 

424
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,710
you're not,
that's when the pitchforks come.

425
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,813
Yeah,
I think so.

426
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,000
I mean,
Billy Wilder,

427
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,340
Saturday,
Billy Wilder said,

428
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,380
if you're going to tell people the 
truth,

429
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,860
make it funny or they'll kill you,
and I,

430
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:53,250
I keep that quote around.

431
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,310
Yeah,
there you go.

432
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,600
All right,
so let's,

433
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,740
let's jump into some political stuff.
You are a through and through liberal.

434
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:00,574
You're,
you're one of my left friends that I 

435
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,590
still understand a lot of what I've been
doing on the show.

436
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,990
I've lost a lot of my people on the 
left,

437
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:11,020
but I consider you a good liberal.
Do you consider yourself a liberal?

438
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,690
Does that have any meaning to you 
anymore?

439
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,533
That the words.

440
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,220
I don't know what you're telling you the
truth.

441
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,054
I mean,
10 years ago I got called a liberal 

442
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:23,420
because I supported gay marriage.
I supported a decriminalizing marijuana.

443
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,240
I thought Bush,
his economic plans weren't going to work

444
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,430
and I was against the Iraq war.
Uh,

445
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,550
it turns out I wasn't a liberal.
I was prematurely mainstream.

446
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,260
Right?

447
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,093
And throughout history,
I think prematurely mainstream is what 

448
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:37,424
liberals have them.
They've been the ones who fight for 

449
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,730
social change generally,
but you know,

450
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,803
everyone I know every interesting person
I know is liberal in some areas and 

451
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,680
conservative and others,
uh,

452
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,750
if you're all just one or the other 
thing,

453
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,633
it doesn't mean anything.
You become a guy at a star trek 

454
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,180
convention.
So I,

455
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,900
I,
I get asked this question and I,

456
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,690
I don't really know what liberal means 
anymore,

457
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:57,524
but when I read the dictionary 
definition of the word I aspire to be 

458
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,161
that,
you know,

459
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:01,994
like I was on the show on Fox News and 
they kept trying to get me to admit I 

460
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:08,840
was a liberal than I said I aspire to be
a liberal the same way I aspired to be a

461
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:09,674
Christian.
I don't know if I would ever self 

462
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:13,010
identify as either of those two words.

463
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,440
Yeah,
well I love that.

464
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:18,070
And you weren't connected to us on skype
when I did the intro to the show,

465
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:21,280
but I actually took the deck,
the literal definition,

466
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,114
the dictionary definition of liberal and
I read it out and it's someone who's 

467
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,310
basically,
if your ideas are evolving,

468
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:32,311
if you're willing to challenge the 
status quo then then you are a liberal.

469
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,423
And it's so funny to me.
I remember back in 1992 when I was 12 

470
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,374
years old and we were doing a mock 
election when Dukakis was running 

471
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:45,070
against George H,
w Bush and George was that.

472
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm sorry,
that was 88,

473
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,010
that was 88.
Ninety two was the,

474
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,860
was a Clinton.
Uh,

475
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,440
and uh,
and George Hw said,

476
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,350
you're a liberal and Dukakis,
that I'm not a liberal.

477
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,460
And that was the Democrat because 
liberal became a dirty word back then.

478
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,940
Yeah,
you're crazy for that.

479
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,270
By the end of that campaign,
Congress finally said,

480
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,104
yes,
I'm a liberal tradition of JFK and all 

481
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:10,040
that.
And Bush celebrated instead of wonder of

482
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,420
wonders,
he finally admits it.

483
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,970
And I give Bush credit for,
uh,

484
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,953
making a word that means a empathetic 
and open minded and caring about the 

485
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:19,970
least of us.
A,

486
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:23,990
a word that pretty much sums up Jesus.
If you go by the dictionary definition,

487
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,970
uh,
and,

488
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,500
and Bush Sr,
I think it's the most credit for turning

489
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,270
it into a dirty word.
Uh,

490
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,580
you know,
I mean,

491
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,513
I mean,
there's no way you can see that Jesus 

492
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,490
wasn't a liberal if you go by the 
dictionary definition of the term and he

493
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:38,301
certainly,
you know,

494
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:39,720
they,
they didn't,

495
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:40,554
uh,
the state didn't put them to death and 

496
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,044
the conservative religious bosses of 
their day didn't put him to death 

497
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:46,340
because he didn't rock the boat up.

498
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,680
He didn't not want change,
right?

499
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,900
This is a guy who wanted some change.
Exactly.

500
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,550
But by that same token,
you know,

501
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:54,384
that that definition you bring up,
it's the greatest proof that we don't 

502
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:58,670
have a liberal media.
Uh,

503
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,110
our friends on the right or thunder 
saying it's the liberal media.

504
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,100
And I've just been like,
well,

505
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,200
this year is proven.
If the media was liberal,

506
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,570
I mean for awhile we've known if they 
were liberal,

507
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,580
they'd probably cover an anti war rally 
as much as they cover a tea party event.

508
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,100
Um,
but if the media was liberal,

509
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:17,970
I think they would have given Bernie 
sanders a bit more than one 80th.

510
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,270
The air time they've given Donald Trump 
the media profit driven.

511
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:22,950
There are a lot of liberals who work in 
the media,

512
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:26,010
but the media itself is ratings driven.
It's profit driven.

513
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,260
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
That's just how it is.

514
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:30,420
And a lot of liberals and conservatives 
can admit that.

515
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,363
Right?
So I love that you made that point 

516
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,584
because yes,
it's profit driven and people want 

517
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:38,210
clicks and people want views.
We all understand that.

518
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,670
I don't know what a better model would 
be.

519
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:41,504
I don't know that the government coming 
in and saying everyone should have 

520
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:44,144
exactly equal time.
I don't know that that really makes 

521
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,420
sense.
I'm not a huge government guy,

522
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:50,240
so I don't really love that.
And at the end of the day,

523
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:53,690
if more people are watching trump and 
he's just using the system,

524
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,840
it's kind of Shitty,
but it's sort of where we're at.

525
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:58,550
Like what else?
What else can we do?

526
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,843
Like the restorative fairness doctrine,
we could have more than one pbs and we 

527
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,920
can have a pvs for liberals and a pbs 
for conservatives.

528
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:09,300
I think we could have presidential 
debates every week on pbs where it's not

529
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:10,470
about profit,
uh,

530
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,830
present,
uh,

531
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,790
a corporate media from having to be 
responsible to their shareholders.

532
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,610
That's just how the culture in the 
industry has evolved.

533
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,800
Once you can admit that,
you know,

534
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:20,634
Donald Trump seems to think that all 
these ratings and all this airtime mean 

535
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:23,904
people love him with trump.
And I think a lot of folks in the media 

536
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:27,294
haven't realized is a lot of these 
ratings that trump generates is because 

537
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:33,300
a large number of people are actually 
hate watching him.

538
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,573
Uh,
he is the true detective season two of 

539
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:41,151
politics and watching to see how 
horrible he is.

540
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:44,460
The way you slow down for a car wreck,
um,

541
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:46,940
I don't think necessarily translates 
into loves.

542
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,730
I stopped watching true detective season
two after one episode.

543
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,310
Unfortunately,
the country hasn't quite caught up to me

544
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:53,870
on that.

545
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,320
I stayed to the bitter end like Kennedy 
Vice and let me tell,

546
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,980
you know,
I'll never get those 10 hours back.

547
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,270
But,
um,

548
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,770
you know,
I do think that,

549
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,693
that,
uh,

550
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,070
MSNBC is doing great in their ratings 
now.

551
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,383
But I think it maybe because people are 
just fascinated at this trump thing is 

552
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,770
actually happening.
I mean,

553
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,160
as a novelty act historically,
it's never happened before.

554
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:18,960
It'll probably never happen again.
And uh,

555
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,560
so in that sense,
I think it's newsworthy in much the same

556
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,394
way.
I think the Malaysian plane going 

557
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:24,104
missing or the Oj case was newsworthy.
These are things that have never 

558
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:27,854
happened before.
Really be grudge the population for 

559
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:30,914
leaning in to watch a,
a spectacle that our grandparents 

560
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:34,214
couldn't have imagined.

561
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,063
Yeah.
So isn't it a little bit of both with 

562
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,374
trump though,
because there's obviously the spectacle 

563
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,010
and the sort of carnival atmosphere and 
all that,

564
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:41,844
but at the same time I read the other 
day that I think at this point he has 

565
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,110
more votes than any other Republican in 
the primaries,

566
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:49,944
or at least he's going to certainly 
break a Romney's record or george w 

567
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:56,310
Bush's record by the time California 
runs around.

568
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:57,990
I think it's more than Reagan already.
Now.

569
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,180
Part of that is just demographics change
and all that kinda stuff.

570
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,740
But the point is that people are 
actually.

571
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,290
People are actually voting for him.
It's not just you thing

572
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,030
one percent now a approval of the gop.
That means Dave,

573
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:14,031
that Donald trump is so popular,
he's got 50 percent of 28 percent of the

574
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,033
American Legion,
right?

575
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,660
Hillary and Bernie combined,
uh,

576
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,780
have gotten more votes.

577
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,980
Trump.
So if you were,

578
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:21,814
if you were conservative,
if you were a republican right now and 

579
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,020
you were in a trump guy,
what would you do?

580
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,883
Because I find that they're in a real 
bind right now because if you're a 

581
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:30,574
mainstream establishment Republican,
I don't think you can go into that 

582
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,344
convention and say,
we're going to steal this thing away 

583
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:37,480
because we don't like it.
It would,

584
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,333
it would expose such a horrible flaw in 
the system and really be undemocratic 

585
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,920
and at the same time they're giving up 
their party,

586
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,040
but I think they've already been exposed
that,

587
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:47,874
I mean,
I don't believe the Republican Party is 

588
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:53,670
against the government at all.
Government is how in my lifetime they've

589
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:55,740
redistributed wealth to the top two 
percent.

590
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,530
They don't dislike government.
They disliked democracy.

591
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,620
And we've seen it time and time again.
Look at these,

592
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,290
look at these ridiculous voter Id laws 
that,

593
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,570
uh,
as soon as the supreme court removed the

594
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:07,404
preclearance regulations in 2013,
these voter ID laws go up all over the 

595
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:13,620
place because they want as low a turnout
as possible.

596
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,580
We know they don't care about the will 
of the people based on a Bush v Gore.

597
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,400
We know that they don't care about 
democracy.

598
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,740
Um,
the government,

599
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,510
they're not really against that.

600
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,810
Yeah.
Where you before,

601
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,510
just like a basic voter id registration 
thing,

602
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,990
just that you just have to have some 
level of identification,

603
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:35,320
some government issued identification 
because I get you on that,

604
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,423
but I don't think you should just be 
able to walk in with nothing and just 

605
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,030
sign.

606
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,780
If you've registered,
your name is on a,

607
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,570
is on a registry when you go into vote.

608
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,060
Right?
But shouldn't you have to prove that you

609
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,010
are that person?
Sure.

610
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,140
And votes in your place,
you know,

611
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:49,270
the fact is you're going to say that 
this is a right,

612
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,370
unless you get a photo id and many of 
these photo ids,

613
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,710
you have to pay fees to get.
So in reality,

614
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:59,170
that's a poll tax,
and so you know,

615
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:02,800
a lot of folks say that gutting the 
voting rights act in 2013,

616
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,960
which was done by the way,
the same week,

617
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,213
they greenlit Sharknado too,
like that was just the end of our 

618
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,960
country and my total coincidence,
but you know,

619
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,450
it doesn't just keep African Americans 
from voting,

620
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,313
it was designed to keep seniors,
low income people of all races and 

621
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:19,834
college kids from voting.
There's districts in this country where 

622
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:25,870
you can vote with an NRA id but not a 
university id.

623
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,930
And the right wing response to that is,
well yeah,

624
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:31,900
but foreigners can get college ids will 
guess skeeter,

625
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,490
but foreigners can't have registered to 
vote.

626
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,593
So that's not a problem where people are
killed by televisions every year that 

627
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:38,524
are than vote illegally.
The New York Times did an extensive 

628
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,313
study and found that out over a billion 
votes cast far less than one percent 

629
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:47,680
were fraudulent cast.
There's voter registration fraud.

630
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,960
There's no voter fraud is designed 
deliberately to make people vote less.

631
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,873
Right.
I would say there's gotta be some way 

632
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:55,734
that it can be subsidized.
So just give everyone some card that 

633
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:58,914
proves who they are even even,
even if the numbers are incredibly low 

634
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:02,214
and then you register and then you have 
some card that has your picture on it 

635
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,760
and the government paid for it and 
that's it.

636
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,530
Your a voter registration card every 
year to your home address.

637
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:11,890
But you know,
for me it's like this,

638
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,920
this whole thing with the voter id laws 
is just more proof of how a undemocratic

639
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:18,034
the entire process is.
And I really think that what we should 

640
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,243
be talking about,
how to make it easier to vote not 

641
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:24,860
harder.
Why?

642
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,270
Why do we only vote the first Tuesday in
November?

643
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,313
Well,
it's because we're still living by 18th 

644
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:32,140
century standards in an agrarian 
economy.

645
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:35,940
We were mostly farmers and you were 
planting your crops up until,

646
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,350
you know you are harvesting up until the
end of October.

647
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,393
And then the presumption was the first 
Sunday in November you'd go to church 

648
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,560
and then Monday it would take you 
wonderful day traveling by horse or mule

649
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,650
to get to the nearest polling station.
And then you could vote on Tuesday.

650
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,693
So we're being controlled by the living 
habits of people who've been dead for 

651
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,204
over 100 years instead of having it be 
like motor voter where you get your 

652
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,430
registration as soon as you get your 
license.

653
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,860
Uh,
why can't we have a holiday to vote?

654
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,500
That to me is the number one one.
Take the day off.

655
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,140
Yeah.
We're,

656
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,970
we're able to vote online.
I mean,

657
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,120
we should make it a lot easier.
We should be trying everything we can do

658
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:12,954
to drive up,
go to a enrollments to drive a voter 

659
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,600
participation.
How people manage their own democracy.

660
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,730
Uh,
but since the beginning of this country,

661
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:21,564
when the founding fathers thought only 
land owning white men should be allowed 

662
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:26,460
to vote.
We've always talked the talk.

663
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,790
We haven't walked the walk.
And so I'm a big fan of democracy.

664
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

665
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,740
Democracy is good.
I will,

666
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:35,180
uh,
I will agree with you on that one.

667
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,513
All right,
so let's talk about the Democrats a 

668
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:38,990
little bit,
I suspect,

669
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:40,940
but I can't totally confirm your.
You're a Bernie,

670
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,973
right?

671
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,760
I'm a Bernie guy.
Yeah.

672
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,860
Uh,
just if you go by policies alone,

673
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:46,850
but I mean,
no,

674
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,370
no candidates ever gonna,
you know,

675
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:53,300
we have these purity tests for our 
politicians and no politician,

676
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,150
no a lover,
no relative,

677
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,900
no artist is ever gonna match your 
entire checklist.

678
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,483
I mean,
every rockstar you've ever admired has 

679
00:30:02,871 --> 00:30:05,060
released a bad album or done something 
embarrassing.

680
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,350
You know,
every great filmmaker hasn't,

681
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,203
beloved.
No politician is going to match your 

682
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,900
purity tests at all.
And I see the Democratic Party,

683
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,970
which I'm not a member of.
I'm independent.

684
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:16,160
I always have been.
I'm not a democrat.

685
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,380
Republicans generally forced me to vote 
that way,

686
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,540
but,
uh,

687
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,800
I,
I see the civil war where it's like,

688
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,853
you know,
mom's friends fighting with GRANDPA's 

689
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:25,610
friend said,
it's so ugly.

690
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:26,444
I don't want to watch Margaret that 
should or beat up fiveish finkel in a 

691
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:29,264
cage match.
Just civil war of the left is the most 

692
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:32,780
depressing thing about,
uh,

693
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,510
generally depressing election year.
And,

694
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:36,500
um,
you know,

695
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,334
I,
I have a lot of issues with Hillary 

696
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,283
Clinton,
uh,

697
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,173
but I,
I don't really think that I'm ready to 

698
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:45,560
hand the nuclear launch codes over to 
Donald Trump just yet.

699
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,503
Right.
So let's unpack that a little bit 

700
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:48,534
because I'm fully on board that,
that one of my problems with the left 

701
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:51,954
right now is they have gone out of their
way to demonize hillary to a point that 

702
00:30:56,611 --> 00:30:58,800
they're making it sound like she is a 
Neil Kahn.

703
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:02,490
That she wants to build nations and 
fight all these extra words.

704
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:04,190
Now I get it.
She did vote for her act.

705
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:07,340
She did vote for the Iraq war.
She was secretary of state when,

706
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,193
when Ben Gazi happened,
but Barack Obama was president Barack 

707
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,850
Obama's president.
Right now we're,

708
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,970
we have some troops now in Syria.
We have Afghanistan.

709
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:15,740
Sorry,
constant.

710
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,420
The most disgusting thing they've got.
I mean,

711
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,640
exploiting the murder of these four 
people.

712
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,400
I'm pretty sure that it was terrorists 
who did it,

713
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,263
but we've seen this whole process of how
can we take these corpses and use them 

714
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,740
against politicians.
We don't.

715
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:30,920
Like first it was Susan Rice,
then it was Barack Obama,

716
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,813
now it's all Hillary Clinton's fault.
These folks have never blamed a 

717
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:34,464
terrorist.
They've never held the CIA or portray 

718
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,430
Patraeus responsible for what happened 
there.

719
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,160
And we're never going to know because 
most likely,

720
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,023
I mean Petraeus is mit resending to 
speech that there was a black site 

721
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:45,070
prison in the basement of that 
constantly.

722
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,550
So we're never going to know the whole 
story.

723
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,691
Uh,
you know,

724
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:48,524
for me,
I find half my day is spent defending 

725
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:50,924
Hillary Clinton against unfair attacks.
I think blaming a woman for her 

726
00:31:53,991 --> 00:31:54,824
husband's infidelity.
Good luck getting female voters with 

727
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,190
that.
I mean,

728
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,400
I hear people bringing up Bill Clinton 
raped 20 to broderick again.

729
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,293
Well,
this has nothing to do with policy and 

730
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,364
Bill Clinton is not running,
but Donald Trump has been accused of 

731
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:09,140
rape.
Ronald Reagan was accused of rape.

732
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:12,140
Bill Clinton was accused of rape.
What are we going to do?

733
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,253
So this goes to that purity thing that 
you mentioned because it seems to me 

734
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:18,270
that the far left has taken Bernie.
And they've basically said,

735
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,300
Bernie's are Jesus.
We love all of these ideas.

736
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,433
And at the same time,
we love them so much that we have to 

737
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:28,020
destroy Hillary.
And what I see the problem there is,

738
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,490
is that ultimately you could end up 
ushering in president trump.

739
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,650
Absolutely.
Because the left will be,

740
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,543
they've demonized her to the point that 
all these young people are just not 

741
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:39,120
going to vote.
Right?

742
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,160
Yeah.
I'm voting

743
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,270
for new ones.
I think,

744
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,104
you know,
like,

745
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,700
I don't blame Ralph Nader for George 
Bush becoming president of.

746
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,680
I thought it was great that Nader ran 
and I think he had a right to run that.

747
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:51,090
I think that he had the best,
um,

748
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,330
policy position of any candidate that 
year.

749
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,403
I do blame 90,000
idiots in Florida who knew they were in 

750
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,830
a battle ground state and voted for 
Nader.

751
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:01,730
Anyway.
So yeah,

752
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,270
I'm voting for nuance.
I like Bernie a lot on paper,

753
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,253
but the,
the magic number of this campaign date 

754
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:08,504
is 147.
That's Ruth Bader Ginsburg's age this 

755
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,383
year.
You're voting for the supreme court 

756
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,170
possibly voting for three judges on the 
Supreme Court.

757
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,213
Would you rather have Hillary Clinton 
appoint someone who respects women's 

758
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:23,144
reproductive freedoms or would you 
rather have Donald Trump but Amarosa or 

759
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,194
Gary Busey on the court?
This is what we're looking at right 

760
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:29,960
here.
And so,

761
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:31,490
um,
I think that,

762
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:32,324
uh,
what's probably gonna wind up happening 

763
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,380
is Hillary Clinton will get a lot of 
people's votes.

764
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,820
She won't get their enthusiasm.

765
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,710
Well,
that seems pretty obvious.

766
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,390
I mean,
even the way you're describing,

767
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,710
not that you're saying you're supporting
her,

768
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,200
but even the way you're talking about 
her,

769
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:47,030
it's sort of just like,
it's like a tepid defense,

770
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:47,740
right?

771
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,490
You keep saying,
I bought my shows.

772
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,390
Tepid is the new black,
you know,

773
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:53,260
again,
it's like,

774
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,600
it's like I think that there's a lot of 
folks who,

775
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:56,434
uh,
don't like hillary personally or don't 

776
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,520
like her policies.
And I get all of that.

777
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,150
I will say that if she means half of 
what you said on this election trail,

778
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,340
uh,
the 2016,

779
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:09,400
Hillary is a much better candidate than 
the 2008.

780
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:10,330
Hillary,
I've been very,

781
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:11,164
very impressed with the positions and I 
give 'em Bernie Sanders a ton of credit 

782
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:15,664
for forcing her to take these moral 
positions that would actually help the 

783
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:19,384
middle class and help our economy.
I think Elizabeth Warren gets a lot of 

784
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:22,720
credit to.
It's clear.

785
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,823
Uh,
Secretary Clinton has read Senator 

786
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:26,200
Warren's book.
Um,

787
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,110
but I have a lot of issues with Hillary.
And let me tell you,

788
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:31,420
I,
I posted a couple of jokes defending her

789
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:32,254
against these,
a sexist attacks against her because of 

790
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:39,010
her husband's and fidelity,
which I think is that one of the easiest

791
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:41,200
things you can do and the amount of 
progressive.

792
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,740
So we came after me over it is 
dispiriting because,

793
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:45,630
uh,
uh,

794
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,480
you know,
I don't consider Monica Lewinsky to be a

795
00:34:49,481 --> 00:34:50,314
victim.
I think what Bill Clinton did was wrong 

796
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,630
and unprofessional and I think he's paid
a deep price for it.

797
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,733
And um,
but I don't consider Monica Lewinsky to 

798
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:01,840
be a victim and a,
and by having that point of view,

799
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,703
because it wasn't consensual 
relationship between two adults by her 

800
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:06,670
own testimony,
she pursued it.

801
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,620
And uh,
you know,

802
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:11,770
and I happen to think that I'm,
none of that is our business anyway,

803
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,873
but when you start trying to use a 
woman's husband's infidelities against 

804
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:16,624
her to say that she is unfit to serve 
because she kept her marriage together 

805
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:21,490
and didn't leave.
I don't know what their marriages.

806
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,383
I don't know what their arrangement is.
And I don't judge anybody in this life 

807
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,833
for what system of love works for them.
If they both have their own people on 

808
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:30,160
the side,
they're staying together.

809
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,470
Fine.
It's so hard to make a relationship work

810
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,630
in this world.
So hard to make love work in this world.

811
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,650
Hillary Clinton has been married,
I believe a one slash third.

812
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,493
The Times Donald trump has been married.
I don't get to judge someone's 

813
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,180
relationship or how they loved.
Okay.

814
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,730
It's all a sham.
Marriage is fine.

815
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:45,564
It works for them.
Whatever I'm going to go based on the 

816
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:50,010
issues and not based on someone's 
personal life,

817
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,870
man.
Fugal saying,

818
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,703
I gotta tell you,
it is so refreshing to talk to someone 

819
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:57,520
on the left with a little nuance because
this is what I've been talking about for

820
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:00,550
months that it seems to me the left has 
lost their mind.

821
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,413
Everyone,
every time that you disagree with sort 

822
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:05,284
of the mainstream progressives,
you are a racist or you are a beginner 

823
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,430
or you are a homophobe and they've made 
good,

824
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,293
decent people that are basically liberal
or basically centrist or even a little 

825
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:17,854
conservative.
They've made them all look crazy and 

826
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:20,854
that is fueling trump.
So this is the exact conversation I've 

827
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,710
wanted to have with someone that I 
consider a simpatico on this stuff.

828
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,713
One of the reasons why I've never joined
a political party because people just 

829
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,160
lose their damn minds over this.
And I look at facebook,

830
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:32,994
which has just become like,
it's become like electronic Bosnia and 

831
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,423
everyone's at war with everyone.
I kind of feel like y'all are going to 

832
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:41,754
have to get along and share this earth 
with each other after November of this 

833
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,600
year.
And um,

834
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,493
so I don't want to really be a part of 
the hate or the rancor and by that same 

835
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:51,050
token,
I'll defend Donald Trump too.

836
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,943
I mean,
I'm,

837
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,853
I find myself defending people I don't 
support who were unfairly attacked more 

838
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:57,840
than anything.
Uh,

839
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,580
and it's,
it's really depressing,

840
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:01,230
but it kind of shows how we got where we
are.

841
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,800
By that same token,
the very fact that Bernie Sanders can go

842
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:08,030
this far in the campaign,
I mean he packed in 20,000

843
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,790
in a stadium in California,
in Sacramento last night with 10,000

844
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:12,420
outside.

845
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,860
Of course the media didn't cover this,
but the very fact that a,

846
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:16,694
a Jewish self-described democratic 
socialists can do that well in this day 

847
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,300
and age shows the power of the Internet 
and online social media.

848
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:25,980
And it shows how far we've come as a 
people.

849
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,993
I mean the,
the strides lgbt people have made in my 

850
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:29,694
lifetime from when I was a teenager 
living in New York in the eighties and 

851
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,310
seeing the beginning of aids activism to
a sitting president,

852
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,580
Dorsey marriage equality during a heated
reelection battle.

853
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,990
That's why I still believe in the 
American dream because I've seen people,

854
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,853
not politicians,
but people make this kind of change 

855
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:45,820
happen.

856
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,511
Yeah.
And you know,

857
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:47,344
it's funny because right where you were 
probably 10 feet from you or when I had 

858
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:53,350
my show on Sirius Xm,
I think it was the first time we had met

859
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,390
or maybe we did stand up one or two 
times together,

860
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,373
but you came on my show and we were 
talking about marriage equality and you 

861
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:01,690
were laying out such a good case for it,
but it was four years before it happened

862
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,760
and it seemed sort of edgy.
We're now,

863
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,670
it seems the norm and that's what 
liberalism is supposed to be.

864
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,801
Sure.
I mean,

865
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:08,634
look,
it was liberals in the Republican Party 

866
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,160
who ended slavery,
right?

867
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,480
I mean it was,
you know,

868
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,180
liberals in both parties who fought for 
civil rights.

869
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:16,014
It was conservative.
So both parties who fought against the 

870
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,440
civil rights movement,
uh,

871
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,190
you know,
it,

872
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,420
it's,
it's messy.

873
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,670
And like I said at the beginning of this
conversation,

874
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,803
I think we're all progressive in some 
ways and conservative and other ways 

875
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,100
that billy's most sane people.
I know,

876
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,270
um,
so,

877
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:31,104
you know,
I've seen a lot to be inspired by in my 

878
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:33,324
life and uh,
I try to remind myself that I am a 

879
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,514
recovering cynic and I don't ever want 
to go back to being so dark again and 

880
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,620
I'm catching a lot of heat for it 
because,

881
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,440
you know,
in talking about Donald trump who is not

882
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:47,110
a conservative Republican,
he's just not,

883
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,840
he's a horrible human being.
But if you would ever told me,

884
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:50,674
Dave Rubin,
if you had ever told me that there'd be 

885
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,864
a guy on stage at a Republican 
presidential debate saying that Bush 

886
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:57,574
lied us into war,
saying that planned parenthood does a 

887
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,170
lot of good things for,
for women saying that,

888
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:03,004
um,
that hedge fund managers and 

889
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:06,460
billionaires like himself,
it should be taxed more.

890
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,230
I,
I wouldn't have believed it.

891
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,213
I mean,
grover norquist is clutching his pearls 

892
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,010
at.
And a lot of this.

893
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,070
But again,
the third right did the same thing.

894
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,490
And I think anyone who compares people 
to Nazis is worse than Hitler.

895
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,910
But I will say a third,
right rose to power by,

896
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,860
uh,
by running against the Weimar republic.

897
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,710
And promising so many conservatives and 
so many liberals,

898
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,544
whatever they wanted,
that people just kinda got caught up in 

899
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,650
the emotion of it and this feeling of 
national pride.

900
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,100
That's not to compare the Obama 
administration to the Weimar Republic.

901
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,340
They're much more confident,
but the parallels are really,

902
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:40,174
really similar because Donald trump has 
promised as much good progressive stuff 

903
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,050
as he's promised.
Conservative stuff.

904
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,973
So talking about trump and sort of 
running on emotion and not policy and 

905
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:49,354
kind of giving everybody everything they
want and being to the left of what most 

906
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:56,500
conservatives are yet still winning the 
republican primaries and all that.

907
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,334
You had an interesting moment that you 
touched on right at the top of the 

908
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:04,300
etch-a-sketch sketch moment of the Mitt 
Romney campaign where basically you were

909
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,440
on CNN and you questioned,
was it Romney's campaign manager?

910
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,390
Who Was it?
Communications director,

911
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,200
Eric,
for instance.

912
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,930
Okay.
And basically you said to him,

913
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,773
you know,
you guys have been saying all this bad 

914
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:19,540
stuff about each other and the 
Republican primaries and how do you move

915
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,280
forward.
That was sort of the gist of it.

916
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:21,971
And he said,
well,

917
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,110
it's an etch a sketch,
right?

918
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:25,060
And you can just sort of forget all that
stuff.

919
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:25,894
And reset.
Do you want to clean up the mess that I 

920
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,813
created for you there?

921
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,670
No,
you got it.

922
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,140
I mean,
it was,

923
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,973
it was pretty.
It was a bit sneaky on my part because 

924
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,883
I,
I knew that I wanted to ask a question 

925
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:39,370
that I hadn't heard asked before.
And at the time everyone was saying,

926
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,500
is Mitt Romney Conservative enough?
That was the,

927
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,210
that was where all the mainstream media 
was going.

928
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,223
You've got Gingrich and Santorum.
Is Mitt Romney really conservative 

929
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,644
enough because main,
most mainstream media will never stop 

930
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,450
chasing Fox News as audience.
And uh,

931
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:55,590
and my whole thing was,
isn't Mitt Romney to conservative?

932
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,453
Has any,
has any painted himself into an 

933
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:00,890
ideological quarter in this campaign by,
you know,

934
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,980
it was easier to run against mccain in 
2000.

935
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,870
Nowadays these guys in 2008,
uh,

936
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:07,780
uh,
um,

937
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,240
starting in 2008 now in 2012,
you know,

938
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,103
you're up against Gingrich and Santorum.
You're trying to be something you're 

939
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:14,044
not.
And it's the same problem that every 

940
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:16,324
Republican nominee is going to have for 
quite a while when the tea party is 

941
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,170
controlled,
when you're nominating process,

942
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,173
um,
it's sort of like the gop is gonna have 

943
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:27,010
a tough time getting non lunatics 
nominated for president.

944
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,010
Democrats have a different problem.
Nobody shows up to vote in midterms.

945
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,873
So both parties are kind of screwed.
And that's why we're looking at 

946
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,920
potentially a generation of democratic 
presidents and Republican congresses.

947
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,091
But,
you know,

948
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:39,120
I.
So I asked it in a,

949
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,840
in a very wordy,
newsy bs kind of way.

950
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,960
Um,
and to my shock,

951
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,430
he came out and said,
oh no,

952
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,170
you get to the midterm,
you get to the general.

953
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:48,540
And it,
it's,

954
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,350
it's like a reset button.
It's like an intro sketch.

955
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,193
And I couldn't believe it.
He had just admitted that Mitt Romney 

956
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,380
had the ideology of the guy from a Mento
lift,

957
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,100
like a crack house mattress.
He changed positions like a,

958
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,950
like a,
like a yoga teacher,

959
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,710
untainted meth.
And um,

960
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,500
I,
I went home after the taping.

961
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:09,920
I was doing mornings every day on CNN.
And by that afternoon,

962
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,190
uh,
the clip had been shown everywhere I was

963
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:16,850
sitting in a cafe with my wife and baby 
and that I saw myself on tv,

964
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,590
uh,
everyone began running it.

965
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,423
It was on the daily show and cold beer 
that night and all the big networks and 

966
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,620
I was getting calls from Europe and just
get sales went up,

967
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,320
I believe 16,000
percent on Amazon that night.

968
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,600
You get a cut of that.
I did not get a cut of that,

969
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:32,570
but I was asked to sign lots of veggies,
sketches for the next two years at every

970
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:34,280
one of my tour dates.
And,

971
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:35,114
um,
I guess I was proud to be a minor 

972
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:38,750
historical footnote,
but you know,

973
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,613
it,
it is the sort of thing that Republican 

974
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,240
voters in the Democratic voters as well 
need to be weary of,

975
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:47,960
especially in a season when so many 
don't trust trump or hillary.

976
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,933
Right?
So basically what you did with that 

977
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,124
question was you pulled the mask off of 
the endless bullshit because you 

978
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:58,750
basically said to him,
you had to say some stuff to get through

979
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,120
and look at the Democrats have the same 
problem.

980
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,830
I get you with the Republicans and the 
tea party,

981
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:03,664
they dragged them to the right.
I think the Democrats have the same 

982
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:06,334
problem now where they're being led by 
the far left and that goes to the point 

983
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,830
where we were talking about with 
Hillary,

984
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:14,230
where they are going to demonize her and
then depressed.

985
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,290
They're actual people from from showing 
up.

986
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,510
So I think both parties have this 
problem,

987
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:20,344
but you expose this thing and it seems 
like four years later trump has just 

988
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:28,480
blown the whole thing apart.
Like there is no more a,

989
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,314
we have to pretend we're this or that.
Trump is just like I say whatever I 

990
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:32,464
want,
you all love it and I'm just going to 

991
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:36,010
keep doing it.
Even if I change my position every week.

992
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,483
Yeah.
And he will continue to change 

993
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,360
positions.
He's already done it this week.

994
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,510
I'm not so sure that Bernie has led the 
whole Party to the far left,

995
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:43,344
so I kinda think Bush and Cheney push 
the country a lot more left to tell you 

996
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:47,004
the truth and I don't think Bernie 
Sanders has sent anything too 

997
00:43:49,051 --> 00:43:49,884
outrageous.
He's really advocating for things that 

998
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:52,794
have worked in other countries that are 
our capitalist allies and for things 

999
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:58,560
that have worked here in the past under 
President Eisenhower.

1000
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,291
Well,
interestingly,

1001
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,510
I don't think that Bernie necessarily is
leading it,

1002
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:02,344
but I think that that movement that's 
behind him is leading him in a way that 

1003
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:06,334
I don't know that he fully grasps.
I think that some of the social justice 

1004
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:09,994
stuff and just the,
the behavior of the far left is not 

1005
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:15,400
behavior that he uses.
I tweeted once,

1006
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:18,940
I wish that I liked Bernie supporters as
much as I like Bernie.

1007
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:22,540
I think he is a pretty decent guy,
but I think he's being led by the.

1008
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:23,690
By.
I go ahead.

1009
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,070
I don't know if he's being led.
I think his campaign is being tainted by

1010
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:29,560
some of his followers,
but that's fair circumstances here.

1011
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:30,394
Number one,
we have no idea how of these online 

1012
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:32,754
trolls are actually republicans 
pretending to be Bernie supporters 

1013
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,920
because I do wound hillary.
Mom tells mom,

1014
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:39,450
always said,
don't talk to strange eggs,

1015
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,353
are right,
talk to any eggs with 20 followers 

1016
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:44,154
because they're trolls and you know,
there's whoever owns them as a whole 

1017
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,400
basket.
Uh,

1018
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:48,450
also,
you know,

1019
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,990
a lot of these same situations apply to 
Hillary Clinton supporters as well.

1020
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:52,824
There is uncommon hostility towards 
Bernie supporters from tons of Hillary 

1021
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:56,694
supporters.
And the generational divide in Hillary 

1022
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,400
Clinton's campaign has been fascinating.
You know,

1023
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:07,401
there've been studies showing that women
over 45 have waited their whole life for

1024
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:10,980
a woman president and they've worked for
this and they need,

1025
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:12,270
they really want this to happen.

1026
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,103
And I respect that.
But the same studies show that women 

1027
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:15,894
under 45 know that in their lifetime 
there will be a woman president and 

1028
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,380
they'd all go for Elizabeth Warren in a 
second.

1029
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,953
Uh,
they don't totally trust this woman 

1030
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:27,490
candidate.
So it,

1031
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,340
it's,
it's a real reckoning that,

1032
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,020
uh,
our country is going to have to face.

1033
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,230
I kind of am inclined to believe day 
that whoever gets the job is going to be

1034
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,064
a one term punching bag because I don't 
know who could enact a kind of sweeping 

1035
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,853
reform.
We need to actually restore the middle 

1036
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:43,354
class.
We're sort of in the golden age of 

1037
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,100
gradual improvement.
That's hailed as sweeping reform.

1038
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,920
I think Bernie Sanders was smart.
If I was advising them,

1039
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:50,754
I would tell them to take a one term 
pledge and then just say that once he 

1040
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:54,354
got in there,
he was just going to executive order us 

1041
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,580
into having a middleclass again and then
leave.

1042
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,160
I think it's the smartest thing you 
could do what trump is,

1043
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,930
but when you be okay with that,
really,

1044
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,764
uh,
the executive branch getting more and 

1045
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:10,050
more power because almost every 
president at this point takes more power

1046
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:12,600
for that branch.
And even if you think about the emphasis

1047
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:13,920
that we put on the presidential 
election,

1048
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,330
there are only a third of the 
government,

1049
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:17,520
right?
But we barely ever talk about,

1050
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,440
uh,
the Senate and the Congress,

1051
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:20,274
right?
We barely talked about the supreme 

1052
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,830
court.
So the idea of giving the president more

1053
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:23,664
power,
do you fear that because somebody that 

1054
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:28,470
you didn't like it then get into office 
and you wouldn't be happy about it,

1055
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:28,860
right?

1056
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,740
Argument for reform,
you know what I mean?

1057
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,260
All the Democrats who were demanding 
that Harry Reid and the Filibuster,

1058
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,370
uh,
you know,

1059
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:39,090
when the Democrats had to send it now,
so grateful they didn't because it gives

1060
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:39,924
the Democrats some leverage.
We've never had this level of 

1061
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,010
obstruction before.
And congressional history.

1062
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:44,844
Bill Clinton broke the record for the 
most filibusters against the president 

1063
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,643
in US history.
He had more than every other president 

1064
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:52,650
combined.
And under Obama,

1065
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,513
it's already tops.
Clinton in Obama's first term and top 

1066
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:56,820
Clinton.
So this isn't,

1067
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,013
I'm not talking about big government.
I'm talking about good government and 

1068
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:01,050
you know,
I,

1069
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,840
I know that things move slow.
Things are designed to move slow.

1070
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,530
But I just spent a couple of years of my
life working on a film for pbs about the

1071
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:08,364
American dream.
We retraced Alexis de Tocqueville's 

1072
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:14,850
journey in 18,
31 and interviewed over 200 people in 55

1073
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:16,200
cities in 17 states.

1074
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,660
About what the American dream was and 
what it is now,

1075
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:19,973
and it's one thing for me to sit in a 
radio or a TV studio and be lofty about 

1076
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:24,390
this,
but actually having good on the road for

1077
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:25,224
a couple of years.
The American dream is not what it once 

1078
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,134
was.
We were raised to believe that we were 

1079
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:31,780
in a country where you could work hard,
play by the rules,

1080
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:32,614
and you would prosper and your children 
could know that they were going to have 

1081
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:41,950
a higher standard of living than you.
After 35 years of deregulation,

1082
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:44,140
of outsourcing,
of Deindustrialization,

1083
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:44,974
of automation,
of jobs being shipped away that are 

1084
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:49,780
never coming back.
That's not the American dream anymore.

1085
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:53,230
It's gone from prosperity to survival 
for millions.

1086
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,183
Retirement doesn't exist anymore.
The middle class is now just the top of 

1087
00:47:56,831 --> 00:48:01,390
the bottom and it doesn't have to be 
this way and if policies got us here,

1088
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,433
policies could get us out of here,
but I fear we being the slow learning 

1089
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:08,980
monkeys that we are going to have to get
a lot worse before it gets better.

1090
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,953
Yeah.
That's been a theme that I've talked to 

1091
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:12,084
a lot of people about that a lot of 
people that I really respect and like 

1092
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:18,480
are saying that it's going to get worse 
before it gets better and everything you

1093
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,314
just described,
whether you are on the left or the 

1094
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:22,614
right,
it explains both Bernie and trump 

1095
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,700
because it's about people are voting or 
at least expressing themselves about the

1096
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,220
broken system,
not the policies.

1097
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:34,110
That's why it doesn't matter what trump 
says.

1098
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,200
He's just saying something and for the 
Bernie people,

1099
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:38,034
it doesn't matter whether the president 
actually has the authority to do these 

1100
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:41,844
things and change the banking system the
way he wants to and all of this stuff 

1101
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:47,100
and the minimum wage thing,
which the president can't just do with a

1102
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:47,934
pen.

1103
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,950
Essential Kennedy talking about it as a 
platform for position.

1104
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:52,970
So it's just,
you know,

1105
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,863
if you go for that,
it's the American people saying that's 

1106
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:57,110
what we want,
but we know.

1107
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,110
We know that the government doesn't care
about democracy.

1108
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,003
Go back to Obama.
Look what the American people voted for 

1109
00:49:02,661 --> 00:49:04,490
twice.
Closing Gitmo.

1110
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,710
The American people voted for a public 
option.

1111
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,650
The American people voted for higher 
taxes on the wealthy.

1112
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:10,723
Obama had to wait until he was elected 
twice before he could just restore tax 

1113
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,900
codes to Clinton levels.
Uh,

1114
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,261
you know,
they,

1115
00:49:17,261 --> 00:49:19,190
they run on these things.
And then of course,

1116
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:20,750
once they were an officer not allowed 
to.

1117
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:21,381
And I'm like,
well,

1118
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:23,970
what about the will of the voters so 
that,

1119
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,060
that does come into it.
In the case of trump,

1120
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:26,894
it's fascinating because he's proved 
once and for all that nobody hates 

1121
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:33,080
Republican politicians more than 
Republican primary voters.

1122
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,053
Right?
And there's something sort of beautiful 

1123
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:36,214
about that.
That's why I'm conflicted about the 

1124
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:38,134
whole thing because it's like,
I don't like the idea of this person 

1125
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,813
that I don't know really what he 
believes in and is using the media in 

1126
00:49:46,811 --> 00:49:51,280
such a crass and sort of dishonest way.
And then at the same time,

1127
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,143
all of these leaders,
I wasn't a fan of any of the mainstream 

1128
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:57,130
Republicans beforehand.
So watching them all kind of crumble and

1129
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,250
watching all the talking heads on all 
the cable news networks,

1130
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:03,190
watching the same people who got 
everything wrong six months ago now.

1131
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,660
Now they're afraid.
Right?

1132
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:06,990
You can see fear in them.
When I watched them,

1133
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,150
I watched them on CNN and I go,
wow,

1134
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,043
you can tell they're afraid for their 
jobs now because they've all been 

1135
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:16,360
phoning it in for years for the system 
and now they're afraid.

1136
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,220
Wow,
this guy can come in,

1137
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,250
we can be out of a Gig.

1138
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,780
Exactly.
Watching the Republican races,

1139
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:24,260
like watching Batman v Superman,
I don't know who I'm rooting for.

1140
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:27,110
I just wanted to be done.
And uh,

1141
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:27,890
and,
and,

1142
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,723
you know,
in that sense it's revealed a lot of 

1143
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:30,470
the,
uh,

1144
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,480
the discontented.
We,

1145
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,960
we can't forget that the first ever 
third party president got into the White

1146
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,793
House with only 38 percent of the vote 
and he was a republican and it was 

1147
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:44,390
Lincoln and the two party do wobbly is 
what a lot of people don't trust.

1148
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,283
And you know,
maybe trump could have done better if 

1149
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,480
he'd run as a,
as a,

1150
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,580
uh,
a third party independent.

1151
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,560
Although he did that before,
I believe,

1152
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:52,940
and you know,
didn't get anywhere with it,

1153
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,043
but,
you know,

1154
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,000
that was before he became a reality TV 
star.

1155
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:57,163
Um,
it,

1156
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,550
it's interesting.
I guess if I was advising the Republican

1157
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,000
Party,
I,

1158
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,830
I think the smartest thing we've heard 
comes from William Kristol,

1159
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,203
which I'm kind of liberal,
are you have broken clocks that are 

1160
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:12,020
right more than him.

1161
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,720
The fact is William Kristol is leading 
this consortium of Republicans trying to

1162
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,414
persuade a mainstream well known 
Republican leader who's out of the game 

1163
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,853
to make a third party run.
Their fear is that I'll even more 

1164
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:29,660
republicans are going to stay home this 
year.

1165
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,733
Then stayed home for Romney in 2012.
Let's not forget Gary Johnson to time 

1166
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:38,480
elected governor of New Mexico who was 
only invited to I think two or three gop

1167
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:43,400
debates and all of 2012 ran as,
as the Libertarian Party candidate got a

1168
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,750
million votes.
Mark my words,

1169
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:45,584
Dave Rubin,
Gary Johnson's going to get more than a 

1170
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:47,504
million votes this year and they're 
terrified of more disaffected 

1171
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:50,894
Republicans staying home.
So the movement and the New York Times 

1172
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,910
wrote a whole piece about it is to get,
say,

1173
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:56,744
a Rick Perry to run as a third party 
knowing he'll never get it to fall on 

1174
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:01,514
his sword,
but their fear is that Donald Trump is 

1175
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:05,210
not just going to cost them the White 
House.

1176
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,790
They're writing that off there.
They're afraid of losing the Senate.

1177
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,223
So if you can get a Rick Perry or an 
attractive well known conservative to 

1178
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:13,064
run to at least get the social 
conservatives out of the house so 

1179
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:16,694
they'll still vote and then vote are all
the way down tickets that could help 

1180
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:20,684
them save the Senate.
We shouldn't be saying this because I 

1181
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:25,100
want them to lose the Senate,
but it is a smart strategy.

1182
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,033
God.
It's such intricate little moves and 

1183
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:29,694
machinations of the system and that 
you're agreeing with the ideas of Bill 

1184
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,510
Kristol to sort of take down trump

1185
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,223
be with the idea,
but I think it's a smart idea if they 

1186
00:52:38,731 --> 00:52:39,564
want to keep the Senate

1187
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,703
right.
So I liked that you brought out Gary 

1188
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,770
Johnson.
I've had Gary Johnson on the show.

1189
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:46,650
I think he is an extremely decent human 
being.

1190
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:48,630
I've watched,
I think I was one of the two people that

1191
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:51,310
watched the libertarian debates.
Um,

1192
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,450
what's your line on Libertarians?
You've got a good line on Libertarians

1193
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,880
and a bunch of lines and libertarian.

1194
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,980
They're liberals with that,
uh,

1195
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,150
something or.
No,

1196
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,300
and I think libertarian is just Latin 
for embarrassed Republican.

1197
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,720
I like that.
That's my cat.

1198
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,570
My cat just like,
like,

1199
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,400
look,
I know you're too stupid to get.

1200
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,940
We'd all just be more selfish.
Dick's,

1201
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,003
oh look.
A food appeared magically before me and 

1202
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:19,300
I did nothing for it.
I met special and no one else had a role

1203
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:21,610
in bringing my food to make you want the
nine rand book.

1204
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:23,080
I've got nine more.
You know,

1205
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,600
you know what?
I had the,

1206
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,450
I had the president of the Iron Ran 
Institute on last week.

1207
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,284
You're going to have to watch the show.
Maybe I'll have you guys on together to 

1208
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:31,254
battle it out.

1209
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:33,530
Yeah,
I mean look out Somalia doing.

1210
00:53:33,531 --> 00:53:36,740
The fact is even if a libertarian became
elected president,

1211
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,990
which won't happen,
you are never.

1212
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,440
First off,
you can believe in religion and science.

1213
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,740
You don't get to claim you follow Ian 
Rand and Jesus.

1214
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,300
Okay.
And uh,

1215
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,560
Ran Paul,
by the way,

1216
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:51,140
ran away from libertarianism faster than
Ian Ran,

1217
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,480
ran to the mailbox for her social 
security check.

1218
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,553
No president is ever going to want to be
the president who does away with social 

1219
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,290
security and Medicare and Medicaid and 
the entire social safety net.

1220
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,120
It's never gonna happen.

1221
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,500
So those,
those types of things,

1222
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,960
that would just be,
if you're a purist libertarian,

1223
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:06,794
like every party,
there's ways of taking the sort of 

1224
00:54:08,391 --> 00:54:09,224
ideals of libertarianism,
of limited government and freeing up 

1225
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:15,040
business more things like that,
um,

1226
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,913
without necessarily destroying social 
security and still allowing for some 

1227
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:20,650
safety net and things like that.
So it's.

1228
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:21,800
Yeah,

1229
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,341
yeah,
I mean,

1230
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:23,031
you know,
we'll see.

1231
00:54:23,031 --> 00:54:23,780
I mean,
I'm,

1232
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,613
I'm,
I liked Dr Jill Stein and the Green 

1233
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,080
party as well.
Like I,

1234
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,650
I would love to see at least one debate 
where all the third party,

1235
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,340
Major,
third party candidates have to be on the

1236
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:35,300
stage with the big too.
Because what we're seeing here with both

1237
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:39,440
Bernie and trump is a massive American 
discontent with this.

1238
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:43,430
A snake with two heads that's taken over
the whole game.

1239
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,850
People don't trust the two party system 
and believe me,

1240
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:47,684
we're all going to be so sick of seeing 
that picture of the trumps and the 

1241
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,183
Clintons at the wedding laughing 
together because it's the ultimate 

1242
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,414
signal of just how there's,
there's us and there's them and most of 

1243
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:00,290
the Republicans and Democrats in this 
country are part of the US.

1244
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,490
Yeah.
Well that's also why I.

1245
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:04,290
Yeah,
I had Gary Johnson on the show,

1246
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:05,363
but I've tweeted several times and I've 
tried to put the message out there that 

1247
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,530
even if you don't love this guy,
even if this isn't your guy,

1248
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,240
if you guys get him to 15 percent,
once the general election is on,

1249
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,074
they have to put him in the debate.
So it's probably not gonna happen for 

1250
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:21,750
Jill Stein because she's running what,
72 times already,

1251
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,300
but Gary Johnson,
I think this year,

1252
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,283
what

1253
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,450
once course she's run

1254
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,720
only only ones before.
Okay.

1255
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:29,220
One 72,
whatever it is.

1256
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,990
Um,
but Gary,

1257
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:31,824
Joseph,
I do think there's such discontent that 

1258
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,764
there's a chance that at some point they
could just get them to 15 percent and 

1259
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:38,940
they'd have to throw another voice in 
there.

1260
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,140
So I'm not even making it about him as 
much as just give us another voice.

1261
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:46,800
Give us another option.
Someone let us here another idea.

1262
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:47,873
Honestly,
if the,

1263
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,400
if the DNC wasn't walking around in 
clown shoes,

1264
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,550
they would pour a lot of money into the 
right to life parties because there's so

1265
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:54,384
many social conservatives who only vote 
for the Republican party because of the 

1266
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:58,044
abortion issue.
The Republican Party will never allow 

1267
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:03,900
abortion to become illegal.
It is their number one fundraising tool.

1268
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:07,040
And Trust me,
as long as politicians have Mr Seuss,

1269
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,780
abortion will remain legal in this 
country.

1270
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:10,943
Uh,
and I can talk about that issue all day 

1271
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:13,410
long,
but you know,

1272
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:17,370
to me why more conservatives don't bail 
on the Republican Party and go ahead and

1273
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:19,860
vote right to light.
If you're already a single issue voter.

1274
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,443
And by the way,
a grotesque hypocrite because Jesus out 

1275
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:24,424
against the death penalty never 
mentioned abortion and got technically 

1276
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:29,140
beliefs,
prolife character in the Bible,

1277
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:31,930
but that's a whole other matter to me.
You know,

1278
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,240
the Bush family was never against 
abortion rights,

1279
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,770
never against the war.
And Donald Trump's not against,

1280
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,960
of course,
you know,

1281
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,410
they,
they put on this charade,

1282
00:56:40,411 --> 00:56:42,700
they shuffle it around.
And these social conservatives,

1283
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,653
I mean,
Alabama keeps voting for these people 

1284
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,860
over and over and over again.
And nothing changes.

1285
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,150
Howard Dean was really smart with the 50
state strategy when he ran the DNC.

1286
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,283
And a smart,
charismatic Democrat would try to make 

1287
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:56,920
inroads down there.
Trust me,

1288
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,053
if social conservatives who watch Fox 
News could hear a Bernie Sanders speech 

1289
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,743
unedited,
they find themselves nodding every bit 

1290
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,530
as much as they do with trump,
only with Bernie.

1291
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:07,660
It's policy with trump.
It's just personality.

1292
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,033
So how much of this,
when we talk about the personality 

1293
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:11,914
thing,
that I really believe this election is 

1294
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:16,300
going to be one on the personality thing
and not on substance in any way.

1295
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:17,343
Um,
how much of this is just the times we 

1296
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:19,444
live in,
it's just that we're all at twitter 

1297
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:21,214
expressing ourselves all the time.
It's all that everyone's on facebook 

1298
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,443
posting articles and fighting with 
people in banning people in muting 

1299
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,590
people.
How much is just noise?

1300
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:30,460
Do you have trouble?
I mean,

1301
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:31,294
when you're doing your show,
even sort of separating the noise from 

1302
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:36,130
what's actually real.

1303
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,340
Yeah,
but I think that's nothing new.

1304
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:40,150
I mean,
you know,

1305
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,080
look back to how vicious Jefferson Adams
were against each other in the press.

1306
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,213
I mean,
Adams called out Jefferson for selling 

1307
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:49,270
his own children to slavery 200 years 
ago.

1308
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,370
You know,
Lincoln was so despised.

1309
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:54,100
Roosevelt and eleanor were as hated as 
the Clintons are.

1310
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,970
All of this is really nothing new for 
our country or our species.

1311
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,590
And I think that,
you know,

1312
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,300
the,
like George Carlin said,

1313
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,340
when you're born you get a free ticket 
to the free show.

1314
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,350
Uh,
the trick is to not grow up enjoying the

1315
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:07,060
freak show.
And so,

1316
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:08,080
um,
you know,

1317
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,973
yeah,
there's a lot of folks who are going to 

1318
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:13,360
have to patch up a lot of friendships 
once this campaign is over and uh,

1319
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,530
uh,
you know,

1320
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,363
I appreciate my conservative and 
progressive brothers and sisters who 

1321
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:18,284
were able to talk about this stuff like 
grownups and not let hate getting the 

1322
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:21,210
way.

1323
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,220
Yeah,
there's not many of us though,

1324
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:25,200
or I guess there are,
but we're the silent majority.

1325
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,034
That's what I said at the top of the 
show that I think actually most people 

1326
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:29,423
don't feel like you have to have a 
purity of political purity tests to be 

1327
00:58:31,861 --> 00:58:32,694
friends with someone.
But there do seem to be sides that want 

1328
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:36,414
that to be.
And I think actually most people are 

1329
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,750
willing to do this and say,
all right,

1330
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,833
if you go,
thanks at a couple of things that I 

1331
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:44,280
agree with and Ruben's at a couple of 
things I agree with and,

1332
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,570
and that's all right.

1333
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,450
And that's the point.
I think you're right.

1334
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,150
So,
uh,

1335
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,140
we will,
we've only got a couple minutes left.

1336
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,240
Who Do you think's doing it better than 
us?

1337
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:56,060
Is there a country that you look at 
right now because you know,

1338
00:58:56,061 --> 00:58:58,040
Europe's got a whole slew of other 
problems,

1339
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,260
uh,
western Europe and Eastern Europe.

1340
00:59:00,261 --> 00:59:01,520
We,
there's all over the world.

1341
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:02,720
There's,
everyone's got problems.

1342
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,260
Is there any system that you could go 
those guys that's the,

1343
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,400
that's the way we should be doing it.

1344
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:08,371
Well,
sure.

1345
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:09,204
I mean it was a lot of people who are 
doing the American dream has become the 

1346
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:12,324
Scandinavian dream and those are 
capitalist societies with strong safety 

1347
00:59:15,061 --> 00:59:18,900
nets where you pay higher taxes but you 
get stuff for your taxes here.

1348
00:59:18,901 --> 00:59:22,250
We think we pay low taxes,
but we pay high for everything else.

1349
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,263
Yeah,
you might pay lower taxes than our 

1350
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:24,854
European friends,
but then you're paying for your 

1351
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:27,680
healthcare.
You're paying for your senior care.

1352
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:30,110
You're paying for your college loans for
the rest of your life.

1353
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,470
Michael Moore's coming on my show today,
a year at Sirius Xm.

1354
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,230
And uh,
I highly recommend his new film.

1355
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:38,750
Nobody saw it.
It's called where to invade next.

1356
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:41,660
And the idea of it is him going to 
different countries and stealing.

1357
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,110
They were good ideas and claiming it for
America because these other countries do

1358
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:45,944
the American green better than we do.
There's still upward mobility in these 

1359
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:49,930
nations.
Uh,

1360
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,210
Finland and Sweden.
Then of course,

1361
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:55,340
Denmark,
which is considered the happiest country

1362
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,030
in the world.
Um,

1363
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,000
you know,
I,

1364
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,833
I believe that America though,
I'm not going to abandon this country 

1365
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:01,184
for another one and I'm going to stick 
around here and fight for decency and 

1366
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,640
love and common sense.

1367
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:05,823
I was going to ask you another question,
but that's kind of a pretty decent way 

1368
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:09,310
to end the show,
Johnny.

1369
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,030
Well,
thank you dave.

1370
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:12,520
It's a pleasure to be here.
I hope it wasn't.

1371
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,520
I'll bring lots of Dick Jokes next time.
Right?

1372
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,240
Next time we'll,
we'll work blue,

1373
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,103
uh,
and I look forward to coming on your 

1374
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:19,890
show again.
And you,

1375
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:20,743
as I said at the top,
you are the one that drags me to stand 

1376
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,540
up.
I need to be doing more standup.

1377
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,341
Dave,
you're really,

1378
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:27,290
you're really good on stage.
You should be doing a lot more of it.

1379
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,670
We need your voice out there,
uh,

1380
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:29,330
in,
in the,

1381
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,130
in the theaters as well as on the year.

1382
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,010
Well,
that's exactly how I feel about you.

1383
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:34,844
So I want to thank my guest,
John Bugle sang for joining me on the 

1384
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:38,570

1389
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:54,500
you'll be in a fancy studio and you'll 
look great and all that good stuff.

1390
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,453
I appreciate it.
I'm also on the road touring across the 

1391
01:00:56,931 --> 01:01:00,170
country right now.
I've just made my 21st out of state trip

1392
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:02,620
in 2016 already.
Uh,

1393

to put your show together.
