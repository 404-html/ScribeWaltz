1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,720
Paris,
San Bernardino,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,160
Jerusalem,
Brussels,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,053
it seems not a day goes by without 
another murderous assault on innocent 

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:09,864
civilians.
Last Sunday bore witness to one of the 

5
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:16,150
most horrific attacks in recent memory 
as a Taliban affiliated group,

6
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,340
um,
to park in Lahore,

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,174
Pakistan,
killing scores of women and children 

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,293
celebrating the Easter holiday.
These attacks only seem to be getting 

9
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,700
more brazen,
more coordinated,

10
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,534
and more effective.
People all over Europe are worried and 

11
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,224
with good reason.
It seems governments all throughout the 

12
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:34,464
European continent had been ill prepared
to deal with the growing threat of 

13
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,500
radical Islamic terrorism.
Please note,

14
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:45,501
I once again said radical Islamic 
terrorism and not all Muslims.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,810
I think I've done that once or twice 
before.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,010
This distinction is becoming 
increasingly exhausting to have to point

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,844
out,
but one I continue to make 

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,410
unfortunately,
many on the right refuse to separate the

19
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,244
nominal average person from the radicals
and many on the left refuse to 

20
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:08,010
acknowledge there are a few of us who do
make that distinction over and over.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,263
While I've now conceded that the far 
left will never accept any good faith 

22
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:13,854
critique of Islam and will always excuse
and sometimes even endorse it's 

23
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,024
terrorism.
I know that many good people are waking 

24
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,324
up to this nonsense every day.
This is one of the themes the rubin 

25
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:24,954
report has been all about,
and I'm glad to say that we're ahead of 

26
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,430
the curve on it,
so one more time.

27
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:34,431
It is radical Islamists,
a subset of people who believe in Islam,

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,350
who are blowing up airports,
trains,

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,483
and parks.
They don't care whether the people they 

30
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:43,530
murder are men or women,
grandparents or children,

31
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,364
black or white.
They want to sow chaos and destruction 

32
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,640
in the name of their religion.
Don't take my word for it by the way,

33
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:51,474
read the statements,
the jihadists issue after each terror 

34
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,864
attack,
these statements are all filled with 

35
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,144
religious reasons,
quoting doctrine to kill infidels and 

36
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,440
nonbelievers.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,820
This is a good time to remind people.
Once again what a religion is.

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,683
It is a set of ideas or religion isn't 
built into you like your sex or your 

39
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:16,641
color or religion is just a bunch of 
ideas only made of reality by people who

40
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:21,120
practice it's beliefs.
Any set of ideas is worthy of critique.

41
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:24,840
Whether these ideas are religious,
political or personal,

42
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,230
so if you would be against throwing gays
off of roofs,

43
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:33,210
making women wear burkas and treating 
minorities as second class citizens.

44
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,180
If a political party had those ideas and
its platform,

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,510
then you must be against those ideas.
When a religion has them in its doctrine

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,773
and for the billionth time,
this doesn't mean you should be bigoted 

47
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,363
against all people who practice that 
faith because there are a multitude of 

48
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:55,500
ways of being part of any faith.
What it does mean however,

49
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,334
is that at the very least,
you must be against the ideas that you 

50
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,700
would be against if they came from 
anywhere else besides religion.

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,983
Actually,
you should be much braver than just 

52
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,534
being against bad ideas.
You should impact stand for good ideas 

53
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,670
or one day the violence you silently 
condone will be at your doorstep.

54
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,180
This is why the regressive left is so 
dangerous.

55
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,014
They've tricked decent people with good 
intentions into thinking that they're 

56
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,430
legitimate fears about terrorism or 
somehow bigoted or racist.

57
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,773
Not only is this pure nonsense,
but he has also fueled the rise of the 

58
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,410
right wing parties in Europe and Donald 
Trump here in America.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,573
The ideas of the regressive left have 
gone from wrong to malicious screaming 

60
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,830
about the crusades.
Every time there is a jihadist attack is

61
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,693
pointless.
Focusing on one random atheist who 

62
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,930
committed a mass shooting is irrelevant.
These regressives or trying to guilt and

63
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,050
confuse you into accepting their 
backwards thinking.

64
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,483
We in the west,
fortunately can't stand up to jihadist 

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,430
face to face,
but we absolutely must stand up to those

66
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,264
in our own societies who will excuse 
people who would kill us due to their 

67
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:11,050
misguided sense of protecting a 
religion.

68
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,363
Ironically,
this disease of the mind which 

69
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,274
regressive thinking really is,
is the furthest thing from progressive 

70
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:19,564
values,
but also is an added bonus for the 

71
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:22,714
jihadists.
They can kill scores of people and then 

72
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,624
their Western allies will do mental 
gymnastics to excuse and explain why 

73
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,810
they did it.
The more that jihad is,

74
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,644
say it's about religion,
the more the regressive say it isn't 

75
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,570
generally I find jihadists to be more 
honest than regressive,

76
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:42,880
so I'm going to take their word for it.
The world is at a precarious point.

77
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,743
We can debate how much foreign policy is
enabled jihadists or whether America's 

78
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,710
toppling of Saddam Hussein led to Isis.
Of course,

79
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,544
we can go much further back in history 
to the British empire or the Ottoman 

80
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,743
Empire even further.
These blood feuds have gone on for 

81
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:02,140
thousands of years and will probably go 
on until after we're all gone.

82
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,333
The question is,
will we in western societies now stand 

83
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,610
together and no longer accept excuses 
for terror?

84
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,890
If you feel the need to make an excuse 
when a bomb goes off in a Paris theater,

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,980
you're inviting terrorism to your 
farmer's market.

86
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,814
In Los Angeles,
people will always have a grievance and 

87
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,204
if you tell them that it's an acceptable
to murder innocent because of your 

88
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:28,570
western guilt or misguided sense of 
justice,

89
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,680
then you are condemning yourself to a 
world where there are no rules.

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,030
We will all live between terrorists 
trying to kill us and Authoritarians who

91
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,880
will promise us safety.
It's a false choice,

92
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,750
but it's exactly where we are headed.
If good people won't stand up.

93
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,584
Now,
I'm not sure how many jihadists watched 

94
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:48,490
the show,
but I'm pretty sure many good and decent

95
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:53,491
people do start calling out this 
regressive thinking in your own world,

96
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:57,770
stopping being cowed by false cries of 
racism or bigotry.

97
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:02,771
Start beating their self flagellation 
with the truth about why Western society

98
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,314
is good.

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,080
The Islam is earned bed with liars and 
regressive conmen.

100
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,230
Their ideas will spread faster.
If we don't wake up now and if you think

101
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,510
this is a job for someone else,
then this evil alliance has already won.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,710
I don't think it has,
but I know we need more vocal allies.

103
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,250
One such ally is my guest this week,
Julie Lunars,

104
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,080
Julie's a terrorism expert and director 
of the Human Security Center in London.

105
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,060
She's on the front lines of calling out 
radical Islam for the danger that it is.

106
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,283
I'm looking forward to talking to her 
about some difficult topics and maybe 

107
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,690
I'll even ask her about those pesky 
crusade.

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,333
Remember,
if you're still upset about the 

109
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,360
Crusades,
which happened a thousand years ago,

110
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,380
then you should be at least equally 
upset about the ones happening.

111
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:54,820
Right now.
Julie Lynn,

112
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:55,654
ours is the executive director of the 
Human Security Center and a principal 

113
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:03,100
consultant to the European Parliament 
intergroup on religious freedom.

114
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,600
Julie,
welcome to the show.

115
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,460
So good to beat him.

116
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,603
Uh,
I'm really excited to talk to you 

117
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:10,564
because I've been following you on 
twitter for probably three years or so 

118
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,183
and you've really been ahead of the 
curve on calling out Islamist extremist 

119
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,393
terror or Islamic extremists terror or 
jihadist terror or whatever phrase you 

120
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:27,520
want to use.
Y'All let you break down some phrases.

121
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,563
You've been ahead of it.
And one of the people that when I see 

122
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,110
with the things that you tweet,
I'm always like,

123
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,030
she gets it.
She understands it.

124
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,560
A.
So let's start.

125
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,540
What brought you to this spot?
How did you get involved in being one of

126
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,820
the people that studies this,
that talks about it,

127
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:43,750
that consulted about it?

128
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,120
When I read my first book on politics 
when I was 12,

129
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,120
and I know that probably makes me sound 
like a complete geek.

130
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,513
I read my first book on politics when I 
was 12 about the conflict in Ireland 

131
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,743
about Northern Ireland and I was 
interested in why people were healing 

132
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,813
for their belief and for their ideology.
And of course Ireland was more about 

133
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,350
national terrorism rather than religious
terrorism.

134
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:15,890
I mean there was a religious component 
in the sense that you have,

135
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,873
you had the IRA on the one hand that was
kept clinic and you had the Uda and the 

136
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:23,350
other power metallic power monetary,
um,

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,120
organizations that were Protestant or 
the other items.

138
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,360
But anyway,
I mean that's how I got interested in,

139
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,740
in conflict and white people were 
killing in holiness and people for their

140
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,010
beliefs.
And then two years later,

141
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:41,060
of course,
nine slash 11 happens and I report in at

142
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,690
the time I remember it,
acid acid was yesterday.

143
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,030
I wasn't in school that day.
I was at home.

144
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,860
I was ill,
I was sitting on the couch,

145
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,694
I was watching random television and 
suddenly this horrific images it pay it 

146
00:08:55,171 --> 00:09:00,150
on my screen and obviously my first 
reaction was this was a terrible,

147
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,520
terrible tragedy,
an accident.

148
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,700
But the moment,
the second plane hit the towers,

149
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,910
I think everybody knew that whatever it 
was and that the time,

150
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:13,060
obviously we were still lacking the 
rhetoric to describe what just happened.

151
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,933
I realized that this was a game changer,
that the world would never be the same 

152
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,730
again.
And that is true.

153
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:23,610
I mean the world was never the same 
again after 9:11

154
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,653
and an obviously Afghanistan happened in
Iraq happened and when we went into 

155
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,070
Iraq,
I was 16 at the time.

156
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,904
And I think that was really the moment I
would describe as my awakening in the 

157
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,720
sense that I realized we were not just 
fighting the enemy from the outside,

158
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,280
but also the enemy within.

159
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,353
And I'm not talking about the people who
post a wolf a perfectly legitimate 

160
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:51,300
reasons,
more everything's strategic reasons.

161
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,433
Um,
I'm talking about the people who 

162
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:54,803
hijacked the antiwar movement and who 
were happy to call George George W dot 

163
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,514
Bush and Tony Blair war criminals,
while at the same time turning around 

164
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:08,130
and embracing people.
I come as a terrorist organization,

165
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,143
had prejudice genocide against the Jews 
and people like George Galloway who was 

166
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:13,854
on record praising Saddam Hussein,
some courage strings in project 

167
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,690
finishes.
And that was the moment when I realized,

168
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,993
guys,
we really have a problem and we need to 

169
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:25,014
talk about this.

170
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,943
Yeah.
So I really want to dive into that 

171
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,460
because it's a,
it's so related to everything we've been

172
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,940
talking about here,
this sort of moral confusion that people

173
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:33,774
seem to have in a lot of it 
unfortunately does seem to be on the 

174
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:39,120
left and the right's got plenty of moral
confusion itself.

175
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,170
Um,
but yeah,

176
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,370
we seem to see a lot of that.
I left.

177
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,413
That's interesting.
So because you were young around the 

178
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,800
time that nine slash 11 happened.
I'm a little older than you.

179
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,930
I was in.
I lived in New York City at the time and

180
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:49,764
of course I had studied politics before,
but of course it was a defining moment 

181
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,770
for me and for literally millions of 
people as well.

182
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,290
So the.
So all that happens.

183
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,460
And then when did you actually start 
working in this field and really sort of

184
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,850
talking about this publicly and making 
that your,

185
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:06,684
your life's work?

186
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,773
Well,
I actually started writing a personal 

187
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:15,731
blog at the time the war in Iraq 
happened and I talked about it a lot.

188
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:16,934
I mean that was the first thing I really
talked about publicly a lot about the 

189
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,040
reasons why.
Even though,

190
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,923
as I said before,
I always had great respect for the 

191
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:28,760
people who opposed the war for perfectly
legitimate reasons that I.

192
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,593
However,
there was also a more legitimate case 

193
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,300
for the wall.
I mean,

194
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,583
look at the torture chambers and the 
concentration camps and the genocide 

195
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,940
against the Kurds.
I think it was a,

196
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,340
a former Kaddish president who once said
that Iraq was a concentration camp above

197
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:49,070
ground,
above ground and a mass grave beneath.

198
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,160
And that was true.
It was one of the worst dictatorships on

199
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,023
earth and that's when I really got 
involved in this debate and was exposed 

200
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,324
to dwight a public and that was also the
time really when people started 

201
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,160
attacking me for my views.

202
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah.
So when,

203
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,810
when people talk to you about the Iraq 
war now,

204
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,780
I mean,
the meme in America is that,

205
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,663
you know,
had we not toppled George had George W 

206
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,320
had we not topple George W Bush,
George W Bush,

207
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,700
uh,
not,

208
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,623
not toppled Saddam,
that ultimately had we not gone into 

209
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:23,460
Iraq that,
that would have,

210
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,710
that isis wouldn't be here basically is 
the,

211
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,870
is the idea that,
and you know,

212
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,780
as I've talked to some experts in this,
a lot of people are saying,

213
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:31,614
well,
Saddam,

214
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,560
as you just said,
was doing some pretty horrific things.

215
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,603
So despite knowing now that there 
weren't weapons of mass destruction or 

216
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,550
at least that we never found them,
do you still in your mind,

217
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:45,270
do you feel that that what we did was 
still a moral case and what you guys did

218
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:46,320
as well?
And obviously,

219
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,460
uh,
you know,

220
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,780
Tony Blair had something to do with it.

221
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,850
Yes,
I still believe,

222
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:53,650
I still believe after everything that it
was right to,

223
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,883
to topple this regime and you know,
some of some of the things that people 

224
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:59,360
were saying,
why we shouldn't intervene,

225
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,194
like at least Saddam Hussein contains.
Iran for me really never was a moral 

226
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,730
argument.
You cannot contain one dictatorship with

227
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:10,470
a theocratic regime and vice versa.
And um,

228
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,540
for the curb it was a liberation.
I mean,

229
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,374
look at Kurdistan today,
Iraqi Kurdistan as a beacon of hope in 

230
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,780
the entire region.
And,

231
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,970
um,
I obviously,

232
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:25,800
I obviously I'm acknowledged that we did
something's terribly wrong,

233
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,634
which led to bloodshed and chaos.
The dismantling of the Iraqi army to 

234
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,780
debar certification.
All of the big things really,

235
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,700
um,
I think were catastrophic and I'm really

236
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:36,534
happy to admit that,
but it doesn't change the fact for me 

237
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,210
that this was a genocidal dictator.
I mean,

238
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,044
he committed a crime of all crimes.
Ninety five percent of Kurdish villages 

239
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,290
were exposed to chemical weapons during 
the DNF pumpkins pain.

240
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,770
And that is still the reason why I still
believe after everything,

241
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,000
that it was the right thing to do.

242
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,933
Yeah.
And that's not even to talk about what 

243
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,530
he was doing to dissidence and free 
thinkers and secular,

244
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,373
secularism,

245
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,420
all of them.
Yeah.

246
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,383
Yeah.
So tell me a little bit about the type 

247
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:11,040
of work that you do now.
What,

248
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,440
what's actually the base work that 
you're doing?

249
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,600
Well,
we do different things.

250
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:19,450
We work with the government,
a government,

251
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,060
of course we work with non governmental 
organizations.

252
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,550
We've worked with media,
we work with the public and we do public

253
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,290
outreach.
I'm.

254
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,153
One of the things that we currently 
doing is we're working with a European 

255
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,340
Parliament intergroup on religious 
freedom and um,

256
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,740
what,
what we're doing for them.

257
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,574
Basically it's a once a year we are 
looking at the worst violators of 

258
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,554
religious freedom across the world.
Everything is really old continent from 

259
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,330
Latin America to Asia to,
to um,

260
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,440
um,
to Africa.

261
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,700
And we,
we look at the sources of persecution,

262
00:14:55,701 --> 00:15:00,701
we look at why religious minorities in 
that particular country are targeted and

263
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,590
by whom they are targeted and what we 
can do to help these people.

264
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,430
Alright.
So who's doing most of the targeting?

265
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,771
Well,
first of all,

266
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:14,720
it,
it is a,

267
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,730
it is a phenomenon and affect all 
countries across all continents really.

268
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:24,660
And it also affects all religions.
Of course you have a,

269
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:25,800
you have,
for instance,

270
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,480
the brutal persecution of Muslims in 
Burma by Buddhist extremists.

271
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,343
And do you have the persecution of 
Muslims by Christian minutia and the 

272
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,990
Central African Republic or you have,
um,

273
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,720
you have the persecution of Christians 
by Hindu nationalists in India,

274
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,243
but the vast majority of religious 
persecution we see in the world today 

275
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,710
has some kind of relation to the 
religion of Islam,

276
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,760
whether it's by a state actor or a non 
state actor.

277
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,350
I had a feeling that's what you were 
going to say.

278
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:01,184
So because we're,
we're the good guys in this case and we 

279
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:07,190
try to separate people from ideas.
How do you guys,

280
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,260
when you're studying this and you're 
learning about this,

281
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,450
how do you separate what is done in the 
name of religion in the name of doctrine

282
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:18,140
versus just the geo political realities 
on the ground?

283
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,010
When I mean,
um,

284
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,111
we,
we looked,

285
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:24,944
for instance at,
at the law of the country and the 

286
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,644
constitution of the country and what you
will find at many of these countries is 

287
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,080
that the constitution in itself already 
discriminates against minorities.

288
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,900
So for instance,
the president of the country can only be

289
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:39,734
Muslim and um,
that is of course not just something 

290
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,214
that,
that is purely decided on religious 

291
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,760
grounds.
It's also a strategic decision,

292
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:50,880
right?
I mean they want to,

293
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,670
to,
to keep to themselves,

294
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,330
but then you also have completely 
irrational persecution of minorities who

295
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,560
can't do any harm whatsoever to the 
state because they are a tiny minorities

296
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,990
and they are deprived of all their 
rights.

297
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,213
And that is of course,
when it's no longer strategic and when 

298
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,470
it really comes down to religious 
doctrine.

299
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,550
And I'm talking for instance about the 
Ahmadiyya Muslims,

300
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,250
the values,
uh,

301
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,400
in,
in Sunni Muslim states often does she,

302
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:21,740
um,
again,

303
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,860
that is both related to religion.
Enter your politics are often,

304
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,694
it's also a mixture of both.
And it's very difficult to tell what it 

305
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,640
is for political or religious reasons 
that people are being persecuted.

306
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,030
But yeah,
I mean that definitely is a problem that

307
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:35,864
we have with religious inspired 
persecution of minorities in the Muslim 

308
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,134
world.

309
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,840
So I know you do a lot of work with and 
for the Kurds.

310
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,580
We've been talking a bit about the Kurds
here.

311
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:51,180
It's incredibly under reported,
especially in the states.

312
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,303
Um,
are they the best example of a 

313
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:58,080
persecuted minority because they're a 
minority in at least four countries.

314
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:58,914
They never got their state when the 
whole thing was carved up and they were 

315
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,040
basically treated incredibly poorly by 
Turkey,

316
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,180
Iraq,
Iran,

317
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,193
and Syria.
So are they really the best example for 

318
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,320
you when you were talking about this 
kind of stuff?

319
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,730
Well,
you know,

320
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,563
I was,
I was joking a couple of weeks ago that 

321
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:14,834
I should get myself a tee shirt saying I
supported the cats before it became 

322
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:19,154
fashionable because now be know a lot of
people talk about them and don't get me 

323
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:23,300
wrong,
I'm,

324
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,133
I'm really,
really pleased that people are finally 

325
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,803
giving them the attention and exposure 
that these wonderful and openminded and 

326
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:35,360
largely peaceful and brave people 
deserve.

327
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,050
And yes,
I,

328
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:37,884
I honestly believed that probably since 
the formation of the state of Israel in 

329
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:46,420
the 19 forties at what we're seeing with
the Kurds,

330
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,293
the struggle for self determination is 
probably the most promising democracy 

331
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,840
experiment in the Middle East because 
low had one,

332
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,200
the curts are doing,
I mean the Iraquis can,

333
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,063
if you,
if you take Iraqi Kurdistan as an 

334
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:01,214
example,
we're just a semi autonomous region and 

335
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,723
in the north of the country they have 
their own president and prime minister 

336
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:09,600
in Parliament and the passion of God,
which is we just eat the,

337
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,690
the army of off the Kurdistan region.

338
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,700
I mean they have taken hundreds of 
thousands of people from Syria,

339
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,540
from Iraq,
persecuted by the Islamic state,

340
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,374
hunted body outside regime,
including tens of thousands of 

341
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:28,550
Christians who otherwise would have been
slaughtered or at least enslaved.

342
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,880
They were able to celebrate Easter in 
safety and peace.

343
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,790
And it's not just that they are 
providing basic needs to these people.

344
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,624
They are going a step further.
They are actually trying to support the 

345
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:45,950
rights of religious minorities.
And last year,

346
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:46,784
the Kurdistan region of Iraq did 
something that I feel is absolutely 

347
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:51,164
unique and historic.
They decided to give to each of the 

348
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:55,964
minority minority communities,
religious minority communities in Iraqi 

349
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:03,650
Kurdistan,
the official representation.

350
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,870
So they all have their own 
representatives now and not just one.

351
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,190
It's not just the Muslims and the 
Christians.

352
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,143
No.
Also the Jews and the buys and to show 

353
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,743
that the shoebox and and Ahmadiyya 
Muslims were persecuted all across the 

354
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,180
Muslim world.
And you know,

355
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,673
these are not just token appointment.
These guys are really doing work that 

356
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,843
the first Jewish represented just comes 
back from a visit from Israel where he 

357
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:30,314
met with lawmakers and always trying to 
really find ways to build bridges 

358
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:34,784
between Israel and Kurdistan.
And this is absolutely unique in that 

359
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:39,044
region.
And it's fascinating if you think about 

360
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:45,620
the defect that just miles away from 
Erbil where the,

361
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,290
where the Kurdish parliament sets the 
stage is,

362
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,611
you know,
is,

363
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:52,930
is,
is in place.

364
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,823
And that is of course the most 
fundamental manifestation of radical 

365
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,104
Islam

366
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
had a few weeks ago who is the,
uh,

367
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,034
the Krg rep to the United States.
And we were talking about that border 

368
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,073
and how close everything is and it's 
really crazy because basically the 

369
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,470
Kurds,
the peshmerga,

370
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:20,471
they are fighting the isis on one side 
and then they're also fighting Turkey on

371
00:21:21,141 --> 00:21:23,420
the other side and Turkey as a NATO 
ally.

372
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,610
Can you explain a little bit of the 
complexity there?

373
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:26,444
Because it's really complex because 
there are also Kurds in Turkey and they 

374
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:32,330
have a political party and they're 
trying to negotiate with Turkey.

375
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,830
It doesn't sound like it's going that 
well.

376
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,013
Yep.
You have to make a distinction between 

377
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,360
the Kurds in Iraq and the cat's in 
theory.

378
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:40,194
I ended up the text and the cuts and 
Turkey and the cuts and in Iran because 

379
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:49,341
they all have different goals and they 
all have different relationships with.

380
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:50,914
With Turkey as well.
The relationship between the Kurdistan 

381
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:56,910
region of Iraq with Turkey is actually 
not that bad.

382
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,093
It's a.
it's the problem with the PK K in in 

383
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:05,610
Turkey,
that is in for many years now.

384
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,473
I'm trapped in a brutal conflict with 
the Turkey stage and of course the PKK 

385
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,293
is allied to the GPJ in Syria,
which now controls almost the entire 

386
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:21,531
border with Turkey and Turkey is bonding
the Kurds,

387
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,203
the same people we are working with,
the US is working with to find Islamic 

388
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:28,464
state.
So what we actually seeing is that the 

389
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:33,810
US net coalition is at war with itself.

390
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,611
Yeah.
So what,

391
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:35,444
what is that?
Because it seems like this is now an 

392
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,363
open secret that this is happening.
The Kurds are fighting isis on the 

393
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:42,414
ground.
They're basically the only fighting 

394
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:47,850
force on the ground fighting Isis and 
Turkey is bombing them.

395
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,800
And we are a NATO ally with Turkey.
So how is this secret being allowed?

396
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,023
It's being,
it's out and we're not doing anything 

397
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:55,750
about it.

398
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,190
Well,
what Europe needs the cooperation of the

399
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,320
Turkish state because of the refugee 
crisis,

400
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,333
right?
Turkey in many ways from the gateway 

401
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,763
from Syria to Europe.
And they need to go on to play a play 

402
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:09,474
along.
And that is one of the reasons why so 

403
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:13,170
many governments in Europe,
uh,

404
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,033
hesitant to criticize the Turkish 
government for the way they're treating 

405
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,200
the cuts both in own country and also in
theory.

406
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,900
So Turkey basically is having their cake
and eating it too,

407
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,840
and that they're letting the fighters in
through Europe,

408
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,010
right?
They come from Europe,

409
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:30,844
they go through Turkey,
they go in and then Turkey is then 

410
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:36,450
bombing the Kurds because they're not 
thrilled with the Kurds.

411
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:37,284
So it's good for them.
And then we have to play ball with them 

412
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,040
because they're also the buffer zone.
So it really,

413
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:42,874
that's like one of those cases where you
can really see how complex this stuff 

414
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,124
is.

415
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,013
Yeah,
I mean basically what do you can say is 

416
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:52,810
that Turkey is more afraid of a Kurdish 
stage than it is Islamic stage.

417
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,910
And that's exactly.
I mean,

418
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:59,500
if you look at that policy and the way 
they react in the region,

419
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,430
I think that that's crystal clear.
And we,

420
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,430
we,
we can't,

421
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:05,650
uh,
we can't really deny that.

422
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,270
And I personally agree with you that 
it's,

423
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,123
it's absolutely shameful that a NATO 
partner is bonding with the group of 

424
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:19,810
people that is most efficient in 
fighting the Islamic state.

425
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,793
Now,
I'm not condemning by any means the 

426
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:25,580
terrorist attacks that we've seen in 
Turkey by the PKK.

427
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,430
No,
no.

428
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,890
Terrorism is ever justified against 
anyone.

429
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,350
I,
I con I rejected when you some extent is

430
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:33,184
doing that.
I rejected when the IRA was doing that 

431
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:37,810
in Northern Ireland.
I rejected when the PKK is doing that in

432
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:38,644
Turkey,
but it's more complex than just the PKK 

433
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,064
and the Turkeys state.
I mean this goes way beyond Turkey just 

434
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,723
taking action against the PKK.
They're really using this to sort of 

435
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:55,621
justify an entire crackdown on,
on the Kurds within Turkey and the Kurds

436
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,734
in Syria.
And this basically goes hunting it hand 

437
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:01,880
in hand with an increased all three,
um,

438
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,773
authoritarianism inside Turkey.
If you look at the crackdown on the 

439
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:08,530
media,
free speech activists,

440
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,120
this all goes hand in hand.
It's not just the,

441
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,350
the cuts that being targeted,
it's freethinkers.

442
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,260
Everybody you to criticize President 
Erdogan.

443
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,213
Yeah.
So I want to back up to something that 

444
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:20,614
you said about the Kurds a moment ago 
that they've sent a representative to 

445
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:27,100
Israel and I know that there is 
supposedly some other sort of behind the

446
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:32,050
scenes relationships there,
but does that sort of proved that at the

447
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,210
end of the day,
regardless of what religion people are,

448
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,120
uh,
that really that having sort of the base

449
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:40,450
human freedom and respect for minorities
and things like that,

450
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,660
that that's what will make these 
countries succeed or fail.

451
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:44,494
It's not a coincidence that the 
countries that seem to fail are the 

452
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,004
least tolerant.
So that's a relationship that should be 

453
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:51,520
nurtured further.
Right?

454
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,580
Well,
absolutely.

455
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:56,220
And uh,
I think what would you say is absolutely

456
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,054
true.
The cut are the best example because 

457
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,070
let's not forget they are Muslims.
The vast majority of are Muslims and yet

458
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:05,184
they practice and if not that is 
inclusive and respectful to other 

459
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:12,300
people.
And it is possible.

460
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:15,840
It's not,
it's not mutually exclusive to be Muslim

461
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,700
as,
as a person and be,

462
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,534
be open minded towards others.
And the coke have a long standing 

463
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:25,710
history and culture of tolerance and 
peaceful coexistence.

464
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:26,730
So in,
in that way,

465
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:29,740
yes,
the kids really are the best example and

466
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:34,741
the beacon of hope and a region that is 
otherwise drowning in blood and,

467
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,450
and,
and my mom,

468
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,370
right.
And it also,

469
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,460
it's a beautiful thing because it shows 
that religions can,

470
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,760
don't always have to be their extremist 
parts,

471
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,580
uh,
and that they're using street.

472
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,423
There are strategic reasons in that area
that they might want to partner up with 

473
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:53,880
Israel and things.
So it gets the religion out of it and it

474
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,860
gets some of the Geo politics out of it.

475
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,623
Yes.
And it's quite interesting if you go to 

476
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:03,070
Kurdistan and he talked to two people 
about Israel and about America,

477
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,233
you don't get this hostility that you 
get in many Arab countries where they 

478
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,420
perceive and Israel and America is the 
worst of everything.

479
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,583
And now we got,
you get a very different attitude in 

480
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:19,360
Kurdistan where they are looking at 
Israel and looking at American.

481
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,490
They're looking at our science and 
technology.

482
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,380
You know,
leave aside politics for a moment,

483
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:24,970
look and everything else,
you know,

484
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,730
the lutheranism that we have,
the freedoms that we have,

485
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,800
freedom of speech to everybody,
you know,

486
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:33,070
has the right to do whatever they say in
what they admire,

487
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:36,070
that they inspire,
they inspire to be like us,

488
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,800
not in the sense that they were giving 
up their own culture,

489
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,083
but having an open minded view of the 
world that is compatible with the 21st 

490
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,803
century.

491
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,860
Yeah.
Alright.

492
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,450
So let's shift we,
I mean,

493
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,284
we could spend,
so it's so complex that we could spend 

494
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:52,624
the rest of the hour talking about it,
but let's shift to some of the other 

495
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:55,924
stuff going on right now.
So obviously there was the attack in 

496
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:01,810
Brussels last week,
just a few days ago.

497
00:28:01,811 --> 00:28:02,644
There was the attack in Pakistan.
It seems to me that these things are 

498
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:11,560
starting to become more frequent and 
there's just a feeling that now,

499
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,533
you know,
I saw something this week that they're 

500
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:18,421
saying that there's probably 400 isis 
operatives in Europe ready to partake in

501
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:22,330
whatever the next event is going to be.
Um,

502
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:25,400
so can you just break down Brussels a 
little bit because I know for,

503
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,690
for weeks before people were saying this
was about to happen.

504
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,853
Uh,
so they obviously had good intelligence 

505
00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:34,240
and it still happened and I think that's
what the really scary part is.

506
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,580
Yes.
I mean obviously what happened in Russia

507
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,540
is absolutely horrific,
but it was not up to me at least,

508
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,590
it was not a surprise,
you know,

509
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,773
it was coming.
We knew that and you were just saying 

510
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:53,130
that obviously we had good intelligence.
Well you have to distinguish the Abbott,

511
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,450
but because obviously the Belgian 
authorities didn't have the intelligence

512
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:58,284
that they were supposed to be having.
And that is a problem that people like 

513
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,154
myself who have raised for quite a long 
time now that the very weak nature of 

514
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:07,920
the Belgian state.
I mean,

515
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,754
it's sometimes even problematic to speak
of Belgium as a state because it's so 

516
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,750
torn apart in eternity.
And the state of the Belgian,

517
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:19,794
um,
secret services and intelligence 

518
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,000
services,
they are inequipped.

519
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,883
They are massively undecided and they 
simply don't have the resources to 

520
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,903
monitor all the people that they're 
actually supposed to be monitoring 

521
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:38,030
because let's not forget that Belgium 
has the highest percentage per capita of

522
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:43,690
foreign fighters do some estate in the 
entire European Union and it's no,

523
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:44,524
it's no coincidence that these people 
have chosen Belgium as a place where 

524
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:49,684
they can gather and plan and carry out a
text because of course there are well 

525
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:59,050
aware of all these weaknesses that I've 
just missed it and you know,

526
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:04,051
by failing their own people,
Belgium is putting everyone else at risk

527
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,290
because obviously these people do not 
appreciate nation states.

528
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,030
You know,
someone in France,

529
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,903
someone in Germany or the UK.
It's just as much an enemy to these 

530
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:19,060
people as the people of Belgium and it 
can openly cross borders.

531
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:21,390
I mean we have,
we still have the Schengen area in,

532
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,224
in Europe where people can cross borders
without showing that passport or a new 

533
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:26,554
form of identification.
And that's why we're seeing the 

534
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:29,854
terrorism that we see.
And that's also why we see a network 

535
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:35,350
really spamming from.
From Paris to Belgium.

536
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,184
And this was the first time ever that 
one terrorist cell managed to attack to 

537
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,810
European capitals?

538
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,240
Yeah.
Did you hear any?

539
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,074
I saw a story that I saw in one place 
and then I didn't see a picked up 

540
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:51,570
anywhere else.
So if this is not true,

541
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:54,450
please stop me.
But I heard that when they were going to

542
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:57,090
arrest the guy in Belgium just a week 
ago,

543
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,253
that apparently that in his community 
that about 200 people we're trying to 

544
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:02,544
stop the police and the anti terror 
people from arresting and they were 

545
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,250
throwing bottles at the police and all 
kinds of stuff.

546
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,460
Did you hear about that and is it being 
reported in Europe at all?

547
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,340
I heard about that as well.
I think some media outlets reported that

548
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:20,450
there were riots taking place when they 
arrested him and to be honest,

549
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,443
it's not surprising to me at all because
you have to understand these people 

550
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:25,814
don't work in isolation.
They are embedded in communities and if 

551
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:29,744
you look at these notorious 
neighborhoods like molenbeek and 

552
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,893
mountain,
it's not just the terrorists that are 

553
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:37,064
the problem.
It's the wider society in which they 

554
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,664
live who may be on not jihad this 
themselves and who not engaged in 

555
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:48,440
violence themselves,
but who are at least to a certain degree

556
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:49,274
described to the Islamist ideology,
which brings me to the overall problem 

557
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,074
really that it's not good enough to say 
this is just a problem with a fringe 

558
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,670
because yes,
there there is only a tiny minority that

559
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:02,504
carries out violent attacks,
but there is a lot of minority that 

560
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:11,900
subscribed to the Islamic world view and
an even larger minority,

561
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:12,734
a significant minority that practices 
conservative Islam that is not 

562
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,973
compatible with the modern world and we 
are not talking a few hundred or a few 

563
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:26,990
thousand people.
Here we are talking millions and even if

564
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:31,760
you say that just one percent of all 
Muslims in the world.

565
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,033
Do you hot it?
We are talking about 15 or 16 million 

566
00:32:36,261 --> 00:32:37,094
people.
I mean wrap your hand around for a 

567
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,304
moment.

568
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,673
Yeah,
no,

569
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,553
it's incredible.
And I know that many people like Sam 

570
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,023
Harris,
who I've had on this show have gone out 

571
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:47,644
of their way to talk about these 
concentric circles and you have the 

572
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:51,634
nominal people who don't necessarily 
care about religion or following 

573
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:58,210
doctrine,
and then it sort of extends outward from

574
00:32:58,211 --> 00:32:59,330
that.
So what do,

575
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,193
what do we do with that?
Because this is where the conversation 

576
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,094
gets difficult.
So you've obviously just laid out there 

577
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:08,080
that you don't think all Muslims are 
doing this,

578
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,660
but you do see a certain amount of 
problems.

579
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:13,180
A certain amount of people are going to 
use violence.

580
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,300
A certain amount of people are going to 
condone that violence.

581
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,313
A certain amount of people are gonna see
it brewing in their communities and not 

582
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,970
do anything.
And then it just keeps.

583
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,250
It's like an onion.
There's just more and more layers.

584
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,080
So how do we in the West combat that 
because we're fighting,

585
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,270
we're fighting the people,
we're fighting them,

586
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,104
and then we're fighting the people on 
our left who are trying to silence us 

587
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:35,350
from talking about it.

588
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,463
One good example,
it's your show really because you equip 

589
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:46,180
people with the rhetoric to to engage in
just daily live in these debates as well

590
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:49,540
and to make the distinction between the 
religion of Islam,

591
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,374
which is a set of eaves and Islamism,
which is an ideology which partly 

592
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:59,941
derived from a particular interpretation
of the religion and jihadism,

593
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:03,790
which Dennis sort of the violent 
extension of Islam Islam.

594
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,624
So I think that's first of all a 
distinction that's very important to me 

595
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,160
because it also makes it easier for 
people like ourselves to reject,

596
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,323
you know,
charges of racism and bigotry and 

597
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:16,710
Islamophobia

598
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,843
doesn't get exhausted by making the 
distinction though because it almost 

599
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:23,620
doesn't win you any friends on the left 
because that's how I feel.

600
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,060
But I'll continue to do it.

601
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,703
Exactly.
I mean I don't really have another 

602
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:28,591
choice.
Right.

603
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:31,010
I mean the other option would be to,
to,

604
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,760
to join Don Donald Trump's camp and just
generalize and stigmatize or Muslims and

605
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,890
that's really not what I want to see 
mean.

606
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,003
That is precisely why I'm not a bigger,
that's a race because I don't want to 

607
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:46,860
engage in these generalizations and 
sweeping statements and brushing every,

608
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,743
everyone over the same Ta.
I don't want to do that and that is why 

609
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,374
I keep explaining to people there is a 
difference between a religion and Islam 

610
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:56,784
is a religion like any other religion.
It is a set of beliefs and we should 

611
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:01,554
have the right to criticize particular 
beliefs within the faith if they are 

612
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:07,344
harmful and incompatible with modern way
of life and it was sometimes called 

613
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,343
sometimes called Islam the virgin 
amongst faith because you are not 

614
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:21,180
allowed to touch it.
You are not allowed to touch virgin.

615
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,193
They are happy to discuss with you 
gender inequality when it comes to 

616
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:26,454
Orthodox Judaism and they are quite 
happy to discuss with you bigoted views 

617
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,570
on the fundamentalist.
Christian write about abortion and women

618
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:34,450
and gay.

619
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,530
Don't forget about the crusades,
the Crusades,

620
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,893
what I say all the time,
but don't forget what we did 200 years 

621
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,573
ago.
Know they talk about the persecution of 

622
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:49,600
Muslims in Burma by,
by Buddhist extremists and they're not.

623
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,713
They don't hesitate to call them 
extremists and make the religion and 

624
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,400
the,
the,

625
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,270
the,
the link to the religion of Buddhism.

626
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,140
But when it comes to Islam,
it's off topic.

627
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,890
You are not allowed to touch Islam.
The moment you touch Islam,

628
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,783
you're a bigot.
You're a racist no matter what 

629
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:11,040
distinction you're making between the 
religion and ideology and m and g,

630
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,300
how does him.
You're a racist that very moment.

631
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,310
You want to talk about Islam?

632
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,323
Yeah.
So basically you'll continue to make 

633
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:20,930
this distinction because we sort of have
no choice.

634
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:21,764
I mean,
that's how,

635
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,723
that's how I feel too,
because I don't want to hand it to the 

636
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,663
far right.
But that's a good segue to a lot of 

637
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:29,960
what's happening in Europe right now.
So you mentioned earlier that because of

638
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,930
the European Union,
uh,

639
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,620
you know,
that they're,

640
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,970
the people don't have to use passports 
to go all over the place.

641
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,440
So this is why the ideology can spread 
and it's white people can,

642
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,810
can go from Paris to Brussels.
Um,

643
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,940
so two questions here.
One is people seem to want.

644
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,970
There's a certain amount of people that 
want to break up the EU altogether.

645
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,880
Uh,
and secondly,

646
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,680
I want to talk about immigration as a 
whole.

647
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,300
So why don't we start with the first 
one?

648
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,670
Why don't we see that there is a debate 
going on everywhere in Europe about open

649
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:02,564
borders because many people feel like 
I'm no longer an asset and rather I'm 

650
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,240
aiding those people that we are trying 
to contain.

651
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,980
I mean,
I always,

652
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,814
as a European myself,
I always felt it was great and I could 

653
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,950
just cross the border.
When I lived in Germany,

654
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:19,784
I thought it was great,
just crossed the border into the 

655
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:25,160
Netherlands or Belgium or France without
having to show my passport.

656
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:25,994
It's great.
But the problem is if you have a system 

657
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:29,504
like open borders,
you also need adequate security to back 

658
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:33,614
this up.
And what the Belgium example shows you 

659
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:41,651
is that right now we are not having the 
security apparatus that can safeguard us

660
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,753
was having open boarders because Belgium
is failing to contain the threat and 

661
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:52,730
that's what they are doing and have been
doing for a long time.

662
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,600
And these people can travel freely 
across the entire European Union.

663
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,660
It's a little different with the UK 
because you have to cross some water and

664
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,494
it's more complex,
but into France or Germany or the 

665
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:05,430
Netherlands,
then we all have,

666
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,610
we're having a problem and we have to 
talk about it.

667
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,653
And I'm not even,
I'm not very partisan when it comes to 

668
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,414
dessert and tie a yes EU until bud bay.
But I do think that we have to honestly 

669
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:20,210
talk about the now your abilities of 
open borders at the moment.

670
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,020
And that is true for terrorists as much 
as it is for refugees.

671
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,963
Do you know,
is the vetting process for the migrants 

672
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,880
and the immigrants,
is it the same in each country?

673
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:33,520
Because if they're all,
let's say they're coming through Greece,

674
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,470
if Greece has more,
uh,

675
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,250
processes by which they can get in.
Well then if you,

676
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,560
once you're in Greece,
if you can then get anywhere in Europe,

677
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,573
I could see why you would be pretty 
pissed if you were in France and Greece 

678
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,000
had lead lacks,
uh,

679
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,540
you know,
ways to get people in.

680
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,130
Well,
the truth is that all of these countries

681
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:53,964
are actually overwhelmed.
They cannot process all these people in 

682
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,070
time that,
that day arriving.

683
00:38:59,071 --> 00:38:59,904
And the truth is also that many of them 
are just throwing away their papers so 

684
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:05,400
you have no way to even,
uh,

685
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:06,800
you know,
check who they are,

686
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,643
where they're coming from,
and the truth they thought so that many 

687
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:11,154
of them actually not coming from Syria.
They also coming from countries like 

688
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:14,604
Afghanistan and Eritrea.
And I feel like the biggest problem at 

689
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:21,840
the moment is that we are only treating 
the symptoms.

690
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:25,980
We are not treating the root cause 
because what is the plan for Eritrea?

691
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,533
Nobody's talking about Eritrea.
What are we going to do about the 

692
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,313
situation in,
in Eritrea to make sure that not more 

693
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:33,504
people that coming.
I mean we have to look at these 

694
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,084
countries and the situation in these 
countries and we have to ask ourselves 

695
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:39,714
what can we do to change the situation 
on the ground and to have people within 

696
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:44,130
their own region.

697
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,450
Because the truth is that even a notch 
country like Germany,

698
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:53,451
a welcoming country like Germany cannot 
take in all the people that need help.

699
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,070
And how would you explain to someone 
from Libya that yes,

700
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:03,780
we are taking in people from Syria and 
Eritrea and Afghanistan,

701
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,010
but no,
you Olivia,

702
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,770
please stay away.
We can't discriminate there.

703
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,500
And the truth is that we cannot take in 
all these people.

704
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,650
And my fear is that uncle amber sent a 
very dangerous message in the sense that

705
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,580
people now believe everybody can come.
And we,

706
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,100
if you look at the situation in Germany 
at the moment,

707
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,413
you see they're already struggling.
I know that the government is not 

708
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:28,404
willing to admit that,
but if you look at the situation on the 

709
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,340
ground,
they are really,

710
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:33,174
really struggling.
And the opposition within even her own 

711
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,170
party is growing by the day.

712
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,273
Yeah.
So this is an example where when I hear 

713
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,070
this,
I always say,

714
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:44,904
well,
the road to hell is paved with good 

715
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:47,560
intentions.
So Angela Merkel,

716
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:52,560
her intentions by bringing these people 
in where to help immigrants,

717
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:53,610
right?
Help migrants,

718
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:56,790
helped people that needed help integrate
them into society.

719
00:40:56,791 --> 00:41:01,440
Obviously Germany has a long history of 
xenophobia and and the Holocaust,

720
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:03,480
so they were trying to do the right 
thing.

721
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:04,350
I don't think,
you know,

722
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,203
I talked to people who think that she 
maliciously is trying to destroy the 

723
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:08,100
country.
I,

724
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,933
I don't quite think it's that.
I think she was trying to do something 

725
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:11,664
good here,
but then because of I guess the 

726
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,403
questionable the vetting process or just
allowing too many people and these 

727
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:20,640
people come in and then the system just 
can't take it.

728
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,030
And then when people in other countries 
see what's happening in Germany,

729
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:24,864
they don't want it happening there.
So this whole thing is just has just 

730
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:32,280
snowballed and it is it too late?
Have we already left this?

731
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,114
That the only will be that far right?
Parties are going to win throughout 

732
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:37,094
Europe.

733
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,771
What,
first of all,

734
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:42,230
I agree with you that I don't think 
there's an eba master plan of,

735
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,280
of Angola to destroy Germany or to 
Europe Union.

736
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,213
I don't believe that.
I believe for whatever reason she 

737
00:41:49,151 --> 00:41:51,850
believed that if the right thing to do 
the problem is.

738
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:52,684
I recently spoke to friends of mine who 
sits in the German parliament for her 

739
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:57,154
party for the video and he said even now
we have still not having a discussion 

740
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:03,580
about quota,
you know,

741
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:04,930
there,
there is no end to this,

742
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,350
that even the people within her own 
party don't know where it stops.

743
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:13,810
And that of course gives people like the
far right in Germany and we see,

744
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:16,970
you know,
the piggy to movement and we see the,

745
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,210
what is called the alternative for 
Germany.

746
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,313
These people are really gaining support 
and really gaining ground and these are 

747
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,800
of course not the people that we wanted 
to handle the beat over to.

748
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,560
And I know that there are people who 
tried remain to sti movements like piggy

749
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,550
die and say,
Oh,

750
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,384
you know,
they are just concerned citizen to take 

751
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:39,280
to the streets and exercise their right 
to free speech.

752
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,320
But you know,
I,

753
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,153
I'm quite familiar with DNRC seed in 
Gemini and I looked at footage from 

754
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:45,964
Pegida demonstrations and do you see 
very well known people from the Neo 

755
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,130
Nazis taking part in these 
demonstrations?

756
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,320
And I'm not a fan of guilty by 
association.

757
00:42:56,321 --> 00:42:57,154
I mean,
you cannot always control who comes to 

758
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,450
your demonstration.
Sure.

759
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,110
But it was fun.
I mean this guy gave an interview to one

760
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:02,944
of,
of Germany's a well known political 

761
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:08,350
magazines and very openly admitted that 
the NPD,

762
00:43:08,351 --> 00:43:10,480
which is the Neo Nazi party in the 
country,

763
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,630
helped begin to organize this particular
demonstration in the east of Germany.

764
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:19,324
So you see already,
you know the lines blurring between the 

765
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:24,610
populist.
Right.

766
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,790
And really the,
the extreme extreme,

767
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:28,220
right?

768
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,400
Yeah.
I'm curious little,

769
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:33,380
let's dig into Paquita a little bit more
because I had Tommy Robinson on the show

770
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,140
and you know,
a lot of people were very angry at me.

771
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:39,440
I got a lot of hate mail for,
for even just talking to the guy now.

772
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:42,170
I think in the context of the hour of 
our conversation,

773
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,243
he did basically make the distinction 
between ideas and people and all of 

774
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,770
those things.
And after the interview,

775
00:43:48,771 --> 00:43:49,604
which I thought was pretty fruitful,
people did send me tweets that he sent 

776
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:53,294
out years before where he was talking 
about all Muslims and there clearly was 

777
00:43:57,021 --> 00:44:01,160
an element of bigotry to it.
I can't vet my guests tweets from,

778
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,650
from five years ago unfortunately.
Um,

779
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,513
but what,
what do you make of someone like him 

780
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,330
that I think,
from what I can tell,

781
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,613
he's trying to make the distinction.
He and I know he's left organizations 

782
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,050
when it's gone too far.
Right.

783
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,540
Or when they were bigoted against black 
people.

784
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,593
Um,
I guess that just shows the complexity 

785
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:21,260
of this,
that these organizations,

786
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,820
they have all kinds of people in them.

787
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,730
Yeah,
I mean Tommy Robinson is a,

788
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:27,960
is a very,
um,

789
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,993
tricky.
I don't want to dive too much into this 

790
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,124
because to be fair,
I'm not familiar with every everything 

791
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:36,180
that he's doing at the moment.
I mean,

792
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:38,160
I,
I what I know is because I,

793
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,263
uh,
we worked with Quilliam as well and I 

794
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:40,944
know Martina was,
that he was really trying to get him 

795
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:47,871
away from the edl and at least making an
attempt to engage with him and explained

796
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,250
to him the difference between,
you know,

797
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,143
the religion of Islam,
which is a set of leave and Islam as an 

798
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,210
ideology and Muslims as people and Islam
as,

799
00:44:57,211 --> 00:45:00,120
as a system of beliefs.
And I think to some extent,

800
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,400
if you're listening to what he's saying 
now,

801
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,020
he has definitely made some progress,
but I don't,

802
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,420
I don't want to,
uh,

803
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,850
I don't want to,
um,

804
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,743
sort of approve of everything that he 
says because I still believe that some 

805
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:16,200
of the views that he holds a problematic
to say the least.

806
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,260
And for instances,
involvement,

807
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,094
movement and the pig Edo movement,
that is something that I do not approve 

808
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:24,060
off and I do not believe that piggy,
that isn't legitimate political.

809
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,490
Well,
it,

810
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,323
it legitimate in the sense that these 
people have the right to speak their 

811
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:28,700
minds,
um,

812
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:33,060
but not legitimate in the sense that I 
would ever support their views.

813
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,073
Sure.
And that's why I wanted to have him on 

814
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,444
the show because I can't figure out what
someone thinks unless I talked to them 

815
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,920
and maybe he secretly was harboring 
ideas that he didn't allow me to hear.

816
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,983
Um,
but I think we got a little closer to 

817
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:47,670
the truth maybe by talking to him.
I'm curious,

818
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:49,980
you brought up my jacket and my jade is 
a,

819
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,320
has been on the show and we've become 
friendly.

820
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,920
Do you think his job here is the 
hardest,

821
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,783
do you think it's much harder than what 
I'm doing or what you are doing or what 

822
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:00,324
Tommy's doing because he's trying to 
reform the religion from the inside and 

823
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:05,454
I see the most hate and the worst things
that people on the left white people on 

824
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:15,591
the left in America say about Majid,
a brown Muslim man from Egypt.

825
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,020
Uh,
so he's getting the worst from everybody

826
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:20,730
I think is his job the toughest?

827
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:22,431
Yeah,
I mean,

828
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:24,590
I,
I don't envy invite by any means.

829
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:27,350
I mean I get a lot of hate mail and all 
of that,

830
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:30,860
but that is nothing compared to a,
to what he goes through.

831
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,190
And if you look at some of the things 
that people say to him,

832
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,413
you know,
you and I would never get away with 

833
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:37,670
things.
Some,

834
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,580
something similar to,
to the Brown men.

835
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,610
I mean we would rightly called a racist 
and a bigot and a and in a summer job.

836
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,340
So I write hugely admire what he's 
trying to do.

837
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,510
And obviously there are two types of 
people that I admire enormously.

838
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,261
You have,
on the one hand,

839
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:55,094
you have people that are in Hirsi Ali 
who's left her faith and it's now 

840
00:46:57,921 --> 00:46:58,754
campaigning really for people to have 
the right to leave Islam and to 

841
00:47:02,331 --> 00:47:06,220
criticize the religion and then you have
people like Margaret who's obviously had

842
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,063
a change of heart,
but it's still a Muslim and he wants to 

843
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:13,580
reform his faith from inside and you 
know,

844
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,453
these are probably one of the most 
important people at the moment that we 

845
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:21,014
should support and align ourselves with 
because let's be under no illusion 

846
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:25,604
whatsoever.

847
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,473
We cannot win this fight without the 
support and the friendship with people 

848
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,730
from inside the community.
We need Muslim leaders.

849
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:41,731
We need Muslims themselves within within
their communities to speak up for a,

850
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,580
for a form of Islam that is compatible 
with the modern world.

851
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,623
And we see basically we see,
we see similar things happening in 

852
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,410
Jordan and Egypt were President Sisi and
King Abdullah.

853
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,770
I now finally,
you know,

854
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:54,604
finding the words to address some of 
these problems and that is hugely 

855
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,010
important.
Whatever else you may be.

856
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:00,844
Think about what President Sisi is doing
to journalists and to he human rights 

857
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,460
activists and I certainly don't approve 
of that,

858
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,670
but I think he plays an important role 
in fighting Islamic extremism.

859
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,660
Yeah.
So that again,

860
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,533
that goes to the precarious position 
that people that really care for human 

861
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:23,051
rights or put in so cc is doing terrible
things for human rights and minorities.

862
00:48:23,451 --> 00:48:24,284
And he's basically,
he's basically a military leader that 

863
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:29,040
took power by a coup after they had the,
you know,

864
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,590
the actual democratic elections that 
sort of ended up going the wrong way.

865
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,713
Um,
but we have to play ball with him 

866
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:39,050
because at least Egypt is a stable 
country.

867
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,153
So if you care about human rights,
it's like you have to play ball with 

868
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:45,800
these strong men.
And then at the same time the strong men

869
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,930
do terrible things.
It almost sounds like a repeat of Saddam

870
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,763
Hussein.
Not to say he's doing the types of 

871
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:54,050
violence to his own people that Saddam 
was doing.

872
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,100
But is that just the best wherever going
to get out of this part of the world?

873
00:48:59,410 --> 00:48:59,801
Well,
you know,

874
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:02,440
it's always a mixture of optimism and 
realism.

875
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,363
Mothers in the Middle East,
there are no pretty solution to 

876
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:06,911
anything.
I mean,

877
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,720
even if you look at the curt who I 
greatly support,

878
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,390
there were still problems within cardiac
societies that need to be addressed.

879
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,230
So you do not find a perfect regime or 
country in the middle.

880
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:18,520
He is not even Israel.
I mean,

881
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:21,720
I'm a huge supporter of Israel.
I'm a self declared proud dryness.

882
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,220
I loved it.
I loved the state of Israel.

883
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:27,850
I think it's a beautiful country and a 
democratic country,

884
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,810
but Israel is not perfect and I 
disagreed with this on certain things.

885
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:34,570
Now obviously Egypt is a much more 
extreme example,

886
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,840
but I think people have the intellectual
capacity.

887
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,913
So make a difference and say,
I completely disagree with this human 

888
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:42,874
rights record,
but I do acknowledge that he is trying 

889
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,250
to,
you know,

890
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,810
trigger a debate about Islam and the 
Muslim world that we really,

891
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:55,644
really need and what the,
the only option that we didn't really 

892
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:01,900
have is to say like,
we cooperate with him on that,

893
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:02,763
but we don't stop criticizing him when 
he arrested journalists or human rights 

894
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:07,510
activist or anyone else.

895
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,850
Yeah.
Um,

896
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,793
what,
what do you make of the West's 

897
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:13,300
fascination or the left's fascination?
I should say,

898
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,980
not the,
it's everyone's fascination.

899
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,840
Everyone's fascination with Israel.
I mean,

900
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:19,810
this is a piece of land that's the size 
of New Jersey.

901
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:24,610
It has one international airport.
You can drive east and west of it.

902
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,650
The border to border in a couple of 
hours,

903
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:30,350
I think like four hours north and south 
in like six or eight hours.

904
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:33,320
I mean,
it's an absurdly tiny piece of land that

905
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:37,250
gets all the media play a that people 
are obsessed with.

906
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:37,740
You know,
I,

907
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,790
I feel similarly to how you just 
described it.

908
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,953
Um,
and of course it's not perfect and 

909
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:44,654
they're in a very precarious place.
It's hard when you have a tiny little 

910
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:48,060
border,
um,

911
00:50:48,061 --> 00:50:50,360
and the Middle East is a mess and 
sometimes people die,

912
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:51,343
but what are you make it just the 
fascination and the endless of the 

913
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,250
United Nations endless assault on the 
one tiny little democracy there.

914
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,380
Yeah,
absolutely.

915
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:02,223
Bizarre.
And I know I'm going to get 100 hate 

916
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,433
emails just holding Israel in a 
democracy and not an apart hype stated 

917
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,140
engages in the genocide of the 
Palestinian people,

918
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,063
which by the way would be the only 
genocide ever to take place in history 

919
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:16,030
where the victim populations increases.
Right,

920
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,990
right.
So just to begin,

921
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,050
can you just really lay that out?
I mean the,

922
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:23,110
the population of Gaza since 1967.
It's sometimes something like four times

923
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:27,100
bigger or even eight times bigger,
I think than it was back then.

924
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,770
So this is not,
it's the reverse of the genocide.

925
00:51:29,771 --> 00:51:32,740
Not to say everything's perfect,
but it is certainly not a genotype

926
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,560
upside down.
Yeah,

927
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,720
it's the only Jennifer in history,
you were the victim population.

928
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,110
Having the alleged victim population has
increased,

929
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,550
that goes for both Gaza and the West 
Bank,

930
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,713
and if you look at the standard of 
living and something like health care 

931
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:55,940
and life expectancy,
this has all improved over the years.

932
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,190
No,
I'm not saying that the Palestinians are

933
00:51:58,191 --> 00:51:59,930
not suffering and that,
you know,

934
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:03,050
Israel is always right in the way that 
it deals with the problem.

935
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:03,884
Not at all.
But to say that Israel is engaging in a 

936
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:10,070
genocide,
I mean,

937
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:13,370
the word genocide is a very,
very serious allegation.

938
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:18,371
It is the crime of all crimes that is 
just absolutely bizarre and frankly,

939
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:19,770
it,
it,

940
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:24,770
it relativizes the concept of genocide 
and it relativizes to cry of people that

941
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:27,314
have actually committed a genocide.
And the most bizarre thing about it all 

942
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,053
is that the people who accuse Israel of 
engaging in genocide are often or very 

943
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:42,320
often aligned with Hamas.
We just actually preaching a genocide,

944
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:44,660
the genocide against the Jewish people.
That is the irony,

945
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:45,920
the episode today about it.
All

946
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:46,863
right.
So that's what I've tried to explain to 

947
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,920
people many times because people will 
say that somehow on this issue,

948
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:51,280
uh,
um,

949
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,113
this right,
we maniac.

950
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:56,090
I'm for two states where you have to 
have two actors that are willing to have

951
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:56,963
two states.
If Hamas is only willing to have one 

952
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:00,910
state,
uh,

953
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:01,691
you know,
look,

954
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:04,300
Israel left Gaza.
There's not one Jew in guys there,

955
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:05,500
right?
Hitler would love the place.

956
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:08,200
There's actually a store called Hitler.
It's a clothing store,

957
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,020
a in Gaza.
So it's like,

958
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:11,854
what do you want them to do?
That's why it seems that's one of the 

959
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:18,670
ones where religion is so tied to it 
because in my opinion,

960
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:20,860
they just simply,
they just don't want Jews there.

961
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,430
No,
you're absolutely right.

962
00:53:23,431 --> 00:53:26,070
I mean if you not just listening what 
Hamas is saying,

963
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:28,010
but also to what president Abbas's 
thing.

964
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,630
I mean,
if the baby.

965
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,493
No,
Tanya was saying the same things about 

966
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,560
Arabs and Palestinians that the 
Palestinian Authority,

967
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:40,530
you're saying about Jews,
not just Israeli Jews in general.

968
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,293
I mean,
the entire word would probably go up in 

969
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,820
flames.
It's completely ridiculous.

970
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,654
And what is also completely ridiculous.
This visa interdependence theory that 

971
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:57,831
people some how believed that if only we
were to solve this problem and this tiny

972
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,570
strip of land at all the ills of,
of,

973
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,390
of the Arab Muslim world would disappear
and to thin out.

974
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:07,403
I mean how is what we're seeing in 
theory are related to the problem in 

975
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,810
Palestine.
There is no relation,

976
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:18,110
there is no relation and this unhealthy 
obsession with Israel is,

977
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,733
is just.
I can't wrap my head around it because 

978
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,450
again,
I'm not saying that it's rent as perfect

979
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:25,284
and I consider myself a critical friend 
of Israel that reserves the right to 

980
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,660
criticize us were always read this 
wrong.

981
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,450
Sure.
But if I look around in the region and I

982
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:34,284
see what what's happening in Syria and 
what the Saudis are doing to women in 

983
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:39,840
their own country,

984
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,293
why are we,
why are we having a part hide weeks at 

985
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:48,630
our universities for Israel and never 
for Saudi Arabia.

986
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,643
Why are we having mass demonstrations on
European street for the Palestinians in 

987
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:55,260
Gaza and the West Bank?
Well,

988
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:56,610
if suffering,
of course,

989
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,833
but that's nothing compared to what 
Bashar Al Assad is doing to them in 

990
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:02,010
Syria,
starving them to death.

991
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,850
Actually really engaging in math.
A lot of Palestinian.

992
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,743
No,
you don't hear these people talking 

993
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:09,450
about it because it's not really about 
Israel.

994
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:10,650
I mean these,
you know,

995
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:11,720
it's not,
it's not really.

996
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,310
It's not really about the Palestinians 
really.

997
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:16,650
These people are really pro 
Palestinians.

998
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:18,450
What they really are.
It's anti Israel.

999
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,240
Right?
So that's the fascinating part.

1000
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:21,074
I mean,
there was the Yarmouk refugee camp in 

1001
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:23,414
Syria,
which means there should be no refugee 

1002
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:27,710
camps in any of these Arab countries for
Palestinians,

1003
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:30,200
but they've kept Palestinians in refugee
camps.

1004
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,690
They don't even let them become citizens
aside,

1005
00:55:32,691 --> 00:55:35,270
killed about 2000 of them within the 
last two years.

1006
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,040
Nobody.
Nobody seems to care.

1007
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:37,993
So it was part of that,
that people just don't care about 

1008
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:41,210
history.
So for example,

1009
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:41,871
they'll say,
well,

1010
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:42,704
go back to 1967,
but it's not as if there was peace 

1011
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,990
before 1967.
And also,

1012
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:48,883
uh,
I'm pretty sure that the Westbank was 

1013
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:53,360
part of Jordan and that guy's always 
part of Egypt.

1014
00:55:53,361 --> 00:55:55,580
So it's not as if the Palestinians had 
to state then,

1015
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,643
so it's like people just don't,
the people love narrative over fact and 

1016
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:02,180
I'm seeing this bleed into almost 
everything these days.

1017
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,670
Yes.
And it's old,

1018
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,180
so I mean they call it finer and finer 
them today,

1019
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:11,910
what there are taking,
but what they really very often mean is,

1020
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,460
is Judas,
you know,

1021
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,490
sign and it's just become a clean word,
the word to describe Jews.

1022
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,400
So it actually has a lot to do with 
antisemitism,

1023
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,234
which never went away.
It took different forms and different 

1024
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:27,184
ways of describing it,
but it really comes down in many cases 

1025
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:33,520
to the fact that people just don't want 
you staff.

1026
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,513
Yeah.
Now you realize people are going to say 

1027
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:36,654
you're a paid Mossad agent and I'm 
opposed to paid Mossad agent and we're 

1028
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:41,130
working together on this.

1029
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,553
You know,
I'm really angry now that you blew my 

1030
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:47,930
cover.
I was trying so hard.

1031
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,833
You thought you were being slick,
but they don't pay me enough to really 

1032
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,740
keep it a secret.
That's the thing,

1033
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,830
you know,

1034
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,520
uh,
I get a call after the show,

1035
00:56:55,521 --> 00:56:57,300
you know,
and I have to explain myself.

1036
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,433
All right,
well,

1037
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:58,901
uh,
okay,

1038
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:00,170
wait,
so we only have a few minutes left.

1039
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,290
I want to circle back a little bit too 
to the European problem.

1040
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:07,570
I saw that this week in Denmark,
uh,

1041
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,453
that they're looking into stripping 
citizenship of moms who are preaching 

1042
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:16,260
hate and preaching things against the 
state in Denmark.

1043
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,980
Now I,
my whole ethos is about free speech.

1044
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,103
Uh,
everything that I do here is about free 

1045
00:57:22,111 --> 00:57:22,944
speech.
So I'm very torn on this one because I 

1046
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:25,974
would basically say that people can say 
anything that they want as long as 

1047
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:30,210
they're not inciting to violence.
Now,

1048
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:31,044
it seems to me that these moms are 
probably going as close to the line on 

1049
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:35,154
that as possible.
If they were preaching to take down the 

1050
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:38,060
state,
uh,

1051
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,103
there's the,
at least a inclination or hint that it 

1052
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,270
may be through violent means,
uh,

1053
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,450
where,
where do you fall on that?

1054
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:48,030
Because I know you're huge on free 
speech and secular values also.

1055
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
I am.
But,

1056
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:51,270
uh,
I'm,

1057
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:56,140
I'm of course also have to believe that 
about all we have to have.

1058
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:56,974
God,
I'm the lives of innocent people living 

1059
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:00,424
in our country and we just had a case in
the UK this week that the mom of the 

1060
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:05,044
largest mosque in in Scotland praised 
the assassination of the anti blast for 

1061
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:14,140
me activists in Pakistan a couple of 
years ago.

1062
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:19,710
And then just hours later,
a shopkeeper who posted a,

1063
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:25,610
a message on facebook congratulating 
Christians for Isa was brutally,

1064
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:28,030
brutally murdered,

1065
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,330
like a Muslim

1066
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,900
by a Muslim because he is,
he belongs to,

1067
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,830
to,
to the Ahmadiyya Muslims,

1068
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:37,180
which is a,
a,

1069
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:42,160
a largely peaceful and progressive 
movement within the Islamic community.

1070
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,263
And within the Muslim world,
these people are often called heretics 

1071
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,273
and a state.
And you don't have to be surprised that 

1072
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:53,284
if the mom or the largest mosque in 
Scotland believes that it's perfectly 

1073
00:58:57,851 --> 00:59:01,570
legitimate to murder people for last,
for me,

1074
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,210
what he actually meets with free speech.
But what these people call blast for me.

1075
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,693
That we then see people actually being 
murdered on our street in the name of 

1076
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,720
their religion.
And I know people would say no again,

1077
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:14,800
no,
he was not a Muslim,

1078
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,140
but he was not in.
It has nothing to do with Islam,

1079
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,183
what it has something to do with Islam 
because what these emom is preaching is 

1080
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:25,580
based on Islamic teaching and there is 
no way around it.

1081
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:30,560
I mean we can deny the problem and many 
people still prefer to do that,

1082
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,530
but it is a part of Islam and we need to
talk about it.

1083
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:34,503
Right?
So now I know you've made this 

1084
00:59:35,591 --> 00:59:38,110
distinction several times even in the 
course of this interview,

1085
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,590
but that there's a political component 
to this.

1086
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,663
So it's not just that the Islamists have
to blow up things and then maybe force 

1087
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:51,070
our governments to take away our own 
freedoms to protect us,

1088
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,203
but that there's a political ideology 
that they'll use the rights that the 

1089
00:59:55,451 --> 01:00:00,451
West grants them to preach these things,
to turn their own populace against us.

1090
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,133
When you start going down that route,
it all starts sounding like a big 

1091
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:04,834
conspiracy or something that there 
really is this massive invasion and I 

1092
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:09,184
don't want to start using the 
fearmongering techniques that the right 

1093
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:14,080
uses.
But that that's real,

1094
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:14,914
right,
that there's a political element that 

1095
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,430
goes beyond violence here,

1096
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,880
I'm third years ago,
that Muslims don't need to,

1097
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,410
you know,
infiltrated western countries.

1098
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,543
They just do this by,
by immigrating to these countries and 

1099
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:35,700
then getting a lot of children because 
that.

1100
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,110
That brings me back to what I said 
before.

1101
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:41,980
We're not just fighting the jihadis,
those who commit violence.

1102
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,383
We also have to deal with the Islamist 
who wants to impose that way of life on 

1103
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:54,040
our societies,
but also with a conservative Muslims who

1104
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,470
are maybe not Islam is and maybe not 
jihadists,

1105
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,723
but who at least to a certain degree 
with some of the things that these 

1106
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:03,070
people are saying.
Because if you look at opinion polls,

1107
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:03,904
and I know this brings me dangerously 
close to what happened to to Sam Harris 

1108
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:10,900
on that show with Ben Affleck looking at
opinion polls.

1109
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:14,230
I mean legitimate opinion polls,
not some fringe,

1110
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:17,680
crazy conspiracy fearmongering opinion 
polls.

1111
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,263
If you look at what people in the Muslim
world think about apostates converting 

1112
01:01:25,121 --> 01:01:27,340
from the religion,
leaving the religion,

1113
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,193
it's shocking.
It is shocking the percentage of people 

1114
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:37,171
who believe it is legitimate to use 
violence against people just leaving the

1115
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:43,291
religion or converting to another 
religion is to me absolutely shocking.

1116
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,690
Do you think the West is fundamentally 
doing something wrong here that somehow,

1117
01:01:48,691 --> 01:01:49,524
and I can even feel it when I'm talking 
to you knowing that we'd go out of our 

1118
01:01:51,661 --> 01:01:53,490
way to make this distinction over and 
over,

1119
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:57,660
that we still feel we have to guard our 
words somehow in all this and again,

1120
01:01:57,661 --> 01:01:58,494
as we've talked about,
that sort of gives the strength to the 

1121
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:00,743
to the right,
but that the west is doing something 

1122
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:06,060
wrong in that we're not selling.
Why freedom is good anymore.

1123
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,253
There was a time where it was like it 
was cool to really stand up for Western 

1124
01:02:11,701 --> 01:02:12,534
values,
stand up for free speech and religious 

1125
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:14,694
plurality and rights of minorities and 
all of those things and for all the 

1126
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:21,600
faults of the West and for,
for wars that we probably shouldn't have

1127
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:22,920
got into.
Although they were,

1128
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,173
as I said at the top of the show,
there were a thousand year old blood 

1129
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:29,490
flute feuds going on in the Middle East,
far boat before America was a country.

1130
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,670
Um,
but that nobody really stands up.

1131
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,210
There aren't public figures anymore that
stand up and say,

1132
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:39,960
you know what,
what we're doing here in the UK is still

1133
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:42,810
good.
We still have more integration here than

1134
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:43,644
they do in most other places.
Certainly in the United States where 

1135
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:48,180
people still want to come.
Do you think we're just,

1136
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,340
we're just not doing a good sell job 
anymore.

1137
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,980
I think you raised two interesting 
points here.

1138
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,420
One is that yes,
indeed.

1139
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,343
Every time,
like if such an interview I think about 

1140
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:58,923
what am I going to say because I know it
will be people out there watching are 

1141
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:04,720
just waiting for me to slip.
Not even intentionally,

1142
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:05,554
just a snip and say something they can 
twist and turn and make me sound like a 

1143
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:10,714
racist and a bigot and you know that 
there are people like John and Glenn 

1144
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,050
Greenwald who do this on purpose and 
have their own malicious agenda and they

1145
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:22,750
know quite well they are misrepresenting
what we're saying,

1146
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:23,823
but they're saying it anyway because 
they are too afraid to debate us with 

1147
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:28,730
ideas so all they can resort to is,
you know,

1148
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,620
smearing us and trying to silence that.
That is one point.

1149
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:36,250
And the second point that you raised 
about not selling ourselves anymore.

1150
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,113
Absolutely.
And you guys in America are doing more 

1151
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:43,800
of a better job at this than we do in 
Europe because you're still what?

1152
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,730
Yeah,
I mean if you look at it from a European

1153
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:48,700
perspective now I left in Washington dc 
for Harvey.

1154
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:53,320
Yeah.
And I was really surprised how proud the

1155
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:57,760
Americans really are about America.
I mean if you come from from Europe,

1156
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:58,623
it's still,
you still feel proud about America at 

1157
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:02,554
least compared to two years.
And we have to be part from this 

1158
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,960
perpetual sense of guilt,
you know?

1159
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:11,823
And and culture of self destruction and 
self blaming that we have somewhat to 

1160
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:19,450
blame for all the ills of the Middle 
East.

1161
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,770
So I'm not saying the colonial period is
period was pretty,

1162
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:24,604
you know,
we didn't do terrible things to people 

1163
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:28,443
but this is not the reason why people 
blow themselves up in Nigeria or 

1164
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:32,890
Indonesia.

1165
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,670
This comes down to the Islam,
Ms.audio

1166
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,504
that g and these people can ignite at as
much as they like and they pretend it 

1167
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,830
all comes down to us.
And again,

1168
01:04:41,831 --> 01:04:46,300
it's what George W dot Bush called the 
soft bigotry of low expectations because

1169
01:04:46,301 --> 01:04:47,250
somewhat,
you know,

1170
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,093
these brown people can not be 
responsible for their own faded must 

1171
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:54,040
always come down to us.
It must always have something to do with

1172
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:56,770
us.
They can say that as long as they like,

1173
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:58,900
it doesn't change the fact it's not 
true.

1174
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,130
And as you can explain,
the global and I,

1175
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:05,830
I believe magic now was called the 
global Islamist insurgency.

1176
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:11,130
You can only explain that and its roots 
with the ideology of Islam,

1177
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:14,800
Islam and not with Western foreign 
policy.

1178
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,541
Yeah.
You know,

1179
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:16,374
it's so funny.
So many of my guests have mentioned the 

1180
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,070
phrase,
the soft bigotry of low expectations and

1181
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:21,904
many times on the show I kept quoting,
I thought it was bill Maher that had 

1182
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:27,010
coined the phrase.
So I felt good about it.

1183
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:29,260
Then I learned it was a George W dot 
Bush.

1184
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:31,570
It was one of his speech writers.
I've been saying it less,

1185
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,050
but maybe that's the phrase that George 
W dot Bush gave us that,

1186
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:36,820
uh,
that we don't have to be upset about.

1187
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,520
No.
And uh,

1188
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,470
I mean,
it's quite funny,

1189
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,270
you know,
I talked about Iraq,

1190
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,550
the,
and you know,

1191
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,393
they will actually,
people who would have been happy at the 

1192
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:49,930
top of George w Bush and toppled Saddam 
Hussein.

1193
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:50,764
And that really brings us back to the 
absurdity of the left and in everything 

1194
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:55,474
that we talked about today,
for all his faults and by no means 

1195
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:02,590
George W Bush was not perfect,
but he was also not a sudden the same.

1196
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:03,511
Yeah.
All right,

1197
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:04,344
so final thoughts to wrap all this up.
If you had a crystal ball and you were 

1198
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:12,651
looking five or 10 years into the future
of where Europe is going to be a,

1199
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,340
the state of Jihad in Islam,
Islam and all that,

1200
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,790
or are you hopeful?
It doesn't feel very hopeful right now.

1201
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:21,624
The only grain that I can get this 
hopeful is that these conversations are 

1202
01:06:24,331 --> 01:06:29,220
happening and at least that the free 
thinkers aren't feeling as held hostage,

1203
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,460
uh,
between jihadists and leftists.

1204
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,700
So I think that's the hope for me,
but I don't know how big,

1205
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,020
how really hopeful I can

1206
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,453
hang my hat on that.

1207
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,970
What I'm.
I am by nature an optimist.

1208
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,910
I couldn't do the job if I were not an 
optimist.

1209
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,253
And I do think there is reason for hope 
because if I look at the emails that I 

1210
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:51,700
received,
a tweet that I received,

1211
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:55,170
the private messages that I received,
the feedback that I received,

1212
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:56,004
when I talk to people,
people are waking up in our own 

1213
01:06:59,041 --> 01:06:59,970
countries.
I mean,

1214
01:06:59,971 --> 01:07:01,530
I have many people come to me and say 
like,

1215
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,240
Oh,
you actually saying what I would like to

1216
01:07:03,241 --> 01:07:04,740
say,
but either they're,

1217
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:05,574
you know,
they're too afraid to say it because 

1218
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:10,680
they'll be called a racist or they don't
have the rhetoric to really bring across

1219
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:13,860
their views were just why shows like 
yours are so important.

1220
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:15,773
But also people in the Muslim world.
I mean the Muslim women that we work 

1221
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,440
with really no longer want to live on 
the oppression,

1222
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,633
who don't want to be treated as second 
class citizens who have the right to 

1223
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:28,320
education and to opportunity in life.

1224
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:30,750
The free thinkers,
the poets,

1225
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,270
the gentleness,
the activist,

1226
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,990
minorities like homosexual converts,
atheist.

1227
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,180
These are the most important people in 
the Muslim world at the moment.

1228
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,710
And who deserves all the respect and 
support that we can give them.

1229
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:47,723
And I think if we can forge a genuine 
alliance between those in the Muslim 

1230
01:07:52,141 --> 01:07:52,974
world,
want to see change and want to make 

1231
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:59,840
Islam compatible with the modern world 
and us who are not afraid to speak.

1232
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:04,040
How to probe about the problems of the 
religion and about the ideology.

1233
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:04,883
Because you know,
the irony is that by denying all of 

1234
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:07,734
this,
you were actually aiding the extremists 

1235
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:15,470
because you're taking away,
you're taking away the justification for

1236
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:19,220
those who want to bring about change,
why they want to bring about change.

1237
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,650
If you don't name the problem,
if you take away the problem,

1238
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,640
what are these people going to do?
So that's something we need to realize.

1239
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,320
Yeah.
At the top of the show I said,

1240
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:29,780
you know,
as you've said that a religion is just a

1241
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:33,890
set of ideas and if there was a 
political ideology or political party,

1242
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,100
let's say that it was an offshoot of the
Republicans here in the United States,

1243
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:37,934
and it said,
we're going to throw gays off roofs and 

1244
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:41,840
we're going to put women in Burkas and 
we're going to oppress minorities.

1245
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:44,840
Well then the progressive's would be 
going bonkers and they'd be,

1246
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,570
they'd be calling them the racist 
instead.

1247
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,430
Uh,
well I think you know,

1248
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:52,100
where I'm going with this.
