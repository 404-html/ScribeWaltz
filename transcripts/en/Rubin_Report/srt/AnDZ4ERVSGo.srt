1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:02,730
I'd

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,563
like to believe that critical thinking 
is woven into pretty much everything we 

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,284
do here on the Rubin report,
but today's show is going to have an 

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,750
even keener focus on this all 
encompassing topic.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,390
At the end of the day,
whether we're talking about politics,

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,710
religion,
or current events,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,740
it all boils down to critical thinking,
the definition of which is quote,

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,350
the objective analysis and evaluation of
an issue in order to form a judgment end

9
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:28,614
quote,
can we really look at the world the way 

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,210
it truly is,
not the way we want it to be.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,283
Can we set aside our faith based hopes 
to analyze real world problems or his 

12
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:38,784
faith actually a part of the problem as 
opposed to being the solution each week 

13
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:44,394
I try to have conversations that exist 
in this space without resorting to ad 

14
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:52,590
hominem attacks and Straw man arguments.
That guiding principle is fully based in

15
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,570
critical thinking and moral reasoning.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,370
Joining me this week is Peter 
Boghossian,

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,263
philosophy instructor,
critical thinker and author of a manual 

18
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,390
for creating atheists.
Peter's book is a really incisive,

19
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,000
clear take on why critical thinking is 
important,

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,610
how faith based thinking can be 
dangerous,

21
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:09,444
and also relates what you can do to 
spread ideas based on fact and reason 

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,093
with your friends and family.
He writes in an understandable and 

23
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,440
relatable style on topics that many are 
afraid to touch on,

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,483
even with the people closest to them.
He gives the reader the very tools to 

25
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,520
help people trapped by faith based 
thinking.

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,410
Yes,
I did say help.

27
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:32,790
Their help is exactly what I believe is 
needed in this situation.

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,450
When your beliefs aren't based in reason
and critical thinking,

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,300
it creates a space where extremism can 
creep in.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,643
This of course,
isn't beholden to one religion or 

31
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:46,410
ideology.
Anytime you throw reason in fact out the

32
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:49,500
window to trade it with ideas that 
aren't provable,

33
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,400
you create the very breeding ground that
extremism needs to spread.

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,250
It's not a coincidence that in places 
where gays,

35
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,084
women and minorities are treated poorly 
are also the places where religion has 

36
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,870
often been a substitute for clear moral 
thinking.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,340
By the way,
uh,

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,490
we here in the West could do a much 
better job of this ourselves.

39
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,270
I know we're more focused on Islamic 
extremism on this show,

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,120
but there are all kinds of extremism in 
the world.

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,163
You can't deal with any of these 
ideologies with half truths and by 

42
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,274
shooting the messengers,
you must deal with them by looking at 

43
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:27,450
them head on and tackling the ideologies
with better ideas and moral clarity.

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,480
We live in a time when religious 
extremism is on the rise.

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,343
I'm going to guess that we probably 
don't have many religious extremists 

46
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:34,704
watching this show,
so I don't know how much of an effect I 

47
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:40,320
can have on those people.
The people that I can have an effect on,

48
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:41,154
however,
is you guys people out there from every 

49
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:43,974
walk of life,
from all over the globe who want to do 

50
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:49,080
the work of finding out what brings us 
together,

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,550
not what tears us apart.

52
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,390
I firmly believe that critical thinking 
is the solution.

53
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,610
Critical thinking doesn't care about 
your race,

54
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,444
your sexuality or your nationality is a 
roadmap to solving serious issues and 

55
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,674
combating superstitious thinking.
That has led to many real world 

56
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:06,964
problems.
Much of the right in America is led by 

57
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,140
Christian religious ideology.
Much of the left,

58
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,974
while not guided by religion,
has become as dogmatic in its beliefs 

59
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,910
between the two is where most clear 
minded free thinking people live.

60
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,460
It's what my guest on next week show Ali
Rizvi he refers to as the new center.

61
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,903
I think by letting go of our 
superstitions and focusing on real 

62
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,890
solutions,
we can change the world for the better.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,113
Either that or we can leave it up to the
zealots after all the world is what you 

64
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:38,014
make of it.

65
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,510
Peter goes in as a philosophy 
instructor,

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,450
critical thinker and author of a manual 
for creating atheists.

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,860
He's also an anterior aggressive warrior
and can back it up with some Jujitsu.

68
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,263
Peter,
welcome to the show.

69
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,410
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,560
Really looking forward to our chat.
I am looking forward to it as well.

71
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,394
You know,
every week I feel like I'm connecting 

72
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,854
with people that I know in the digital 
space and mostly through 140 characters 

73
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:07,690
and I put you in that group.
You just did three hours with Rogan.

74
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,760
I did.
We had an interesting conversation.

75
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,800
How you feeling?
You came up,

76
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,610
you came up to good.
I feel great.

77
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,740
I feel great.
Did he say good things about me?

78
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,880
We said nothing.
Well,

79
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,780
you know,
that's the thing.

80
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,614
We don't.
I think part of it is when people are 

81
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:23,410
together and they're sincere,
I think they'll,

82
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,723
they'll either agree or disagree or 
there'll be a convergence around those 

83
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,060
ideas.

84
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,320
And I started off when we were talking,
thinking that I feel like I know you,

85
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:36,460
like I feel that the stuff that you 
think about and the values that you have

86
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,800
are in congruence with my own values.
And I think part of that comes from,

87
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,890
from the uh,
type of honesty with oneself.

88
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,810
Yeah.
Well we're obviously going to talk a lot

89
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,190
about those values and I think it really
is cool that this,

90
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,024
this group of people come together.
You were sort of in this a little bit 

91
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:57,310
before me and connected with Sam and 
some of those other guys,

92
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,320
but now Rogan,
Christina Hoff,

93
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,154
sommers,
all these people who don't necessarily 

94
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,494
agree on everything.
Don't come from the same walks of life 

95
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,880
or the same socioeconomic separate,
whatever,

96
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:10,300
that we've all sort of come together 
because we have these base principles,

97
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,130
apps that we want to put out there.

98
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,110
Yeah,
I think that's right.

99
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,140
And I think that it's so.
So here's one way to think about it.

100
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,040
We often think about the right and the 
left on some kind of align.

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,173
So there's the far right,
which is obviously on the far right of 

102
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:28,090
the line,
the far left and the middle.

103
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,193
There's this philosophy,
there's a French philosopher has this 

104
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,134
idea of a horseshoe theory.
You take the ends of the line and you 

105
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,284
bend them together.
The far left and the far right are 

106
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,000
closer to each other than they are to 
the center.

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,913
Yeah.
And so I think that that's a helpful 

108
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:46,690
heuristic or helpful way to look at some
of these issues.

109
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,040
And for me it was,
you know,

110
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,650
rather than give a geological account 
about how this came to be for,

111
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,160
for me,
what's always interesting is when

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,850
I look at the mean spiritedness,
the anger,

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,073
the tactics of the regressives,
they're just so fundamentally contrary 

114
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:12,980
to what my values are and for the sort 
of person that I want to become.

115
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

116
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,771
And,
and,

117
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:15,604
and I do see that that horseshoe,
that far left in that far right and the 

118
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,114
left the regressive seem extraordinarily
angry and eager to smear those people 

119
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,610
with racist,
sexist,

120
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,660
homophobic,
etc.

121
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,793
If you don't buy into certain,
even if you ask questions as opposed to 

122
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,440
buying into something they have made any
kind of discourse almost impossible.

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,841
Yeah.
Well,

124
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,730
we've talked a lIttle bit about that and
i.

125
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,500
Sam said something,
sam harris said something about how it's

126
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,800
almost like scorched earth.
I think I'm loosely quoting what he said

127
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,890
because the tactics have been so bad.
But before we get into all that,

128
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,903
let's talk about you a little bit so 
people can understand where you come 

129
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:47,790
from.
All this and,

130
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,803
and the book that you've written,
which I just read this week and manual 

131
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:51,560
for creating atheists.
It was,

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,770
it was wonderful.
It was,

133
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,620
it was what I tried to do here actually,
uh,

134
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,603
which I guess goes to what you said at 
the top because it was understandable 

135
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:05,001
you were trying to give people the tools
to go about talking about,

136
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,780
you know,
reasoning and,

137
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,870
and morality without taking the leap of 
faith.

138
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,223
Yeah.
And,

139
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,340
and asking people starts off in.
So thank you for the,

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
for the book.
You enjoyed the book.

141
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,280
I fully did.
It really did.

142
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,690
And if you didn't,
you tell me.

143
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,471
I absolutely.
Okay.

144
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,510
So that's the type of sincerity and I'd 
appreciate that.

145
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:23,344
So,
so the book talks about in the 

146
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,420
forthcoming app atheist,
which talks about how to have more civil

147
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,960
productive conversations with people to 
help them break through dogmatism,

148
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,063
to help them break through these deep 
seated beliefs that they hold and that 

149
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:42,340
they think that they're better people 
because they hold these beliefs.

150
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,400
So how to really have productive 
conversations and engage people.

151
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:45,750
Yeah.

152
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,190
So I think the best way to jump off on 
this is let's just define some terms and

153
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:51,024
I've done this in one incarnation or 
another a few times on the show and 

154
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:56,280
we've talked about religion and atheism 
and agnosticism and all that.

155
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:58,530
But why don't you just give me some 
basic definitions,

156
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:01,490
which is sort of how you start the book.
So just what is an eighth?

157
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,740
Yes.
So the way I define ads,

158
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,110
I think it's right.
These are placeholder terms.

159
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,944
I'm willing to revise those.
I don't have an atheist is a person who 

160
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,340
doesn't have sufficient evidence to 
warrant belief in god,

161
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,413
but if they were given that evidence 
then they would believe so inherent in 

162
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,500
the term atheist or the way that I use 
it is a sort of open mindedness.

163
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,800
Right.
Which is funny to me,

164
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:23,634
and that's the way you describe it in 
the book because there seems to be a 

165
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,174
certain subset of people that think that
atheists are actually the most closed 

166
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:32,190
minded people,
but that's not the way you are defining.

167
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,033
And maybe that's just sort of the 
personalities that have been publicly 

168
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,294
attached to them.

169
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,870
To a certain extent.
We,

170
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,213
we can understand why someone would 
think that because the word theist is 

171
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,644
contained with the word atheist and just
as theorists tend to have these dogmas 

172
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,630
where they latch onto religious 
propositions,

173
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,340
faith,
faith promises to faith.

174
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,490
So two,
one would think that atheists does.

175
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,324
But again,
I think that the faithful have 

176
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,574
constructed these narratives to,
to make it as if there's some kind of a 

177
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:03,480
parallelism,
assymetry of belief.

178
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,130
Look,
we believe these things.

179
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,740
You guys believe that we,
we,

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,380
we have beliefs that are predicated on 
no evidence just like you do.

181
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,550
Right?
And I,

182
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,560
I don't,
I,

183
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,790
I think that's a type of insincerity.
I don't think that people who are honest

184
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,090
with themselves and have a minimal 
level,

185
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,503
you know,
basically enough intelligence to tie a 

186
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,770
shoe,
a shoe is,

187
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,470
I don't think that it's possible to come
to that conclusion.

188
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.
So,

189
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,580
so before we go too deep on that,
what are the other,

190
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,340
what are the other terms we should just 
define right at the beginning?

191
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,920
So agnosticism for example,
um,

192
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,940
I would,
you don't,

193
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:39,870
you're not big on.
No,

194
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,070
I don't like that.
I don't like the term.

195
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,943
I think it's a,
it's a useless tournament we need to do 

196
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,590
away with it.
You don't believe in santa claus?

197
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,860
No.
So you were a santa claus,

198
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,720
a atheist or don't understand to close.
Agnostic,

199
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,613
right.
So the word agnostic is gives wiggle 

200
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,320
room worse.
No wiggle room should exist.

201
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,470
The default to any belief shouldn't be.
Maybe the default should probably be no,

202
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,150
unless I have sufficient evidence to 
believe.

203
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,000
But again that's part of the hijacking 
of the narrative.

204
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,871
Right.
So that's interesting.

205
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:13,704
So a lot of people I've heard lately,
they described themselves as agnostic 

206
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,340
atheist.

207
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,173
That seems to be like the new or have 
you heard about that one where it gives 

208
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,030
them,
I guess a little more wiggle room,

209
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,910
but you're saying that that in a way 
that sort of cheating the,

210
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,590
the idea here,
right?

211
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,310
Yeah.
And maybe people self described that way

212
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,920
because they feel they want to reap some
social benefits from it.

213
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,993
Maybe they feel that they don't want to 
offend people or insult people or make 

214
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:41,520
people feel bad so that they use these 
wiggle terms.

215
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,260
Yeah.
So in the book.

216
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,791
Well,
first off,

217
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,050
is there anything else we should define?
Just real quick.

218
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,400
All right.
I don't know.

219
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,181
I don't think so,
but if,

220
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,260
um,
if we've defined something and it's,

221
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,300
you're right,
it's important to define words and those

222
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,790
can be placeholders for later on because
if someone says,

223
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm an agnostic atheist,
I'll say,

224
00:10:58,561 --> 00:10:59,640
well what do you mean by that?

225
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,803
And I can challenge or what have you,
but if not it's like two ships passing 

226
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,193
each other.
Not like we don't know what the 

227
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,574
conversation is about.
And there was a lot of that in the book 

228
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:08,040
where you're talking about,
you know,

229
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,880
people with faith and people without 
faith or a nonbeliever verse believer,

230
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:12,714
whatever,
however you want to define it there 

231
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,653
they're talking about two different 
things and that sometimes makes the 

232
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:20,410
conversation really kinda crazy.
It does.

233
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:21,244
And that's the problem with faith is 
that it has a broad semantic range and 

234
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:29,010
people try to use the term to do some 
work that it doesn't do,

235
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,850
like they try to use the term to protect
like,

236
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,900
well I believe that muhammad fluid 
having a winged horse or I believe jesus

237
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:41,901
walked on water fasting or the dalai 
lama incarnates through bodies where it.

238
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,890
But I,
you just say you have faith,

239
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,960
your wife loves you or you have faith in
a plant.

240
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,794
So they use that term as an umbrella 
term to almost cover their beliefs from 

241
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,830
any make an impervious to reason.
And I just don't think that's,

242
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,970
that's a very sincere way to approach 
any inquiry.

243
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,973
Right?
So I think a lot of people just from 

244
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:05,280
this first five or six minutes are going
to say,

245
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:05,940
well,
this guy,

246
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,240
this guy is a pretty open minded atheist
like that.

247
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:10,074
That's going to be part of it.
And I think one of the things you said 

248
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:12,414
right at the beginning of the book is 
you don't really define yourself as an 

249
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:15,894
atheist.
And I thought you were.

250
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,810
I thought your reasoning was actually 
really clever.

251
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:19,644
Can you go into that?
What you tell me what you got it and 

252
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,574
then I'll,
I'll.

253
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,503
Well basically you were saying I don't 
define myself as someone that doesn't 

254
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:27,910
believe in leprechaun.
Right.

255
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,980
So,
but,

256
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,843
but yet there seems to be with atheists,
there seems to be so much onus on them 

257
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:36,060
to constantly have to talk about it or,
or whatever it is.

258
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,700
I've only been in this kind of.

259
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,810
I never even publicly said that I was an
atheist.

260
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,570
Yeah.
Literally it was about two months ago,

261
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:44,370
I think when milo yiannopoulos was on 
the show,

262
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:47,790
I always considered myself sort of a 
friend of the atheist community.

263
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,530
I always liked atheists.
I like free thinkers.

264
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,060
I like critical thinkers.
It never,

265
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,300
it wasn't something that really hit me 
one way or another.

266
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,890
I didn't feel like I needed to say,
all right,

267
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:58,830
I have to make this announcement or this
announcement.

268
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,720
but somehow in that conversation with 
him,

269
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:03,540
I had finally got to my breaking point 
or something.

270
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,890
Well that was good then.
It was a good car.

271
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,850
So Yeah,
it was all good

272
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,940
honesty though.
Public asta.

273
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,390
And so I think that the Word atheist 
still has some negative connotations and

274
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,570
a lot of negativity is attached to it,
but I don't.

275
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,930
I think that atheism is a conclusion and
it's ultimately,

276
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:23,260
it's much less important that then 
epistomological hygiene if you were like

277
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,150
thinking about how you come to knowledge
and making sure that,

278
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:27,984
that,
that those ways to come to knowledge or 

279
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:30,264
reliable.
Because that's the other thing that was 

280
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,340
a big realization for me a long time ago
is that that faith,

281
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,730
faith claims are knowledge claims.
So when someone makes a faith claim,

282
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,180
they're making a claim about the world.
Like I have faith because of x.

283
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:47,181
So people use faith as a process to get 
to a claim about the world.

284
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,450
I mean the whole thing is just so 
bizarre twisted,

285
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:55,950
but unfortunately where we live or it's 
surrounded surrounding us,

286
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,500
but I don't,
I don't have.

287
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,010
It's really weird to me.
Like I'll go to,

288
00:13:59,011 --> 00:13:59,844
I'll speak an atheist conference and 
people would be singing about being an 

289
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,570
atheist since I just,
I can't.

290
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,680
It's just unfathomable.

291
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,653
Right.
Well that's why your description of it 

292
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,890
felt decent to me.
You know what I mean?

293
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,210
It does.
It certainly,

294
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,493
as I said,
I didn't talk about it until three 

295
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:13,791
months ago.
It's never.

296
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,470
I don't think it will ever be something 
that defines me.

297
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:20,471
What defines me are my thoughts and my,
the breadth of all the things that I am,

298
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,660
but that's just to define yourself by 
saying you don't believe in.

299
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,370
Actually it doeSn't make that much 
sense.

300
00:14:25,371 --> 00:14:26,360
Right?
Yeah,

301
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:26,810
and

302
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,530
I'm trying to think about defining 
yourself in terms of your thought.

303
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,970
I don't even know if I had to do that.
I mean,

304
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,703
I think it important to ask yourself,
what kind of person do you want to be 

305
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,490
like,
you know,

306
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,260
I want to be a kind person.
I want to be a compassionate person.

307
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,633
I am very confident that those values 
are derived through reason and that we 

308
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,990
can articulate ways to get through those
very clearly,

309
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,200
but I'm not.
I'm not Sure if he hit me.

310
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,063
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I want to be tHe type of person 

311
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,813
who's willing to revise my beliefs.
Maybe I want to be the type of person 

312
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,330
who's inquisitive and trustful of reason
and who treats people well,

313
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,193
you know,
maybe that's the kind of person I want 

314
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,144
to become.
so maybe those things are identify self 

315
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,600
identify with those,
but I don't.

316
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,500
It's just an odd thing to me to latch 
that onto an identity.

317
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,050
Yeah.
Well I,

318
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,953
I certainly agree with that.
So a lot of what you're doing in the 

319
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:22,900
book is really,
I think you actually use this word is to

320
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:27,730
deprogram people from faith and I 
thought using that word was particularly

321
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:30,760
interesting because you're viewing it as
sort of,

322
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,220
you know,
we all enter this,

323
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,173
this life sort of as a clean slate and 
then we're programmed with this stuff 

324
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,360
and you're trying to give everyone the 
tools to,

325
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,770
to deprogram.

326
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,490
Yeah,
that's exactly right.

327
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,280
We have been indoctrinated by ideas,
culture.

328
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:47,114
We have.
Everybody has a kind of cultural myopia 

329
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,930
that's reinforced by religion and 
beliefs.

330
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,500
So how do we help people to become more 
reflective about their beliefs?

331
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,470
How do we help people to become less 
dogmatic about what they,

332
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,800
about their thoughts and,
and you know,

333
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:07,550
maybe maybe that's why like for me even 
the is and part of an identity,

334
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:12,551
but maybe that's because it's a dominant
heteronormative or you know,

335
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,180
so I mean,
I,

336
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,770
I don't,
I don't know.

337
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,173
What I do know is that people think that
havIng certain beliefs makes them a 

338
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:22,304
better person.
Dan debt talks about this in terms of 

339
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,620
belief and belief and part of the 
problem is once you start taking that,

340
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,810
you're holding beliefs makes you a 
better person.

341
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,823
You're much less likely to revise those 
because it moves from the realm of 

342
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,970
epistemology that is knowledge to the 
realm of morals and you don't want to be

343
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,070
that guy like you don't want to be.
Yeah,

344
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,961
yeah.
No,

345
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:41,794
I'm with you.
The difference between knowledge and 

346
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:43,864
morals,
which people seem to conflate 

347
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,630
constantly,
right?

348
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,530
Yeah.
And it's interesting in terms of the,

349
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,940
the regressive left and the,
the idea of race.

350
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:54,774
When people talk about race that is just
so charged and so politicized that they 

351
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:01,194
have made it almost impossible for a 
sincere inquirer to ask a question 

352
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,340
without being smeared or labeled in some
way,

353
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,473
and we've lost the ability,
we've lost the ability in an academic 

354
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:18,350
context to ask sincere questions that we
get.

355
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,720
The only way to solve any problem,
the first step is to be honest about it.

356
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,730
If you're not honest about it,
you're not going to solve it.

357
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,564
And you've written about this.
And Douglas Murray was on sam's 

358
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,460
podcasts.
Other people have spoken buts.

359
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,000
I've tweeted about this.
I wrote about this.

360
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,643
If you do not allow questions than 
extremists are eager to come in with 

361
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:38,184
answers.
And so that's one of the consequences 

362
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,950
that we see and we see this in a 
religious landscape.

363
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,080
Very it,
especially with islam.

364
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:48,150
Now with me,
we see this terrible problem.

365
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
So we're,

366
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,520
we're jumping ahead a little bit.
I'm gonna.

367
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,261
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

368
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,770
Follow you on this jump.
Um,

369
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,300
so when it relates to,
to the left,

370
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,450
now I assume you're basically someone 
that comes from the left,

371
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:00,811
right?
I mean,

372
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,880
from everything I knew,
classical liberal,

373
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,850
liberal class every,
every virtually every sense.

374
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,713
Yeah.
So I assume that also that you feel the 

375
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,090
same way I do that it's your job to 
police them more than the.

376
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,690
Right.
Right.

377
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,430
Like for me,
people always say to me,

378
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,264
well,
why aren't you attacking the right as 

379
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:16,674
much?
And it's like I see I have not part of 

380
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,950
the right.
I do attack them.

381
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,760
I,
I,

382
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,210
I don't think I've ever voted for a 
republican in my life.

383
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,083
Not,
I'm not a fan of the democrats and I'm 

384
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,990
not a democrat.
I'm an independent,

385
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:30,510
but I.
But for me to police the people that I'm

386
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,070
not part of,
you know,

387
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,150
it,
it just seems silly.

388
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,730
I want to police my guys.
Do you feel that?

389
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,680
I mean,
is that part of what you do and

390
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,430
I feel to me it's more germane in the 
sense that the left,

391
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,350
the regressives have taken over 
academia.

392
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,303
They have literally hijacked the 
institutions and now they're 

393
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,890
institutionalizing these policies which 
are really rather extreme by any in any,

394
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,500
any classical liberal would be horrified
at what their speech codes,

395
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,760
microaggressions.
Troy,

396
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,623
it's horrifying and they're Basically 
robbing a generation of people have the 

397
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:05,574
possibility of being able to think 
clearly and critically and their ever 

398
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,713
increasing the threshold.
People's threshold for what they 

399
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:13,164
consider to be offensive or the types of
conversations they'll have is 

400
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:16,644
continuously dropping.
So for me it's personal only and then I 

401
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:22,500
have to deal with this every single day 
and I write.

402
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,200
I mean it's,
it's the most personal thing.

403
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,750
Yeah,
it's,

404
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,990
it's endemic now.
Why?

405
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,800
Why don't you criticize the rightest 
much?

406
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,401
Well,
I mean,

407
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,560
look,
I have criticized the right,

408
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,394
you've criticized the right.
Think about the type of criticism you 

409
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:38,310
have to label against a guy who is a 
bonafide.

410
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,150
Can I start?

411
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,410
We're on.
Your shows were away.

412
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,303
Yeah,
everyone always asked me before they 

413
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,040
swear I probably,
I probably asked me for a while.

414
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,913
That's fine.

415
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,830
Yeah.
I mean think of,

416
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,420
think about about,
you know,

417
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,610
like huckabee,
who is a bonafide fucking lunatic,

418
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,863
right?
I mean think about guys like Donald 

419
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,740
Trump.
I mean these guys are so outside,

420
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,610
not even actually that's status.
They're not outside the mainstream or at

421
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,590
least have that place.
Yeah.

422
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,573
And labeling a sort of criticism against
that type of crazy is very different 

423
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,430
from people for whom I feel sympathies 
for these impulses they have.

424
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,993
They have very decent impulses that base
and we need to be careful that because 

425
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:24,340
they're so insincere and dishonest that 
we don't disregard their whole message.

426
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,250
Like the onus falls upon us to think 
clearly about that,

427
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,470
into really,
okay privilege,

428
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:32,490
I got it,
you know,

429
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,590
this gender thing,
you know,

430
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,483
but to really take a step back and 
separate the message from the messenger 

431
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,500
so that we don't discount the whole 
thing.

432
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,180
Yeah.
I'm

433
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,600
very,
very aware of that all the time,

434
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:44,434
you know,
because I know that I'm attacking the 

435
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,580
trigger warnings and safe space and all 
that stuff and I don't want to throw the

436
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,414
baby out with the bathwater and I know 
that there are legitimate racial issues 

437
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:55,510
in early legitimate socioeconomic issues
and all of that stuff.

438
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,320
But because of the way these guys have 
behaved and frame the debate,

439
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,730
they've made it extremely difficult to 
separate legitimate issues.

440
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,400
That's exactly right.
From pure craziness.

441
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:10,270
So I think what's interesting related to
someone like you that comes from a place

442
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,900
where you're writing and talking about 
moral clarity and and critical thinking,

443
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,890
this has to be.
It's almost like doubly worse for you in

444
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,070
a way to be part of this because there's
the,

445
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,080
there's the thinking part,
the spiritual part.

446
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,990
Like it's just a lot mixed into one 
crazy thing.

447
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,310
Yeah,
it's interesting.

448
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,144
I mean everybody,
you had I think nicola here and other 

449
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:34,810
people have given geological accounts of
how we got into the situation,

450
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:35,644
but I think the thing that people really
aren't thinking about or talking about 

451
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,770
that much or what are the implications 
for these things.

452
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:43,360
I mean,
what are the philosophical.

453
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,210
What does this mean?
What did this would interest.

454
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,090
We're both speaking quickly.
We have so much to sacrifice,

455
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,453
so much to get up and go,
what does this mean when we've created 

456
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:58,111
academic environments in which people in
which professors are terrified to give a

457
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,400
dissenting opinion and then when 
dissenting.

458
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,970
I mean something from,
from the regressive party line.

459
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,250
What does that mean

460
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,293
for a second,
let's define dissenting because it's 

461
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,394
barely dissenting.
It's literally just saying anything 

462
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,403
other descending.
It's not like you're saying something 

463
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,880
that's really against what the 
mainstream belief is.

464
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,160
It's pretty much anything like,
you know,

465
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,850
be okay with someone else wearing a 
halloween costume that you may not like.

466
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,590
ThAt's the tour sort of dissenting.
Right?

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,550
And that's the kind of craziness that 
you get when you.

468
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,663
So it's again,
it's the issue of how we got there is 

469
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:33,840
extremely interesting and valuable.
I'm,

470
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,020
I'm interested in recently my work has 
been focusing on what does that mean for

471
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:39,954
one's intellectual life?
Like what does that mean for one's 

472
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,650
ability to reflect on issues?
What does that mean for one's ability to

473
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:48,900
make decisions about things that really 
matter?

474
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,080
Not halloween costumes.
I understand that some people think that

475
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,110
matters,
but that's just evidence of an inability

476
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,820
to show moral triage,
you know,

477
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:57,654
to prior to indexically partners prior 
to some kind of a hierarchy to identify 

478
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:06,600
that one need and another need and show 
why that's important.

479
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,560
And the way that you do that is through 
reason and rationality.

480
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,440
That's how you get there and the way 
that you.

481
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,130
So when you attack safe spaces and when 
you attract trick,

482
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,750
true warnings,
you're actually,

483
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:19,584
this is the key thing,
you're actually doing them a favor 

484
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,673
because,
because you're giving them an 

485
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:25,164
opportunity,
you're giving people an opportunity if 

486
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:28,344
their values are true,
like if their values are morally 

487
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:31,920
correct.

488
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,753
And I do believe that there's such a 
thing as being morally correct and 

489
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,740
obviously they do as well or they 
couldn't be espousing.

490
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,833
And that's just parenthetically,
that's the interesting difference 

491
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,670
between,
that's the,

492
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:45,504
uh,
the contradiction in their beliefs 

493
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:51,470
between being lost.
My train of thought.

494
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,423
Well that I think,
I think you're going that they think 

495
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:54,500
that,
oh yeah.

496
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,250
So right.
Yeah.

497
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,090
So,
so you.

498
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,200
So these people,
they have the legacy of relativism,

499
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,150
but yet the values that they put forth a
radical egalitarianism,

500
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,930
you cannot be a relativist entity.
Galitary and safe.

501
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,270
You cannot say everything is relative 
and then all systems are equal.

502
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,810
So one of the things that you're doing,
you're doing,

503
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,673
they'll look at it as to them,
but I will look at it as to advance 

504
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,610
their cause.
One of the things you're doing is you're

505
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,611
giving people an opportunity to reflect 
on how they know what they know,

506
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,960
and the only way you can do that is 
through an unsafe space.

507
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,453
The only way you can do that Is to 
really take a look at these ideas and 

508
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:40,490
examined these ideas.
There just is no other way.

509
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,443
So if they have their values are 
arbitrary and subject to cultural 

510
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,024
capriciousness,
unless they can be rationally derived 

511
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,953
and they've taken out the engine of 
rationality once they've created spaces 

512
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,830
in which you can ask these questions.
Yeah,

513
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,780
so that's why I've a few times I'll say 
that the road to hell is paved with good

514
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:05,360
intentions that I believed that these 
guys.

515
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,493
Actually.
Joe rogan fought me on this when I said 

516
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,031
this,
I said,

517
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:08,864
I believe these guys,
like with the athletic thing on real 

518
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:14,180
time with sam harris and all that I did,
while his intentions were good.

519
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,313
You know what I mean?
He was intending to try to protect the 

520
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,700
other joe.
Basically it was like,

521
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:20,790
nah,
he's a hollywood guy.

522
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,930
He's just protecting her zone,
his own internals and actor.

523
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,280
He's an actor.
That's it and he's,

524
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,323
he's out for number one fund,
but I guess that's probably what really 

525
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:33,830
is perverse about what's going on on the
left because by taking kids,

526
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:34,664
by taking college kids whose thoughts 
aren't fully formulated yet and then 

527
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,613
putting this thing on them,
they think they're doing everything for 

528
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:42,764
good intentions,
but then they're going to walk out into 

529
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:47,720
the world realizing the world doesn't 
really react that way.

530
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,613
Yeah,
and if they're listening to this and 

531
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,870
they're just dumping on you and hate you
and hate in me,

532
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,033
I think it's perhaps a nice,
helpful heuristic to think about it in 

533
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,530
terms of standing for the flag.

534
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,693
An example on the rIght,
people on the right are big on respect 

535
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,110
for the flag.
They've made their own thing sacred,

536
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,693
but I don't think that's important.
I think what's important is to teach 

537
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,680
people why they should stand for the 
flag,

538
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,700
what our values mean and and that's why 
they're standing.

539
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:23,480
It's not an icon,
but I think that the same property holds

540
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,430
on the left.
They have to.

541
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,983
They have to start being honest and 
realizing that if their values really 

542
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:31,874
are true,
then they have to subject those values 

543
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:36,380
to scrutiny and then we have to create 
spaces.

544
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:41,381
we have to create environments where the
marketplace of ideas,

545
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,330
we can have a discourse and a dialectic 
above these things.

546
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,740
Exactly.
If that's just a little different,

547
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:50,910
we just do the do the officers.
That's why they should be thankIng you.

548
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,810
I'm,
I mean,

549
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,710
I'm being facetious.

550
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,543
I'm being really sincere.
That's why they should be thanking you 

551
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,200
because if not then that means their 
values are arbitrary.

552
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,320
So when I talked about this with milo 
and the and the college thing,

553
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,820
you know,
he said that what this really is about,

554
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,654
this isn't about left and right.
He was saying that thIs really is about 

555
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:05,964
authoritarians versus the word of 
porsche and that's what you're really 

556
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,130
talking.
That's the horseshoe.

557
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,890
Yeah.
So,

558
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,723
so somehow though,
I think this is related to religion to 

559
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:15,924
right,
we can relate this very much to 

560
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,510
absolutely.
Thinking of religion.

561
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,220
So can you go down that path for me a 
little bit?

562
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,060
yeah.
So the,

563
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,480
they use many of the same mechanisms.
They have things that are sacred.

564
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,030
In this case,
it's the rise of the victim,

565
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:29,940
the victim hood culture.
They have certain questions,

566
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:30,774
certain ideas can't be questions,
can't be challenged to churches or safe 

567
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,820
space to university campuses are safe 
space.

568
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,880
And,
and so here's what's super interesting.

569
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,310
When I did a talk a few years ago,
uh,

570
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,270
I dunno,
five years,

571
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,060
I don't even know it's on youtube.
Jesus,

572
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,400
the easter bunny.
And other delusions just say no.

573
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,230
Yeah,
I know if you saw that or not,

574
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,064
doesn't matter.
But,

575
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,360
but the people who protested that were 
not chrIstians,

576
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,160
I had some christians come in,
the audience,

577
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:56,994
I speak all around the world.
People are in general with very few 

578
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,850
exceptions.
Christians and muslims are very civil to

579
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:04,860
christians.
I go out for beer off afterwards,

580
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,970
but it's the regressive leftist who,
I mean this,

581
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,360
I mean really think about this.
This is,

582
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,970
this is like the feminist is rice said 
to joe today.

583
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:15,210
It's like the feminists in bed with the 
islamists,

584
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,493
I mean is you just could not conceive of
a relationship that was more eight to 

585
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,110
thetical t two,
one,

586
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:24,240
one of those parties interests,
right?

587
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,950
So,
so it's interesting that,

588
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,380
that,
and I'm pretty sure that the,

589
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,870
the islamic,
no,

590
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,823
uh,
that they're never going to treat these 

591
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,850
women any better.
Right?

592
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,230
It's.
So what is that?

593
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,220
What is that?
I'm sorry to cut you off,

594
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,054
but what is that?
That,

595
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,280
what are they doing?
So they just view.

596
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,203
So these feminists for whatever,
they just view the other as more 

597
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,304
oppressive than they are,
so they just have to give them their 

598
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:46,230
credit.
I mean,

599
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,063
is that,
it's really that simple and that is a 

600
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
comp.
I have thought about that a long time.

601
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:54,750
I think it deals with the color of 
people's skin oppression.

602
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:56,870
I think it deals with,
you know,

603
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,510
this whole third wave feminism that I 
still don't understand.

604
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,970
Uh,
I,

605
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,510
I,
I don't know,

606
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,640
I don't,
I cannot explain to you,

607
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:10,270
and I've thought about it extensively,
how this cohabitation fine,

608
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,070
not a marriage,
but how,

609
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:12,923
how this,
how this bizarre relationship came to 

610
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:18,030
be.

611
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,863
I still cannot understand it.
and the most recent event at goldsmiths 

612
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:24,270
dot dawkins was tweeting on and such.
I mean that is,

613
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,680
that should be a case study for people.
The,

614
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,060
that is even boggling my mind to even 
think about trying to understand that.

615
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,640
Right?
And then so that and,

616
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,550
and all of this and all the stuff that 
we're talking about in this discussion,

617
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,880
it shows again why that if you don't 
help the reformers,

618
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:44,734
the actual reformers who are trying to 
change make things better for women and 

619
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,244
gays and might not even question if you 
don't help these people and you keep 

620
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:52,870
framing these people as the problem.
Well what do you,

621
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,070
do?
You get the rise of trump?

622
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

623
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,880
I'm just going to say that extreme.
I think my treat was something like a,

624
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,630
if you have create environments in which
you can ask questions,

625
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,550
extremist step in with solutions.

626
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,650
And I think that that's exactly right.
Could this,

627
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:08,030
so really could,
do you think that this atmosphere that,

628
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,300
that trump has taken advantage of their,
their sense of palpable fear,

629
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,620
right in America that I haven't felt 
before.

630
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,783
I really do.
I sense that people are feeling like 

631
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,100
everything is screwed up,
that there's,

632
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,200
we have this terrorism stuff.
We don't know what the answers are.

633
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,213
There's this refugee thing.
We're all children of refugees are 

634
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:27,304
descendants of refugees here,
unless you came over as a slave or a 

635
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,870
american indian,
right?

636
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,240
If you were actually indigenous to this 
land.

637
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,313
Um,
and I just had this sense that people 

638
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,594
don't know what's going on.
and then when you shut down the people 

639
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:40,630
on the left,
zach,

640
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,820
then of course trump.
Yeah.

641
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,013
Okay.
So I really wish that every single 

642
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:50,380
person listening to that would put the 
rewind button and listen to that again.

643
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,483
So if you're one of these people who 
thinks that you're doing the world a 

644
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,470
favor by creating,
you know,

645
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,860
triggering,
protecting people who are,

646
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,480
you know,
you want to protect the sensitivities of

647
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:01,931
others.
Again,

648
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:02,764
not a bad impulse at all,
but the consequence of that is that 

649
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:09,040
people become less capable of making 
discerning,

650
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,290
rational judgements,
particularly in the moral sphere.

651
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,273
So the consequence of those things is 
that Donald Trump is right there with 

652
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,870
the answer and I just read a piece about
the number of people who,

653
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,060
who support trump who won't admit it,
is far higher,

654
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,703
which is terrifying and we know that the
way we don't want to create adversarial 

655
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,830
relationships.
I mean if so,

656
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:32,950
I think that part of this problem,
I don't want to go down this rabbit hole

657
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:33,784
necessarily,
but part of this problem is we have to 

658
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,870
engage trump's arguments on his own 
terms.

659
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,063
And part of that is if the idea is that,
that this is going to make America 

660
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,840
safer,
I think that's what we should.

661
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:46,330
We shouldn't appeal to patriotism,
which we should take a look at that.

662
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,193
I don't think that claim is true.
I don't think that's borne out by the 

663
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:49,763
evidence.
I don't think there's any reason to 

664
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,930
think that first off,
it's not even constitutional.

665
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:56,770
Any of the keeping people out based on 
religion or we can accept.

666
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,190
We can just bracket that.
Yeah,

667
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,430
and we can just look at,
okay,

668
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,220
what is the consequences of this?
and you know,

669
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,660
what is the concept?
Well,

670
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:05,494
let's see.
Well what is the content you think that 

671
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,650
muslim,
muslim,

672
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,780
islamic.
It's again,

673
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:13,070
so we need to figure that they're 
getting caught in words.

674
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,530
Even this.
Isn't that the crazy thing?

675
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,393
Yeah.
They've made us also crazy about words 

676
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,030
that whatever you were about to say 
there,

677
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,920
you had to think about it 18 different 
ways.

678
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,753
Even though you're sitting across from 
somebody that you know is okay with the 

679
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,590
idea of what you're going to talk about.
I was,

680
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,120
I was caught because I said,
okaY,

681
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:30,940
well we should have defined the term 
islam is the religion,

682
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:31,774
the belief,
the ideas that so and mostly from the 

683
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:35,104
people of the people and it for some 
reason that seems to be an unbelievably 

684
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,980
too way too complicated for people to 
understand.

685
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,650
I don't understAnd,
why do you think that is?

686
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:43,484
Because it,
and it also seems like they can only do 

687
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:45,674
that with islam,
like the issue only seems to be with 

688
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:50,780
islam because if we were to say anything
about christianity,

689
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:52,220
people would be saying,
great job.

690
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:53,923
You're awesome all day long.
Or if you say anything about radical 

691
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:57,861
islam,
they'll say,

692
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,000
well,
the crusades,

693
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,670
which is right.
So that.

694
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,570
So you did it.
Okay.

695
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,310
So that's right.
Because that's.

696
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,970
Remember I said the values,
they hold her egalitarianism,

697
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,940
relativism for them in their minds.
Egalitarianism.

698
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,370
Look,
every age has had a dominating value.

699
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,550
In aristotle he talks about the and 
gentlemen in homer.

700
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:21,260
It was strengthened little tara was 
humor and now it's,

701
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,780
it's in one side.
It's egalitarianism in relatives.

702
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,500
for them,
everything has to be relative.

703
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:26,300
It'S like the,
the,

704
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,133
the,
uh,

705
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,100
usually the default is relativistic and 
andy galatarian.

706
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,970
So while they have their band guys,
but you have your bad guys.

707
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,863
I'm actually no,
actually those things are not morally 

708
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,490
equivalent.
And so,

709
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,250
so you're asking the question was,
was a pertinent and it's one that should

710
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:48,020
be explored.
Like what is that about?

711
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,960
I think part of it is that we've 
extended the,

712
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,290
the umbrella of rights a wider and wider
and I want to be crystal clear that I'm,

713
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,570
I'm being descriptive,
not evaluative.

714
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,390
I'm describing the state.
I'm not saying it's good or bad,

715
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,020
you know,
I was just at a restaurant with my buddy

716
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,480
there before we came here and you know,
I don't eat,

717
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,420
um,
I try to eat only cruelty free meat so I

718
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,263
won't eat that's school.
So we've now extended the umbrella of 

719
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:15,650
rights to,
to animals,

720
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:17,660
right?
So that is constantly extending.

721
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,770
So the next step for some people is to 
extend that to ideas.

722
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,950
We've extended that and,
and I.

723
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,240
And I think that's really interesting,
right?

724
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,210
You got it.
Sorry,

725
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,560
go ahead.
Yeah,

726
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,393
no,
I want to throw it again in that for a 

727
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,550
second.
So we've extended the ideas of rights,

728
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:35,240
which used to be for people now to 
animals because we want to treat animals

729
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,270
better.
Minority.

730
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,430
The next version of that will be with 
ideas.

731
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,540
So we're going sorta take,
we're going to put on even softer gloves

732
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,870
and when it comes to ideas,
because even that should be held in some

733
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:48,110
sort of.

734
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,950
Yeah,
because people,

735
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:51,620
as I said in my tam talk,
ideas don't deserve dignity.

736
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:53,230
People do,
and it's kind of become a meme,

737
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:54,064
but it's true.
It's,

738
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,190
it's that.
It's just the next kind of radical.

739
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,160
Taking that idea and extending it 
further on,

740
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,593
and the problem with that is that you do
a disservice to those people holding 

741
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:09,170
beliefs because you don't respect their 
beliefs to engage them enough.

742
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,820
Let's do the thing that's really not 
talked about.

743
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,850
This whole enterprise is really one of 
disrespect that they're.

744
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,150
They're trying to engender these values 
of respect but not listening to people,

745
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,300
not engaging people,
people's ideas.

746
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,251
Even,
you know,

747
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,340
you've talked about your show,
the soft bigotry of low expectations.

748
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:31,790
I think it was bush bushes phrase and I 
kept crediting bill maher,

749
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,550
which at least sounded nice.
Now I'm quoting George W.

750
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,840
Bush.
I don't know.

751
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,570
I feel like,
well,

752
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,020
I don't know.

753
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,710
So then you'll be an con,
right?

754
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,250
Everybody's going to gang up on us 
because they're going to say,

755
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,084
look at you guys.
You're really love bush deep in your 

756
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:43,860
heart.
Yeah.

757
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,330
No,
that's actually not true.

758
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,223
That's just a fabrication.
That's the kind of mental gymnastics 

759
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:52,470
people need to do to keep their 
ideological biases in place.

760
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah.
Well that was one of the things,

761
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:54,834
you know when we launched the show in 
order to sam was the first guest and he 

762
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,570
said that they're always looking,
that these people are always looking for

763
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:01,404
something in you,
not that you've said this opinion or 

764
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,094
that you've shared this idea,
but if they can somehow link together 

765
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,360
something that gets them to where they 
want you to be,

766
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,980
you're out.
Yeah,

767
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:16,620
and just thInk about this kind of 
person.

768
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,800
Think about discharging that impulse 
that you have.

769
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,230
Think about the kind of person that you 
are.

770
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,773
It's difficult for me to say without,
without being overly harsh and as soon 

771
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:36,900
as example of a time when someone ought 
to be overly harsh,

772
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,300
but that makes me feel really sad for 
somebody.

773
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,740
Yeah.
Well that's.

774
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,633
That's very much how I feel I had out of
all of this because like I could barely 

775
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,104
speak what I'm saying because this,
this situation has cost me friends and 

776
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:50,154
relationships already and I've only been
talking about this stuff for a couple 

777
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,040
months and so I see the way people have 
turned on me and I,

778
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,660
I've gotten into big debates with 
friends and said,

779
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,530
can you point me to where I said what 
you're accusing me?

780
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,620
And they never do because they can't.
So thAt's that.

781
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,380
So,
so if I may ask you,

782
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,510
what is the point of contention you 
lost?

783
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,643
Was that an issue?
Was it a sweet one who exists in the 

784
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,240
world that we exist in?

785
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,710
That's public person,
uh,

786
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,573
who I no longer talk to anymore who's 
been a good friend of mine for the last 

787
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,393
couple of years,
said that my whole show now is about 

788
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:22,644
bigotry to muslims.
And I said it's actually the complete 

789
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,323
route.
I'm trying to separate people from the 

790
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:34,260
ideology and trying to show that not 
everyone believes this.

791
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:37,140
I brought on people repeatedly to talk 
about tolerance.

792
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,270
You know,
the way they'll frame,

793
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,150
they'll say sam and majid that they're,
uh,

794
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,090
that these are the bigots they're book 
was called.

795
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,170
It was about islam and the future of 
tolerance,

796
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,840
not islam in the future of nuclear war,
you know,

797
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,140
so it's,
it's these mental gymnastics as you just

798
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,430
said.
So what would that person lIke you to do

799
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,480
not talk about it?
I suppose not talk about these important

800
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:58,314
issues.
Okay.

801
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,300
But I'm not going to do that.
Right.

802
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,134
But then again,
that goes back to what we started the 

803
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:03,840
conversation with them.

804
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,580
That's why you get trump's.
Yeah,

805
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,660
exactly.
SO I don't,

806
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,553
I would ask them.
So that's kind of the feasibility test 

807
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:12,300
that I talk about in the book.
And the app haS the feasibility tests.

808
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,343
It's under.
What conditions do you think that that 

809
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:16,170
belief would be?
False.

810
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,180
You can leave.
It doesn't have to be religion.

811
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:20,040
You can use the usability tests is not 
my idea.

812
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:20,874
It's matt mccormick's.
You can use the usability tests with 

813
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:23,664
anything.
So under what conditions could I 

814
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,880
demonstrate to you that I am not a 
biased against muslims hydro?

815
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,380
If they say to you,
well,

816
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:34,590
there are no conditions,
well that's a type of belief closure.

817
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,424
There's,
then there's,

818
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,210
there,
there almost is no conversation.

819
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,510
then you have to take a step back and I 
hate to say this,

820
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:42,790
but to the metal level and have a 
conversation about that.

821
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,710
Um,
but,

822
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,810
but I think that,
I don't know.

823
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,340
I'm now,
now I'm kind of ideating.

824
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:50,650
I think I'm concerned about your 
friendship with this person.

825
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,990
I mean,
I've given up basically because once,

826
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,750
because after being called a bigot 
repeatedly and saying,

827
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,831
actually,
no,

828
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:59,200
and can you point me to any,
and I know I'm not a big,

829
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,490
you know,
uh,

830
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,950
Douglas Murray said something really 
interesting on sam's podcast.

831
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:03,784
He Said,
I have no time anymore for people whose 

832
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,440
intentions are not good.
You know what I mean?

833
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:09,274
So I know I'm not a racist,
so if you want to call me a racist or 

834
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,180
call me a bigot,
it actually,

835
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,560
since I'm not,
it actually,

836
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,600
I don't like being called a racist or a 
bigot,

837
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,780
but it doesn't really have any meaning 
because it's just a word.

838
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,270
If I was secretly racist and you were 
calling me a racist,

839
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:24,460
I suppose I would struggle with it a 
little bit more,

840
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:28,000
but so that's,
that's the hard thing about,

841
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,863
that's that really is difficult about 
dealing with people who are insincere 

842
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,660
and I think a lot of those attacks on 
sam,

843
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,513
like in philosophy,
this thing called a hermaneutic of 

844
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,514
charity.
You want to give everybody a charitable 

845
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,490
reputation and you want to say,
okay,

846
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:41,740
these guys actually believe this stuff,
you know,

847
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,190
but over time you just have to grow up.
Yeah,

848
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,360
I mean I,
I,

849
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,980
I hate to say this,
I'm,

850
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,750
and I don't hate to say this because 
it's.

851
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,540
I should have woken up to this 
conclusion long ago.

852
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,880
I don't think these people are sincere.
No,

853
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,700
I don't think so at all.
But that's hard to grasp too.

854
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,730
It is hard to grasp because if they 
thought they had the truth,

855
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,580
why wouldn't they be sincere?
Yeah.

856
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,680
So excuse me.
That's,

857
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,740
that's the thing thAt kind of keePs me 
from going on a full throttle attack.

858
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:14,560
I mean,
maybe the,

859
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:19,590
their cognitive software has somehow 
been hijacked by this moral.

860
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:24,730
This idea that they think that they're 
defending the downtrodden and we,

861
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,790
you know,
we need to do this as an examPle.

862
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,800
It's okay to do this because we're 
stripping some,

863
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,500
you know,
there's some utilitarian calculus,

864
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:32,801
like,
oh,

865
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:33,634
it's going to be in the greater goods.
I don't know what goes through their 

866
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,900
mind,
but that's the problem with dealing with

867
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:39,370
someone who's insincere.
Yeah.

868
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,610
So I do think that I think that they 
think,

869
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,740
and maybe I,
I'm probably giving them the,

870
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,320
the leash,
that they wouldn't afford me.

871
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,393
Right.
But I do think they think as much as 

872
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,360
said he thought he said they think that 
they were in a war.

873
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,790
So they're gonna use whatever tactics 
they have.

874
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,773
What I find particularly odd about it is
that now that we live in a digital age 

875
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,870
where everything is recorded and you can
be quoted,

876
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,953
you know,
talking to this person about this or 

877
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:07,820
this person about that even when they're
confronted with new evidence or frontier

878
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,350
or exposed as frauds,
they just doubled down even more,

879
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:13,460
which is incredible.
Yeah.

880
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:14,294
So,
so I share your frustration and I'm 

881
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:18,970
sympathetic with it.
Um,

882
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:19,981
I dunno,
I,

883
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:20,814
I would,
I would,

884
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,030
I mean I'm a hey look,
I just,

885
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,120
I'd call your friend again and say,
hey look,

886
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,000
I've been thinking about this.
let's have a talk.

887
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,863
I mean,
I wouldn't let that friendship go 

888
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,960
because that's not like trying to get 
them to sit down.

889
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,740
We did this over text.
They wouldn't even,

890
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,530
they wouldn't even sit to even say let's
get coffee.

891
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,140
that's again,
part of the regressive left.

892
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:41,120
Yeah.
They don't want to have conversations.

893
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,290
They want to end those conversations.
And ironically they turn that against us

894
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,124
and say,
well look,

895
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,040
you guys are the ones who don't want to 
have conversations.

896
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,010
And I look the whole prompt.
This is the schism and liberalism,

897
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:52,844
right?
And it was made can naked on the bill 

898
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:59,921
maher show with ben affleck and sam.
And this is something again,

899
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:02,180
to solve these problems,
we need to be on it.

900
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:04,550
We need to be forthright,
we need to be honest.

901
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,433
We need to create environments where we 
can talk about the problems and almost 

902
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,580
if you were to,
again,

903
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:12,470
create a list of how not to solve your 
problems.

904
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:13,550
These people have it.
I mean,

905
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:14,050
they've done it.

906
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,350
Perfect job.
You know,

907
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,130
what's amazing to me also is that I 
never mean to go this deep into it even.

908
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,230
I really wanted to focus more on 
atheism.

909
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,410
Oh,
I'm happy I'm.

910
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,470
We're going to go there now and I'm 
happy to do this,

911
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:25,304
but what I think is particularly 
fascinating about this is that 

912
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,603
everything else that we talk about and 
that we're going to talk about is so 

913
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,160
related to this.
That's why this,

914
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,033
this whole situation has been so bananas
because this schism has exposed 

915
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:41,600
something that I think people didn't 
really realize.

916
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,760
But let's.
Let's just leave that portion there.

917
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,580
Unless you want to give me a closing 
statement on that and then we'll take it

918
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:47,361
isn't.
No,

919
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:49,610
it isn't.
I just think that we.

920
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,280
This is not a very hopeful time right 
now.

921
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,143
You know,
I mean we're dealing with very serious 

922
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:59,351
ecological issues and we have people who
are apologists for big oil companies and

923
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,930
denialists and end of anthropogenic 
global warming.

924
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,363
And again,
I actually do think those people should 

925
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:10,280
be given a seat at the adult table and 
anybody who has a view different from my

926
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,114
own,
as long as they provide evidence is 

927
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:12,914
welcomed to have a conversation.
I think that there's something that's 

928
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,740
morally damaging about what the 
regresses are doing.

929
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,030
And I think people have had enough.
I have had way more than enough.

930
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,980
And,
and I think now like your,

931
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,873
your show has really caused this 
catalyst almost this cascade of people 

932
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,090
who also feel the same way and they're 
like,

933
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:38,924
mines are gravitating and they've,
they've really robbed us of any idea of 

934
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:47,620
hope that we have because we look at the
presidential campaign and I,

935
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,340
it's just.
Holy moly.

936
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,220
I mean,
I look at the republicans and I think,

937
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,940
wow,
like any one of those people would be an

938
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,070
unmitigated disaster.
Right?

939
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,030
and this is this.

940
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,100
I mean,
we.

941
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,520
All right,
we're just gonna keep going with this,

942
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:01,811
right?
No,

943
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:02,041
no,
no,

944
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:02,874
no,
no,

945
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,833
we'll,
we'll just keep going because you're 

946
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,420
hitting on it that,
that,

947
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,980
this thing is so it's so powerful 
because I watched the republican debates

948
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,420
and I think I could never in good 
conscience vote for all you people.

949
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,770
And,
but now part of,

950
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:21,680
there is a piece of me that when I see 
that there,

951
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,500
this regressive group when they want to,
they all like bernie.

952
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,110
Now there's a piece of me that's like,
do I like the same guy they like,

953
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,750
that's crazy because I do like him,
you know what I mean?

954
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,280
But that's how perverse this whole thing
is.

955
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,680
That's why we have to make sure that we 
separate the message from the messenger.

956
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:36,514
Yeah.
And that's why it's so difficult to do 

957
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:41,280
that when you're constantly smeared.

958
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,620
If you use the wrong pronoun by accent.
Look,

959
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:45,150
I'm 49.
I've been growing up calling.

960
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,781
Uh,
he,

961
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:46,614
he,
I,

962
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,640
I,
it's not mal intent.

963
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:49,474
I'm not,
I don't have some deep moral malignancy 

964
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:52,230
in me that I'm kinda,
you know,

965
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,640
it's like I made a fucking mistake.
And so we have,

966
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,893
again,
we have been there so morally right all 

967
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:00,360
the time too,
you know what I mean?

968
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:01,194
There's so they're always policing 
everyone else's words as if they have 

969
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,960
high gna of ha ha,
that's,

970
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,730
that's part of the genius about this.
Anyway,

971
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,320
let's,
we'll do the atheism thing.

972
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,120
It's crazy though because I do want to 
keep going with this because I feel each

973
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:15,954
week I feel like I can get away from 
this a little bit and then something 

974
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,430
else happens that brings me back into 
it.

975
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,470
And we've talked about it in a little 
more of a lofty way,

976
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:22,980
which is nice.

977
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,500
AlSo,
not so much the nitty gritty of it,

978
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:27,750
but in this sort of,
in sort of a bigger sense.

979
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,010
But uh.
All right.

980
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:30,000
So let's,
let's get to somebody,

981
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,640
and this is all going to relate back to 
it,

982
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,230
but.
So I want to know about new atheists.

983
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,203
There's a,
there's an attack on new atheist as I 

984
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:38,604
understand it.
New atheist pretty much are just 

985
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:43,650
atheists who are finally speaking up 
about atheism.

986
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,570
It may be a little more you,
you define it.

987
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,460
I think a little more specifically write
in the book.

988
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,294
There's a little more about that.
They're actually trying to shoot down 

989
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:51,924
some ideas where an old atheist maybe 
just removed themselves from the 

990
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,280
discussion.
Is that fair?

991
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,323
Yeah,
I mean different people define it 

992
00:45:58,261 --> 00:45:59,190
different ways.
Austin,

993
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,024
dc.
Some people think there's no difference 

994
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:02,850
between new and the old.
I think.

995
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,470
I do think there is a difference.

996
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,303
I think there a little more kind of a 
forthright in their speech and people 

997
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,760
interpret being forthright as being 
disrespectful,

998
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:14,760
overly aggressive.
I think that's a mischaracterization.

999
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:20,150
I think that they've made this,
the additional move from the,

1000
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,303
these,
this set of beliefs or this suite of 

1001
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:27,150
beliefs is irrational to these beliefs 
are delusional.

1002
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,050
And I think from my work delusion has 
been a component of,

1003
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,430
of how I think it's helpful to think 
about the problem and uh,

1004
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,740
but they don't take too kindly to that.
The believer,

1005
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,623
the believer,
the average believer and you say you're 

1006
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:43,900
delusional.
they're usually not that responsive.

1007
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,833
If you do that,
you haven't read the book because you 

1008
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:47,394
never,
you don't want to invoke a defensive 

1009
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,464
posture and something that you want to 
enter into a conversation in which 

1010
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,320
people change their bullies from point 
of view of safety,

1011
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,910
so this is literally what you do in the 
book.

1012
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,743
I mean you lay out the exact tools on 
how you should talk design by line word 

1013
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:06,870
for word as a template that you can use 
and people have gone around.

1014
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,150
One anthonY,
magna,

1015
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:13,760
bosco has gone around videos on youtube 
who implements the uses,

1016
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,860
the scientific method.
What iS your confIdence in this belief?

1017
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,690
Gives an intervention based upon the 
book.

1018
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,110
Now what is your internet post-test,
pretest intervention post stuff,

1019
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,873
and it's amazing that the down moves 
that people make and only five to 10 

1020
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:28,830
minutes.
So we know that this works.

1021
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:33,370
We that this is effective.
We know that these sorts of very civil,

1022
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:35,350
very engaging and that's the other 
thing,

1023
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,184
you never have to worry about anybody 
saying they don't want to talk about 

1024
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:39,010
their faith.
Everybody loves.

1025
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,240
that's the one thing that people will 
get.

1026
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,010
The one commonality among people of 
faith.

1027
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,520
They love to talk about it.
So speaking of talking about it,

1028
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:48,070
I,
you also hit upon how people

1029
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,300
are very selective in what they believe 
and if you get them to admit,

1030
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,720
well I don't believe that a this or that
happened,

1031
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:56,770
right?
I don't believe some heart,

1032
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:57,604
you know,
about chopping off hands are tied to 

1033
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,123
your head.
That's,

1034
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,390
that's the crazy part.
But I believe in this other stuff.

1035
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,780
But I think what you were saying is that
basically if you can get them to sort of

1036
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,033
started meeting something not true,
that's sort of how you pull the string 

1037
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:12,330
right to then leading to getting them to
admit some other stuff probably.

1038
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,263
Yeah.
And in a lot of that is you have to 

1039
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:17,920
create conditions.
And again,

1040
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:20,380
this isn't me,
there's a long body of literature.

1041
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:23,980
There's a long line of literature about 
how to change the behavior of people who

1042
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:26,980
don't want their behavior change.
It's from drug and alcohol counseling.

1043
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:27,810
It's from,
you know,

1044
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,800
motivational interviewing,
cult exiting.

1045
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,950
This is out there,
but nobody is really synthesized it.

1046
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,740
Nobody's brought these disparate 
elements together.

1047
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,933
So

1048
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,070
I was partly thinking this when I was 
reading the book,

1049
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:39,904
what would you,
what would you say is the problem if 

1050
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:42,544
there's the average person that's a 
believer that uses religion for 

1051
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:48,250
community,
you know,

1052
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,010
celebrate some holidays,
whatever the religion might be,

1053
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,220
um,
but isn't doing anything,

1054
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:54,790
uh,
you know,

1055
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:55,623
not,
not the people that are beheading 

1056
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:56,914
people,
but if you're just some average person 

1057
00:48:58,031 --> 00:48:59,650
that doesn't necessarily take your faith
seriously,

1058
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,510
but you get some sense of community,
whatever it is,

1059
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,660
do you see an inherent problem in that?
Or is that just for you?

1060
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:05,590
It's like,
well,

1061
00:49:05,591 --> 00:49:07,980
you're just sort of diluted,
but alright,

1062
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:08,830
go,
go with it.

1063
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,663
I do see a problem because I think that 
people are wasting their life energy on 

1064
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:16,024
something that's not true.
They are harboring of belief about 

1065
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:19,744
reality that is almost definitely false.
And we just know this empirically 

1066
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:23,884
because of the number of different 
religions that make different claims 

1067
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:27,880
about the world.
They can't all be right.

1068
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,000
In fact,
there are contradictions.

1069
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,180
Perfect one,
jesus was crucified.

1070
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,010
Jesus was not crucified islam.
Christianity.

1071
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,550
Mohammed was the last prophet.
muhammad was a prophet for mormons.

1072
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,780
So people are harboring views about 
reality that are true.

1073
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,450
The other thing is I've heard people say
that a lot and I have to challenge.

1074
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,930
I have to push back with you on 
something.

1075
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,380
I'm not so sure that people can hold a 
private belief.

1076
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:58,430
I'm not so sure that somebody can have a
belief and had not had that belief bleed

1077
00:49:58,431 --> 00:49:59,470
out.
Interaction.

1078
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,623
hmm.

1079
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,770
Not necessarily base speaking it,
but just by the way they are.

1080
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,870
Can you give me an

1081
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,281
yeah,
well that,

1082
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:09,380
that's what it means to hold a belief.
I wouldn't say so.

1083
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,270
Like I,
I don't like people.

1084
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,650
I'm thinking about homosexuality,
but that's to charge so many users.

1085
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,750
Your blazer,
like I don't like guys who.

1086
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,170
This is a nice blazer.
We're brooks brothers.

1087
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:22,004
I'm just going to make that.
I like guys who have brooks boilers but 

1088
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,940
like if I can't stand the smell 
different,

1089
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:26,691
they look different,
you know?

1090
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,950
But,
but I'm not gonna.

1091
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,810
I'm not gonna let that.
I'm not going to show that.

1092
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:30,644
Like if I meet some,
I can work with someone who has a 

1093
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:32,600
blazer.
I can.

1094
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,543
I think what it means that that's almost
a denial of what it means to have a 

1095
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,870
belief,
to hold a belief about something so,

1096
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,853
so I'm also not sure that these beliefs 
are as benign as people think that they 

1097
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:48,140
are.
And every time I bring that up,

1098
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:49,310
people will bring out a study.

1099
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,890
Well look at this like,
you know,

1100
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,780
religiosity in this group correlated.
The smart people will say correlated.

1101
00:50:55,781 --> 00:50:59,060
The less intellectually adjoined people 
will say,

1102
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:02,600
you know,
some causal correlated,

1103
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,710
okay,
whatever.

1104
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,753
It's a huge difference,
but let's just go with it a look what 

1105
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:08,864
happened to you have religion,
you have lower incidence of heart 

1106
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:11,654
disease or whatever it is.
I think that the word you used before 

1107
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,440
was apt.
It's community.

1108
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,210
Those benefits can be found from 
community and you can get communities of

1109
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:24,140
likeminded people without believing any 
superstitious silliness.

1110
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,370
You know,
you can get,

1111
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,840
you can get like the same sports team.
I mean,

1112
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,060
he has a community.
Yeah.

1113
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,390
And,
and I think that you say,

1114
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:33,224
well,
what's the harm of someone rooting for 

1115
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,010
the patriots?
I don't know anything about football.

1116
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,810
What's the harm of someone rooting for 
the patriots?

1117
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,600
Well,
that,

1118
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,433
that that's this analogous because 
you're not claiming that it's objective 

1119
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:43,520
lee.

1120
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,140
True.
Right?

1121
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:45,974
And so if I think that the patriots are 
ordained by god to win the superbowl or 

1122
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,460
whatever it is that they do,
you know,

1123
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,220
again,
I don't know anything about sports.

1124
00:51:54,221 --> 00:51:54,851
So thought was good.
Yeah.

1125
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:55,980
Linda,
thanks super bowl.

1126
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,760
They'll take me down that road.
I travel,

1127
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,900
then I get 50 hate mails.
People love football.

1128
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,160
Um,
so,

1129
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,083
so I think that the problem is that 
people make objective claims and they 

1130
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:10,760
live their lives accordingly.
And this is all you got,

1131
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,250
man.
Zach just said,

1132
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,323
so wouldn't it be better for those 
people to be invited to see reality for 

1133
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:20,684
what it is?
Wouldn't it be better to give those 

1134
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:26,060
people an opportunity to flourish?
Because if your beliefs,

1135
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,583
if one belief,
it's like you can look at it as like an 

1136
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,270
architect tonic struggling like a big 
building,

1137
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:33,104
right?
If one of your beliefs on the bottom 

1138
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:38,780
level of that building,
it's contaminated like a base belief,

1139
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,614
like jesus rose from the dead order,
then all of the beliefs that flow from 

1140
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,610
that are stemmed from that becomes 
suspect.

1141
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,440
So if you,
if you.

1142
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,363
So what's the harm?
The harm is that if you want to enaBle 

1143
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,980
yourself to flourish and you want to 
enable your community to flourish,

1144
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,370
you have to align your beliefs with 
reality because if you don't,

1145
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,613
then what you think is objective,
moral of the right thing to do will 

1146
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:05,420
actually be leading you away from 
flourishing.

1147
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,321
Right?
So that's interesting.

1148
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:07,154
So almost in a way you then systemically
you have to constantly be compromising 

1149
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,620
because no matter how much new evidence 
comes in to prove something else,

1150
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,130
you really have to skirt around it 
because you built sort of your,

1151
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,520
your base in things that aren't true.
Yeah,

1152
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,810
and you put your finger on the cognitive
problem.

1153
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:27,930
The cognitive problem is then in order 
to reconcile that,

1154
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,410
they make a virtue out of not revising 
their beliefs.

1155
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,950
they make a sin.
Then you need to import new words,

1156
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,880
words that have words that are anathema 
to belief,

1157
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,714
revision like sin,
like sacred and that buttresses or 

1158
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,080
protects those beliefs from being 
revised.

1159
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,123
So there's a whole mechanism to keep 
this that almost like I talked about in 

1160
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:52,824
the book,
it's.

1161
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,873
It's almost if you look at it 
epidemiologically how these things 

1162
00:53:57,391 --> 00:53:58,470
spread,
like memes.

1163
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:02,760
They spread the medically.
When you really think about that,

1164
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,103
the harm is that literally billions of 
people are living in ways that they 

1165
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:10,074
think is just and kind and right and 
it's not and nation states are created 

1166
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,073
around that and we're in a very serious 
problem with technology and the 

1167
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:23,430
instantaneous flow of an access of 
information.

1168
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,490
We are in a problem that we can no 
longer afford.

1169
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:28,740
Not only to ignore that,
but to disallow.

1170
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,643
There we go the rest of leftist ago,
but to disallow conversations about 

1171
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:34,074
those things.
We look a shocking number of people in 

1172
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,740
this country,
and I'm ashamed to say this,

1173
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,960
but that doesn't.
Don't Shoot the messenger.

1174
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,520
Do not want muslim immigration.
They want to target people and not their

1175
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:50,700
beliefs.
We need to have a talk about that,

1176
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,930
ignoring that is not only not going to 
make it go away,

1177
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,093
but it's going to make that percentage 
increase and that's the thing that the 

1178
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:01,680
regressives just cannot seem to 
understand that.

1179
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,340
So,
and of course we're back to no,

1180
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,890
but that's okay.
So the but the point being that.

1181
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:11,150
so then if you were to take someone like
sam who's having extremely difficult,

1182
00:55:11,151 --> 00:55:16,151
complex thought out conversations about 
the difference between islam and muslims

1183
00:55:16,491 --> 00:55:18,380
and islam,
islam and jihad and all those things,

1184
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,290
and if you put him in the same bank as 
trump,

1185
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,080
there is nobody left.
I think that for me exactly,

1186
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:24,914
that for me is why I've taken this so 
that I've taken this thing on because I 

1187
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,114
saw this guy who I told sam to his face.
I didn't even know who he was before 

1188
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:32,750
that,
right?

1189
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,461
Believe it or not,
I,

1190
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:35,300
I didn't reallY know.
I didn't follow them on twitter.

1191
00:55:35,301 --> 00:55:37,490
I had never read any of his books.
I had maybe heard of him,

1192
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,830
but I watched that thing and I thought,
jeSus,

1193
00:55:39,831 --> 00:55:40,664
here's a guy trying to tell the truth on
some pretty controversial things and 

1194
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:45,110
look at the way he's beIng the

1195
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,293
even trying to ask questions and that's 
what's so interesting and that's what 

1196
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:52,720
you moral look.
It's complicated.

1197
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,853
Moral arguments are just complicated.
That's why you have guys very smart 

1198
00:55:58,031 --> 00:55:58,864
individuals who have substantive 
disagreements about eating animals 

1199
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:02,914
factory from this is complicated,
but that's more reason and not less 

1200
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:07,624
reason to talk about it and what they've
done to sam is that they have created 

1201
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:15,100
conditions to make it impossible for 
people to speak.

1202
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,390
They have really done exactly the 
opposite of what they.

1203
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,990
The danger of what's going on in the 
colleges really,

1204
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,760
because you were usIng.
Sam is one example of this,

1205
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,853
but if they can breathe that ideology in
the colleges now it goes to what you 

1206
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:30,754
were saying before.
You worry about the future because now 

1207
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,720
you're going to bring up all these 
people with all this idea.

1208
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:39,130
So it was some of this though that to 
have these conversations.

1209
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,270
First off,
people,

1210
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,133
we view things on vine in six seconds,
140 characters and I'm really happy to 

1211
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:45,994
be doing long form again and I really do
believe that it's coming back and I get 

1212
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,640
emails every day saying that people are 
digging it so we're on to something,

1213
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:52,743
but it's part of it that to have real 
discussions about real things and 

1214
00:56:58,061 --> 00:56:58,894
especially when you take,
when you do it from the religious angle 

1215
00:57:00,471 --> 00:57:02,530
and and atheism and all that.
Well,

1216
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,603
you're basically bill maher and dawkins 
and a couple oTher people that are 

1217
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:07,564
really in the limelight of it and that 
you're putting too much on a few people 

1218
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,793
and that's sort of the reverse of how 
this should go if you want to have real 

1219
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:15,970
open discussion.
Right?

1220
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

1221
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,780
Putting a lot on a few people.
Aaron,

1222
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,000
for example,
sorry to,

1223
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:23,110
but for example,
people always.

1224
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:26,230
I'll defend bill maher in related to 
this and people say,

1225
00:57:26,231 --> 00:57:27,064
well,
he's a dick about it and he's throwing 

1226
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:31,000
it in everyone's face and all that.
And although we say,

1227
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:34,390
well,
I grant him a leash on this because he's

1228
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:36,340
fighting the good fight,
in my view,

1229
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:37,174
he's fighting thing that's so hard to do
and really using reason to explain 

1230
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:43,030
complex things.
So I have to,

1231
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,660
if he's a little bit of a dick about it.
Alright.

1232
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:46,963
It's guess what?
There's plenty of dicks or the other 

1233
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:48,844
side too.

1234
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,390
It's interesting.
And again,

1235
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,270
I think again,
afflecks respect clip was just perfect.

1236
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,590
Afflecks response was so implematic.
Now I don't know if rogan's right.

1237
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:00,570
I have no idea if this guy is such a 
good actor.

1238
00:58:00,571 --> 00:58:01,890
He had us all believe in.
I really,

1239
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:03,030
I can't.
I don't,

1240
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:03,864
I don't know the answer to that,
but I do know is that that reaction is 

1241
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:09,750
more typical than ever now and we need 
less of that reaction.

1242
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:14,280
Here's one way that we may want to think
about getting less of that reaction.

1243
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,160
And I'm not being facetious when I say 
is an incredibly sincere.

1244
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,760
virtually every time I speak to some and
not every time,

1245
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,653
you know,
they're a professional apologist and 

1246
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:25,800
that goes out the window virtually every
time.

1247
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,360
Excuse me,
when I'm speaking with someone,

1248
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,480
I always think to myself maybe they know
something.

1249
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:35,481
I don't know if you can just attempt to 
hold that in your head in.

1250
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,800
I have found in conversations with 
religious people,

1251
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:44,160
it's been very helpful.
I will admit to you,

1252
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,053
I almost cannot do that any longer with 
the regressives because because they 

1253
00:58:49,531 --> 00:58:53,190
make a slip of the tongue into some 
monstrous,

1254
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,950
heinous act or I always feel that it's 
personal.

1255
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,770
Like it's deeply personal.
Like there's something,

1256
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:03,743
there's something in me that they need 
to cleanse or something like there's 

1257
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:08,720
some kind of like,
well that's what I mean

1258
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,573
about the authority or anything.
Like they're in a weird way they're 

1259
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,700
doing religious trickery.

1260
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,070
They are doing.
Yeah,

1261
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:14,943
right.
Yeah.

1262
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,810
The horseshoe they're buying.
Yeah.

1263
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,760
they're using a lot of the tactics.
So the question is like,

1264
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,940
what do we,
how do we engage these people?

1265
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:26,660
I mean this is a very.
This is a very difficult question.

1266
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,860
Particularly when they now have at their
disposal.

1267
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:33,920
They've been there,
they've infested academia,

1268
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:34,933
you know,
like what do we do in these people now 

1269
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,190
the rule makers.
Well,

1270
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:40,340
it's interesting that the more I try to 
bring this towards atheism,

1271
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:44,270
the more it comes back to this because 
it seems to me that they're there at the

1272
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,104
attacks that they've done on the new 
atheists where they use it as a 

1273
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:48,800
pejorative.
Now you're a new atheist.

1274
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:51,580
It's sort of some sort of evil creature,
even though I don't know many.

1275
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,650
I don't know anyone really that 
identifies as a new atheist as a,

1276
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,510
I don't think maybe sam does.

1277
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,590
I,
I'm not even sure.

1278
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:59,030
Um,
I don't know,

1279
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,193
but they've just muddied the water.
You were just saying you don't identify 

1280
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,710
as an atheist.
So yeah,

1281
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,210
I mean,
you can attempt to smear me.

1282
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:06,044
You can attempt to.
But the irony is joe and I talked about 

1283
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:09,264
this.
It's like I have never heard a person 

1284
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:13,460
used the word intersectional who wasn't 
just a nasty,

1285
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,330
who wasn't just a really just mean 
spirited,

1286
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,040
angry person.
Yeah.

1287
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,650
And so,
and,

1288
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,523
and I think that is part of the.
Of course I should be indignant because 

1289
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,204
I'm a good person.
Good people become indignant at these 

1290
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:28,994
things.
Yeah.

1291
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,860
So,
okay,

1292
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,170
we're going to talk about atheism or 
we're going to go back.

1293
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,340
Okay,
this is fine.

1294
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:36,230
We're Going to do what kind of chart 
could we do on this?

1295
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,220
I'm ready to back.
Yeah,

1296
01:00:38,221 --> 01:00:39,170
I know.
I know you're going with me.

1297
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:44,350
So I think part of the problem is also 
that when people have made the choice to

1298
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,520
make the leap of faith,
right,

1299
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:50,090
whatever the religion that they've 
jumped in in a certain way,

1300
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:51,343
even though I think in their eyes 
they're doing something very lofty and 

1301
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:55,070
in a certain way you're doing,
you're just.

1302
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,980
I view it as sort of like you're giving 
up sort of your like this.

1303
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,823
The world is a pretty fucked up place.
I don't know the answer so I'm just 

1304
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,940
going to leap and just hope that this.
So is that,

1305
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,060
is that part of why it makes the 
rational person's argument to them?

1306
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:08,894
Very difficult because there you're,
you're arguing against something that's 

1307
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:15,290
not rational in its most pure form that 
I.

1308
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,840
Did I get somewhere there.
Yeah.

1309
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:17,903
I don't know.
Only because I think different people 

1310
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,230
believe for different reasons and so.

1311
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,900
So I,
I don't know.

1312
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:27,943
here's what I do know,
unlike this belief that seems to be out 

1313
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:33,770
everywhere,
it seems to be going around,

1314
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,500
you can actually reason people on an 
audit of unreasonable positions.

1315
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:38,490
In fact,
I was just talking to my.

1316
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,180
My buddy that's a couple of days ago,
john w dot loftis.

1317
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,373
I wrote the forward to his new book.
He was a disciple of the greatest 

1318
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,660
christian apologist senator.
He reasoned,

1319
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,540
so jerry [inaudible],
the list goes on and on and on of people

1320
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:55,541
who have done that,
and I think it doesn't start with reason

1321
01:01:56,121 --> 01:01:57,800
so much.
It starts with honesty.

1322
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:02,780
You really think there was a talking 
snake like no bullshit like you think,

1323
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,883
but yet if you looked at your garden and
you're raking up and a snake started 

1324
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:07,910
talking to you,
you'd be freaking out,

1325
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,650
right?
Yeah.

1326
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:09,780
So,
so I.

1327
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:11,810
Nobody would believe you and no one 
would believe you.

1328
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,644
Right?
so these things cohere in a very 

1329
01:02:14,391 --> 01:02:16,970
complicated.
Not to use a big word,

1330
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:19,740
but covariance set of beliefs that 
reinforced our beliefs,

1331
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,070
et cetera,

1332
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,290
et cetera.
So I don't think that there's.

1333
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,490
We can narrow it down to one note or one
data point for why people believe.

1334
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,920
I think it's a very complex equation.
Yeah.

1335
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:29,551
You know,
it's funny,

1336
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,490
I haven't thought of this so literally 
until just this second,

1337
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:34,980
but years ago,
I think in 1997,

1338
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,083
so I was 21.
I went to Egypt and I was at mount 

1339
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:39,414
sinai,
which is supposedly where moses got the 

1340
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,290
10 commandments and I hiked up the 
mountain.

1341
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,600
It's a long hike.
You're supposed to do it at night.

1342
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:47,130
I did it during the day I ran out of 
water.

1343
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:47,964
I mean I was basically delusional.
My stomach was messed up from apes and 

1344
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,340
bad pigeon in cairo.
I mean I was.

1345
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,333
If I was,
if there was ever a moment where I was 

1346
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:55,014
gonna have a spiritual awakening,
like that's where it was because I was 

1347
01:02:56,911 --> 01:02:58,950
compromised in my body.

1348
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,960
Right.
And I remember not getting it all.

1349
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:01,794
I mean,
I remember going to the top of that 

1350
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:05,820
thing and thinking like if,
if there's something here,

1351
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,890
you got to give me a sign,
right?

1352
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:08,724
Like if there's something here and this 
is where moses supposedly saw the 

1353
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,920
burning bush and got the 10 commandments
and all that,

1354
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,070
then you've got to give me something and
there was nothing.

1355
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:22,340
So for me that was sort of like,
oh god is very good at hiding.

1356
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:25,200
Yeah,
great height or this guy.

1357
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,600
Yeah,
and I think that that's kind of.

1358
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,220
I mean,
if you Really think about this,

1359
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,473
I apologize ahead of time.
If this loWers your iq by a couple of 

1360
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,020
points for jews,
peep,

1361
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,730
people will say,
well,

1362
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:40,560
that's why you need faith because there 
is no evidence or there is no.

1363
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:43,020
There is nothing for god.
You just have to have faith in that,

1364
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,620
but you don't act that way in any other 
aspect of your life.

1365
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,453
Like you know,
there's no other arena in that in what 

1366
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:53,190
you think like that.
Can I,

1367
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,133
can I go back to your friend,
your friend again because they're still 

1368
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:58,794
thinking about this.
So what if you had another belief that 

1369
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:06,870
had nothing to do with muslims or islam 
that that friend found odious,

1370
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,980
they would probably let it slide.
I think that's where you're going.

1371
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,270
That's what I'm going.
Yeah,

1372
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,223
that's what I'm.
That's what I'm amazed about with this 

1373
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:15,594
whole thing.
This seems to be the one sticking point 

1374
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,130
they can.
So what is that?

1375
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,980
What does that so,
so vachon opportunity.

1376
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,450
I'll tell you what that is.
that's an opportunity for your friend to

1377
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:28,284
reflect,
to sincerely reflect about the moral 

1378
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:38,091
priority that she or he has given this 
one issue and to ask yourself,

1379
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,590
well,
does that seem just as an outsider,

1380
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:41,963
as an outsider,
does that seem that that this one issue 

1381
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:45,630
should trump everything else?

1382
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,580
Because I'm frankly,
I don't even know if I'm concerned about

1383
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:51,414
their wellbeing.
I'm concerned about their well 

1384
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,593
priorities.
Well that was also part when we were 

1385
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:57,054
having this discussion,
but you get amazon text which also felt 

1386
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:01,770
so weekend.
It felt like nothing.

1387
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:02,604
You know,
when you're having a video conversation 

1388
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:04,134
with someone and you can feel a weight 
to it and you can feel important to do 

1389
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:09,210
it over text felt ridiculous.
I mean not even email,

1390
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,073
which also wouldn't have felt great,
but I could not get this person to sit 

1391
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:14,260
down with me,
um,

1392
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,390
that there would've been nothing else.
And I,

1393
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,190
and that's your point,
there would be nothing else.

1394
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,113
And when I said,
well,

1395
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,043
is there evidence of this?
Have I ever in all the time that you've 

1396
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:24,590
known me,
right?

1397
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:29,920
Was I secretly doing this yet?
So here's the thing that I've been,

1398
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:30,783
I've been saying it about the thing that
I try to be careful of what I've been 

1399
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,473
noticing.
It's like I sometimes if somebody has a 

1400
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:39,014
belief that's just so out in left field,
it's really easy for me and I try to 

1401
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:44,720
rein myself in with this internal 
tendency.

1402
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:45,554
I don't verbalize it articulated if 
thinking that these people have mental 

1403
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,320
disorders,
like it's very,

1404
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,630
you know.
and then I'll talk to people who believe

1405
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:56,030
in actual talking snakes and stuff.
And again,

1406
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:57,620
these are very nice people.
They're very easy to talk to.

1407
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:00,820
I debated the guy in perth,
a,

1408
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,070
I still keep in touch with them,
written to each other.

1409
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:08,300
There is something about literally 
believes that he talks to the snakes.

1410
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,590
No,
in talking snakes,

1411
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:10,930
like in the bible.
Oh,

1412
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,530
leave that.
He did him.

1413
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:12,930
Yeah.
No,

1414
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:13,430
no,
no.

1415
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,780
That's a whole different level of 
person.

1416
01:06:14,781 --> 01:06:15,441
And I said,
yeah,

1417
01:06:15,441 --> 01:06:16,460
that,
that is,

1418
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,420
uh,
and it's,

1419
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,410
it's,
it's very difficult for me,

1420
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:22,130
dave,
I,

1421
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:22,963
I try not to characterize people whose 
beliefs are so far afield of mine that 

1422
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,410
they have mental disorders and I find 
it,

1423
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,313
I think I find that the type of people 
who go into religion are the sort of 

1424
01:06:36,411 --> 01:06:40,250
people who tend to be imbalanced anyway 
and they find a nice community for that,

1425
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:44,570
a way to discharge those bizarre blues.
It's the same thing with the regressives

1426
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,860
oh,
you're supposed to keep talking about.

1427
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:47,383
Yeah,
they find this wonderful social justice 

1428
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:51,524
warrior place where they can be behind 
their keyboard and angry and smear 

1429
01:06:54,441 --> 01:06:57,710
people that get all the hate and the 
reach and they.

1430
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,293
And it's very difficult for me to rein 
myself in and not write them all off as 

1431
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:05,660
people who have mental disorders.
And I'm,

1432
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:07,460
as part of my work,
man,

1433
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:08,230
I'm trying.

1434
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:12,140
I hear you in the most that I can 
possibly hear someone.

1435
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,060
Yeah,
I hear you.

1436
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:18,130
And that's why I find it exhausting and 
it is exhausting.

1437
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:19,510
I wonder,
so for you,

1438
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,300
even before the regressive thing took 
hold so much,

1439
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,730
this discussion,
a discussion about,

1440
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:25,803
you know,
free thinking and critical thinking 

1441
01:07:27,071 --> 01:07:27,904
versus faith and things you can prove 
and then you toss in some of the 

1442
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,990
regressives how exhausting is this for 
you on a,

1443
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:39,850
on a day to day basis because I do find 
that it can be extremely exhausting that

1444
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:40,684
at the end of the day I can have trouble
shutting off my mind or I'll wake up at 

1445
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:45,274
six and I click on twitter and then I 
immediately see craziness before I've 

1446
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,790
gotten out of bed and I do find it sort 
of exhausting.

1447
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,530
What about for you?

1448
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:53,363
Yeah,
I think that's because you care a lot 

1449
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:58,500
and I don't really care about like the 
negative things people send it to.

1450
01:07:58,501 --> 01:07:59,334
I really don't.
I mean I legitimately don't die of 

1451
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,380
pressing things that I care about my 
family and my health.

1452
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:05,290
Friendships,
you know,

1453
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,173
relationships and I don't.
But I guess in a sense I'm genuinely 

1454
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:11,334
interested in what people believe and 
why they believe it and how it's 

1455
01:08:14,251 --> 01:08:15,084
possible to hold preposterous beliefs.
So it's just presently perennially 

1456
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,053
interesting to me.
What's problematic though in what is 

1457
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:23,804
exhausting are the constant ways that I 
self because I'm afraid of academic 

1458
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:33,260
punishment or they're constantly and I 
just had another complaint filed against

1459
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:34,094
me or the ways that I can't.
And it's not that I know that the 

1460
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:38,534
administration has said anything to me.
It's the culture in which were the 

1461
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:42,134
Academic culture now is you,
you just have to be extremely cautious 

1462
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:46,664
about what you say,
particularly in regard to islam or 

1463
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:50,030
particularly regardless.

1464
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:53,120
There are certain things you don't have 
to be conscious whatsoever.

1465
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,073
If you want to criticize big pharma,
you can just use a thing like in class 

1466
01:08:57,681 --> 01:09:01,190
you can say fuck shit,
you can say want but don't use a pronoun

1467
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,760
wrong or don't say,
you know,

1468
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,490
don't slip again.
Forty $9 with the retarded word.

1469
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,360
I don't do that anymore.
But you know,

1470
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,413
the things that are exhausting to me are
the mechanisms that are in place that 

1471
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,943
prohibit the free expression of ideas 
and not necessarily that I don't have 

1472
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,040
tenure and I'll never get tenure.
Not necessarily that anything.

1473
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,180
It would be a career ender,
but it is a theft of my time.

1474
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:29,150
It is now.
I have to constantly go deal with it and

1475
01:09:29,151 --> 01:09:31,550
I have to have it in the back of my mind
and then,

1476
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,780
oh,
if I say something else,

1477
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:33,614
I have another complaint and then I'll 
be the guy who gets all these 

1478
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:36,290
complaints.

1479
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:39,140
So it's working within these and you 
know,

1480
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:39,974
the other thing I was thinking about 
last night is that what this does in 

1481
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:47,000
essence is it pushes the whole system 
towards mediocrity.

1482
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:51,260
It pushes the whole system because then 
people are afraid to voice controversial

1483
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:56,261
ideas or opinions or give sides that 
students wouldn't here.

1484
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:00,260
They want to be the people who don't get
complaints filed against them.

1485
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,780
So they take the evil,
the,

1486
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,633
the ease you,
they take the easy courses you know in 

1487
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,890
and what they're not talking about is 
like,

1488
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,100
for example,
nothing to do with the regressive left,

1489
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:10,934
but our end,
a cognitive disability in it's 

1490
01:10:13,611 --> 01:10:14,444
challenged.
More philosophy were to read a great 

1491
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:19,400
book about that.
We're not talking about the status.

1492
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:20,234
Peter singer has really interesting 
stuff about this philosopher of what 

1493
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:23,983
should the status of cognitively 
disabled people be and he says they 

1494
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:30,420
should be more equivalent and treatment 
too.

1495
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,610
I don't want to mischaracterize them,
but to to to basically a pigs and cows.

1496
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,223
I think that that's an important 
conversation to have and the whole 

1497
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:43,310
system is then being pushed towards 
mediocrity because professors don't want

1498
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:44,720
to deal with it.
They don't.

1499
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,010
They just can't stomach or handle all 
these ridiculous student complaints,

1500
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:50,590
so they just don't teach it.
Yeah.

1501
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,120
Why are you never going to get tenure?
All.

1502
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:53,954
I was told that I could publish 10 books
from harvard and I never get tenure 

1503
01:10:56,391 --> 01:10:57,224
here.
It was like the best thing that ever 

1504
01:10:58,851 --> 01:10:59,684
happened in the moment after this guy,
my I won't say who is this person told 

1505
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,680
me this.
I wrote an article.

1506
01:11:05,681 --> 01:11:06,111
I'm like,
well,

1507
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:06,944
okay,
well since I'm never going to get 

1508
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:08,990
tenure,
and I know that there's nothing I can do

1509
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:11,270
independent of my accomplishments,
I'll never get promoted.

1510
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,400
I it just felt was the most freeing 
feeling ever.

1511
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,400
I left his office and I wrote a little 
piece of something that I published,

1512
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,980
some like a,
what should the role of the educator be?

1513
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:26,730
And I said that the role of the educator
should be to change students' beliefs if

1514
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:30,720
they're not in alignment with reality,
seems to be totally uncontroversial.

1515
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,570
My colleagues freaked out about it.
The piece went viral.

1516
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,823
This is brief how this chronology and I 
got in touch with sam harris and then 

1517
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,593
uh,
some guy from paul party from 

1518
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:44,760
philosophy,
so said you want to do a podcast?

1519
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:45,594
And when the podcast sam harris tweeted,
we need more educators like peter 

1520
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,370
boghossian,
how I got in touch with dawkins.

1521
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:54,510
Dawkins just tweeted it and that,
that just started this whole cascade.

1522
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,480
But I've never felt more free to talk 
about anything that I want,

1523
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,070
knowing that I could be fired at any 
instant.

1524
01:11:59,130 --> 01:11:59,970
I'd love that.
Actually.

1525
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:01,500
It's a freedom that I relish.

1526
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,413
Well,
I love it.

1527
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,300
I love it because it shows you the 
importance of ideas,

1528
01:12:05,301 --> 01:12:08,360
which is really,
that's the big thing here,

1529
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,090
that everything else is couched in,
right?

1530
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,770
That you had an idea,
you shared it.

1531
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:17,060
And then your idea was shared by people 
that you respect and admire,

1532
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,360
who you credit in your book for helping 
you get to this place,

1533
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:25,361
and then they spread an idea and that,
I guess to sort of bring this all around

1534
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:26,623
is what the regressives are fearing.
And That's why they want to silence 

1535
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:31,970
everyone because they don't like.
They don't like your ideas.

1536
01:12:31,971 --> 01:12:32,804
Right?
So that they're not going to debate 

1537
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:34,860
them.
Yeah.

1538
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,550
They don't like it.
They think they have the truth.

1539
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:40,970
It is really a bizarre kind of a pistol.
Logical myopia.

1540
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:42,270
Not even,
it's just that they,

1541
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,030
they have these ideas that they're 
completely convinced are true.

1542
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:48,140
Again,
like religion,

1543
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:51,200
holding them makes them better people.
They're sacrosanct.

1544
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,010
You can't criticism.
Not only can you,

1545
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:56,280
you can't even ask about him.
Can you ask how they derived it?

1546
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:58,310
Bang.
Interlaced in there.

1547
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,193
So morally sure of sanctimonious.
I guess that's why I wanted to bring 

1548
01:13:03,141 --> 01:13:03,974
this around to relate it to religion 
because I had been trying to put this 

1549
01:13:06,501 --> 01:13:07,334
all together and there is these 
underpinnings that are so the same of 

1550
01:13:10,161 --> 01:13:13,890
the authoritarian religious thing.
It's all there.

1551
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:14,724
It really is all there.
It's like they hate really there on the 

1552
01:13:16,281 --> 01:13:17,870
left.
So they hate religion,

1553
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:19,851
christianity,
right?

1554
01:13:19,851 --> 01:13:21,950
Then they have one religion that they 
want to protect,

1555
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,090
uh,
because it's,

1556
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,110
it's,
uh,

1557
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,870
the downtrodden religions and then it 
just,

1558
01:13:26,871 --> 01:13:29,900
everything they do is in,
it's a constant shell game.

1559
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:30,943
They're just moving the goal posts all 
the time and how intellectually 

1560
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:34,220
exhausting must that be for them.

1561
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,383
And I don't think it's that tiring for 
them because they're just so ingenuine 

1562
01:13:37,821 --> 01:13:38,654
and since that's what I've come to 
believe because many people every day I 

1563
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:44,030
get email people saying,
why don't you sit down with one of these

1564
01:13:44,031 --> 01:13:44,661
guys and there's,
you know,

1565
01:13:44,661 --> 01:13:47,090
there's a list of the public ones that I
could sit down with,

1566
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:47,924
right?
And I know some of them personally and 

1567
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:49,890
it's like,
what,

1568
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,873
what could we do if I had been exposed 
repeatedly as liars as they have and as 

1569
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:59,510
repeatedly with bad intention.
So then for you,

1570
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,930
for you someone that deals in the moral 
landscape Without religion,

1571
01:14:02,931 --> 01:14:04,250
right?
And deals and critical thinking,

1572
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,640
what,
what should the decision process be?

1573
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:08,700
For me?
You know,

1574
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,060
because I think about all the times.
Yeah,

1575
01:14:10,061 --> 01:14:11,220
I guess I could do it.
I.

1576
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,010
Okay,
so

1577
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,620
here,
here's a piece of mine.

1578
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:17,680
My friend jerry coyne said this to me,
very evolutionary biologist,

1579
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,753
very useful piece of information when 
somebody's trying to say this without 

1580
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,530
pumping this,
giving this person in the identity.

1581
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:29,050
But here's what I think you should do it
give you the piece of advice he gave me.

1582
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:29,963
Yeah,
people are going to criticize you no 

1583
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,830
matter what.
So if someone says to you,

1584
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,110
hey,
you know I'm going to donate to charity,

1585
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:36,790
I'm going to do this.
The question I think is,

1586
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,960
do you think that this person is sincere
and honest in their engagement with you?

1587
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:47,110
Not what would I get out of it?
Not what would they get out of it,

1588
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,780
not even what would it do to further the
discourse,

1589
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,614
but is this a sincere person who,
who's willing to sit down and talk with 

1590
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:56,170
me and look at the evidence and are 
their beliefs to feasible?

1591
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:57,041
Are they willing to,
you know,

1592
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:57,550
hey,
look,

1593
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,630
dave,
I came in here.

1594
01:14:58,631 --> 01:15:00,310
I thought this had a conversation with 
you,

1595
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,010
but equally important,
you have to ask that of yourself.

1596
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:06,010
Right,
and if,

1597
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:09,760
if that is absent from that discourse,
it's just a farce.

1598
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,180
So why would you,
you should.

1599
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,390
That should never listen to someone on 
twitter.

1600
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,520
You going to have this global fuck you 
like have your own show.

1601
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,430
You know,
you should never listen to you.

1602
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:20,920
You're not held hostage to the 
irrationality of others.

1603
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,900
Yeah,
I like that.

1604
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,570
That's a good ending.
That sounds like a good ending.

1605
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,540
We could have done so much more here and
I pretty much,

1606
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,374
I could have just mixed these up.
I don't even know that I really looked 

1607
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:31,564
at them,
but I could have just thrown them all 

1608
01:15:31,991 --> 01:15:33,500
over.
I'm dying to know it's on there.

1609
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:34,843
You can have those.

1610
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:38,290
we will absolutely do this again and 
then we'll.

1611
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,840
And I won't bring any of those cards and
we'll just see,

1612
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,000
see what happens.
But the beauty of this is that this,

1613
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,193
this is big and this is what a lot of 
people have wanted to talk about and I 

1614
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:49,324
liked the fact that I'm able to talk 
about it with people that are dealing 

1615
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,570
with it in different ways.
So at the academic level and the and the

1616
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,413
religious level or belief level and then
people are dealing at the political 

1617
01:15:58,091 --> 01:15:59,650
level and all that.
And you've been a catalyst.

1618
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:00,484
I mean you've brought people together,
you've talked about an issue that's 

1619
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,124
important.
More and more people are becoming aware 

1620
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,970
of that and you've kind of,
you've,

1621
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:07,823
you've become a figure in which people 
go to and they look to and they respect 

1622
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,733
for these sorts of conversations to help
them navigate these difficult terrain 

1623
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,290
because these are not easy issues.

1624
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:20,950
Particularly not easy.
When again,

1625
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:25,951
a lot of the arguments that people on 
the progressive regressive have,

1626
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:30,220
they really should be taken earnestly.
You know,

1627
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:31,054
treating people,
not treating people differently in the 

1628
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:34,690
basis of skin color.
I mean these are really important things

1629
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:38,380
and we need to be sensitive to how we 
behave.

1630
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:41,620
We need to be more kind and more just 
and more compassionate.

1631
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,950
The way to do that is not through the 
regressives.

1632
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,203
the way to do that is by being honest 
and sincere with ourselves and having 

1633
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:55,240
these sorts of discourses,
having these kinds of dialogues.

1634
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,100
I want to thank peter because he in for 
joining me.

1635
01:16:57,101 --> 01:16:57,934
You can check out his work at peter 
boghossian dotcom and buy a manual for 

1636
01:17:00,851 --> 01:17:02,890
creating atheists wherever books are 
sold.

1637
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,470
Thanks for watching and we will do it 
again next week.
