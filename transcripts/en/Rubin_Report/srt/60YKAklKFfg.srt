1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,893
Joining me today as a lawyer or a gun 
rights activists and the host of know 

2
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:11,220
are on NRA TV.
Kalia.

3
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,860
No,
are welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,960
How's it going?
How's it going,

5
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,130
my friend?
It's going good.

6
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:17,660
It's good to be in la.
I am.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,150
I'm glad to have you on.
We've been trying to do this for about a

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,710
year.
Yeah,

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,910
you're a busy man.
Yeah,

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,210
I just don't like to think so.
It might just be a facade I put her onto

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,073
avoid people,
but no one actually were in reality now 

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,900
it's been.
It's been a pretty busy year.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Yeah.
Like extremely so.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,830
And it doesn't ever seem to slow up and 
just want to think it does.

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,020
Something else jumps off.
Well,

16
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:38,270
if you think coming out of this show is 
gonna help slow it down.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,310
You are sorely mistaken.
Yeah.

18
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:42,680
Well I'm a bit of a masochist in that 
regard,

19
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,910
so we'll see.

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,050
We'll see by the time this hour he's 
done work on earth.

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,780
Hell,
we can release you.

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,700
I'm pretty sure there will be some.
Yeah.

23
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,603
Well,
don't worry because there will be equal 

24
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,070
amounts of me just sitting here with 
you.

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,570
That's the interesting thing.
You know,

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,030
I don't want to say I've been blind to 
it,

27
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:01,360
but just being.
Just seeing some of the reaction and the

28
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,194
responses that I got,
especially like for instance when I was 

29
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,380
on radar when I.
After I did Bill Maher,

30
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,413
I still saw some of the comments from 
the like I say the other side just for 

31
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:10,904
ease of communication,
but for people who largely don't agree 

32
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,420
with me and his audience and he was 
like,

33
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,280
oh,
why would drive the NRA guy on there?

34
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,323
Even a,
it was a tweet I responded to yesterday 

35
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,163
and even though I was on my no tweeting 
deal that I like to put my cell phone 

36
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:26,890
because so toxic and they're sometimes.

37
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,420
How often do you do that?
Every 30 minutes.

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,340
I'm trying to do weekends disappearing 
and all of August see it man.

39
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,423
Twitter's toxic man.
When you're in the lane that you and I 

40
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:41,930
are and it's toxic man and it can 
really.

41
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,120
Even though you don't think you're 
taking that in,

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,980
even when you just kind of scrolling 
through,

43
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,260
you're taking that in.
Yeah.

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,133
You know,
and it's like I constantly have to 

45
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,734
develop this pattern of just,
you don't respond to that because 

46
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,640
they're baiting you and things of that 
nature.

47
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,890
But um,
I,

48
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,670
I saw a tweet and she's like,
yeah,

49
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:00,020
I love,
Oh,

50
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,690
I love this episode,
but you have that NRA guy on there.

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,550
I'm like,
Jesus,

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,710
are we not allowed to have discourse 
anymore if it,

53
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,470
especially if it disagrees with 
something that you believe in and,

54
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:12,051
you know,
and I was like,

55
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,360
this is a very dangerous road we're 
going down if that's,

56
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,880
if that's going to be the case because 
you forget,

57
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,743
you know,
we live in this country together and 

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,240
we're not all the same.

59
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,980
There's about 350 million might not all 
think the same thing.

60
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,120
Exactly.
Pretty crazy.

61
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,830
It's,
it's kind of sad.

62
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:28,940
So it,
at least for me,

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,933
it's a little disheartening because I 
grew up under the guise and 

64
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:35,024
understanding the importance of 
discourse and being able to talk things 

65
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:38,870
out even if you do disagree with 
someone.

66
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,973
But then they even still having the 
ability to set aside whatever views I 

67
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,334
may have on a particular issue and then 
be able to speak with you cordially or 

68
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,790
have respect for you even though we 
don't agree that's the way I was brought

69
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,624
up.
And so to see the country kind of 

70
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:57,281
falling into this extremely vitriolic 
divisiveness it,

71
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,750
it's heartening to know me get all emo 
on you,

72
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:04,990
but it does it like we don't have to 
guess cried until the end.

73
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,380
We can do it this way.
But.

74
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:08,214
But that's exactly why I wanted to have 
you on because you are okay going into 

75
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,680
enemy territory.

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,870
I'm not calling this enemy territory,
but you did,

77
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,733
you did Maurice Show where you knew a 
certain percentage of the audience was 

78
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,494
just going to hate you.
And we talked about it briefly right 

79
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,104
before we started,
but you found Martin to basically 

80
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,200
pretty,
pretty respected.

81
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,053
Even kill.
Yeah.

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,270
Even though I'm policy,
he probably disagrees with you with 80,

83
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,770
80 percent of this tournaments.
Yeah.

84
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,391
And,
and,

85
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:31,224
you know,
and it was something that I ended up 

86
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,510
respecting about him in that regard 
because like I said,

87
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,830
I kind of,
I went in prepared for,

88
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,610
I didn't go into dual war,
but I went and prepared for it,

89
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,230
you know,
it was like prepare for the worst,

90
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,570
hope for the best.
Um,

91
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,970
and I tell you I got the best in a sense
of it was a,

92
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,640
it was a discourse where he challenged 
me,

93
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,983
but it wasn't this kind of tumultuous 
kind of butting of heads where it was 

94
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,190
just turned into something that was just
ugly.

95
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,670
Yeah.
He,

96
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,750
well,
he wasn't trying to get.

97
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

98
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,770
Trying to understand you because that,
that,

99
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,250
you know,
I'm trying to do that here.

100
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,250
I think there's a couple other places 
where people are trying to do that.

101
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,670
But yeah,
that's the thing that's been lost.

102
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,270
And that's an interesting thing you 
pointed out there.

103
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,020
It's,
I think sometimes people take offense to

104
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,023
that idea.
It's like,

105
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,850
well,
I don't want to intrude.

106
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,260
Intriguing.
I think intrigued kind of offense people

107
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,094
sometimes because it's like we all grow 
up with a typical understanding of what 

108
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,540
we expect certain people to be like and 
then when certain things don't fit,

109
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,411
it's like,
hmm,

110
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,180
that's interesting.
How did you get there?

111
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,163
Right.
And I think when it's innocent like 

112
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:31,894
that,
I don't think there's an issue there 

113
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,483
when you use it to try to kind of muscle
people into believing a certain thing 

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,953
based on what they are,
then that's when we start having 

115
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,684
problems.

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,553
You know what I mean?
It's like you see me as like how to you 

117
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:44,104
as a black guy.
Like it happened to me when I first 

118
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,180
started doing what I did with the NRA.
I'm a Russell Simmons or,

119
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,390
and I'll never forget this.
I was like,

120
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,880
I was like in Virginia Beach,
I think.

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,650
Um,
and Russell said,

122
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,484
I,
I,

123
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,413
I did my first sets of videos rolled out
with the NRA and I get this tweet from 

124
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,970
Russell Simmons.
And he was like,

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,580
how can you as a young black man push 
data,

126
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,680
you know,
the typical rhetoric in that regard,

127
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,420
even though he often is all about trying
to get people to.

128
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,810
Exactly.
Which was really odd.

129
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,190
And so I,
you know,

130
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,160
I responded,
I said,

131
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
you know,
like I didn't know advocating for self 

132
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,960
defense and self reliance was a bad 
thing.

133
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,540
I didn't know that only non black people
were allowed to do that.

134
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,790
And so that was Kinda like my first 
foray into that world of wait a minute.

135
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,814
People have an expectation of me based 
on my race that I'm not going to say I 

136
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,510
was oblivious to,
but it just,

137
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,643
when it was coming from people that look
like me as well with the same level of 

138
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,950
intensity,
that's when I go wow.

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
Okay.
Alright.

140
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,100
So here,
that's what this is.

141
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,210
Yeah.
So I want,

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,073
I want to back up a little bit of 
childhood and growing up because you're 

143
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,870
evolutions kind.
Interesting.

144
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,703
But let,
let's just sit with this for one second 

145
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,910
because I think there's something really
interesting about that thing right there

146
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,730
that often if you listened to the media,
they'll you that that police are hunting

147
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,950
down,
black men are and all of this,

148
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,280
and then at the same time you're saying,
well,

149
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,114
we should be able to arm ourselves and 
protect ourselves from the white 

150
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,950
supremacists.

151
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,170
See whoever is doing that,
but meaning that lawfully and legally we

152
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,930
should be able to take care of 
ourselves.

153
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,764
If you believe that the system is so 
corrupt and the police are so corrupt 

154
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,090
and there's racists running around 
everywhere,

155
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,740
you're trying to bring the power back to
yourself.

156
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,440
That's to me,
that's very empowering.

157
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,483
Yet somehow this seemingly is lost.
When this conversation hits the 

158
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,560
mainstream,
it's amazing.

159
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,963
I don't understand it.
It's like in one breath you're talking 

160
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,084
about let's,
let's take the current administration 

161
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:39,554
for instance,
they'll paint it as this the most 

162
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,770
vicious involving on the planet,
and then it's like,

163
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,510
well then let's give the same guns that 
you have for your own self reliance.

164
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,373
Would you would use to protect yourself 
against this monster that you said 

165
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,934
existed and let's give it to them and 
then place your entire alliance with 

166
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,910
respect to your safety on the same 
people you,

167
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,510
you're telling me I should be scared of.

168
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,750
It doesn't look horrible.
Give them your weapons.

169
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,280
What again?
Just it's,

170
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,000
it's mindblowing.
Right?

171
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,950
And so what it does though,
it exposes this notion that the,

172
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,963
there's an absence of ability to,
I don't want to say mobility or people 

173
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,534
just choosing not to critically think.
And we're at a point now where we have 

174
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,903
access and I tell people it's like,
it amazes me some of the questions that 

175
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,384
I get and it's like you literally have a
device that gives you access to all of 

176
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:36,560
the information in the world and it's in
your pocket.

177
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,050
And in the case of my overabundant 
tasks,

178
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,300
I have two of them and it's like it 
takes you to fall into your.

179
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,750
I assume you have like eight guns on you
at all.

180
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,110
Those rifles,
some here.

181
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,240
So you know.
And it's,

182
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,420
it's amazing how when we have such 
access to so much information,

183
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,850
we've become so lazy at reaching for it.

184
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,940
This was almost like back in the day 
when we didn't have this access,

185
00:07:58,941 --> 00:07:59,774
we were more adamant about search 
searching and seeking it out and 

186
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,070
critically thinking about things.
It's almost,

187
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,890
we've become too fast for our own good.
Right.

188
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,380
So the obsession now is instant 
information,

189
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:12,650
instant information regardless of 
whether or not the information is of any

190
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,770
use or good or the or if it's even 
correct.

191
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,760
Yeah.
You know.

192
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,190
And so it's it.
I hate it because,

193
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:19,760
you know,
I,

194
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,593
I blogged,
I've done all of those things and 

195
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,393
actually get people get mad at me when I
don't jump on a certain issue quick 

196
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,860
enough.
And when I say quick enough,

197
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:28,694
within 30 seconds,
the second I'll see that sometimes 

198
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,800
something goes down in the news and 
literally two minutes go by her,

199
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,210
I'm at dinner and I wasn't living at 
home.

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,500
And then I'll get a slew of tweets.

201
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,660
People.
Well I see you didn't comment on that.

202
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,873
You must be in and God paid off.
God forbid it involves a black person 

203
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:46,490
and there's a gun within 10 miles.
I have to jump on it.

204
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,343
Yeah.
And in some cases I understand there's 

205
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,863
some people who do who are just now 
getting into this who are just now 

206
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:53,750
getting into firearms and they are 
black.

207
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,060
Right.
And you know,

208
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,620
they look to me for understanding and 
direction because I've been doing it for

209
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,580
so long so that I understand,
but,

210
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,463
but other people,
it's just this constant desire to be 

211
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:03,810
like,
ah,

212
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,660
I got you.
I knew you were coon kind of deal.

213
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,100
Right.
And it's like,

214
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,143
like,
give me 30 seconds to even read the 

215
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,860
article you just sent me 10 seconds ago.
Yeah.

216
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,330
Right.
And then from there,

217
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,380
and then not to mention,
you know,

218
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,610
there's this thing called work that I 
do.

219
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,590
So yeah,
I'm still doing that as well.

220
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,091
So I'm,
I'm,

221
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:21,240
you know,
I'm juggling a lot of things.

222
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,083
I think I don't have to tell you,
you probably have to read 10 more 

223
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,040
articles to even ascertain anything 
close to the truth.

224
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,883
Bingo.
And that's the one thing that I think a 

225
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,114
lot of people don't do.
And almost tweeted that the other day I 

226
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:32,514
go,
you know,

227
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,353
it's very dangerous to read headlines,
especially in the day and age of 

228
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,863
clickbait titles,
to just read headlines and then make an 

229
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,790
opinion based off of that or think you 
know,

230
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,360
understand what happened at a particular
story because there are so many articles

231
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,313
that I've read about me and what I've 
said where the headline said one thing 

232
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,160
and to cover their assets within the 
article.

233
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,460
They'll clarify exactly what,
what it is that I said,

234
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,653
but they're banking on the idea that 
people are just going to read the 

235
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,174
headlines and then run with that and so 
it ends up making a fool of you in full 

236
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:07,410
of people.

237
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,010
What's your personal policy on that?
About how to respond to that?

238
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,110
Do you go all in on the fight?
Do you ignore it?

239
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,390
Because that this has happened to me 
just in the last week.

240
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,430
Daily be said,
I was all right.

241
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,110
Cheerleader.
Now,

242
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,730
correct me if I'm wrong,
if you're black.

243
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,330
I think so how am I doing for the.
For an orange,

244
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,950
you suck now.
Well,

245
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,841
no,
I mean,

246
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,230
but this is the level of pity,
but then it's about how much time do you

247
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,064
want to invest in,
in defending yourself and by doing that 

248
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:35,544
defense,
do you just add intensity to the people 

249
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,424
going,
I see we can get them to defend himself 

250
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,703
and then before you know it,
your whole life is dedicated to 

251
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,224
defending yourself from fake attacks 
rather than you and the work that you 

252
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,520
care about.
Two things.

253
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,354
One,
they do it to you because you're 

254
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,034
dangerous.

255
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,173
You're dangerous.
Not Because you agree with me in 

256
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,210
certain,
in certain issues,

257
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,673
you're dangerous and the fact that 
you're just simply willing to talk to 

258
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,580
me.
So for instance,

259
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:02,190
same thing happened when I did.
I did the interview with killer Mike,

260
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,100
Right?
They jumped all over him,

261
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,520
not because of what he said,
but just because he sat down and had the

262
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,130
conversation with me.
Half the time they don't even listen.

263
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,820
Oh,
that's interesting.

264
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,670
You can point it out because I was 
talking to my friend.

265
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:15,504
I'm like,
I'm like,

266
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,020
how can anyone watch this interview and 
not walk away with saying,

267
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:19,854
you know,
that was a great conversation about two 

268
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,414
people who don't agree on everything,
but there's some things we agree on 

269
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,460
like,
because they don't watch it.

270
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,490
That sounds like.
What do you mean?

271
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,290
It's like I had just this weird blonde 
moment,

272
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:28,480
right?

273
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,180
Yeah.
I'm like,

274
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,050
what do you mean?
He was like,

275
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,490
they didn't watch it.
He was like,

276
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,360
they don't actually watch the video.
They just read the title and then assume

277
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:39,120
they know what happened in the video and
then make their opinion from there.

278
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,201
And I'm like,
damn,

279
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,034
you're right.
I hate going down in the weeds with too 

280
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:45,900
much in this because it feels like we're
just responding to all of the craziness.

281
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:46,734
But even in the.
Even in like the youtube ecosystem when 

282
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,054
we put videos up,
sometimes within 10 there's 100 condoms 

283
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:58,330
and that was an hour of want,
that time when she can,

284
00:11:58,331 --> 00:11:59,164
because I will be a lot more productive,
but it's always the haters that that's 

285
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,034
why I wouldn't bring it up because it.
Because then that heat is the thing 

286
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,424
that's always leading us and then I 
think that brings it back to where you 

287
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:09,574
started a moment ago,
which is that we're in this polarized 

288
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,430
thing and it's because the haters are 
are sort of paving the road and everyone

289
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:16,720
else is just going down the road.

290
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,590
I think a few of us are actually trying 
to better road that.

291
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:21,424
More of us can get it.
The interesting thing about the 

292
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,440
discourse the way it is now,
right?

293
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,410
And so our politics have become our 
entertainment.

294
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,450
That's the one that's the dangerous 
aspect,

295
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,850
right?
So if it's not vitriolic,

296
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,160
if it's not snarky,
if it's not any of those things,

297
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,370
if people don't pay attention to it.
And I'm the biggest advocate of like,

298
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:40,870
all right,
look,

299
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,730
if you,
if you don't agree with me on something,

300
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,950
you don't have to be an ass about it 
right now.

301
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,910
Can I be snarky?
Hell yeah.

302
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,740
No,
I,

303
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,750
I can absolutely be snarky,
but what I,

304
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,240
what I tried to do in response to your 
initial question,

305
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,130
you asked me how do I like,
how do I go all in?

306
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,870
Do I respond?
So like for instance on twitter,

307
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:56,704
what I've kind of held myself back to 
doing now is if I can tell that the 

308
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,610
person is literally seeking out an 
answer or response,

309
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,460
that's I'm going to give them that same 
energy in terms of,

310
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,270
okay,
no,

311
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,740
let's,
let's have that conversation.

312
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,023
Right?
Because there was a point in time where 

313
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,243
everything I responded to when I respond
to it through the lens of just being 

314
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,980
this snarky on,
you know what I mean?

315
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,180
And Yeah,
sure,

316
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,190
it was entertaining myself.
Absolutely.

317
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,473
But then I had to ask myself was I 
really moving the conversation and the 

318
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:26,620
dialogue along,
even though it is twitter,

319
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,240
it's twitter,
it's a dumpster fire,

320
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,010
but when I started has some importance,
does just the truth.

321
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:33,844
That's why it keeps coming up in so many
of these conversations that high level 

322
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,230
people with great minds that are open 
and engaging,

323
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,460
that are still involved in the stupidity
of that.

324
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,470
So it's like I always feel guilty when I
bring it up with a guest.

325
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,620
I'm was like,
I don't want to touch that again.

326
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,640
And then on the other hand,
we all know it's really just,

327
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,580
it just is whether we want it to be or 
nothing,

328
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,950
like you said,
whether we like,

329
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,480
Nah,
this the medium of expression right now.

330
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,200
Um,
and so we have to either adapt or die,

331
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,910
you know,
but,

332
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:01,744
you know,
it's,

333
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,940
it's,
I try,

334
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:04,774
I try to be what it is.
I tried to be the opposite of what I 

335
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,850
could plan about.
At least I try in terms of like,

336
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,743
sometimes I'll see snarky messages and 
then I'll respond by trying to be 

337
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:14,260
reasonable.
I say,

338
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,280
okay,
I get it.

339
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,190
You don't like me,
but answer this question for me.

340
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,870
And I tried to move the dialogue along,
you know,

341
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:24,170
what ends up happening to get deleted.
Yeah.

342
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,680
Almost every single time.
Yeah.

343
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,490
The second you shed a little light on 
it.

344
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Grad scatter.
Yeah.

345
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,883
Yup.
What,

346
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,790
what is the,
uh,

347
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,673
before we dive too much into your past,
what is the thing that they're 

348
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,943
criticizing you most for?
Like you come across to me as a pretty 

349
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,090
rational,
decent,

350
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:43,240
open guy.
You're trying to empower yourself.

351
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,643
Okay.
So what is it that they're always going 

352
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:47,464
after you?
Is it that thing that black men 

353
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,500
shouldn't be for guns?
I mean,

354
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,880
is it that simply stupid?
So I'm like,

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,833
so I don't,
I'm not going to be so naive to assume 

356
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:58,300
it's simply just because I'm black and 
I'm in the guns and holds up.

357
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,250
That's part of it.
That's a big part of it is just aligning

358
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:03,110
myself in the organization that they 
seemingly,

359
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,160
that they see as being a racist 
organization that hates black people.

360
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,600
And we're going to talk plenty about the
NRA.

361
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,420
Right?
So there's that element of it,

362
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,254
but then there's,
there is also this idea that being a 

363
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,044
young black man that I am supposed to 
run from guns because of the projected 

364
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:20,714
image that we've all had forced down our
throats with respect to black men and 

365
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,850
firearms in this country for decades.

366
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,520
You know,
black man with a gun,

367
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,690
he's a thug.
He's a drug dealer.

368
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:34,691
He was a gang banger period.
So now when I young,

369
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,490
attorney educated,
open minded and you know,

370
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,483
with respect to different issues and 
then I'm pushing the narrative of the 

371
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:44,474
second amendment,
it sets off an explosive level of 

372
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:51,770
cognitive dissonance in people who have 
what I love this quote and I believe was

373
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:55,450
Bush who said it,
the soft bigotry of low expectations,

374
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,200
right?
And it,

375
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,280
they hate it,
they hate it the same way they,

376
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,173
they hate you now because you can't 
control someone who's willing to think 

377
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:11,090
independently outside of what is 
stereotypically expected of you.

378
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,410
Right?
Um,

379
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,880
and that's where the labels come in and 
so it's like,

380
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,170
Yo,
do progressive or liberal,

381
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,004
you know,
so,

382
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,560
but you still have that ability to step 
outside of that and say,

383
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,820
you know what,
let me let me.

384
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,140
Okay,
I can see that perspective.

385
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,810
That's dangerous for people who want to 
control people.

386
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,240
So when I want to control the way you 
think,

387
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,074
the way you see yourself,
I cannot allow you to develop it and 

388
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:30,224
ability to think independently on 
separate issues because then I can't 

389
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:35,270
control you.
So if I,

390
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,380
if I say,
you know what,

391
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,800
I can do everything for you,
depend on me.

392
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,940
The last thing I want you to do and 
understand this,

393
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:43,761
you know what,
wait a minute.

394
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,230
You mean to tell me I could protect 
myself.

395
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,020
You mean to tell me I don't have to 
depend on calling a cop in order to come

396
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:48,854
save me if someone does try to break 
into my house because then I can't 

397
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:52,154
control you.
I can't own your vote because what the 

398
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:55,844
gun has done for me and a lot of people 
it serves as a catalyst for awakening 

399
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:01,400
for a lot of people don't understand,
you know,

400
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:03,740
what I can do more for myself than I 
realize,

401
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,050
you know,
and once that,

402
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,020
once that spark is set off than a lot of
things,

403
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:09,980
you start to realize,
you know,

404
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:10,681
I don't,
you know,

405
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,380
what maybe,
you know,

406
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,243
not on,
I'm holding myself to a different level 

407
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:14,870
of accountability.

408
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,820
Maybe I might try to do this on my own,
you know,

409
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,943
just feel good and they put an aside.
I know a lot of people are into facts 

410
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,354
over feelings these days,
but Shapiro but doesn't that statement 

411
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,630
right there that,
that you can do more for yourself.

412
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,033
It just feels good like pills,
making some power back to yourself and 

413
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:34,904
go and the government or you,
whoever you are or are not in charge of 

414
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,820
my life,
my responsibility,

415
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:42,100
my livelihood,
my family,

416
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,963
the rest of it.
It's the most invigorating feeling in 

417
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:47,630
the world.
And I'm with you.

418
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:51,380
I'm all about facts over feelings and 
I'm meaning from standpoint.

419
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,520
I don't allow my feelings to dictate the
facts,

420
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,340
you know,
I do think feelings are necessary,

421
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,480
right?
Because we would,

422
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,450
in the absence of them,
we just become cold,

423
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,850
calculated creatures.
Right.

424
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,480
And we are still human.
We are getting,

425
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:03,960
you know what I mean?

426
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,540
So it's like now at least.
So you know,

427
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:11,541
when I talk about the issue of firearms,
I do actively try to inquire.

428
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:12,984
I was,
I was having a discussion with a lady 

429
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:19,230
not too long ago about just general 
firearm issues with respect to her son.

430
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,930
Right?
Who's the young black man.

431
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,871
And I asked her,
you know,

432
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,704
like the,
are you fearful of the idea of him 

433
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:28,980
carrying a gun and so forth and so on,
and I have to bring myself back when I'm

434
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:32,220
having a discussion with someone like 
that because I don't have kids.

435
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,200
Right.
So Yeah,

436
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,360
and my godfather that,
yeah.

437
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:36,910
So,
and,

438
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,830
and I,
and I love her but it's not the same for

439
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:41,664
a woman who has a son.
So I have to be cognizant of that and 

440
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:49,260
understand what goes into that when 
she's thinking about whether or not she,

441
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,510
he,
she is okay with him owning a firearm.

442
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,343
And then on top of that having this idea
that her son is more likely to get 

443
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,010
killed by a cop because he has a gun on 
him versus when he doesn't,

444
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,043
you know.
And that's where the feeling component 

445
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,484
comes in where it's necessary.
I think if you can't sympathize with 

446
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:07,710
that,
then it makes you dismissive.

447
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,260
And so then that person can't relate to 
you,

448
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,780
then we can have that conversation.
You know what I mean?

449
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,703
And that comes from personal experience 
because when I was reading your bio 

450
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,281
there,
I mean,

451
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,114
it's really interesting stuff about how 
you evolve sort of politically and 

452
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:21,354
personally,
but when you started getting into guns 

453
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,310
you kind of had to hide it from your mom
either.

454
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,030
So everyone actually takes a little bit 
about,

455
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,260
about growing up and then sort of your 
kind of politics and then how do we,

456
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,930
how do we get so into gun director?

457
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,860
So I've,
I grew up largely a closet anti gunner.

458
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,840
I didn't realize I was going the wall,
there was one president,

459
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,090
right?
I wasn't kind of rapidly running out,

460
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,781
running out,
screaming.

461
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,870
I hate guns or anything like that.
But when a woman was president,

462
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,880
I remember there's one moment when I was
in college,

463
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,110
I had a roommate,
um,

464
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:50,550
when their friends brought a gun over,
I was like,

465
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:53,880
you need to get the hell out my part.
You get the hell out of my apartment.

466
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,223
And um,
had a good friend of mine who randomly 

467
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:58,980
just asked me,
hey,

468
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,230
do you want to go to the range?
Never even thought about it.

469
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:04,380
Never even crossed my mind.
Which is how I know a lot of times I can

470
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,214
decipher based on certain comments 
whether or not somebody is actually 

471
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,753
coming from a place of ignorance or a 
place of understanding because I was 

472
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:16,380
that guy never even thought about going 
to range,

473
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,960
never thought about shooting gun,
but I can tell you all their opinions on

474
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:19,794
the world wide.

475
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,853
Right?
And so when I hear that rhetoric now I 

476
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,380
can usually point it out and I'm like,
you've never shopped before.

477
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,700
You've never even held a gun before.
And so from that perspective,

478
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,700
we went to the gun range and shot for 
the first time and I was hooked.

479
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,283
Now I was hooked not from a political 
standpoint now with not even from an 

480
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,280
empowering,
oh my God,

481
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:39,114
I can protect myself now standpoint,
it was just pure fascination with the 

482
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:42,570
mechanics,
the physics,

483
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,910
all of it.
I'm a very kind of like,

484
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,550
curious mind.
So for me it was like kind of like this,

485
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,384
like the idea that I'm launching a 
project out faster than the speed of 

486
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,370
sound and a little target 100 yards 
away.

487
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:56,410
Like that was awesome.
So first shot you were hooked,

488
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,300
first shot terrified me the second,
so a little bit second shot.

489
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,170
Right,
right.

490
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,970
Um,
so from that perspective,

491
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,080
after,
so after that,

492
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,033
I just,
I follow that rabbit all the way down 

493
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:08,920
the hall,
but it was,

494
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,600
like I said,
it was more from a scientific,

495
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,070
mechanical understanding of it.
Then as time went on,

496
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,190
then I started looking at it from more 
intellectual,

497
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,760
second amendment political activist 
standpoint and then I started my,

498
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,970
then the lawyer mind kicked in and then 
I started looking.

499
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,420
I'm like,
I'm hearing something.

500
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,880
We [inaudible] we during the time 
period.

501
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:31,714
Then that particular time period we had 
a couple of pretty big mass shootings 

502
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,834
that happened and so I started paying it
and so now I'm paying attention more to 

503
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,254
this kind of like when you're thinking 
about buying a car and you never see it 

504
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,404
on the road.
And then once you start thinking about 

505
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:44,200
buying you see it everywhere.
That was pretty much what happened now.

506
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,033
So I'm like,
I'm hearing the conversation about guns 

507
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:46,834
everywhere now and I'm like,
none of this is making any sense 

508
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,270
logically like what people are 
proposing.

509
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,920
It doesn't.
It was so pure,

510
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,450
it wasn't like an agenda driven.
I was like,

511
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,410
this doesn't make sense to me.
It's like a window,

512
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,600
like a sticker on the window,
not going to stop somebody from bringing

513
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:06,601
a gun in there saying that it's illegal.
You need the dad's not going to read the

514
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:09,100
sign and be like,
oh exactly.

515
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,480
I go to the other place.
Right.

516
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,960
So interesting.
That's Kinda when I started jumping into

517
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:18,200
the more activist advocate side effects,
um,

518
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,810
with respect to the second amendment.
And when you first got guns.

519
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:24,250
Yeah.
You were literally hiding them from your

520
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,140
mind.
Cause cause,

521
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,073
cause she was very much let me,
she was a single parent mom raising a 

522
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:29,800
black son.

523
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,290
She wanted to court every stereotype on 
the planet.

524
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,423
Right.
My mom over compensated with me 

525
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,493
tremendously because she understood,
she understood in her mind the 

526
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,470
limitations that come with being a 
woman,

527
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:44,640
raising a man by herself.
So she overcompensated.

528
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,890
So whereas usually typically have like 
mama's boys who were just kind of like,

529
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,540
mom does everything for her.
She ain't did shit for me.

530
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,840
Go wash your own clothes,
come here and go do shit.

531
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,683
Like everything she made me and I didn't
at the time I just thought she was just 

532
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,550
being,
I mean not realizing,

533
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,320
you know,
it was her overcompensating standpoint.

534
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:04,690
It's like I gotta make this through.
I got to raise a man.

535
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,663
Yeah.
Right.

536
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,830
And so,
but so she was trying to buck.

537
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,290
So I knew once I started getting into 
guns.

538
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:11,661
No,
no,

539
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:12,011
no,
no.

540
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:16,000
Because the perception was black man 
with gun gang banger.

541
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Right.
And you know,

542
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,750
she had some insecurities in that.
She's like,

543
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,613
you know,
like there's gonna come a point where 

544
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm not gonna be able to control this 
kid.

545
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't know what it's going to be 
doing.

546
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,383
And so I didn't want to terrify her and 
make her think that I was living in the 

547
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,820
ferris lifestyle,
that she.

548
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,743
And it was almost in a way to protect 
her more than once to hide it from 

549
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,820
myself because I didn't want her to feel
like she,

550
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,853
like she failed as a mother and so I 
knew if she saw the AK 47 that I had 

551
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:43,414
hidden under my bed.
In her mind she knows nothing about 

552
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:46,364
guns.
All she knows is what she sees in the 

553
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:48,554
media.
And we all were like we touched upon 

554
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:52,370
before,
that imagery is not positive.

555
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,760
So she comes home,
sees ak 47 in bed.

556
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,010
She's,
Oh my God,

557
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,100
my son is a gay man first instead under 
the bad guy.

558
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:00,934
You said in the bed.
Is there anything you want tell here 

559
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,150
we're talking about that.
Like,

560
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,980
I already did this.
I did this guy.

561
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,040
Both basketball fans.
I used to sleep with my basketball.

562
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,060
Oh yeah.
Oh Man.

563
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,260
Yeah I bought was life that was 
everything out.

564
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:16,090
And you still got any skills?
Some,

565
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,540
some something.
Something.

566
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,120
I'm actually working on trying to open 
next.

567
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,470
NRA annual meetings put together like a 
to a charity.

568
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:24,080
Basketball it.
If you're down.

569
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,150
Can I get into that?
Let's do it.

570
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,871
Alright.
Let's do it,

571
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:28,690
but uh,
I've never slept with my guns.

572
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,743
Right.

573
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,500
Okay.
So,

574
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,843
so from that point when you started 
getting okay with this and now you're 

575
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,760
exploring it,
as you said intellectually,

576
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,133
uh,
how long before you were really an 

577
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:43,604
advocate for this stuff because you 
always sort of wanted to fight for 

578
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,080
something to be a theme with you.
A long time.

579
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,880
It was def that that's what I wanted to 
do.

580
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:50,714
I wanted to be an advocate.
I wanted to be in the courtroom 

581
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,390
defending people.
That's,

582
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,210
that was my goal.
Like even to the detriment of my grades.

583
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,044
Like I focused more on like my mock 
trial stuff when I was in law school 

584
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,900
than I did my actual work,
like the,

585
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,030
like schoolwise,
right.

586
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,910
And um,
I liked being the voice for people.

587
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:05,744
I like being able to speak to people who
can articulate certain things away that 

588
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,653
maybe I can.
And I never saw this going way that it 

589
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,154
did,
but I'm doing exactly what I always 

590
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,214
wanted to do.

591
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,340
And,
and for me with the gun thing,

592
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,260
I remember being in like I'd be in class
in law school and the way that they,

593
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,480
like the seats are staggered or like 
stadium seats,

594
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,314
right?
So if I'm on my computer and you're 

595
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,503
behind me,
you can see what I'm doing on my 

596
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:35,261
computer and I'd be in class in like I'm
researching guns and all man,

597
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:37,911
God,
dude,

598
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,744
like people.
And the thing is a lot of things that 

599
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,830
were being said about me I didn't even 
know about till later on,

600
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,820
people were concerned.
Yeah,

601
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,630
I really like Yo.
It's like he's like,

602
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,780
he's not crazy.
He's not,

603
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,100
you know,
um,

604
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,450
and I get it if you don't,
if you're not into that kind of thing,

605
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,820
um,
and you don't follow it.

606
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,900
The idea of being passionate about 
something you perceive to be a tool that

607
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,690
you use for killing people and only 
killing people.

608
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,410
It's gonna seem new to you.
But because I came to it so naturally,

609
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:14,660
so organically without any of that,
it just made sense in my mind.

610
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:15,494
I was so unapologetic about it.
Once I got over being apologetic about 

611
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,350
it,
that I didn't push it in people's faces,

612
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,670
but you know,
there was a,

613
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,470
there was even a time like that's how my
instagram got started was me separating.

614
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,810
So the people who followed me up until 
that point,

615
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,210
you know,
I had a girlfriend at the time was like,

616
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,073
you know,
I get a lot of questions where people 

617
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,400
can tend to tone down the gun stuff a 
little bit.

618
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,700
And it was,
it was kind of an innocent thing,

619
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,740
but I never really.
I just said,

620
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:42,990
you know,
what,

621
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,823
forget it.
I'm just going to set up a whole nother 

622
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:45,414
page and now I'm just going to do all 
the good stuff I want to do on that 

623
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:47,520
page.

624
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,410
Yeah.
Um,

625
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,620
and,
and now that's taken over.

626
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:50,454
I don't even use the other one that I 
don't even know if I remember the 

627
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:53,970
password,
but it.

628
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,073
So from there,
that's where things really started 

629
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:59,050
taking off.
And then with the and,

630
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,130
and then when I started I started doing 
gun reviews.

631
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,150
And so then from there when I got into 
the political component of it,

632
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:06,984
then I started talking during my 
commentary and then that's when things 

633
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,070
started really taking off.
All right,

634
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,580
so let's do this.
I want to do gun one on one with all the

635
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:15,414
things that we should know about guns.
And then I want to do the most common 

636
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,033
misconceptions about guns.
Because I think part of the issue right 

637
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:26,130
now is every time something happens,
every time there's a shooting,

638
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,380
half the people don't know anything 
about guns.

639
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,214
On one hand,
half the people then give you all of 

640
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,430
those misconceptions.

641
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,293
It gets confusing for everybody.
And even the people who I generally 

642
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:36,930
trust,
I,

643
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,030
I don't know exactly what they're 
saying.

644
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,380
So I want to do a video with you right 
now.

645
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,503
Every time one of these incidences 
happen and someone starts asking me 

646
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:47,910
this,
asking me that I want to go,

647
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,300
I've got the thing that I can point to 
with the answers.

648
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,080
So let's do gun.
What on what?

649
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,830
What do we need to know about guns are 
first and foremost,

650
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,320
ar does not stand for assault rifle.
So when they say ar 15,

651
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,530
that's not assault rifle,
does not mean assault rifle.

652
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,530
And the assault rifle is a gun that is 
fully automatic,

653
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,300
right?
That means I pulled the trigger,

654
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,300
I hold it back and an expense all of the
ammunition in the magazine.

655
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,670
So that's Jesse,
Ventura and Predator.

656
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,633
Boom.
Okay.

657
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,473
It's a great gun.
Yeah.

658
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,453
Love that guy.
I can argue that not going to side with 

659
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:17,970
my known again.
But um,

660
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,980
so,
so that's automatic.

661
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,730
You just hold it down and down and it 
will fire every round,

662
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,940
uh,
subsequently until it's completely out.

663
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,953
Okay.
Right.

664
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,580
And does.
So at a very high rate of speed.

665
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,220
Generally speaking,
somebody automatic.

666
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,353
So now there's been this thing where 
people conflate this or use somebody 

667
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,654
automatic as a kind of a hyperbolic way 
of characterizing guns as death killing 

668
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:41,724
machines,
right?

669
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,540
Virtually every modern gun is 
semiautomatic.

670
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,270
And what that means is one press of the 
trigger,

671
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,840
one bullet versus holding the trigger 
down once and getting all the bullets.

672
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:52,763
Okay.
So that's a great distinction out there 

673
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:54,534
because often when this happens,
you see people saying we have to band 

674
00:28:57,211 --> 00:29:00,420
semiautomatics semiautomatic.
That's virtually every month.

675
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:01,823
He's just because all the,
the only difference between that and a 

676
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,240
what I guess fully automatic stuff.

677
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,380
Well what's one that you're just loading
one bullet in that.

678
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,080
Okay.
So that would be a bolt action.

679
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,740
Okay.
Right.

680
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,573
So there's fully automatic,
semi automatic and Bolt Action Bolt 

681
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,830
action more.
It was more like to like,

682
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,953
like hunting,
right or high high precision shooting 

683
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,443
and it's a bolt because it allows you to
build a gun up in such a way where you 

684
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,193
at the tighter constraints within a gun 
and allows you to be more accurate 

685
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,770
without certain mechanism moving back 
and forth causing.

686
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,340
Throwing off the accuracy of the shot.
So you would say then that when with all

687
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:42,580
of these people come out and say we have
to band semiautomatics and that they are

688
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,414
actually just flat out confused or 
intentionally conflating or a 

689
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,230
obfuscating what the truth is related to
them?

690
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,430
Yes,
absolutely.

691
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,433
And so it's either they're confused,
they're ignorant or they're doing a 

692
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
purposeful that you just stated.

693
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,530
Okay,
so what is the.

694
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,170
So let's do some nra stuff while we're.
While we're doing this,

695
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,750
what is the NRA stance on automatics 
just being able to hold an shoot.

696
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,953
I mean,
the way it's currently regulated is the 

697
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,014
way it stands right now.
There's like in order to get an 

698
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:12,250
automatic gun,
there's a certain process you have to go

699
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,084
through in order to get them.
And it's been that way for a very long 

700
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:20,710
time now and that's been that it exists 
as it does now.

701
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,413
And that's essentially where the stance 
is with respect to fully automatic 

702
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,183
what's,
what are people using fully automatic 

703
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:30,070
guns for?
So um,

704
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,840
because I think this is where you'll 
hear people go,

705
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,610
well,
no one needs an automatic to see.

706
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:34,444
Here's the thing though,
it's the idea of putting it under the 

707
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,170
guise of needing,
right,

708
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,933
their name,
another right where we use that same 

709
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,200
standard,
you know,

710
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,203
begs the question.

711
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,580
And so it's like,
okay,

712
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,833
you haven't fully automatic gun and you 
have some automatic gun shot bolt 

713
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:49,534
action.
There are different reasons why you 

714
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:53,530
would want each of these guns.
Now I can delve into that.

715
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:57,940
But then that starts getting into the 
very nerdy side of firearm ownership.

716
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,640
Whether enthusiasm aspect of that comes 
into it,

717
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,400
it's understanding tactically why you 
would want certain things.

718
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,760
And so for me,
I'm not personally,

719
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,300
I don't have a problem with people on 
fully automatic gun personally.

720
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,613
I just don't see that as a significant 
danger above and beyond say owning a 

721
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:17,870
nuclear suitcase.
Right?

722
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,740
So people tried to make that absurd 
argument to me before.

723
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:21,574
It's like,
well then why don't you read a lot and 

724
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,403
well that's because there's a,
there's a cost benefit ratio that 

725
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:27,070
doesn't make any sense,
right?

726
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,010
That you just inherently self 
destruction.

727
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,893
So how is,
how is that protecting you in any way 

728
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,620
from the very thing that you're supposed
to be taking yourself against?

729
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,340
Do you think there should be a higher 
threshold to be able to get an automatic

730
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,080
than some of the other records you're 
talking about?

731
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,510
Me Personally?
Threshold in what respect?

732
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:48,511
Like in terms of either hire back graded
background checks or references.

733
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,560
So.
So talking about background checks for a

734
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,540
minute.
So there's this idea,

735
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,090
this notion that we don't have 
background checks for guns.

736
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,390
We do.
And the funny thing is we,

737
00:31:58,391 --> 00:31:59,224
in the gun community,
you become become a victim of 

738
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,294
technology.
And what I mean by that is people think 

739
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,830
that just because I can go into a gun,
if I really wanted to,

740
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,723
I can go a gun store right now,
buy a gun within two minutes just like 

741
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:11,440
that.
You can.

742
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,453
Yeah,
because you've done all of the 

743
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,190
background and see that's the thing 
though.

744
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,280
I'm still going under.
I'm undergoing the same processes.

745
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,340
So I go into a store,
I find a gun.

746
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,770
I liked this gut.
I say I want to buy this gun.

747
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,540
I fill out the 44,
a forum,

748
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,570
44 slash 73,
which asked me a series of questions.

749
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,703
Then they take that information and they
submit it to the FBI database and they 

750
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,633
do a background check,
but it happens instantly because 

751
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,753
technology people.
It's interesting because there's a lot 

752
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,810
of people who feel,
like I said,

753
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,120
undergo some type of CIA investigation 
before I buy a gun.

754
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,010
The same people who also hate the 
government.

755
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,873
Exactly right.
So when they did the instant aspect of 

756
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:51,284
the background check causes people who 
don't know very much about the process 

757
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,790
that think that there isn't one.
Right.

758
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,910
Just because I can buy the gun easily 
doesn't mean it was done thoroughly.

759
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,060
You know what I'm saying?
I underwent the background check.

760
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,400
There's a system there.
They checked it against the system.

761
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,760
If I don't have any felonies or anything
that prevents me from owning a firearm,

762
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,070
I'm allowed to buy the gun.
Okay.

763
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,904
So when people say there are,
there are no background checks and 

764
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,680
background checks aren't tight enough or
however you want to extrapolate that.

765
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,090
Is there any credence to any of that 
that you can.

766
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:21,710
So now let's talk.
So I think what you're,

767
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:24,290
what you're kind of going into is 
universal background checks,

768
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,770
right?
So when they say universal back,

769
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,820
now they do conflate these 
terminologies.

770
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:32,750
There's universal background check is a 
very specific statement.

771
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,480
It's not like saying coke,
right?

772
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,160
Because people here universal background
checks and all the.

773
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:40,100
Here's the background check part.
That universal means something.

774
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,323
And what that means is it's a 
requirement that every single 

775
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:45,770
transaction you have to undergo a 
background check,

776
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:47,150
even private transactions.

777
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,160
Right?
So right now in California,

778
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,930
if I had a gun,
right,

779
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,240
I can bring a gun into California,
just can't carry it.

780
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,051
But you were like,
hey,

781
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:54,980
you know what,
cause I like that gun.

782
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:59,450
You have right one to buy it from you in
California.

783
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,000
I can't sell it to you right now.
What?

784
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,530
Here's what I can do.
I can say,

785
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,393
all right,
cool.

786
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,503
When I get back to Texas,
I'll transfer the gun to a gun store 

787
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:08,744
here in California if it's on a specific
list that allows you to actually own 

788
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,400
that gun,
right?

789
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,420
Because California has the district.
Yeah.

790
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,940
And then you would have to go to the gun
store and then buy it right now.

791
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,020
Let's say I decided to give you the gun 
anyway.

792
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,410
Privately,
right now in this room,

793
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:30,244
no one else is here.
But you went on and I saw the either 

794
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,133
gun.
You want me to shut the cameras and I 

795
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,170
don't have any plans on going to jail.
And I sell you the gun.

796
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,710
You know,
and then let's say you have the gun,

797
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,980
what is there to check against?
What databases did they check against to

798
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,630
determine whether or not you got a 
background check for that gun?

799
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,910
Now,
just completely two issues right now,

800
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,060
so.
Well if we did it on the dl there,

801
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:54,010
there's no,
there's no way and that's what the whole

802
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,720
concept of the universal background 
check is.

803
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:59,230
It is to require a background check for 
every private transaction.

804
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,810
Now,
legally right now I can't do it,

805
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:02,644
but like in Texas I can sell a gun to a 
friend and as long as I know he's not a 

806
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:09,700
prohibited person and I know he's not a 
felon,

807
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,680
I can sell him that gun.

808
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,923
No problem.
That's completely legal with the 

809
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:20,120
universal background check idea suggests
is I should have actually,

810
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,013
he should be required to undergo a 
background check before I can sell in 

811
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:23,614
that gun.
That would mean you and he and I would 

812
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:28,180
have to go to a gun store and undergo a 
background check.

813
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,073
Then he can go and buy the gun from me.
So is the problem with the way it is 

814
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:32,614
currently saying in Texas,
the way you're describing that you just 

815
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,463
would not know intentionally enough 
about the person you were selling it to 

816
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,830
a potential?
Absolutely.

817
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,083
And so the reason why I'm against the 
universal background check is because 

818
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,980
there is no other way to enforce it,
but for a national gun registry,

819
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,413
because otherwise you have nothing to 
check it against to say if a cop walks 

820
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,860
down the street sees you have a gun and 
he's like,

821
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:56,970
did you get a background check for the 
gun?

822
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,340
Yeah.
How's he going to prove otherwise?

823
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,820
Unless there's a national registry and 
then there was,

824
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:02,654
okay,
fine.

825
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,100
Or then let's have a national registry.
No,

826
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,623
because we've seen time and time again 
that when the governments have a 

827
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:09,594
national registered firearms,
they subsequently use it to confiscate 

828
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,504
guns.
Now the problem is when you say that 

829
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,730
they try to put the tin foil hat on you,
right?

830
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,920
Except because what they.
What they envision is roaring truck,

831
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,833
black military trucks coming down the 
street pulling guns from people's 

832
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:27,540
houses.
No,

833
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:30,060
that's not what happens or how they do 
it.

834
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,163
It's constructive and then when you have
potential presidential candidates like 

835
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,870
Hillary Clinton suggesting we should 
take apart,

836
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,960
we should take up the Australia model,
which did that very thing.

837
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,943
They use the national,
they use a national gun registration to 

838
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:44,880
tell people to say,
you know what,

839
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,770
you need to turn in your guns.

840
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,230
It's a voluntary buyback.
No,

841
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,020
it's an.
It's a,

842
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,130
it's a mandatory buyback.
Right,

843
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,560
so,
and if you don't sell your guns back,

844
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,060
guess what?
You go to jail.

845
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,290
That's a confiscation.
It's a constructive confiscation,

846
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,124
but compensation nonetheless,
just because they didn't roll the 

847
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,274
military trucks down the street and pull
them out of your house doesn't mean it 

848
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:10,050
isn't confiscation.
And so that's why I'm.

849
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,003
I'm adamantly against universal 
background checks unless you can 

850
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:13,944
demonstrate away from it for it to be 
applied in such a way that would not 

851
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:17,394
require a gun registry because I do not 
trust my government not to exploit that 

852
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:23,550
registry in their favor.
Yeah.

853
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,130
So how much of this then,
because we've talked about it,

854
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:29,510
you said to me right before we started,
you're sort of a libertarian.

855
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,070
I think it's exactly what he said.
I don't want to put words in your mouth.

856
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,773
How much of this does go back to that 
states should be able to make the 

857
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,330
decisions that they see fit.
I mean,

858
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:44,320
I suspect you probably wouldn't be that 
thrilled living in California other than

859
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,480
the weather.
I.

860
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,790
I'm here in California.
Whether the women.

861
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,170
That's pretty good.
Food and texting.

862
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,110
Yeah,
we do.

863
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,280
Yeah.
I'm not complaining about that.

864
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,770
I'm so.
See.

865
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,120
That's just it too.
It's like,

866
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,550
well,
how far those states' rights go from the

867
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:00,150
standpoint of violating my second 
amendment.

868
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:01,340
Right,
right.

869
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,720
I believe in states rights,
right?

870
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,593
Them to point.
You started violating my constitutional 

871
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,250
ones and so when you have places like 
California,

872
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,130
which I think I think I'm being 
currently violated now,

873
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:15,180
the fact that I can't carry my gun,
what is the difference I can take?

874
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,890
I can take my car with my Texas license 
and drive it right into California.

875
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,963
No one has a problem with that.
I can drive up and down these roads and 

876
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,380
as fast as I want,
as recklessly as I want.

877
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah,
that might be illegal,

878
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:28,290
but I can still do it.
Does that potentially to do it,

879
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,124
but yet I can't carry the thing that I 
carry to protect my life with the same 

880
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:34,614
license.

881
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,373
That doesn't make sense to me.
Like am I any in any less danger here 

882
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,240
than I would be in Texas.
If anything I can make the argument that

883
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:44,074
I'm more.
There's more danger for me here in that 

884
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:47,500
I don't know the area very well.
So in a weird way,

885
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,720
you're actually making a non states' 
rights argument here,

886
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:50,554
right?
Because if you're saying you want the 

887
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:55,270
same thing everywhere,
that's not a states' rights argument.

888
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,280
It's not that,
but that's what I'm saying,

889
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,673
but that's under the guise of me feeling
like me not being able to carry his 

890
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,180
violation of my constitutional right.
Right.

891
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,133
Because there's rights doesn't allow 
them to violate those constitutional 

892
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,700
rights and that's,
that's the argument I'm making now.

893
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,683
It's difficult because when you start 
talking about the idea of having a 

894
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,760
uniform like concealed carry platform,
right?

895
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,200
Where one license allows you to carry a 
gun everywhere,

896
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,740
right?

897
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,240
Then you start getting into the weeds 
about,

898
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:23,860
okay,
well that's violating states rights,

899
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,920
but that's only if you don't see my 
ability to carry your firearm as a,

900
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,720
as a,
I'm sorry,

901
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,813
uh,
my ability to carry a firearm as a 

902
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:32,030
violation of my constitutional rights.
Right.

903
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,883
So it's a,
it's an interesting philosophical place 

904
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:34,984
to talk because it's like,
it just depends where you start because 

905
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:39,450
even though I'm definitely a states' 
rights guy,

906
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,380
I hear what you say there.
And then on the other hand,

907
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,210
as a state's rights guy,
to me,

908
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:48,100
if a state wants to have stricter laws 
and you're a big gun guy,

909
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:48,934
then you actually are allowed to leave.
It's kind of it as I would say for 

910
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:54,160
virtually every other situation.
It's kind of shitty.

911
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,890
It doesn't feel great to have to leave a
place that you want to be at,

912
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:57,724
but if they are doing things as part of 
their state experiment that you don't 

913
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:03,370
like well on,
it's on you to get going.

914
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,233
Yeah.
But if that same state creates a law 

915
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:08,650
that violates my right to privacy,
right?

916
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,670
Well we have constitutional rights 
superseded.

917
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,980
So I see.
So I get,

918
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:12,814
I get nature.
Are we missing anything else on the 

919
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,700
technical front because we did that 
pretty well.

920
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,543
I'm sure we will see a from a mechanical
standpoint just from a mechanical 

921
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:26,320
standpoint or just any of the language 
that we use related to this.

922
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:26,870
Okay.
Okay.

923
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,120
So yeah,
so then of course there's,

924
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,700
some people can say it's trivial.
Some people say it's not.

925
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,160
So the magazine versus clip,
the general terms.

926
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,820
Actually it's called the magazine a clip
is an actual thing.

927
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:41,200
It's just different from a magazine but 
that's kind of slightly trivial,

928
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,034
but it,
it does typically kind of expose people 

929
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:45,394
who don't really know much about guns 
when you say clip versus magazine 

930
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,220
because the proper terminology would be 
magazine.

931
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,613
Um,
as far as any other mechanical 

932
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,060
components,
what,

933
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,830
what do I need to know about the 
magazine?

934
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,270
Well,
that's just terminology.

935
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,550
It is semantics,
right?

936
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,523
Get this.
I don't always go about correcting 

937
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:05,780
people because I felt like it just 
creates it.

938
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,450
It kind of makes me look like an ass,
but that's why we're doing this.

939
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,463
I don't want to clean up.
The biggest thing is just the assault 

940
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:15,700
weapon thing,
right?

941
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,240
Because the Ar 15 is the civilian 
weapon.

942
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,350
It's,
it's designated.

943
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,400
The biggest difference between an ar 15 
and an assault rifle is that the assault

944
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:29,350
rifles,
fully automatic and they are 15,

945
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,393
isn't it?
That's the biggest distinction between 

946
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:33,770
the two.
Now,

947
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,570
of course,
then you can make the argument.

948
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:37,640
Well that's some very minor distinction.
You know,

949
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,410
there's a lot of people who make that 
argument,

950
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,633
but I don't look at the Ar 15 any 
differently than I look at the handgun 

951
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,570
in that sense.

952
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,403
Okay.
So every time when one of these happens 

953
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:52,850
and we hear the Ar 15 is a weapon of war
and so were handguns,

954
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,423
you would basically put the Ar 15 of the
handgun in the same categories as 

955
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:58,090
pulling ones.
Yeah,

956
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,230
she even wants.
Yeah.

957
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,970
So that would not be categorized as a,
as a weapon of war will see that.

958
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:07,110
See that estimation,
that terminology is designed to,

959
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,200
to manipulate the emotions of people who
don't know anything about guns.

960
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,573
So when you hear,
if you don't know anything about 

961
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:17,660
firearms and you hear he used a weapon 
of war,

962
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,900
technically speaking our guns or weapons
of war,

963
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,670
right?
So words can be weapons.

964
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,350
Exactly.
So,

965
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:25,184
but what that does mentally,
like they understand language very well 

966
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:33,140
and they liked our unit,
but in terms of the,

967
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:35,323
I call it the anti gun side of it,
I things they understand the use of 

968
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:41,450
language very well and um,
and they confuse it purposely.

969
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,820
So when you hear someone who doesn't 
know anything about firearms,

970
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:44,654
think about it.
Like if,

971
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,870
if I'm already kind of,
I'm a little scared of firearms and then

972
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:48,704
I hear he used a weapon of war.
What image comes up in your mind at 

973
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,280
it's,
it's Rambo,

974
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,343
he's running down,
they're just going crazy and that's 

975
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:58,694
exactly what he's doing.
He could do the same thing with a 

976
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,160
handgun.
And so the biggest thing that I like to,

977
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,890
when I'm having these conversations with
people's,

978
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,503
you're going to walk away with,
we're going to walk away with two with 

979
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,673
two points of two trains of thoughts.
I'm even going to get you to admit you 

980
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:16,841
just want to ban all guns or you can see
my perspective because if you're,

981
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,440
if you're willing to say,
you know what,

982
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,040
we need to get rid of all the assault 
weapons as they,

983
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,480
as they understand them to be,
which is essentially a fifteens,

984
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,530
but now it's actually become even more 
broader.

985
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,020
Like we need to get rid of all 
semiautomatic weapons right now.

986
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,913
Virtually every modern gun.
So let's say they want to ban Ar 

987
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:38,510
fifteens air 15th rifles aren't even 
used like the,

988
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:39,344
the,
the percentage that rifles are used in 

989
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,490
actual shootings is so low and marginal.
It's,

990
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,660
it's unreal.
So then why are we focusing on that?

991
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,080
But okay,
so then what are most shootings?

992
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,250
Our handguns.
Yeah,

993
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,143
right.
So if we get rid of that and we got rid 

994
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:56,774
of Ar for teens and then we have another
shooting happened because the army was 

995
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:00,054
deadliest.
Mass shooting was Virginia Tech and he 

996
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:02,804
used the hangup.
So then what happens if that happens 

997
00:44:05,451 --> 00:44:07,850
again?
So now what are you going to ban you?

998
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,700
You're going to abandon the hangup and 
that's when you're stuck.

999
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:12,260
Having to confront the fact that,
okay,

1000
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,453
either you really just want to ban all 
guns or you understand that the 

1001
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:18,800
distinction is irrelevant,
right?

1002
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,860
With God to get to the absolute point of
issue and why these things are happening

1003
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,950
and focusing on the gun is doing a 
disservice to the conversation.

1004
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,993
It sounds like I'm just utilizing.
I'm using the bigger issue as a 

1005
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,034
scapegoat,
but in reality if you really sit down 

1006
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:35,250
and think about it,
right?

1007
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:36,923
We have over 300,
close to 400 million guns in this 

1008
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:39,564
country and not going anywhere and 
understanding that you've got to then 

1009
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,240
sit down and say to yourself,
all right,

1010
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,913
if we're going to try to fix this issue 
of gun violence or just violence in 

1011
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:50,964
general,
we've got to get to the root of the 

1012
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:55,620
issue of why people are doing it and 
then understanding that.

1013
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,633
Staying within the context of reality.
We've got to understand well in the 

1014
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:00,744
process,
I still have to protect myself and 

1015
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:03,624
because people are still gonna be able 
to get their hands on guns whether 

1016
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,923
illegal or not,
and and use them to commit crimes and 

1017
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,260
the bread and people's lives.

1018
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,783
I've got to be put in a situation to 
defend against that so you can bend all 

1019
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:17,010
the outfit teams you want.
Doesn't mean it's going to stop somebody

1020
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:19,260
from getting one on the black market.
So now,

1021
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,140
yes,
I don't run from the fact that the ar 15

1022
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,170
is a more powerful platform that I agree
with and I don't think it.

1023
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,053
I don't run from that.
They're going to be people on who we 

1024
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,910
were going to be mad at me for saying 
that,

1025
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,043
but the reason why the run from it just 
because that's the very reason why I 

1026
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,730
want an ar 15 when it comes to defending
my life.

1027
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:39,420
I don't want it to be a fair fight 
period.

1028
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,313
I don't want to have to confront someone
with an ar 15 with a handgun if I don't 

1029
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:45,150
have to.
If you come in my house,

1030
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:47,190
I'm not grabbing a handgun.
I am grabbing an arm,

1031
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,730
see we have this strange thing.
It's like when people will say,

1032
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,460
okay,
well the second amendment says the right

1033
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:55,620
to bear arms and then they'll put up a 
picture of,

1034
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,463
you know,
the type of arms that existed way back 

1035
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:58,914
when and it's like well then we should 
have the right to that because that's 

1036
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,020
what they were talking about it.
It's like this is so disingenuous.

1037
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:04,854
Very disingenuous.
It's like they were also talking about 

1038
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:07,704
why you should be able to form a militia
and it's like the thing that we'd be 

1039
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:11,424
fighting against now has a lot more 
power and it doesn't mean that just 

1040
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,320
because you have some guns,
you're going to be able to stop the guys

1041
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:18,030
in the black trucks as you talked about 
earlier,

1042
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,163
but maybe you could defend yourself a 
little bit longer and who knows what 

1043
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:23,610
happens with a little bit of time.

1044
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,583
I mean fruit and be real with them.
They're still fighting in Afghanistan 

1045
00:46:26,691 --> 00:46:28,900
and those guys over there just using AK 
$47.

1046
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,733
You get what I'm saying?
So like we can't just because we're 

1047
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,820
going to lose something that you just 
lie down and do it,

1048
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,380
you know,
and in,

1049
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,250
in that the whole notion of like,
ah man,

1050
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:41,084
I just lost my train of thought that 
this idea of owning firearms to combat 

1051
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,270
the government and they think it's 
preposterous,

1052
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,460
but I'm like,
ask the people in Venezuela,

1053
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,560
and again,
these are now the people,

1054
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:57,394
at least in this current moment,
the people who say that the government 

1055
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:01,090
is run by Orange Hitler.
Exactly,

1056
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,160
man.
It's really well.

1057
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,970
Well this is a good spot.
I think changed some minds and as I said

1058
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:11,620
to you before we sat down and I've never
considered myself a gun person per se.

1059
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,751
Uh,
I'm interested in.

1060
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:15,040
I'm always interested in talking about 
these things,

1061
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,113
but I do find myself now more pro gun.
It's probably not even the right phrase 

1062
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,280
to say that I've ever been in my life 
and then.

1063
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,213
But for me it has more to do with that.
I really understanding what rights are 

1064
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:30,370
in a much clearer way and,
and what I want

1065
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,690
the government to do.
And,

1066
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,360
and once you understand that,
then

1067
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,950
yeah,
no,

1068
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,260
it's tough.
It's tough to take other positions.

1069
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,183
It is weakened.
So is there anything to you that when 

1070
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:45,680
they always say sensible gun control and
I'll always see the pro gun,

1071
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:46,820
people will say,
well,

1072
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:47,654
the people that always say that just 
don't know what they're talking about 

1073
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,350
now I sense you're probably in that spot
because of that.

1074
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,050
You were just saying that they do with 
language.

1075
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,880
Yeah.
So sensible gun control.

1076
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,160
Most of the time when people say that 
they actually advocate things,

1077
00:47:58,161 --> 00:48:02,900
we already had background checks,
things of that nature.

1078
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:04,420
Right?
And then you like,

1079
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,480
and you have other language like the 
loop,

1080
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,800
uh,
the gun show gun,

1081
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,080
your gun show loophole.
Yeah,

1082
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:10,940
let's talk about that.
That's not a loophole.

1083
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,230
All the,
all that is,

1084
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:15,050
is a private transaction.
That's all that is.

1085
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:15,884
And it's just happening happening.
It just so happened to happen at a gun 

1086
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:18,710
show.

1087
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,620
If you bought a gun from an actual 
dealer at a gun show,

1088
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,630
you still have to undergo a background 
check.

1089
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,100
So the when they say loophole with 
saying is that if you are at a gun show,

1090
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,370
you're not a dealer,
you can actually sell that gun at the.

1091
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,293
If you are.
If one person's not a prohibited 

1092
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:39,610
possessor,
you are from the same state then?

1093
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,431
Yes.
If they.

1094
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,380
If there's nothing that precludes them 
from owning a firearm,

1095
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:45,500
legally I can sell them a gun at a gun 
show.

1096
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,423
Right.
So the only slippery part of that is 

1097
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,124
what we talked about earlier,
which is you just may not know all the 

1098
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:52,640
information.
So there is a,

1099
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,503
there is,
I guess there's a little bit of a gray 

1100
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:55,664
area and that one is,
is that a fair in terms of the 

1101
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,830
backgrounds that you're sort of taking 
somebody's word for it at that point.

1102
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,020
When you guys meet somebody that day and
they're like,

1103
00:49:03,021 --> 00:49:04,850
I want to buy that gun.
And you say to that,

1104
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:06,670
you asked them all the appropriate 
questions.

1105
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,010
They could be lying to you,
but that's just.

1106
00:49:10,011 --> 00:49:12,860
Yeah.
But then that sold in the way.

1107
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,740
The response that they have to.
That is a universal background check,

1108
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,050
but as I pointed out,
how do you,

1109
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:18,973
how do you enforce it without a national
registry and then with that national 

1110
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:24,350
registry,
even with the national registry,

1111
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,750
it doesn't stop anything,
right?

1112
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,231
We,
we,

1113
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,064
we,
we tend to go down this road of just 

1114
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,970
wanting to do things to make ourselves 
feel better,

1115
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,193
but in reality name one mass shooting 
that would have been prevented with a 

1116
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,140
universal background check.

1117
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
No one.

1118
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,110
Because even the people who had gone to 
war,

1119
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,410
supposed to have them,
it got them illegally.

1120
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,873
Right?
It wasn't because there wasn't a 

1121
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:50,680
universal background check that stopped 
them from getting,

1122
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,230
you know,
it wasn't.

1123
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,630
So I have to so I have to ask the 
question.

1124
00:49:54,631 --> 00:49:55,464
I go then why are we doing this other 
than just to make ourselves feel better 

1125
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,650
because it's literally doing nothing,
nothing.

1126
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,570
And so that's why like the person who 
who bought and sold the gun privately at

1127
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:07,404
a,
at a gun show could have done that in 

1128
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:12,840
the parking lot of the gun show,
could have done it at their house before

1129
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:14,760
going to the gun show.
You get what I'm saying?

1130
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,973
But what it does is when you frame it 
within the context of the gun show 

1131
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:19,554
loophole,
it makes it seem like it's this bizarre 

1132
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:24,480
where everyone comes there together and 
sells illegal guns.

1133
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,010
That's the image that's created in the 
mind.

1134
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,670
Like it's barter town.
Exactly.

1135
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,760
Like they feed on the,
made on the ignorance of people,

1136
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,230
right?
Because they're not.

1137
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:36,000
Everybody knows that much about guns.
It's like it's one of those things.

1138
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:37,250
It's like,
I don't know,

1139
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,880
I don't know a lot about a lot of other 
things that people may know a lot about.

1140
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,833
Right.
So if you tell me something and I'm not 

1141
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,920
really researched and schooled on that 
issue,

1142
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,530
you could give me the beliefs.
I'm pretty Kooky stuff.

1143
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,580
Yeah.
And,

1144
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,780
and that's what I'm talking to you.
I mean,

1145
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,540
that's what you consistently see every 
time we talk about this.

1146
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,374
And you know,
there's this other piece of it where 

1147
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,880
it's like every time a shooting happens,
you know,

1148
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,770
there's this pile on we now we should 
talk about it.

1149
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:01,604
Yeah.
And then there's this other part of us 

1150
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:06,970
where it's because we go from one crisis
to another that there's never read it.

1151
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,550
It seems to me at this point,
we never really have time to really ever

1152
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:12,470
fully unpack any of these things.
I think.

1153
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,710
I think there's moments like this,
but on a national level,

1154
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,830
we're not particularly good at these 
conversations.

1155
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:18,664
No.
Because then what it does is just turns 

1156
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,960
into a political sparring match.
Yeah.

1157
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,730
I mean right after the last shooting and
when,

1158
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,310
when Dana Lotion and Rubio are on that 
CNN town hall and it was,

1159
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,660
it was amazing.
I mean the gladiatorial fests,

1160
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,890
it,
it was a disaster.

1161
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:32,750
I mean it was everything I hate about 
cable news.

1162
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:33,584
It was everything I hate about just the 
quick bites of all of this and 

1163
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,260
flashiness and just who can we take out 
right now?

1164
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,090
It was a disaster.
And then,

1165
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,593
and I sat and I pointed this out,
how can we have a real honest 

1166
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:50,591
conversation when they try to paint 
program people as crazy when we say no,

1167
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:53,930
the ultimate goal is to ban guns.

1168
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,213
But then I can watch cnn live town hall 
where we suggest you do realize banding 

1169
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,014
on somebody.
The amount of guns is essentially 

1170
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:08,591
banning all guns and the entire stadium 
erupts in applause and cheers.

1171
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:10,880
Yeah.
So then it goes,

1172
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:13,340
Yo.
Rubio said exactly what you said.

1173
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,040
And they started cheering even even when
confronted with the core,

1174
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,730
because Rubio said,
look,

1175
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,013
you want to bet on somebody that had a 
gun to your me kitchen really quickly 

1176
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:24,830
and tell you that it's virtually all 
guns.

1177
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,710
So even when he corrected them,
so it wasn't.

1178
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,640
They can't,
they can't,

1179
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,653
they can't claim they will be ignorant 
on it because he just explained to them 

1180
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:35,290
that needs banning virtually all guns 
and they erupted.

1181
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,060
So it goes,
okay,

1182
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,980
so now you have all those programs are 
like,

1183
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,390
we just going to go back to our client.
There's no discussion.

1184
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:47,030
Because while,
while we're trying to be fair,

1185
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,830
you're ultimate goal is to try to ban 
them all.

1186
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,450
You know,
there was that moment,

1187
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:52,460
I'm sure you remember this,
after the Parkland shooting,

1188
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:56,470
when they had the big rally and one of 
the survivors got up there and said,

1189
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,340
we're going to come.
What was the line?

1190
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,230
Do you remember the exact line where she
said,

1191
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:01,064
basically,
we're going to come for the 

1192
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,343
semiautomatics now,
but we're going to come through 

1193
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:06,600
everything later.
So something to that effect them.

1194
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:07,880
Yeah,
I'm slightly butcher head,

1195
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,290
but I thought,
wow,

1196
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,810
now now you're flat out saying and 
you're just giving.

1197
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:17,180
You're telling them now.
So I could see why.

1198
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:17,671
You know,
I,

1199
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,060
I see this with all my frustrations with
the left all the time.

1200
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:22,910
It's like I know they're never going to 
stop.

1201
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,520
I've seen it so consistently and that's 
why I'm staking out some positions,

1202
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,503
but sometimes it's,
it's kind of sucky to have to just be 

1203
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:29,551
like,
well,

1204
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:32,010
the people that I'm fighting against so 
to speak,

1205
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,820
they're not dealing in the same world 
that I'm dealing in and I.

1206
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,600
and that makes it more important for me 
to stake out a position.

1207
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:40,703
But the thing that's most frustrating 
about it is the way they'll color it in 

1208
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:47,430
the mainstream media is that were 
unreasonable.

1209
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,160
We don't want to move on inch.
We've dug her heels in.

1210
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,860
All we want is we don't care about 
anything.

1211
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,413
And really what it is is no,
I let you into my house and now you're 

1212
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,444
trying to take my house from me.
So get out because that's essentially 

1213
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:06,570
what they're saying is all right.
So they'll say,

1214
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:08,700
well common sense.
That's why we hate that word.

1215
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:11,400
Common sense because it cause it's 
disingenuous.

1216
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,990
It's like,
well we need common sense measures after

1217
00:54:13,991 --> 00:54:18,000
a shooting in another shooting happens,
we need more common sense measures.

1218
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,390
And another shooting happened.
We need even more common sense measures.

1219
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:22,943
Windows commonsense mentioned,
stopped being common sense and just 

1220
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:26,770
intruding on my rights and I can see 
the,

1221
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:28,710
you know,
you know my thing for guns to use,

1222
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:29,580
free speech to me.

1223
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,090
And it's like I can see this coming with
that give these guys took control.

1224
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:35,520
You'd start seeing,
well we can have free speech,

1225
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:38,690
but we need some common sense controls 
around Greece,

1226
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,093
so I.
So I do understand the position that I 

1227
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,020
tell people all the time.
I'm like,

1228
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,920
there are over 300 federal gun laws in 
this country.

1229
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,803
I think we've been reasonable.
I think we were really truly being 

1230
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,273
unreasonable.
We wouldn't have over 300 federal gun 

1231
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,270
law and I can't even begin to tell you 
how many we have on a state level.

1232
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,810
Right?
So it's incredibly disingenuous to think

1233
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:01,644
that we're just being hard,
hard assets who don't want to move one 

1234
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:06,300
inch on the issue.
Right.

1235
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:09,810
No one's saying it should be a free for 
all where we're just handing out guns to

1236
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:11,730
everyone like Oprah.
Right.

1237
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,910
I don't think anybody has a problem 
inherently with background checks.

1238
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,070
Now he's talking about universal 
background checks.

1239
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:18,840
That's a different thing.
But since nobody.

1240
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,730
Since they never want to make that 
distinction,

1241
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,740
right?
No one ever knows that you can't,

1242
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,790
you can't.
Exactly.

1243
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,370
And then the idea of like,
you know,

1244
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:27,204
we can talk about gun free zones and it 
begs the question is like what does 

1245
00:55:31,621 --> 00:55:32,454
that,
what does that sticker on when they're 

1246
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,953
going to do for me?
So now I have to make like people don't 

1247
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:37,283
really like to sympathize with gun 
owners in a sense of like we all want 

1248
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:41,580
the same result,
right?

1249
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,160
We want the killing to stop.
We want the violence to stop.

1250
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,580
Notice I said violence and killing,
not just gun violence,

1251
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:48,414
right?
Because we can't just focus on gun 

1252
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:52,710
violence because violence is violence.
However you die,

1253
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:57,711
you die and it's bad all the way around.
But when I have to make a decision about

1254
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:58,644
whether or not I potentially break a law
to go into an establishment that may or 

1255
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:06,180
may not cause me to need my gun at some 
point,

1256
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,070
and that's messed up.

1257
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,030
And I know that there are a lot of 
people who don't see it that way because

1258
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,864
they don't see value in the second 
amendment because they're not firearm 

1259
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:15,960
owners.
Right?

1260
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,973
There are a lot of people who look at 
the second amendment is useless because 

1261
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:19,974
they don't own firearms,
but when you have a group of people who 

1262
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:22,824
understand the importance of it and how 
it fits into their lives and they 

1263
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:27,790
understand that at the end of the day 
when something happens,

1264
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:31,120
the only person who's going to be there 
to stop it is you.

1265
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,393
That's a big deal.
So it's not just me trying to protect a 

1266
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:38,770
piece of metal because I just want to 
have fun with my guns.

1267
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,740
No,
it's much bigger than that.

1268
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,430
It's this idea that I have to rely on 
myself.

1269
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,830
You can tell me all day long,
the police are going to be there,

1270
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:51,070
the police are going to be there,
but they're not going to be.

1271
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,150
They're just not.
And then,

1272
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,390
and then you think you named were at 
Parkland.

1273
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,660
Exactly right.
So then you,

1274
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,180
then you add kids,
family into the mix.

1275
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,100
That ratchets it up to a whole nother 
level.

1276
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:04,863
So that.
What about the piece of this that just 

1277
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:07,090
sort of optics.
So,

1278
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,220
you know,
every now and again you'll see a picture

1279
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:12,370
of like three dudes with big ass guns at
Aaa,

1280
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,890
an open carry.
Now I know if I was,

1281
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:19,090
if I walked into Japan and three guys 
came in with big ass guns on their back,

1282
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,180
you can prototype notice why would take 
notice?

1283
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:24,610
And I probably leave.
I probably would,

1284
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:25,730
I would just be like,
you know,

1285
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,441
like,
and again I'm here,

1286
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:27,980
I'm here in California where that would 
be so,

1287
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,163
so out of the norm.
But for the person that's living in 

1288
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:33,760
Texas,
you can do this.

1289
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,920
If I was in AAA,
right?

1290
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,700
And three guys walking in,
I probably would leave no one.

1291
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:42,550
Everything that you just said there,
knowing that these guys are probably NRA

1292
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:44,440
members and,
and as far as I know,

1293
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:46,760
no NRA member has ever done a mass 
shooting know.

1294
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,800
Right?
Okay.

1295
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:48,610
So,
uh,

1296
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,480
you know,
because you see this,

1297
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:50,680
all the celebrities,
Michael,

1298
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:51,514
Ian Black light out on the show who's on
this rampage telling everyone that you 

1299
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:54,814
guys are terrorists.
I mean really that you're part of a 

1300
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:58,100
terrorist organization.
Okay?

1301
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,953
And so all the other 5 million members,
but I think there is something about 

1302
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:03,940
some of the optics of that,
you know what I mean?

1303
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:06,520
Like I would be nervous now.
I get your point would be,

1304
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:09,160
well those guys are going to protect you
and the other guy walks in or whatever.

1305
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,130
And some of that may be feelings over 
facts right there,

1306
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:13,420
but it just,
it just is.

1307
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,330
The interesting thing about it that is a
big debate within the gun,

1308
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,223
the gun community as a whole.
The idea of open carry versus concealed 

1309
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:23,410
carry.
I don't ever open carry except for maybe

1310
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:27,070
if I'm out hunting or I'm on the range 
or something like that.

1311
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,200
But that's,
that's a personal decision.

1312
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:31,660
I'm choosing my own for various reasons.
One,

1313
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:34,180
sometimes I rather not have the 
attention.

1314
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,100
And tactically I liked the advantage of 
having the element of surprise.

1315
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,650
You don't know I have a gun on me,
so if I had to use it,

1316
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,930
I'm going to be reacting.
Right?

1317
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,670
I'm not going into a place to shoot it 
up.

1318
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,810
If somebody decides to come into a place
to shoot,

1319
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:48,843
I'm going to be reacting to that.
So I need all the advantages I get from 

1320
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:54,010
my personal perspective.
So I want the element of surprise.

1321
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,530
There's some people who think only 
alternative.

1322
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,423
They feel like just the mere presence of
that gun is a deterrent from anyone who 

1323
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,704
wants to come in and do some bad.
So if a guys casing out a couple of 

1324
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:05,420
stores in,
then ecs,

1325
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,460
there are certain citizens in there with
long guns and some that have a hand guns

1326
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:11,620
on the side of your hip,
then that's a deterrent.

1327
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,223
I understand the alarm that people who 
don't necessarily engage in interact 

1328
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:21,100
with fire arms get when they see people 
walking around with rifles.

1329
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,240
Right.
Even though I've never been.

1330
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:24,074
I've seen a couple of people in Texas do
it and initially my gut reaction and 

1331
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,760
I'll admit was like,
what?

1332
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,650
What's going on here?
I'm now,

1333
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,230
I'm very versed firearms and I have a 
gun too.

1334
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:38,890
So at that point I actually almost 
welcome it and the reason why is because

1335
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,340
if you're going to do something,
I now get to see you attempt to do it.

1336
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,130
You get what I'm saying?
There's a telegraph.

1337
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:49,430
They are in a unique case.
Yes,

1338
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,060
but I'm speaking from purely a personal 
preference,

1339
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:53,913
right?
Am I getting on the whole for anyone 

1340
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:56,540
else or anything like that?
Me Personally,

1341
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,500
I would rather like to know you have it 
right if I can see it,

1342
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,753
because then I know where to focus my 
attention versus me kind of being alone 

1343
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,860
to a state of complacency because of its
absence.

1344
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:07,843
And then all of a sudden somebody stands
up and decides he wants to shoot the 

1345
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:10,720
place up.
Um,

1346
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:12,450
and then I have to react to that.
Um,

1347
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,120
but again,
that's tactics,

1348
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:14,690
right?
That,

1349
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,580
that's personal preference in that 
regard.

1350
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:17,563
However,
I do understand the alarm that somebody 

1351
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:21,320
who would have seen you three guys 
walking into aaa with,

1352
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:24,230
uh,
with rifles because it seems seemingly,

1353
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,720
especially to them,
it seems like that's a bit excessive.

1354
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,480
I'm not gonna lie to you.
If I can conceal carry a rifle,

1355
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,530
I would because it's better at defending
me than a handgun was the only reason.

1356
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,543
The only reason I have a handgun it was 
because it's small enough for me to 

1357
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:39,770
conceal and it allows me to live my life
in an uninterrupted.

1358
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:42,290
Otherwise I'd walk around with a rifle.
Okay.

1359
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,124
So we can't end without doing sort of 
what I think would be the big question 

1360
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,933
for everything we've talked about.
Hearing for someone that works with the 

1361
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:50,690
NRA and your show is on nitv and all 
that.

1362
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:56,170
So what is going on in America right now
that seems to be unique to our society?

1363
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,233
We do have more shootings here than I 
and I think virtually all other western 

1364
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:05,550
nations combined.
Um,

1365
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,540
so.
Okay.

1366
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:09,800
For you to fact check me on that if I 
butchered that one.

1367
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,140
But it does seem it's.
And even if I'm slightly.

1368
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:12,471
Oh No,
no,

1369
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:13,240
you're good.
You're good.

1370
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,240
It seems that there is something 
uniquely happening here now.

1371
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,074
I would argue that there's all sorts of 
mental health issues and probably a 

1372
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,463
prescription drugs and maybe non 
prescription drugs and all sorts of 

1373
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,990
other stuff.
So there's a,

1374
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,380
there were a couple of things.
So I'll try to.

1375
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:28,214
I've try to keep this as concise as 
possible because we are going to get 

1376
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:31,040
into weeds for a split second.
He got.

1377
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,050
So first of all,
let's talk about mass shootings,

1378
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:33,760
right?
Your schools,

1379
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,000
school districts.
For instance,

1380
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:39,110
I recently just read a study from 
northwestern university I'm not too long

1381
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:39,944
ago,
which talked about comparing the number 

1382
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:44,810
of school shootings back in the nineties
versus the versus today.

1383
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,003
And what they concluded essentially was 
the perception is that it's happening 

1384
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:51,020
more frequently,
but it's not,

1385
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,430
it's actually on par or even less now 
than it was then.

1386
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,360
Now you can people who are going to do 
like,

1387
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,930
oh my God,
how could you possibly say that?

1388
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,180
Google it.
It's a northwestern university.

1389
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,560
Um,
research.

1390
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,960
Uh,
I can't remember the actual title of the

1391
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:06,794
actual research,
but we're going to grab it from you 

1392
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:11,470
after this guy's linked to it.
And absolutely.

1393
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:16,220
So that being said,
mass shootings account for a very,

1394
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:20,100
very,
very marginal percentage of shootings in

1395
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:23,430
this country.
Let's start off with the overall.

1396
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:25,350
So 35,
35 to 36,000

1397
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:28,170
people each year die from guns,
right?

1398
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,153
I didn't specify gun violence,
but just guns because they don't do 

1399
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:32,190
that.
They'll just say gun violence.

1400
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:37,220
Right?
So 60 about 60 to 65 percent of those,

1401
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,870
that 35,000
suicides.

1402
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,750
Now what I'm not saying is we don't care
about suicides.

1403
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,160
We do.
However,

1404
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:48,470
when it comes to the idea and the issue 
of somebody shooting at me that's a.

1405
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,220
that's not.
It's not Germane.

1406
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,470
But then even still,
if you want to make the argument,

1407
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:53,460
well,
if we had less guns,

1408
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:57,210
we'd have less suicides.
That's also not true because our suicide

1409
01:02:57,211 --> 01:02:59,610
rate is on par with every other major 
country.

1410
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,950
So if it was a case that the more guns 
you have,

1411
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:03,780
the more suicides will you be leading 
the charge?

1412
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,670
We don't there where there's a will.
There's a way.

1413
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:06,504
Exactly right.
Even some of the more famous suicides 

1414
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:09,960
that we've had,
they didn't use guns.

1415
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,200
So we sat that number aside,
which is a huge number,

1416
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,780
65 percent,
it's huge number out of 35,

1417
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:16,614
36,000.
So then you have about one to three 

1418
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:23,040
percent which are justifiable homicides,
that self defense,

1419
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:26,250
that's including police shooting 
criminals who are shooting at them,

1420
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,130
right?
And people who use guns in self defense,

1421
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,233
right?
We got to set that aside because that's 

1422
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:34,530
not the issue we're trying to address.

1423
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:35,723
So it's at that number.
So and then you have about five percent 

1424
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,200
which are accidental,
right?

1425
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,610
Kid gets behind the gun,
pull triggers,

1426
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,480
unfortunate,
extremely unfortunate.

1427
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:46,703
However,
I believe personally half of that can 

1428
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,773
easily be addressed with more education.
So if we took the energy that we took 

1429
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,933
that we we placed,
now I'm trying to vilify guns and have 

1430
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:02,040
national campaigns teaching people about
gun safety,

1431
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,653
that we'll cut that number in half 
because a lot of these accidents easily 

1432
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:07,230
preventable,
but they're just people who have gone to

1433
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:08,064
just don't know.
And so if we spend time educating those 

1434
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:11,844
people,
do we know what percentage of that 

1435
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,810
subset is getting those guns legally or 
illegally?

1436
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,940
Because I would imagine that a lot of 
it's probably illegal,

1437
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,680
which is why they don't know how to use 
the gun in the first.

1438
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,543
I'm not going to assume I have that 
answer because I don't have that hard 

1439
01:04:23,101 --> 01:04:23,640
number.

1440
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,480
Um,
but,

1441
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:27,720
and I would bet I do feel comfortable 
assuming that as well.

1442
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,280
Right?
Um,

1443
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:33,120
and so we take that,
the accidents and set that aside,

1444
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:39,530
purely homicides were looking at around 
seven to 10,000

1445
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,330
every year.
Right now,

1446
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:47,790
that's a different looking number,
right?

1447
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,720
When will be accounted for all of the,
the context here with those,

1448
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:56,780
those other shootings.
Now the vast majority,

1449
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,403
I'd say close to 80 percent that I've 
read in a couple of articles of those 

1450
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:06,030
homicides are happening in the inner 
cities of our country.

1451
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,770
Right?
So then reasoning goes,

1452
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:11,604
all right,
so let's look at those inner cities and 

1453
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,710
it's,
look at the dynamics there,

1454
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:16,920
right?
You have low jobs,

1455
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,063
lack of economic opportunity,
storied households and a narco economy 

1456
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:29,990
that warrants that warrants but creates 
the necessity for this type of violence.

1457
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,273
So if we dealt with the socioeconomic 
aspects of what's going on in those 

1458
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:39,840
areas right to we really have a gun 
problem,

1459
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,593
just think about it.
I know I know other communities filled 

1460
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:47,440
with black people,
they have guns,

1461
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,350
they don't have the same level of 
violence because I only say black people

1462
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:53,170
because most people associate the inner 
city with with black people.

1463
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:54,004
Right?
But the reason why we had that high 

1464
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:57,184
level of concentration of violence,
it's because of the conditions in those 

1465
01:05:59,111 --> 01:05:59,944
environments.
And then even within those communities 

1466
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:03,064
there are.
The vast majority of people in those 

1467
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:05,224
committees are good people and it's a 
very minor group of people who are 

1468
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:11,410
creating a large number of the violence.
Right?

1469
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:15,880
So there's something to be said.
Do we really have a gun problem or do we

1470
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:20,230
have a social economic suicide problem 
in this country?

1471
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,040
Because at the end of the day,
this 35 to 36,000

1472
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,920
that people assuming is all gun violence
by way of homicides,

1473
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:31,570
people shooting at other people to kill 
them.

1474
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,203
It's not the case.
We're looking at closer to seven to 

1475
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:36,100
10,000
if that.

1476
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,310
So if you take those numbers and you 
compare them other countries,

1477
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,533
then how does it look?

1478
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,820
Could it be continued?
Yeah.

1479
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,733
Well I'm so glad that we finally did 
this and we will definitely do this 

1480
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:47,764
again because I absolutely.
This story and everything we've talked 

1481
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:51,124
about here is just going to continue.
I mean these are the battles that we're 

1482
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:54,604
now fighting on many fronts related to 
the constitution and free speech and 

1483
01:06:58,091 --> 01:07:02,170
free expression and your ability to,
to own your life and all that stuff.

1484
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:04,090
And that's all we ask is.
This is a.

1485
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,983
let me see.

1486
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,540
Well I'll say one last thing.
Yeah,

1487
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,960
people are,
there are a lot of people.

1488
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:09,570
It was like,
why do you feel the need to carry a gun?

1489
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,570
Why?
I like the chances of you needing to use

1490
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,570
that gun to protect yourself one 
percent.

1491
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:19,140
And the answer I have for that is this.
You may be right.

1492
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,230
The chance of me need to care to 
actually use my gun to defend myself.

1493
01:07:22,231 --> 01:07:24,780
Maybe really slim,
maybe one percent,

1494
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,340
but if that one percent happens,
it's 100 percent of everything.

1495
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,750
The consequences are 100 percent and 
that's why it's so important.

1496
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,530
Yeah.
Right.

1497
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,600
Well,
that's how you and to show you know,

1498
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:39,130
you maybe we'll do this next time.
Maybe we'll bring you on with someone on

1499
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:41,110
some of the other side of the issues on 
this.

1500
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,230
I will tell them what that conversation 
sounds like.

1501
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:45,250
A plan.
All right.

1502
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:47,820
