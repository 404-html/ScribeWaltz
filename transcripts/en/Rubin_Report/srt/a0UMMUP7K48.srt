1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,900
Joining me today is the host of Tucker 
Carlson,

2
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:11,040
tonight on Fox News,
now a New York Times best selling author

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,040
with his new book ship of fools,
Tucker Carlson.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,710
Welcome to the Rubin.
I am glad to have you here,

5
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,390
my friend.
I'm glad to be here.

6
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:19,224
I love this.
I don't know that anyone that has ever 

7
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,624
walked in here and been more impressed 
by the rubrics and television so I know 

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,810
what this is and it's just the coolest 
thing I've seen in a long time.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,690
Are you jealous?
Are you joking?

10
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:31,890
Yes,
I'm jealous.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,910
You have millions and millions of views,
a massive staff,

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,550
but I don't have the control that you 
have,

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,870
which is wonderful.
Yeah,

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,741
control.
All right,

15
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,740
so speaking of control,
I have only one goal for the next hour,

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,750
which is to some point say something so 
ludicrous that you stare at me with that

17
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:53,751
face where I make do that.
Where did the face come?

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,180
It's totally everyone the memes that 
come in with that,

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,060
but the funny thing is when,
I mean that's just my face at rest,

20
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:00,894
which is golden retriever,
like I'm a mouth breather and when I 

21
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,450
first started this show,
um,

22
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,330
I got complaints about it internally and
the idea was,

23
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:10,880
it's too embarrassing.
Click a moron,

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,550
but I can't stop.
I can't help myself.

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,420
So I'm not as super self aware person.
I'm not a mirror user for example,

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,390
because if you work in TV and you become
really self conscious,

27
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,224
it destroys you and makes you insecure.
So I just am trained after 20 years not 

28
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:26,694
to think about the way I look and I 
didn't even know that I look like a 

29
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,110
moron,
but I do and I'm not changing.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,033
Well,
I know you're not guessing because even 

31
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:38,970
just now when you were in the green room
and my girl is putting makeup on your,

32
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,770
you,
you sat there for literally two seconds.

33
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,730
You were like,
don't do anything.

34
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:42,564
You didn't even look at the mirror.
You're looking at me and you can go 

35
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,620
crazy.
As you know in TV,

36
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:49,200
if you start to think about how other 
people perceive you,

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,930
you just drowned in lake me,
you know,

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,520
and I don't want that.
All right.

39
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,710
So I'm glad to have you here for a 
couple of reasons.

40
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,544
We're going to get into the book and 
obviously we're kind of simpatico on 

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,420
what I think are the big issues of the 
day to free speech,

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,890
all that stuff.
But I will be totally honest with you,

43
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:09,210
years ago when I first saw you on a 
crossfire on CNN,

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,230
I was not a fan.
Now I was alone in that I thought here's

45
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:19,530
this bow tie wearing guy who was 
seemingly kind of smug and whatever.

46
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,180
And I was a lefty at the time.
So,

47
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,760
so we were really polar opposites 
politically,

48
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,290
but everything has shifted enough that,
that we are kind of allies now.

49
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,470
And I actually think that's Kinda cool.
So before we do anything else,

50
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,160
tell me about little Tucker Carlson.
People know about Tucker Carlson,

51
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,250
that eviscerates socialists all day.
What was that like as a kid?

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
Yeah,
southern California.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,693
And um,
we lived in studio city and I mean I 

54
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,564
think I've always been the same 
anti-authoritarian for the individual 

55
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,810
against the group.
Um,

56
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,350
I,
I hate bullies,

57
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,730
I hate being bullied more than anything.
And so if I find myself,

58
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,564
and I've always been this way in a 
scenario where everyone is forced to 

59
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,770
sort of,
not in bovine agreement about something,

60
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,390
my instinct is always to be the one guy 
who was like,

61
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:07,210
no,
and I'm so,

62
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,044
I haven't changed at all.
The particulars of my political beliefs 

63
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,850
have changed because America has changed
so dramatically.

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,013
I'm 49,
so in the last 40 years it's become a 

65
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,270
different country and a lot of the 
things that I thought would work haven't

66
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,050
worked.

67
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,883
A lot of the things I thought were not 
threatening turned out to be 

68
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,830
threatening.
So,

69
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,420
you know,
my views have changed,

70
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,120
but my instincts have remained 
consistent over time.

71
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,510
Were you always political or were your 
parents?

72
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,990
I was always political.
Yeah.

73
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
Well I was always interested in history 
and my father was a non conformist,

74
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,000
I would say.
I mean that's an understatement.

75
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,283
And his baseline position was just 
because everybody says it doesn't mean 

76
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:51,250
it's true in the answers to the way,
uh,

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,353
people are found in history because the 
one immutable fact of history as human 

78
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:56,164
nature,
like it literally does not change and 

79
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,624
you see consistent themes over time.
And so if you want to understand what's 

80
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,010
happening,
look backward and you will,

81
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,070
I mean just pretty conventional stuff.
But now it sounds kind of radical,

82
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,100
but I'm basically at.
My main influence was my dad.

83
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,760
I grew up with my dad and my brother.
And again,

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
his view was,
you know,

85
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,080
just because all the Chin tuggers are 
saying it does not prove it.

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,060
Does that seem like a pretty obvious 
through line to your success right now?

87
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:27,061
Because it's like every day there is 
some other group think exactly.

88
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,580
Lunacy that it's like these people then 
go on your show.

89
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,990
And I always think it's hilarious 
because it's like,

90
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:36,991
do they know what they're getting into?
They're going to be a and will,

91
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,530
but they don't actually have the same 
goals for the debate that I do.

92
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,753
So I'm linear and literal and old 
fashioned and I go into it believing 

93
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:51,631
that I can win the person over with a 
superior reasoning or you know,

94
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,943
a larger and more compelling facts set 
or whatever they're coming to this 

95
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,110
believing they've already won because 
they have superior virtue.

96
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,750
So they're having a theological 
conversation.

97
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,620
I'm having a political debate and too 
often we talk past each other.

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,170
That's interesting.
Theological conversation.

99
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,090
A couple,
a couple of people have mentioned on the

100
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,730
show,
my friend Peter,

101
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,180
because he and a philosophy professor 
has been on a few times.

102
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,540
He calls this sort of new leftism a 
secular religion.

103
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,980
Of course.
Do you view that?

104
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:19,060
Look,
I'm an Episcopalian,

105
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:19,894
so I know what happened because the 
episcopal church was the church or the 

106
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,563
American ruling class,
our national cathedrals and Episcopal 

107
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,004
church.
So our culture was rooted in mainline 

108
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,360
protestantism.
I mean this was a Protestant country and

109
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,223
our rulers,
whether they were like literally 

110
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:37,414
Protestant or not,
internalized the values of that faith 

111
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,110
and then within like a 20 year period,
the faith evaporated.

112
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,900
The Episcopal church barely exists 
anymore,

113
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,270
and certainly as a national force it's 
irrelevant,

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,300
but that didn't eliminate the religious 
impulse within people,

115
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,000
which is inherent.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,070
It's innate.
We're born that way.

117
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:58,190
We worship something in the end whether 
you know it doesn't need to be God,

118
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,623
and so they've transferred that 
religious impulse to the political 

119
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,914
sphere.
They're making the same arguments that 

120
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,530
19th century Protestants made,
especially the calvinists like,

121
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,180
I am safe.
Like I know this.

122
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,910
That's my baseline assumption.
I'm one of God's elect.

123
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,013
You were not.
If you go into any conversation like 

124
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:18,764
that,
nothing will be resolved because it's 

125
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,490
already been decided.
Well,

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,460
it's good.
Verse Evil.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Exactly,
exactly what it is.

128
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,530
Yeah.
Was it always like this?

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,320
It wasn't like wha.
What,

130
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:35,930
what Gimme Gimme some markers of when 
you saw things kind of start to change.

131
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,890
I mean,
I'm kind of,

132
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,743
you know,
I'm not an intellectual and a talk show 

133
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,464
host,
so I'm a little that we have our promo 

134
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,850
clip.
Well,

135
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,060
it's,
it's true.

136
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,110
I mean,
that's what I do.

137
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,303
Um,
so it took me a while to see the 

138
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,311
outline.
I mean,

139
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:50,144
this all comes kind of slowly to me 
because I'm caught in an earlier time 

140
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:54,224
just by virtue of my age and so I would 
have these conversations that were 

141
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:01,871
confusing to me where you'd be debating 
a so called liberal and I would be and I

142
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,860
would find myself taking the liberal 
side,

143
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,723
like in favor of free speech or you 
might default suspicion of corporate 

144
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,704
power or concentrations of power 
anywhere because it's a threat to the 

145
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,060
individual or in favor of due process or
you know,

146
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:16,894
I would take a position that I heard 
liberals have of my childhood take and 

147
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,280
the liberal I'm debating will be like,
nope.

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,100
And if Google says that it's true or you
know,

149
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:25,934
if you're accused,
prove yourself innocent or if what you 

150
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,394
say is offensive,
you don't have right to say it and be 

151
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,200
like,
wait a second.

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,150
This is a mirror image of what I grew up
with.

153
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,640
So actually to answer your question as 
honestly as I can,

154
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,770
I don't know if they ever really meant 
what they said.

155
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,753
I really don't.
It's possible that the pursuit of power 

156
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,813
and the empowerment of the Democratic 
Party was always the goal and that was 

157
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,740
just the disguise they used in order to 
achieve it.

158
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,450
In 1979,
I don't know the answer.

159
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Do you think we'd be in a healthier 
situation if there was a same democratic

160
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:56,970
party even if all the policies were 
again and believes?

161
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,880
Yeah,
that's the point in my book.

162
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:03,170
The funkshway is off,
so for 100 years you had one party which

163
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:05,120
was the corporate party,
the Republican Party,

164
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,283
the country club party,
the party of the ruling class and the 

165
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:09,810
other party existed.
Ineffective.

166
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,200
Keep it in check and to say,
wait a second,

167
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,110
you know you're getting rich because all
these people are working really hard.

168
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,580
You need to think about their interests 
and a bunch of different things happen.

169
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,423
The value of labor dropped because of 
technology to the point where it's not 

170
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,720
even worth representing the working 
class because they're not worth anything

171
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,930
actually that this was the calculation 
of the Democratic Party.

172
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,333
And so basically what you have is this 
weird alignment where the leadership of 

173
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:35,894
the Republican Party represents 
corporate interests and leadership of 

174
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:38,454
the Democratic Party represents 
corporate interests and there's no one 

175
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,670
to represent the middle class.
And that again,

176
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,563
the balance is off.
You need a vigorous party standing up 

177
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,400
and saying,
well wait a second.

178
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,630
You need balance.
Always.

179
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,810
You need balance.
Yeah.

180
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,890
So is that the part of this that sort of
scary for our future.

181
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:55,724
And that's kind of what you're going for
in the book is that if one side 

182
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:58,914
completely implodes,
which it seems more likely as we're 

183
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,180
taping this at the moment,
that the Democrats are.

184
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,140
Yes,
absolutely implode.

185
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,213
That it's not as if all the conservative
policies that you might like would 

186
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,460
suddenly take root.
It's that we would actually tilt in some

187
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,470
really bizarre.
Exactly.

188
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,363
That's exactly right.
I mean this is why marriage is an 

189
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:22,371
institution works because there's like 
another person pushing back against your

190
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,070
bad instincts are balancing you out.
You know,

191
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,120
and what's true at home is probably true
on a national scale,

192
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,830
on a political scale.
And yes,

193
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,950
you absolutely need a vigorous and 
principled opposition party always,

194
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,790
or else you've got something really 
ugly.

195
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,040
Then you've got the monitor party,
which is kind of what we have.

196
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,073
You know Jordan Peterson,
who I know you admire also one of the 

197
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,814
lines when he's talking about politics,
it's interesting you brought up 

198
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,100
marriage.
Hello.

199
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,260
He say,
you know,

200
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,080
it's like a fight with your spouse.
You don't want to beat them because then

201
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,430
you're married to a loser.

202
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,293
You want to give them a chance to figure
out something so that you'll be able to 

203
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,570
move forward.
And we seem at this,

204
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,663
we're at this odd place right now where 
it's like one side is trying to be the 

205
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,824
other side,
the other side of trying to beat the 

206
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,760
other side and the rest of us,
which I think is actually most of us are

207
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:10,680
just like,
that's true,

208
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,050
and you don't want to beat your spouse 
because you're married to a loser,

209
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,570
but you're also a loser if you're 
married to a loser.

210
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,404
The point is,
you're implicated in the future of the 

211
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:21,660
other side because in the end you're all
in this together.

212
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,660
Even though you're coming from it from 
different perspectives,

213
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,880
so you're,
we're all Americans,

214
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,950
so in the same way that crushing your 
spouse doesn't actually win you any kind

215
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:36,750
of meaningful victory or victory you'd 
want crushing your fellow Americans,

216
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,560
doesn't improve your life or your 
country.

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,580
So like,
you know,

218
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,414
you don't want any of this.
It's going to lead to something really 

219
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,080
bad action,
really ugly.

220
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:50,430
And everybody who's paying any kind of 
attention senses it on an animal level.

221
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,140
This is,
this is moving in a,

222
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:52,974
in a really ominous direction.
So I know we could talk about why we're 

223
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,310
frustrated with the Democrats all along 
and all that,

224
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,810
but let's,
let's put that aside because I feel like

225
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,850
that's a little bit of low hanging fruit
and we both do it.

226
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,170
We do it enough.
So let's,

227
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,210
let's talk more about the Republican.
Yes.

228
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,860
So tell me some of your frustrations 
with the Republican Party.

229
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,830
It's really simple.
The Democratic Party was for,

230
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,080
you know,
add probably close to 100 years,

231
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:19,620
the party of wage earners,
and sometime in the last,

232
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:22,500
I would say 15 years,
probably at the end of the Clinton,

233
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,513
right,
to kind of apex of the tech boom in the 

234
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,890
late nineties,
uh,

235
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,783
the Clinton administration decided to 
reorient the party away from its 

236
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:29,844
traditional base to it's new base,
which is the rich and the poor and the 

237
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,730
Republican party being dumb didn't see 
this.

238
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,163
And it was only the emergence of trump 
that forced them to sort of realize 

239
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,220
that,
wait a second,

240
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,800
you know,
we don't represent the people we thought

241
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:47,130
we represented actually the country.
It was the country club party.

242
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:48,870
They denied it.
They hated that.

243
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,520
That line,
because it was true.

244
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,500
I mean it's,
it's the things that are true that we,

245
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,593
we do,
but we now need to become the 

246
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,291
middleclass party.
Well,

247
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,230
they just didn't want to become the 
middleclass party actually at all.

248
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,370
And it took trump.
I mean,

249
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,263
trump is a flawed person.
Complex will not a complex person but a 

250
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,140
flawed person.
We'll get to that,

251
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,390
but he basically has forced the 
Republican party to be what it in effect

252
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,000
already is the party of last resort for 
people making,

253
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:22,600
you know,
50 to $150,000

254
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:23,111
a year,
you know,

255
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:23,944
the people who are making enough not to 
be on welfare but not enough to send 

256
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:27,670
their kids to summer camp.

257
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,103
That is a.
I mean that's the core of the country 

258
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,540
and they don't want to represent those 
people and to.

259
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,970
So to me,
and I'm not one of those people,

260
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,980
I'm not here to give you the view from 
coal country at all.

261
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,050
I grew up in La Jolla and Georgetown,
so like,

262
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,950
but I know less about what the middle 
class things.

263
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,490
I know a lot about what the ruling class
things.

264
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:46,324
Having lived in it my whole life and 
they hate the leadership of the 

265
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,213
Republican Party.
Hates the American middle class and has 

266
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,090
contempt for them and that's 
infuriating.

267
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,820
What does it say though that trump who's
not one of them?

268
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,440
Exactly.
To care about them.

269
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,450
You who's not.
One of them seems to care them.

270
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,120
Me grew up in new.
I've only lived in New York and La.

271
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,983
Yeah,
exactly.

272
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,290
Like what is that?
What?

273
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,133
Why has there been such a shift that 
that almost seems impossible to that 

274
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,354
trump would be the hero of these people,
but that's exactly the last time we had 

275
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:16,480
something like this.

276
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,700
Of course it was in the progressive era,
Teddy Roosevelt,

277
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,940
really the pivotal president of post 
civil war America.

278
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:26,941
I would argue who made this a capitalist
country by restraining capitalism the,

279
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,500
you know,
the Romanovs didn't do that and they got

280
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,380
70 years bolshevism.
Right.

281
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,450
But Roosevelt,
who really was a genius,

282
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,480
I was like,
wait a second.

283
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,400
The concentration is corporate power.
So scary.

284
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,383
They're gonna overwhelm the democracy 
and we're going to have a counter 

285
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,550
reaction,
you know,

286
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,680
in the wobblies are going to take power.
So Roosevelt was the last person to fill

287
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:49,870
this role and he was exactly the same.
Similar to trump.

288
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,350
He wasn't throwing chairs through the 
window into the country club.

289
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:54,184
He was throwing them out onto the street
like he was from the class that he was 

290
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:02,320
trying to restrain.
And you sort of have to be like,

291
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,510
he knew what they were like because he 
was one of them.

292
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,560
I don't know,
there's something,

293
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,390
but I would just say my,
for me,

294
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,224
it always goes back to I have greater 
sympathy for the lone guy who's getting 

295
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,730
pushed around that I do for the group 
that's pushing them around.

296
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:18,610
So I feel like right now the least 
popular group in America,

297
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,983
you know,
lives in the middle west and they have 

298
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:25,540
kind of antiquated social attitudes and 
they have very little economic power and

299
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,730
they're overweight and everyone hates 
them.

300
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,820
And I feel like really because they're 
Americans actually like,

301
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,750
you don't.
What is this,

302
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,230
what they were doing this to black 
people or Hispanics or any group.

303
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,780
I would be sympathetic because I hate 
that.

304
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,103
And I'm actually not even sure that when
it comes to some of the social stuff 

305
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,870
that their abuser.
That and I agree,

306
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,740
I think they've changed.
And I think,

307
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,510
I mean I can see this from you would 
know,

308
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,440
you would know you.

309
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,380
People don't.
They want you to live however you are.

310
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,223
They don't want you to come on their 
property and take their stuff and you 

311
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:57,740
can't punch them walking down the 
liberal gay guy from New York.

312
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,300
They're like,
we love,

313
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,550
you know,
I mean,

314
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,010
I totally agree actually,
but in the mind,

315
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,750
in the kind of Cliche,
controlled mind of your average Brooklyn

316
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,950
intellectual,
they're all,

317
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,350
you know,
medieval,

318
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,213
but they're not actually there.
They're basically libertarian and 

319
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,160
temperament.
They always have been.

320
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,093
Yeah.
So what is trump then as you've 

321
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,830
interviewed the guy a bunch of times?
Yeah.

322
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,243
What actually in the scheme of what your
book is about and sort of where America 

323
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:30,380
is at at the moment,
is he just the great record that we sort

324
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,214
of needed so that this ship of fools 
wasn't gonna sink and take everybody a 

325
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,763
record.
Look,

326
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,643
here's what trump is not.
Trump is not the guy who comes to 

327
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,870
Washington and transforms the system 
because he's not capable of that.

328
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,340
He's not interested in that.
Washington is a very specific town.

329
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,174
Okay.
So like the legislative process is 

330
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,390
highly complex.
He doesn't understand.

331
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,210
It doesn't seek to.
He's not going to be the guy who runs on

332
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,250
these nine policies and then affects 
them once,

333
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:56,480
select it,
gets them to the congress,

334
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,710
gets them to the agencies he can.
Um,

335
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,800
that's not his role.
It's very frustrating actually.

336
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,510
If you're from DC like me to watch it,
you're like,

337
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,344
wow,
you know what a second get the Energy 

338
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,233
Department under control,
not going to happen is $3 million 

339
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:10,340
executive branch employees versus trump 
trump's role.

340
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,050
Is that right?
That's that right there.

341
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,060
There's $3,000,000,000,
million.

342
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:14,894
Three dollars million executive.
I think there are 3 million executive 

343
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,564
branch employee that,
that may include the military by the 

344
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:22,040
way,
which was not quite right,

345
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,874
but I'm just saying like the permanent 
class in DC and I live right in the 

346
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:27,470
center of them.

347
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,161
You know,
they hate trump.

348
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,750
He's a threat to them,
but why do they hate him?

349
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,910
They hate him.
Not because he's a right winger.

350
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,910
He's hardly right.
We're actually here.

351
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,120
They hate him because he's the guy who 
says the obvious things.

352
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,853
So like when we went to Helsinki last 
summer and interviewed him during the 

353
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,864
Putin thing and like the crystallized 
for me in this conversation I had with 

354
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,680
him off camera,
I said,

355
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,240
I said something,
I'm asking about NATO.

356
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,640
And he goes,
why don't we have NATO?

357
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,610
And as someone who's looked like a Cold 
War Kid,

358
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:56,001
I was like,
well,

359
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,590
I like NATO.
I'm thinking to myself.

360
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:58,071
And he goes,
you know,

361
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:59,940
the Soviet Union,
you know,

362
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,123
fell in 1991.
It wasn't the point of Vedo keep them 

363
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,090
from invading western Europe but they 
don't exist anymore.

364
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,530
Why?
Why do we still have them?

365
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,740
And I'm trying to searching for a good 
answer and I couldn't find one.

366
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,380
So trump repeats this and public.
And everyone's like,

367
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,150
well,
shut up.

368
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,290
You know,
what are you working for?

369
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,990
Potent?
And I thought this is what trump does.

370
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:22,520
He comes in and his kind of artistic way
and ask the obvious question at the core

371
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,940
of whatever the issue is.
That is the one question everyone's been

372
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,410
avoiding because they don't have to 
answer to it.

373
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,380
So like,
well why do,

374
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:33,620
why are we signing a trade agreement and
letting the other signatories ignore the

375
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,540
terms?
Why don't we have a border?

376
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,880
I don't know,
these are not complex questions are very

377
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:38,714
obvious questions,
but because they are an answered an 

378
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:42,614
unanswerable,
in some cases they exposed shorter the 

379
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,034
mediocrity of a ruling class.
Like they actually don't know what 

380
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,410
they're doing is the truth.
Right?

381
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,150
So I have a lot of friends.
I think you know,

382
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:52,984
some of them who think that this thing 
that you're talking about with trump is 

383
00:17:56,081 --> 00:18:00,790
this sort of existential threat to the 
system that this erratic minus this idea

384
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,624
of you just throw the idea out there and
then let it sort of ruminate and see 

385
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,614
what happens.
But that is just too dangerous to play 

386
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:09,900
ball with.
I suspect you disagree.

387
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,641
Well,
I don't know.

388
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,474
I mean I don't think you want.
I mean populism is a threat to 

389
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:14,534
everything that we have.
I'm not a populist at all and I think 

390
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:22,550
it's.
But I think populism arises as a symptom

391
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,190
of discontent that you need to address 
in a democracy.

392
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,840
If you want to continue the democracy,
so,

393
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,943
um,
I don't want to live in a country this 

394
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,120
volatile anymore.
Nobody does,

395
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,800
but I think in order to solve the 
problems,

396
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,870
you have to name them.
You know,

397
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:36,704
I,
I'm not one of these guys it like I 

398
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:40,280
believe in creative destruction.
It's very easy to destroy things,

399
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,230
very hard to build them,
you know,

400
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:45,260
it's incremental effort over time that 
builds things.

401
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,370
So no,
I mean,

402
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:49,040
look,
I understand the complaint 100 percent,

403
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,890
but I also think it's a two way deal 
here.

404
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,050
So if I say,
hey dave,

405
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,940
you know,
like,

406
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,860
did you pay for this house?

407
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,323
And you're like,
that's the one thing I don't want to 

408
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:02,240
talk about because actually you didn't,
you're just squatting here.

409
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,340
Whose fault is that?
I mean,

410
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,090
I guess,
you know,

411
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm disruptive for asking you the 
question,

412
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,900
but you also should pay for the house.
You delay.

413
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,070
Do you know what I mean?
So like he's calling bs on them.

414
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:13,904
I get why they don't like it.
But it also is a call to action to them 

415
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,583
to like answer the question and rule in 
a way that is sensible and wise and 

416
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,190
sustainable and they're not.
So the byline on the book.

417
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,360
How is selfish ruling classes bringing 
America to the brink of revolution?

418
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,300
Yes.
Do you think we're that close?

419
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,450
I think we're in the middle of it.
We just elected Donald Trump.

420
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:36,470
President.
What?

421
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,570
I mean.
This is like,

422
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,760
this is what got me to write the book,
like Donald Trump,

423
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:44,180
who I've known for 20 years and always 
sort of liked because we're like,

424
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:46,220
why wouldn't you?
I think it's just funny as hell.

425
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,870
Did you,
did you ever think he was racist or any,

426
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
any of those?
Like put aside the center part.

427
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,970
I mean,
look,

428
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,670
I think on some level everybody is 
bigoted.

429
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,400
I mean that's the human heart is dark 
and a light and you know,

430
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:01,370
it's a patchwork.
But like talk about.

431
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:03,200
I mean look,
if he has a policy,

432
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,790
if he were to get up and say,
you know,

433
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:09,791
the problem is that this one racial 
group is screwing everybody else.

434
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,830
And in response,
we need to crush that,

435
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:15,920
we need to attack them in public and 
then make it much harder for them to get

436
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:16,430
jobs.

437
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,710
Government contracts get into school.
That would be racist.

438
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,080
Racist.
Oh wait.

439
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,020
That's what our ruling class has been 
doing for 35 years.

440
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,050
So,
right.

441
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,980
You want really wanna have a 
conversation about racism.

442
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:31,640
Racism is attacking people on the basis 
of their immutable characteristics,

443
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:33,980
which is like how our government 
operates.

444
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,220
It's totally wrong.
Um,

445
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,753
so yes,
there's a lot of racism is trumping 

446
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,360
offender.
I probably who isn't,

447
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,463
but the actual structural racism that 
hurts people and rewards others on the 

448
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:47,114
basis of their skin color or something I
thought we got rid of 50 years ago that 

449
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:50,764
is not being perpetuated by trump.
It's being perpetuated and defended and 

450
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:54,274
celebrated by his critics.
Don't lecture me or anyone else about 

451
00:20:56,771 --> 00:21:00,100
racism if you're pushing that crap.
Isn't that the irony?

452
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,953
It's half the guests that you have on 
your show are the people who are 

453
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:06,360
actually trying to inject racism into 
the system.

454
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,600
Quotas and the rest of that,
of course,

455
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,180
you know,
why are they doing this?

456
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,130
It's complicated psychological 
phenomenon,

457
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:17,131
but at root it's much easier to maintain
power when you divide your opponents,

458
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,454
when you divide the country into warring
tribes based on characteristics that 

459
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,130
don't change and therefore can't be 
resolved.

460
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,170
You know,
this is how the British ruled India.

461
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,263
This is the problem with Rwanda.
I mean this is like a very well known 

462
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,890
phenomenon,
but anyway.

463
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:32,740
Yes,
it's all projection and displacement.

464
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,890
It's like whatever I'm doing,
I'm accusing you of doing like,

465
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,800
I can't believe you know,
whatever it is,

466
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,560
and it's in it.
It's actually orwellian because it's not

467
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:45,010
a lie.
It's the mirror image of the truth.

468
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,520
Yes.
And your.

469
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,260
This is what you're fighting constantly 
on your show.

470
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,310
It actually gives you a headache,
like I have a bunch of kids and they lie

471
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,144
because everybody lies and you 
especially lied to the people you love 

472
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,700
because you care about their opinion.

473
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,040
Most so kids lie to their parents,
like it's a feature of it,

474
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,593
but a child's lie is very recognizable 
because it's always three shades off 

475
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,470
from the literal truth.
So it's like you a tenorio's no,

476
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:11,140
I just had three,
but no one's contesting that you ate the

477
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,974
Oreos.
Right.

478
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,300
What they're doing is what all 
authoritarian regimes do in Norwell.

479
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,990
Being the great genius and English ever 
got right to the heart of it.

480
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:21,310
He's like,
you know,

481
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,240
if I were dealing with a,
a powerful leftist,

482
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,650
I would say you wait three hours and be 
like,

483
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:27,490
no,
actually you did.

484
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,860
You get the Oreos and I'm going to 
punish.

485
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,431
It's like,
what?

486
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,870
No,
that's the.

487
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,433
It's actually much more effective and 
manipulative not to grade the truth and 

488
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:40,894
distort the truth,
but to tell the opposite of the truth 

489
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:45,150
because it throws the other person 
completely off.

490
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,530
That's been why they hate all of the 
supposed minorities who,

491
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,430
who walk away leave.
That's.

492
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,280
There's nothing they hate more than a 
gay person.

493
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,200
That leaves a black person.
Really.

494
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,210
An Asian person that leaves.
Yeah.

495
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,900
I can't imagine I have just because of 
my job.

496
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:02,734
I mean I know a lot of people who 
dissent from the Orthodoxy within their 

497
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:08,150
group.
Do you know?

498
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:10,210
Because I try to have them on because I 
think they're brave.

499
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,373
Do you know what I mean?
Like I'm not involved in any of these 

500
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:13,840
debates.
I'm so,

501
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,703
but,
but like if you're a gay guy who was 

502
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:16,091
like,
you know what,

503
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:18,670
I'm not really on board with this.
What happens to you?

504
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,730
It's and I have deep sympathy for my 
twitter lately,

505
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,860
but no I haven't.
I would never go there because it upsets

506
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,694
me.
I think in the end the individual has a 

507
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:28,900
right to make up his mind.
You can control what I do.

508
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:30,970
Okay.
Societies get to do that.

509
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,310
They get to control the behavior of the 
people who live with them.

510
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,450
You're not allowed to sleep in a 
crosswalk.

511
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,170
Sorry,
we don't allow it.

512
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,003
Fine.
What you can't do is control what I 

513
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,134
think that's not allowed.
That crosses the line from order to 

514
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,560
totalitarianism and all of a sudden for 
the first time in my life,

515
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,360
that's what they are.
Not simply attempting,

516
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:48,190
but demanding.

517
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:48,690
Yeah.
So.

518
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,523
All right,
so then that's a perfect segue to the 

519
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,843
technological part of this,
because I think the last time I was on 

520
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:56,140
your show,
this is what we discussed.

521
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:56,974
Just going on with Google.
What's going on with the algorithms are 

522
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,450
people be in shadow,
banned,

523
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,340
etc.
Etc.

524
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,180
I think thEre's plenty of evidence that 
yes,

525
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:08,320
this is all real.
What is your solution to this?

526
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,154
I know,
I suspect you don't want the government 

527
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,820
coming in and fixing them.

528
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,900
Or Is this a unique case now?
Well,

529
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,780
it's,
I think it's a,

530
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,703
it's an I,
I hate to use the term existential 

531
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:21,510
threat because it's been all and 
overused,

532
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:22,344
but actually it is an existential threat
to the ability of the us government to 

533
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,410
run the country to administer the 
democracy.

534
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,210
Um,
yeah.

535
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,260
Look,
google.

536
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,340
There are 20,000
engineers,

537
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,670
engineers making between two and 
$400,000

538
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,600
working right now just on google search.
Just on that one feature of google,

539
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,553
20,000.
This is the most technologically 

540
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:48,750
advanced and powerful organization in 
the history of the world.

541
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,200
It's technology and capabilities so far 
outstrip those to the pentagon,

542
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,034
for example,
where the chinese military or the 

543
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,580
russian,
the russians or any other group.

544
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,623
This is the most powerful technological 
entity in the world which has a 

545
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:02,310
chokehold on all human information in 
english.

546
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,730
So that is all sort of all you need to 
know.

547
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,920
I don't care if jesus is in charge of 
the country.

548
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:12,000
That's too much power for any entity to 
have and it's a,

549
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,290
it's a threat to the nation state 
actually.

550
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,590
And it's a threat to all of us.
So yeah,

551
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:21,000
I think whatever it takes is what we 
need to do.

552
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:24,450
Like now,
is that a tough pill for a conservative?

553
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,190
They don't know.
are you kidding?

554
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,820
Well,
first of all,

555
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,650
I would say not to go to motive.
I hate it when people do that,

556
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:32,130
but in fact a lot of just flat out 
bought off by google.

557
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,810
Google literally funds the antitrust 
think tank in Washington.

558
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:40,090
I'm not speaking for ian.
No,

559
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,800
but look,
no,

560
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,320
but,
but it's so a symmetrical like all these

561
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:46,920
debates are because with liberals who 
are only about power,

562
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,450
you just make the pitch like,
look,

563
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:52,020
we'll fund you were on your side,
you know,

564
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,820
that we're part of the coalition of the 
ascendant.

565
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,240
So just like no problem with 
conservatives,

566
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,450
all they who are sort of like dog,
like in the eu market.

567
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,620
You knoW what I mean?
It's like,

568
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:06,120
what are you against markets you want 
government control you for regulation.

569
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,490
I ran and ran and ran.
that conserves and like,

570
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,480
oh my gosh.
Kryptonite.

571
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:10,500
I'm sorry.
You're right.

572
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:11,730
You're totally right,
mr google.

573
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,660
It's actually and so I feel like I'm the
only person who like,

574
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:16,560
yeah,
of course I'm concerned.

575
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:19,260
Of course I'm not for regulation.
Of course I believe in markets,

576
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,360
but this isn't a free mark.
This is your friend.

577
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,223
This is your version of capitalism.
This is what you've been promising all 

578
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:26,430
these years when like two guys who run a
company,

579
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:27,264
it's not even american whose values are 
not aligned with the interest of my 

580
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,330
country is in charge of the country.
No,

581
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,020
I'm not for that.

582
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,853
Sorry I got to say this man.
I did not think that I was going to 

583
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:36,104
bring you in here and that I'd have 
tucker carlson agreeing with my friend 

584
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:41,780
eric weinstein about this,
but that you're basically laying out the

585
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:42,710
same case.
He's lit

586
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,240
big

587
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,040
and and sometimes I think,
well maybe I'm going crazy.

588
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:47,874
Maybe I'm thinking about this too much 
and I'm becoming like the wacko who's 

589
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,020
like,
you don't understand us actually.

590
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,610
The deeper.
Yeah.

591
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,453
And I know people who work there and 
I've actually spent a lot of time on it 

592
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:59,370
because I'm.
Because I know,

593
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,840
I don't think I'm overstating it.
And by the way,

594
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:02,910
I'm not temperamentally an extremist.
I'm always.

595
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,940
I'm from southern California,
you know,

596
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm a kind of semi observant 
episcopalian.

597
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,690
I'm not like now where,
you know,

598
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,550
the end is no,
I am.

599
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,100
That's not the way I am.
But on this topic,

600
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:17,790
I think I'm becoming that because I 
think the facts warranted.

601
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,223
What do you make of the whole shift of,
of what's happening with news and 

602
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,580
technology at the moment that,
that.

603
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,220
It's funny,
I said this to you in the green room,

604
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:28,500
but when I was doing a show,
the peterson last week,

605
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:28,980
I said,
oh,

606
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,720
you know,
tucker carlson's on my show next week.

607
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,700
The audience went wild,
like,

608
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,960
we're crazy.
And I was like,

609
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:34,794
oh,
that's interesting because I hear from 

610
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,100
so many of these young people that they 
don't get their new uh,

611
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,180
from cable news anymore.
I think you and gutfeld are a little bit

612
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:45,810
of a,
like a bridge sort of between mainstream

613
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,220
and,
and the internet thing,

614
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,350
um,
but that,

615
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,233
that cnn has sort of become a joke that,
that just saying these things about 

616
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,333
cable news,
I know that's already the punchline and 

617
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:59,220
I spent many years at cnn and hosting a 
show there and had a lot of,

618
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,540
have a look,
have friends there.

619
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,100
I mean the landscape changes technology,
you know,

620
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,740
destroys and creates,
you know,

621
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,500
it's a very familiar cycle.
I think cable news has remained relevant

622
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,630
much longer than a lot of us who work in
a thought it would.

623
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,010
But that of course will change because 
technically,

624
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,500
once again,
technology changes everything.

625
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,700
What's ominous is the next thing.
I'm completely for digital media.

626
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:18,923
I owned part of a digital media company,
but we've sort of wound up exactly in 

627
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,690
not in the opposite place we expected to
wind up.

628
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:30,750
I mean the promise was that this was 
going to diversify,

629
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,953
you know,
the media and decentralized power over 

630
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,070
information.
And of course the opposite,

631
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,360
you know,
the little controls everything.

632
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,910
So without youtube,
I mean where are you with that youtube?

633
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:46,740
So we're actually fInding ourselves more
dependent upon a smaller group of people

634
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,410
who hate free speech and hate our 
values.

635
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,693
That's a very precarious place to be.
Somebody needs to introduce competition 

636
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,340
into the space.
Like yesterday,

637
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,710
like right now it's the most important 
thing.

638
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:02,350
Otherwise we're going to find ourselves 
like at the mercy of these stars.

639
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,233
Like is that where you want to be?
It's the opposite of where you want to 

640
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:05,040
be.

641
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,873
If only there were some influential 
billionaires to be listening to this 

642
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,400
show.
We're not going to name names,

643
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,443
but whenever two or more people who 
thought thIs through for 10 minutes get 

644
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:18,684
together,
they mentioned one name and they're 

645
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:21,120
like,
why is he coming to save us?

646
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,070
Well now you said it's a heat,
but let's not get lost in gender.

647
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,913
So with that being said about the 
technological component watching cable 

648
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:28,884
news shift right now,
there's also an issue that a lot of 

649
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,304
people are getting their news from this,
from this show shows like this shapiro 

650
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,250
rower,
all of these guys.

651
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,070
That's kind of worrying to at some 
level,

652
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,913
right?
And I say that I'm talking about guys 

653
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:43,780
that I love,
but like,

654
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,130
just that,
you know,

655
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,550
the fact checking is different here than
say it would be on cable news.

656
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:50,760
Not that cable news has done a great 
job.

657
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,810
No,
but you're right.

658
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:53,460
I mean we're part,
you know,

659
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,160
we're,
we're always,

660
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,060
uh,
a point on a continuum and we're,

661
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:01,950
we're in the middle of a cycle where the
media are being reinvented completely.

662
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,840
And you're right.
I mean,

663
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:04,674
the problem with individual operators,
solo guys on youtube is they have so 

664
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,370
much less to lose than a television 
network.

665
00:30:11,371 --> 00:30:12,204
Does that,
the incentives to get the facts right 

666
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:15,420
and be responsible of course,
much lower.

667
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,660
Um,
the problem as you well know better than

668
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,220
anybody is that the media has so 
discredited themselves that it's like,

669
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,713
it's so obviously propaganda.
But did you ever think it could be that 

670
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,981
bad?
No,

671
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:29,814
I never did.

672
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,323
Every day I look at a story from cnn or 
political and forget buzzfeed and all 

673
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,780
those other ones.
I forget the really bad ones,

674
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,183
vox.
and it's like everything you guys are 

675
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:41,674
doing,
every headline and the way every 

676
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,920
republican has a picture that they look 
awful in the picture.

677
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,940
Democrats look great and like every 
little thing,

678
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,190
it's like there

679
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,100
smashing us with it.
They just turned it up to 11.

680
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,750
And I've,
I mean,

681
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:55,584
I grew up in a media family.
I mean my dad was anchor here in la of 

682
00:30:58,381 --> 00:30:59,214
abc and so I,
I have always lived in this world and I 

683
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:04,050
always thought the media are liberal,
but I was totally wrong about that.

684
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:06,240
They're not ideologues actually their 
party people.

685
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,920
That's what I totally missed.
Yeah.

686
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,083
They are loyal to the party.
They feel powerless except as part of a 

687
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:15,480
group that is the main distinction 
between left and right in this country.

688
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,870
And so whatever the democratic party's 
imperatives are,

689
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,823
they will act on them.
If the demOcratic party invaded Canada 

690
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,050
tomorrow and they wouldn't see,
I'm serious,

691
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:25,681
they'd be like,
you know,

692
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:28,400
these canadians,
they live among us there.

693
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,880
You know what I mean?
They're a fifth column.

694
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:32,480
Like they would actually do.
It doesn't matter what the part is,

695
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
they will defend it.
Once you understand that,

696
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,800
then it all makes sense.
They feel threatened.

697
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,160
That's the truth in you and people like 
you are the main threat to them.

698
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:44,220
It's not me actually.
I'm on a competing medium,

699
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:45,054
but in the same medium they are.
They know that their power is epic and 

700
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:52,650
when you feel like you're losing 
control,

701
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:53,484
that's when you tried to assert control.
That's when the most ludicrous 

702
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:57,870
propaganda comes when you feel like,
you know,

703
00:31:57,871 --> 00:31:59,310
oh my gosh,
they're not listening to me.

704
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,420
Right.
But that's the funny part.

705
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,580
Part is I always,
and I tweet this all the time,

706
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:06,670
it's like if these guys had just been 
like pretty bad.

707
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,950
Yeah,
I think it would have been tolerable.

708
00:32:08,951 --> 00:32:11,650
People would have because it had been 
happening for so long.

709
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,603
People kind of wooded and have noticed 
that maybe they could have got a little 

710
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,150
worse than we would have been okay with 
it,

711
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,740
but it's like they've just completely 
bottomed out and.

712
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,613
Well,
this is one of the criticisms of trump 

713
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,740
that has a lot of truth in it.
When people are like,

714
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:25,670
well,
he's a destroyer.

715
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:28,280
He destroys everything he touches.
You know,

716
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,190
probably an overstatement,
but he does,

717
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:32,024
you know,
you get close to you sit and stare at 

718
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,500
trump all day and you're going to burn 
out your news.

719
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,653
Okay.
You are.

720
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,460
And that's one of those I try to do.
I don't do a show about trump.

721
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,860
I didn't write a book about trump.
I'm not against trump.

722
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,290
I think trump is useful in a truth 
teller in some ways,

723
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,124
but,
but the people who obsess about trump 

724
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,990
are destroyed and that would include his
opponents,

725
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,220
maybe especially his opponent.

726
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,250
So what would you do to get some of 
those people back if they're,

727
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,084
if they are out there now,
the ones that really are overboard on 

728
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,210
trump that I haven't,
you know,

729
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,180
I've been able to reach them,
some liberalism,

730
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,320
good lefties and liberals so that,
okay,

731
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:04,154
we can put a hand out for them.
But for the people that are really 

732
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:09,880
feeling like they're buying all the 
nonsense and the skies,

733
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,060
hitler and all of this really,
do you have any technique that

734
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,090
I almost never argue about trump.
I really try not to.

735
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:18,924
I mean,
the platonic ideal for me of a show is 

736
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:23,130
never mentioning trump because I try to 
take the long view.

737
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:24,720
I mean look,
other shows had different roles,

738
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:25,554
you know,
everybody sees like his or her specific 

739
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:28,134
tasks,
but I feel like mine is to try to take 

740
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:30,864
the long view,
not easy in the middle of this new 

741
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,563
cycle.
Of course I get caught up all the time 

742
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,480
and the,
you know,

743
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,730
the bullshit of the day,
but,

744
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,020
but,
but I really try to think about like,

745
00:33:40,021 --> 00:33:41,820
well how would this look 10 years from 
now?

746
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,230
Like,
trump Will be gone.

747
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,093
I'll be gone.
We'll all be gone because we actually 

748
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:46,920
die at the end.
It turns out so.

749
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,470
But I want the country to 10 years for 
10 years.

750
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,550
But I'm just saying,
what kind of country do you want?

751
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,030
That's the question.
Do you want to live in a place where the

752
00:33:57,031 --> 00:34:00,360
individual has the right to dissent?
And I think most people would say yes,

753
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:01,080
I do.
Yeah.

754
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,870
Is that why the free speech stuff has 
become so important to you?

755
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,930
Because I think that it's foundational.
I mean,

756
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:09,720
that's just if they can tell you what to
say,

757
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,050
they can control what you think and if 
they can control you,

758
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,690
think you're not fully human and so 
you're really.

759
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:16,524
You're not fIghting for a political 
party or an ideology or fighting for 

760
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,124
your humanity.
I believe that that's what I was taught 

761
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:25,440
as a child by liberals and they were 
right and I bought it then by the way,

762
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,810
and so the acl used to the for 
clearance.

763
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:28,644
Brandon berg,
who Is not only at literally a clansman 

764
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,910
from Ohio,
but a moron like a literally a moron.

765
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,773
He was the least appealing person ever 
and they stick their entire credibility 

766
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,780
and defending this guy,
why they do that.

767
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,040
They did it,
of course,

768
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:44,874
to preserve the absolute right of free 
speech for the rest of us and they made 

769
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,200
the country better.
When you abandon that,

770
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,190
yeah,
dude,

771
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:50,750
it's over

772
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,480
and now you see what comes out of the 
aco and you're like,

773
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,550
you're not.
You're not defending free speech.

774
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,870
You're clearly a progressive group.

775
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,300
They're opposing statements saying,
no,

776
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:06,190
some speeches is to offensive.
Really because you defended the right of

777
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,024
nazis to march through skokie,
which everyone forgets had the highest 

778
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:14,250
percentage of holocaust survivors of any
town like outside Israel.

779
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,113
Yeah,
I mean it was the most offensive thing 

780
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:19,450
you could do and they defended it and 
they lost a lot of money doing it.

781
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,190
Like they lost a ton of donations doing 
it,

782
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:24,570
but they defended the principal and I 
noticed you've got nadian strauss's book

783
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,833
we talked about here.
So there are people like her are 

784
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:32,770
dershowitz are these former clu board 
members who were like totally bewildered

785
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,700
by this,
not because we care about the acl.

786
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,543
You as an institution who cares and some
dumb nonprofit because the principles 

787
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,040
are literally foundational.
Yeah.

788
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,080
All right,
so let's,

789
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,380
let's jump back for just a second here.
So I want to talk about fox generally.

790
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:47,420
Yeah.
So first off,

791
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,710
you guys are doing something right and I
don't mean just you hear clearly,

792
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:52,544
if you look at the ratings,
I just looked at this thing and it's 

793
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:56,690
like the last,
bottom 20 shows are all cnn.

794
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,823
The top 10 are basically all fox.
Maybe there's one msnbc show in there 

795
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,190
beyond just you.
What,

796
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,220
what do you think that fox is?
Just do it all right.

797
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,060
You know,
being slightly different.

798
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,440
I mean,
I,

799
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,370
you know,
I would argue that the,

800
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,280
I mean I can only speak for my shot.
I'm only in charge of an hour of the,

801
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,223
of 24,
but you know that it's actually worth 

802
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:16,944
defending the principles as distinct 
from the individuals or the political 

803
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,850
figures in overtime.
Like you're not embarrassed to do that.

804
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:24,684
It's worth doing,
but I think as a business matter and 

805
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:32,190
just sort of a matter of life if you're 
the guy who's not entirely with the herd

806
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,570
and you're like,
actually no,

807
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,580
it's a little bit different,
you know,

808
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,443
you go to the 19 other stores when you 
can buy this one product and I've got a 

809
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,400
different product.
I mean why is that bad?

810
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,930
Yeah.
So that just seems obvious.

811
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:45,600
That's just human nature is how 
offensive that is.

812
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,150
It's like fog and I've worked,
I've worked at cnn,

813
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,040
I've worked at msnbc,
I worked at pbs,

814
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,993
I worked at esquire.
I'm and I've worked at like a million 

815
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:52,764
different liberal publications and 
television channels and they're all 

816
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:57,354
selling exactly the same product and 
then there's fox in the mainstream 

817
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:04,971
landscape that's different.
Just one channel is different and the,

818
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,400
the feeling overwhelming feeling is that
should not be allowed.

819
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,490
Like I can't believe that they're 
allowed to say what they're saying.

820
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,380
We need to shut them down.
Well that's

821
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,343
the irony.
It's like you guys are the only ones 

822
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:19,420
that will put me on.
I will gladly go on cnn or msnbc,

823
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:21,280
get on those channels.
I've never been asked.

824
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,260
I can't just show up there and bang on 
the door,

825
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:26,140
but you guys call me and nobody.
Every time I've done your show,

826
00:37:26,141 --> 00:37:28,060
it's alive.
I never know what you're going to ask.

827
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,443
And,
and same thing with some of the other 

828
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:34,090
shows and it's like I will go where I 
can talk to people.

829
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,730
I don't want to be edited and 
misrepresented,

830
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:38,200
which.
So I don't know that I would trust a lot

831
00:37:38,201 --> 00:37:39,080
of these other.
No.

832
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,863
Okay.
So that sort of.

833
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,830
But it's just so uninteresting.
I mean,

834
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:43,664
if everybody's saying,
repeating the exact same pieties 

835
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,830
diversity is our strength,
our children,

836
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,683
our future,
whatever this sort of banality is that 

837
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:51,974
you think is profound.
If everybody is saying the exact same 

838
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:54,980
thing,
like this is boring.

839
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,383
I like to have.
I like to have people on who surprised 

840
00:37:58,311 --> 00:37:59,144
me.
Like what?

841
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,330
Do you know what I mean like that.
Just because again,

842
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,360
I'm more curious.
I mean I'm a human being.

843
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:05,710
I,
I,

844
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,980
I want to think about things.

845
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,820
Does it ever drive you crazy to just be 
in the,

846
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:11,070
in the constraints of what television 
is?

847
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,380
Because we've done segments where it's 
like,

848
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:14,214
you know,
we've got maybe six minutes and I feel 

849
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,650
like I just started and then yoU're 
like,

850
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,640
robin,
I'll See you next time.

851
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,080
You know?

852
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,940
Yeah.
I mean I was a writer before I went into

853
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:20,774
tv and one of the reasons that I failed 
a couple of times pretty spectacularly 

854
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:27,440
and tv is because I didn't understand 
the medium and I didn't respect it.

855
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,940
I was like,
I'm a writer,

856
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,240
I'm a deep person.
Here I am in the shallow medium.

857
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,160
And what I didn't understand is it tv 
is,

858
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:34,994
it's completely,
it's a different thing and it's got its 

859
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,420
own requirements and its own rules and 
you need to understand what it's capable

860
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:46,270
of and is capable of great things.
It's just not capable of everything.

861
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,620
You know what I mean?
It's not capable of explaining concepts,

862
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,920
complex concepts,
just that's not what tv is about.

863
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,320
Someone was for.
Is it odd to you that the interview,

864
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:57,030
the real long form this like just sit 
down with another human being that,

865
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,750
you know,
cnn booted Larry King,

866
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,640
which I think was the beginning of the 
end for them.

867
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,710
So smart.
I think that I really believe it.

868
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:04,300
I mean I've never heard anybody else say
that,

869
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,470
but I argued that when I worked there.
yeah.

870
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,840
So,
so you were.

871
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,713
Because they were getting rid of him.
I think he told me he was here a couple 

872
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,291
of weeks ago.
He said,

873
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,190
I thought it was the number one rated 
show is still on the network.

874
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:14,980
it was number two at the time.
And they said,

875
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:15,370
no,
no,

876
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,210
we're done 30 years.
Adios.

877
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,180
Right.
And they also ended crossfire,

878
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,000
which had become a kind of perversion of
its former self,

879
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:22,834
but I was in both versions of it and at 
one point crossfire was like a public 

880
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:26,570
service,
you know,

881
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,423
to sort of equally matched,
did something shift with crossfire 

882
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,290
because I do remember watching you on 
crossfire and watching those guys.

883
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,710
And it was so it became partisan,
which is Uninteresting.

884
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,480
Nobody wants to hear what your team 
thinks.

885
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,480
We already know what's interesting is 
when we throw up an idea or a policy and

886
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,090
we deconstructed and we have two fairly 
evenly matched people,

887
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,240
you know,
kind of competing for,

888
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,790
you know.
So anyway,

889
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,970
it became something much more.
But the idea was aLways a good idea.

890
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,133
And especially the idea of Larry King,
I pitched that show too many different 

891
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:02,080
channels,
black curtain to people,

892
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,153
our lonG conversation.
And my argument was this will rate 

893
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,110
people want this,
there's none of it.

894
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,500
And everyone's like good Things.
So we need to interstitials in graphics.

895
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:14,440
And it's like they love interstitial.
It's unbelievable.

896
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:16,780
And now,
of course with youtube,

897
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,643
it's like you look at the numbers that 
you're getting and others are getting 

898
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:25,540
with that exact format and they're huge.
It turns out,

899
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,220
yeah,
of course there's a market for that.

900
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,110
Why wouldn't there be,
how much of all of this?

901
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,943
Everything we're discussing here and so 
much of what you're doing on your show 

902
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:36,280
is just that people are just tired of 
having their intellect insulted.

903
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,140
Totally,
completely.

904
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:42,070
We'll look at television versus movies.
If you had told me 30 years ago that the

905
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,700
most interesting,
you know,

906
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,960
visual art being created would be in 
television,

907
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,330
scripted television.
Like what?

908
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,990
I don't think so that's the province of 
moron,

909
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,900
like full house.
But um,

910
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,500
but it turned out to be true because to 
stand up for bob saget,

911
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,560
bob saget,
bob saget,

912
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,570
but she's actually very smart.
But the point is that there is,

913
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:09,010
especially when we're all narrow 
casting,

914
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,560
when you don't need to reach,
you know,

915
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,513
$80,
million people when you can reach 3 

916
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,513
million.
And that is a more than viable 

917
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,913
commercial proposition.
You can aim at an audience that wants 

918
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,930
that.
And there is a substantial audience that

919
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:23,460
does.

920
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,101
Yeah.
Okay.

921
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,330
So fox news,
we get it.

922
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,080
Some things are clearly going right and 
by ratings and everything else.

923
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,600
Is there anything that fox is doing that
you think is wrong?

924
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:35,420
Is he too close to the or or anything?
You know,

925
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:36,050
I,
I mean,

926
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,090
I mean I'm obviously I'm dodging the 
question.

927
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:40,640
Even if I had a real answer,
I would run from that question because I

928
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:42,160
worked there.
I have to ask you a hundred.

929
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,570
Right?
But if I'm being completely honest,

930
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,070
no,
I'm not a huge.

931
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,933
I'm so caught up in our hour and I'm so 
it's such a hive in my show and we have 

932
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,180
like,
you know,

933
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,013
I intentionally hired really smart,
smarter than I am people that I don't 

934
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,900
have a sense sometimes of the larger 
programming.

935
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:07,310
I would say as a general matter,
I've always tried not to be aligned with

936
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,610
any politician because in the end,
no matter how sympathetic it might be to

937
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,090
the message,
it's a politician and I'm not.

938
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,420
If I wanted to be a policy maker I would
be one because it's a pretty low bar for

939
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,070
that.
It turns on certain sound.

940
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,291
Right?
Exactly.

941
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:25,010
So do you ever think about it?
Not for two seconds.

942
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,380
I would never want.
I mean,

943
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,070
I live in that world so I know what it 
is.

944
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:31,520
I don't want that.
I have a journalist temperament.

945
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,354
I like to watch.
I like the freedom to say what I really 

946
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:34,874
think is true.
I don't want one thing I will say about 

947
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:38,870
fox,
which I am grateful for every single day

948
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,720
and this is rupert murdoch.
They don't,

949
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,260
they do not control what you say.
I've had this show for two years,

950
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,094
almost exactly two years.
Not a single time of someone called you 

951
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:51,440
or no one calls me at all,
but like no one calls in is like,

952
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,450
I can't believe you said there's nothing
like that.

953
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,470
Pure editorial freedom.
So like why is that not a great job?

954
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,070
Yeah.
No,

955
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,330
I mean I know it.
Again,

956
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:00,164
I just want to illustrate because people
don't understand that every time I've 

957
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,720
Gone on your show that we,
you know,

958
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,880
they give you some sense of what we're 
going to talk about and that's it.

959
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:08,714
We go live,
it's live and if you want to say 

960
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:12,130
something insane like we can't stop you.
Yeah,

961
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,430
you know,
and,

962
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,680
and I would say the other thing is the 
way tv works,

963
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,290
at least at our network,
but I think this is true.

964
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,000
When I worked at the others,
it was also true.

965
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,090
The shows have enormous autonomy.
They really do.

966
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:23,924
I mean there's not a morning call where 
it's like here's our line on this or 

967
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:28,190
that or the other.
It's like I never talked to any.

968
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,380
I talked to my executive producer,
Justin wells,

969
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:31,214
whom I love and a lot of my other 
producers all morning and just in the 

970
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:34,190
car parked outside.

971
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,810
I was just doing a show like here's what
I think we should do.

972
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,020
There's,
I mean we can do whatever we want.

973
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,640
Yeah.
What,

974
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,530
what's your day to day like over there?
So I know what it's like to do.

975
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,590
I do a couple shows a week and I'm doing
long form and this way,

976
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:46,424
but we're not doing a zillion segments 
and all and all the interstitials and 

977
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:51,080
all that stuff.
What's your sort of day to day?

978
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,030
Tucker wakes up,
he's got to show that night.

979
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,130
Yeah,
I mean I try and I'm married.

980
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:57,500
I've been married for 27 years.
I really liked my wife.

981
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,710
My kids are all Gone,
so I really try and stay home.

982
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,820
I mean,
the key in daily tv is not to go insane.

983
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,460
That actually is like the whole deal 
right there.

984
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:12,440
If you can keep from becoming an 
insecure sort of bag of neuroses,

985
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,663
um,
do you mean that just because of the 

986
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:19,781
media criticism and just constant 
worrying about ratings and all of that,

987
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:20,744
but just the medium itself leaves most 
anchors at some point feeling totally 

988
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:26,960
exposed and alone it's like I'm out 
here,

989
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:27,794
you know,
I've got a staff of 80 people or 

990
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:30,880
whatever,
but in the end I'm out here to.

991
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,033
IT's just me.
I'm taking all the crap and no one's 

992
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:35,730
backing me up.
I mean,

993
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,520
every person in the business feels that 
way at a certain point.

994
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,130
And then you start to feel like,
you know,

995
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,710
no one understands.
You know what I mean?

996
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,544
And you actually become so self pitying 
and self-involved that no matter how 

997
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,014
much they pay you,
your deeply unhappy and then you start 

998
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:55,920
acting erratic ways and like look at tv 
and you know exactly who's going through

999
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:56,754
this,
right?

1000
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,863
Everybody except me,
because I keep my world's so small when 

1001
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,703
I married my high school girlfriend,
I live walking distance from my dad and 

1002
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,744
my brother and my college roommate and 
best friend and that's who I talked to 

1003
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:10,850
everyday,
everyday.

1004
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,523
And uh,
and the reason I do that is because I 

1005
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:14,754
love them,
but also because I don't want to feel 

1006
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:20,730
the way that most people on tv do I 
want,

1007
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,500
I want to talk to people I love and 
trust and,

1008
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,390
and I want my security and happiness to 
come from those relationships.

1009
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,223
And not from the affirmation I get on 
television because you will become a 

1010
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:32,520
crazy person.
Someone once said to me,

1011
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,160
the head of a tv network when said,
what do you think my job is?

1012
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,630
I said,
I don't know,

1013
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,370
running a tv network.
And he goes,

1014
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:39,204
no,
it's keeping millionaires from killing 

1015
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,180
themselves.
My job.

1016
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,830
And yet,
how dark is that?

1017
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,070
It's also true.
It's like his job was to keep the people

1018
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:47,904
from going totally bananas because the 
medium itself drives you crazy and 

1019
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:53,760
you're doing this.
No booze,

1020
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,360
no cigarettes anymore.
Right?

1021
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,620
You got any advice?
The booze is easy.

1022
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,100
Drinking coffee,
drink problem,

1023
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,460
you know,
I drink a lot.

1024
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,190
Voltaire,
levels of coffee.

1025
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,380
Not quite as impressive effects,
but yeah,

1026
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,810
like quit smoking four or five years 
ago.

1027
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,030
And,
but I'm,

1028
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,670
I'm,
you know,

1029
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,130
I wouldn't call it advice,
but I'm a,

1030
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,083
I'm an enthusiastic user of nicotine gum
and the lozenges because I think they 

1031
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,410
really have improved my life like a lot.
I think.

1032
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,810
I mean,
I don't want to endorse the product.

1033
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,160
Sure.
What the downside is of using nicotine.

1034
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,293
There's a huge downside from smoking.
Of course the target gives you cancer 

1035
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:33,354
and emphysema.
But,

1036
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,853
uh,
I don't think that we've shown that 

1037
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:38,820
nicotine for people who don't have blood
pressure problems and I don't.

1038
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,293
I'm hurts you.
And I think there's a lot of evidence 

1039
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:44,160
that that's great.
Yeah.

1040
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,053
Alright,
so I want to spend the remaining time 

1041
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:47,340
really focusing on the book.
We sort of did,

1042
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,700
I think we did everything we did 
everything else,

1043
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,410
but let's really focus in on the book.
Okay.

1044
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,460
If,
if we're on the brink of a revolution,

1045
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,430
what are your prescriptions to say?
But I mean,

1046
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,840
I think the first thing you need to do 
is cool the temperature a little bit.

1047
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,040
presidents not good at that.
That's not his by temperamentally.

1048
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:13,010
He's incapable of doing that.
I don't think he sees it as an important

1049
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:13,730
thing to do.

1050
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,100
So is that,
do you think the fundamental sort of,

1051
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,320
if we're looking at this just at a,
at a base level,

1052
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,021
that,
that,

1053
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:21,350
that trump's temperament and the way the
media is with him,

1054
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:23,330
is that sort of the root of everything 
else?

1055
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,330
The volatilities,
the problem.

1056
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,553
I mean I,
I think that we needed to awaken the in 

1057
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:30,274
charge,
not simply of our political system but 

1058
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:35,200
also of our economy and our culture from
their suPer,

1059
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,333
you know,
hey,

1060
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,383
you're not listening.
We're going to let this orange guy to 

1061
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:40,750
wake you up.
I actually think that was a useful thing

1062
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:41,584
and necessary thing,
but repeated cycles of political 

1063
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:46,564
volatility like break your country.
Obviously there's a million examples of 

1064
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,430
this and it's obvious,
so um,

1065
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,803
you need to calm people down in the main
way you calm people down as the way you 

1066
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:56,440
come,
children down,

1067
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,880
which is you explained to them as simply
and Clearly as you can,

1068
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:01,803
why?
What's happening is happening while 

1069
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:07,060
you're making these decisions and you 
give them some sense that they have some

1070
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:08,320
control,
total control,

1071
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,660
but some control over the decisions that
you're making,

1072
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:11,560
you know,
you and franchise.

1073
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,540
Then we bring them in.
In a democracy,

1074
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:14,374
you need,
you need to mean the system is 

1075
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,130
predicated on the idea.
So you need to say to people,

1076
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:18,964
look,
you know,

1077
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,140
you want x,
y,

1078
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:20,974
and z,
you will elected this guy to build a 

1079
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:24,370
wall.
We think a wall is stupid.

1080
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,204
We don't think it's going to work.
We think it's kind of embarrassing 

1081
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:26,741
actually.
It doesn't matter.

1082
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:29,170
We're going to do it because you have 
demanded it.

1083
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,590
You have to kind of give people a sense 
that the democRacy,

1084
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:33,970
Israel,
if they think it's fake,

1085
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,520
they think it's really an oligarchy 
posing as a democracy.

1086
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:38,830
What are they going to do?
You don't want to think about that.

1087
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,090
so just practice democracy a little bit.
Would calm things down a lot.

1088
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,763
Is anyone doing it better than us?
Like for all the sort of anger at each 

1089
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:49,650
other right now.
And it's funny because,

1090
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,493
you know,
I spend time on twitter wheRe it seems 

1091
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:52,084
like the civil war has begun already and
then I get out there in real life and 

1092
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:55,684
I'm on this tour and it's like I need 
thousands of people all across the 

1093
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,254
middle of the country who are wonderful 
and open and decent and all those 

1094
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,460
things.
Um,

1095
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,510
but I lost my question in that.
What was the point of that?

1096
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,040
I mean,
is it actually as bad as it seems and as

1097
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,930
anyone,
any other country more stable,

1098
00:49:12,931 --> 00:49:13,770
unhappier than ours.

1099
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,690
So that was it.
Yeah.

1100
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,593
Is there an example to look at?
Because I see all these people always 

1101
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:19,804
complaining and as you said,
it's easier to break things and burn 

1102
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:24,550
them down than it is to build.
So all these people are always,

1103
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:25,720
oh,
look at these countries.

1104
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,583
Look aT the end.
They always look at the nordic 

1105
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:28,420
countries.
That seems to be a big one.

1106
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:29,970
Look at that.
Sweden and you know,

1107
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,780
even though sweden's got all sorts of 
problems right now,

1108
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,280
you're one of the only people covering 
it.

1109
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:34,420
Actually.
Um,

1110
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,910
I'm one of the only swedes on 
television.

1111
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,360
Maybe that's why you swedish.
My name is carl said.

1112
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,190
Oh,
alright,

1113
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,220
there you go.
I've got a lot of ikea.

1114
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,950
I'm not in any meaningful sense.
Swedish.

1115
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,813
I mean,
I guess I am genetically swedish stuff 

1116
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:49,040
like even care about that stuff.
One,

1117
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,010
1000,
24.

1118
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,450
But those are not models.
We can replicate for obvious reasons.

1119
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,040
It's a country of Sweden.
Sweden's got 8 million people go tell me

1120
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:01,883
something like that.
Anyway,

1121
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,810
uh,
know who does it?

1122
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:05,940
Look,
nobody does it better.

1123
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:08,610
There's no greater country.
I don't have a foreign passport.

1124
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,473
I'm stuck here.
I plan to do everything I can for the 

1125
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:12,564
country because I have a longterm 
interest in it and I don't want to move 

1126
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:16,470
anywhere else.
I can't think of anywhere.

1127
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,480
Better helpline.
Switzerland is pretty nice,

1128
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:20,730
but there's no humor allowed.
So I probably the anyway,

1129
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:22,190
the point is,
um,

1130
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,163
no,
you can look at countries and see their 

1131
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:28,190
ruling classes doing things you,
ours did.

1132
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,610
There's no country.
I kind of despise more than China.

1133
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,833
But one thing I do admire about China is
that its ruling clique a thinks long 

1134
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:43,520
term about stability.
That's their overriding concern.

1135
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:44,354
Now,
of course,

1136
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,520
that's rooted in their desire to hold 
onto power,

1137
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,170
which is ignorable.
I get it.

1138
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,393
But they understand how important 
continuity and stability are to the 

1139
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:55,040
site.
So they think deeply and they don't make

1140
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:55,874
the right decisions all the time.
Obviously the one child policy is a 

1141
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:58,580
disaster,
but they,

1142
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,760
that's how they think.
And I wish we thought that way.

1143
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,803
I think we've to internalized 
libertarian economics as a model for 

1144
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:10,880
everything that like it's always 
virtuous to destroy this thing and build

1145
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:13,520
something new and we don't understand is
like that's not.

1146
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,413
People are not capable of that at scale.
Like 325 million people can't deal with 

1147
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,830
tearing down in remaking the society.
Every generation.

1148
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:23,180
They just can't.
They'll go crazy.

1149
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,673
And so we need to identify the things 
that we want to preserve and actively 

1150
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:30,060
work to preserve them.
And,

1151
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,610
and I would start with the bill of 
rights.

1152
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,430
So

1153
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,263
I think any of the people right here,
these beautiful character caricature is 

1154
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,720
maxine waters and mitch mcconnell and 
nancy pelosi.

1155
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,160
Who else do we have on there?
I'm upside down.

1156
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,470
Hillary clinton.
Bill crystal,

1157
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,500
crystal river bayzos.
Who's this?

1158
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,390
I'm upside down here.
That's lindsey.

1159
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,470
Lindsey graham.
Oh well,

1160
00:51:49,471 --> 00:51:50,304
okay.
So I actually wanted to sort of get 

1161
00:51:50,971 --> 00:51:51,804
lindsey into this somehow.
He's a little punchier there than in 

1162
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:55,170
real life.
Um,

1163
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,063
he's become sort of like a,
like a star said like what do you make 

1164
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:02,700
of sort of these republicans that like 
even mitch mcconnEll,

1165
00:52:02,701 --> 00:52:05,510
like they seem like they've got a little
juice at the moment.

1166
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:07,490
It's like the cabinet thing did 
something.

1167
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,353
Well,
they did the right thing and they're on 

1168
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:10,184
the cover of my book,
not because of that or any real 

1169
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:15,950
political reason.
Particularly lindSey graham is there and

1170
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:18,740
it's described inside.
He's the embodiment.

1171
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:20,390
And I like lindsey graham and I think 
he's smart,

1172
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,870
but he's the embodiment of a phenomenon 
that I think is really destructive,

1173
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:28,871
which is the refusal of people to learn 
from the failures that they created.

1174
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,490
And so like it's okay to have supported 
the invasion of Iraq.

1175
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:37,520
I did.
What's not okay is to seven,

1176
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,110
10,
15 years later,

1177
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:40,940
look at it and be like,
no,

1178
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,650
that wasn't a mistake.
And no,

1179
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:45,380
I refuse to learn from what happened.
And yes,

1180
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:49,010
I think we should do it again like that.
That's something for which you should be

1181
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,600
held responsible.
that's my only point.

1182
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,460
It's like I catch my kid's doing 
something wrong.

1183
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,230
I'm not surprised that they did 
something wrong,

1184
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,573
but I demand that they can see they did 
something wrong and I make them try and 

1185
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,460
learn from it.
Like that's just basic.

1186
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,800
alright,
so let's do a.

1187
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,693
I know there's nothing that people in 
television like doing more than 

1188
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:10,190
predictions.
We got an election coming on,

1189
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,220
like accountability is the problem.
All right.

1190
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,450
So you seem pretty open to this.
So,

1191
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:14,961
uh,
look,

1192
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:16,790
I,
I had Glenn Beck on last week.

1193
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,560
How was he?
He was great.

1194
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,300
He was [inaudible].
This is a guy who,

1195
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:21,840
if you haven't sat down with them and 
how you.

1196
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,401
Oh,
okay,

1197
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:26,550
good.
Like this is a guy who admits freely now

1198
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:27,384
that he was part of the problem,
that he was one of the people that led 

1199
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:34,170
to the polarization and he's trying to 
fix it.

1200
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,480
Yes,
I can,

1201
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:36,121
you know,
people will say,

1202
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:36,790
well,
his motives,

1203
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,750
he Just wants whatever money it.
It's like people's.

1204
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,210
Yeah.
And I don't want to attack people.

1205
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:43,044
Yes.
If you repeatedly show me that your 

1206
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:44,934
motives are bad,
but I see a guy who genuinely 

1207
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,100
ingredients trying to fix some things.
Um,

1208
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,140
so when I discussed this with him about 
the midterms,

1209
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,303
we sort of agreed basically that the 
only option that I see that is remotely 

1210
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:59,610
possible here for the betterment of the 
country going forward,

1211
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,230
the democrats kind of have to be 
destroyed so that they can rebuild.

1212
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:07,350
I don'T otherwise,
if they do well in these midterms,

1213
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,860
we ended up in two years of impeachment.
And then it's like that,

1214
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:13,110
that revolution thing that you think 
we're on the brink of.

1215
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,753
I agree with that.
And the reason is not because trump is 

1216
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,090
inconvenienced or in peachtree or 
whatever the reason is that the problems

1217
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,810
that led to trump's ascent are 
unaddressed.

1218
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,440
I mean,
that's,

1219
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,100
that's,
you know,

1220
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,770
the,
the dying of the middleclass is the core

1221
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:35,890
problem and no one is talking about it.
And trump,

1222
00:54:35,891 --> 00:54:40,330
I have to say sometimes makes it easier 
not to talk about it because he seeks to

1223
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:42,630
be the person people talk about anyway,
you know,

1224
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,810
the problem.
Um,

1225
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,351
yeah.
I mean,

1226
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:47,650
I think the ideas need to be repudiated 
really clearly.

1227
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:52,651
Like you don't win when you say that the
guilty have an obligation to prove their

1228
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:53,680
innocence.
I'm sorry.

1229
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:54,910
We're not rewarding that.

1230
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,410
Yeah.
What was that?

1231
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:57,244
The ultimate like sort of just obvious 
way this all was going to go like 

1232
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:03,230
everything with identity,
politics and everything else and believe

1233
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:05,590
all women or because when you group 
everybody,

1234
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:06,424
you can't have anybody that wanders.
So the cabinet thing really was kind of 

1235
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:12,670
the like,
did it seem obvious to you?

1236
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:14,590
It seemed obvious to me.
That's what it felt like.

1237
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:15,723
The way the reaction

1238
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,770
are really obvious.
And I mean,

1239
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,240
I got caught up,
I mean,

1240
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:21,074
I say it's obvious,
but I also got caught up as I always do 

1241
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:25,160
in my sort of literal like,
but wait a second,

1242
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,023
what about ted kennedy or whatever,
when I should have been far more 

1243
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:28,870
sophisticated,
just said,

1244
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,930
yeah,
what you just said,

1245
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:32,330
which is of course they're doing this 
because they have to do it.

1246
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,810
And this is kind of the logical apogee 
of identity politics anyway,

1247
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,163
that no one is really human.
We're all just sort of component parts 

1248
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:43,994
of a larger whole of the group.
And we have to act as a member of a 

1249
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:50,430
group that can never act alone.
Um,

1250
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,201
you know,
our,

1251
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:53,630
our unique humanity cannot be 
acknowledged.

1252
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,830
I mean,
you must,

1253
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,663
you,
yeah,

1254
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,660
you must deal with this all the time.
Yeah,

1255
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,510
I mean,
I'm like straight white men,

1256
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,041
so like,
you know,

1257
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:02,000
whatever.
I guess I'm acting according to type,

1258
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,010
but if you're not,
you know,

1259
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,900
so anyway,
you know what I'm talking about.

1260
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,260
It's yes.
And I should have known that of course.

1261
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:10,094
But the point is,
I don't think that most people buy that 

1262
00:56:12,861 --> 00:56:13,694
or want to buy.
They don't want to live in that country 

1263
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,070
where you're required by your dna to act
a certain way.

1264
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:21,140
like what?
So what makes you different from a robot

1265
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:21,920
at that point?

1266
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,270
And these are the exact people who are 
now defending Elizabeth Warren,

1267
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,020
of course,
could not be more fraudulent in which.

1268
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,800
Have you had any.
HAve you had a native american tribes?

1269
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,960
Men are,
but yeah,

1270
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:38,270
I mean I have to say I think that story 
for me has been a happy respite from all

1271
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:40,160
this heavy stuff because it's just so 
hilarious.

1272
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,800
Oh yeah.
How did for Joseph Smith is warren is.

1273
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,530
But I do think there's a deep question 
at the bottom of it.

1274
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,120
Not even at the bottom,
at the very top of it,

1275
00:56:47,121 --> 00:56:50,510
which is like,
should your dna determine your life?

1276
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,390
And maybe I'm just too american or too 
California or something,

1277
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:54,800
but no,
I don't think it should.

1278
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,470
I don't think you're responsible for 
what people you never met.

1279
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,750
I think you're responsible for the 
decisions that you make.

1280
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:03,800
I don't think we Should hurt you because
if your eye color or your height or your

1281
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:05,500
race,
I mean like if,

1282
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,463
if you start to accept that it's okay to
inflict group punishment on groups then 

1283
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,764
like I mean,
isn't that the whole lesson of the 20th 

1284
00:57:17,631 --> 00:57:21,020
century that that's wrong and that's a 
culdesac that ends in bloodshed.

1285
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,853
Yes.
So why are we accepting this and 

1286
00:57:24,081 --> 00:57:26,280
everyday on tv,
one of the main pros,

1287
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:27,114
last thing I'll say,
but one of the main problems with our 

1288
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:29,084
coverage is that as brought to us by 
dumb people and I really think finance 

1289
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,380
the whole finance world is partly to 
blame.

1290
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,243
Forty years ago,
like smart evan thomas from newsweek 

1291
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:41,400
lives used to live on my street.
I've been.

1292
00:57:41,401 --> 00:57:43,580
Tom is a very smart guy,
went to harvard,

1293
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:44,840
you know,
he's kind of liberal,

1294
00:57:44,841 --> 00:57:47,810
whatever,
but he's in legitimately smart,

1295
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,853
smarter than I am.
He left harvard and went to work at 

1296
00:57:50,661 --> 00:57:53,810
newsweek because that was kind of an 
acceptable path.

1297
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,190
Now what percentage of harvard seniors 
are going to newsweek now?

1298
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:00,850
They're going into private equity.
So what you're Left with,

1299
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:01,803
it's almost,
it's almost like medieval england where 

1300
00:58:03,181 --> 00:58:03,471
the,
you know,

1301
00:58:03,471 --> 00:58:04,304
under private jennifer,
the first son gets the estate and the 

1302
00:58:06,231 --> 00:58:08,810
second son has to like figure it out or 
become an army officer,

1303
00:58:08,811 --> 00:58:09,644
a vicar or something.
It's like we're getting the dumb people 

1304
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:13,094
were getting the people who can't think 
for themselves or all of a sudden 

1305
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:17,540
winding up as cable news anchors.
It's like,

1306
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,490
what?
Do you know what I mean?

1307
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,753
I do know what you mean.
That's why I'm on youtube with all the 

1308
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,150
smart people have youtube,
you know what I mean?

1309
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,111
Listen.
And you know,

1310
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:28,944
the first video that I did in uh,
in 2018 was that I thought this was 

1311
00:58:31,951 --> 00:58:33,930
going to be the year of unusual 
alliances.

1312
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,840
And I would say I would say this is 
right up there because I,

1313
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:37,674
I consider this a great alliance and I 
think you're doing great work and all 

1314
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:41,004
that stuff.
Not that you need

1315
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,780
any body,
that it's really simple.

1316
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:48,250
If you,
if you feel a moral obligation to scream

1317
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:49,084
at people in restaurants,
if you disagree with their political 

1318
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,510
views,
you're not on my side.

1319
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,450
and if you don't,
you are so it's like,

1320
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:58,450
I don't even know what I mean.
This is such an intense moment.

1321
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,860
It's thrown everything into stark 
relief.

1322
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:04,800
I just care about aligning myself with 
people who believe in the individual and

1323
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,040
freedom of expression.
Period.

1324
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,480
I hear you brother.
And for more on tucker,

1325
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,420
watch your mind,
tucker carlson tonight at 8:00

1326
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,560
PM eastern on fox news.
