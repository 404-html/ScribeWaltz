1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,400
Is it just me or is Internet culture?
The trolling,

2
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:10,310
the outrage and the endless hate 
starting to eat itself?

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,413
This election obviously brought out the 
worst in almost everybody from real 

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:17,030
people to twitter,
eggs and atomy avatars.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,440
People are constantly attacking others 
online and saying things that they would

6
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:24,140
never dare say to someone's face in real
life.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,650
The really scary part of this though 
isn't the words you guys know.

8
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:28,484
I love free speech,
but there seems to be no bottom to this 

9
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:31,724
whole of anger.
Just think about your facebook and 

10
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:36,220
twitter feeds for a moment or they 
enlightening,

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,780
interesting and bringing joy and 
goodness to your life.

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,600
Or are they an endless cascade of rants 
and Raves,

13
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,770
psychotic,
ramblings,

14
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,230
endless fighting and nonstop virtue 
signaling.

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,140
I'm going to go out on a limb here and 
guess that for most of you,

16
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:49,280
the answer is the latter.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,020
Not the former,
and yes,

18
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:54,380
there are also a lot of baby pictures on
facebook which can be quite annoying.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,173
What I think is most interesting about 
our constant state of bickering isn't 

20
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:02,480
the obvious fact that the Internet can 
bring out the worst in all of us,

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,673
but that it seems to me that this 
behavior and the reaction to it is now 

22
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,484
bleeding out into the real world.
I'm slammed with emails every day in 

23
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:11,444
which people explained to me how they're
suffering real world consequences for 

24
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,690
what they post or even what they don't 
post online.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,883
People are getting fired over tweets,
losing friends over facebook posts and 

26
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,260
God only knows what's happening on 
snapchat,

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,513
but perhaps worse than all of this is 
the chilling effect that this state of 

28
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:32,510
outrage has on the rest of us.
This is why I've said it before and I'll

29
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,140
say it again.

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,973
The biggest threat to free speech is 
that we are actively silencing 

31
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,300
ourselves.
Not that the government is silencing us.

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,493
The threat to free speech isn't just 
that protesters are violent at a milo 

33
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:46,754
event.
It's the trickle down effect that that 

34
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,380
has.
Now they're violent events for people.

35
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,860
I conservatives and Libertarians such as
Ben Shapiro and Charles Murray,

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,960
but of course it won't stop there 
either.

37
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:00,800
Eventually they'll come for liberals to 
while at the same time,

38
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,760
plenty of other people who just won't 
want to deal with the threats.

39
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,240
Simply won't accept invitations to speak
in the first place.

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,313
The outrage machine will just dull us 
all down to the point where we won't 

41
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,974
share any original thought because we 
just won't want to deal with the 

42
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:16,004
repercussions.
This is exactly what's happening with 

43
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,554
trump right now.
The mainstream media and the twitter 

44
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:23,630
brigade go bananas every time anything 
happens.

45
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,763
The result is that people won't be able 
to gauge the proper outrage if he does 

46
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,060
do something that truly warranted.
Yes,

47
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,090
he eats his steak with ketchup.
While it is well done.

48
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,720
That sounds horrible to me,
but you've got to deal with it.

49
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,910
Remember the boy who cried wolf?
Well,

50
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,980
now we've got the media who cried?
Trump,

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,590
you think I'm being alarmist here?
Well,

52
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,060
do we see more politically correct or 
less politically correct than five years

53
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,950
ago?
What about 10 years ago?

54
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,640
Do you find yourself censoring yourself 
more or less?

55
00:02:55,641 --> 00:03:00,641
Now than you did even last year,
who is forcing you to censor yourself?

56
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,130
Is it the government?
I don't think so.

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,310
I bet you need only look in the mirror 
and guess what?

58
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,203
This creep of stifling speech for fear 
of being ostracized isn't going to 

59
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:15,010
magically reverse itself.
We have to proactively fight it,

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,110
and we should have started this a long 
time ago.

61
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,590
Take a minute and think about our 
current television programming.

62
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,693
Could all in the family,
arguably the best Sitcom in television 

63
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:28,030
history with a bigoted yet lovable 
archie bunker,

64
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,893
possibly be on network television today.
The beauty of archie was that we all 

65
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,980
know someone like him,
whether that person is white,

66
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,030
Brown,
or blue.

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,133
Only through seeing these people poking 
fun at them and showing the short 

68
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,194
sightedness of bigotry,
can we change our society to be more 

69
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,570
thoughtful and decent for everybody?
Even when I watched Seinfeld with all of

70
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,550
its quirky,
racially based characters,

71
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,900
jokes about gays,
women,

72
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,734
and everyone else.
I think that the authoritarians will 

73
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:59,080
come for the show about nothing,
which was really a show about everything

74
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,914
one day as well.
It won't be the government kicking 

75
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,794
Jerian the crew off the air.
It'll be the next generation of social 

76
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:06,724
justice warriors upset about the episode
where George wanted a black friend or 

77
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,794
where Kramer wouldn't wear the aids 
ribbon or the ones with characters like 

78
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:19,681
ping the Chinese delivery guy or baboo 
the Pakistani restaurant tour beyond the

79
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,650
outrage machine.

80
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,390
There is another nefarious layer here 
which is a whole group of people who get

81
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:29,560
off on the outrage itself.
This is the group of people who react to

82
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,453
anything in everything,
so to get clicks and ultimately money 

83
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:34,534
from our constant state of outrage.
So when Pewdie Pie makes a stupid joke 

84
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:40,360
about Jews as they did a couple of weeks
ago,

85
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,373
the bigger reaction is from those who 
want to capitalize on the moment rather 

86
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,950
than those who are actually outraged by 
the joke itself.

87
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,083
Then the mainstream media gets involved 
with the Wall Street Journal writing 

88
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,354
about the incident which subsequently 
led maker studios to end their contract 

89
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,124
with Pewdie Pie.
This destructive force will take anyone 

90
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,240
down who has moved up to far.
The youtuber is attacking Pewdie Pie.

91
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,074
Wish they had his 55 million subscribers
and the Wall Street Journal's sees how 

92
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,510
his influence,
believe it or not,

93
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,390
is now dwarfing their own as online 
culture.

94
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,570
It gets woven into every facet of our 
lives.

95
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,590
It's vital.
We all pick up and choose our spots when

96
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:24,400
to fight and when to be outraged.
If we're outraged at everything,

97
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,234
then we're outraged at nothing.
If we spend all day online trying to 

98
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,040
find enemies as well,
then guess what?

99
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,023
Enemies will present themselves.
Making some intellectual point over an 

100
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,990
opponent has value,
but we have to be careful that the value

101
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,680
isn't because of the retweets and 
favorites it garners.

102
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm sure I can be better at some of this
myself,

103
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,310
by the way,
especially on twitter.

104
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,533
Trolls are always going to troll,
but those of us who want to change 

105
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:52,660
things for the better have to actually 
be better ourselves.

106
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,583
Final thought.
I was a guest on the Alex Jones live 

107
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,290
show last week at.
Some of you may have seen,

108
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,153
I'm not even fully familiar with Alex 
beyond the little bites I see of him 

109
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,570
screaming and generally going nuts.

110
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,703
That said,
the guy has a huge audience and is 

111
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:09,650
clearly influential as mainstream media 
crumbles and online media rises.

112
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,843
As I've said before,
this comes with both positives and 

113
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,570
negatives,
but regardless,

114
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:17,510
the fact is the guy is talking to a huge
amount of people.

115
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,210
Immediately when I got the request to be
on the show,

116
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,044
I thought that I shouldn't do it because
of the ton of hate that I was about to 

117
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,194
get.
Then I realized that if I didn't do the 

118
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,624
show,
I would only be holding myself hostage 

119
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,904
to the very same ideas which are 
silencing so many other people right 

120
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,610
now,
so I did the show with no preparation or

121
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,970
advanced questioning and Alex let me say
what I wanted to say.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,073
Well,
I got the usual hate from the usual 

123
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:44,450
haters just for appearing on the show.
I also know that I got some of the ideas

124
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:47,510
that I care about to be heard by his 
large audience.

125
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,710
Now maybe some of them will come here 
and learn more about the issues that you

126
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,200
and I care about.
If you're one of those new viewers,

127
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,610
welcome.
I don't yell as much,

128
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:58,820
but I think you'll dig it around here,
but for the record,

129
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,654
I do not believe that a secret group of 
Lizard people are leading a shadow 

130
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,554
government,
which is trying to undermine our 

131
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:06,440
freedoms.
Obviously.

132
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,274
It's actually a group of frog men led by
pepe and they're actually a bunch of 

133
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,960
freedom fighters.
Good luck to us all.

134
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,113
Joining me today is the author of 
several books and the founder and 

135
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:24,030
current president of the David Horowitz 
Freedom Center.

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,930
David Horowitz.
Welcome to the Rubin report.

137
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,483
What are the chances that you ended up 
being the president of a place called 

138
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,510
the David Horowitz Freedom Center?
That is,

139
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,760
that is incredible.
I actually fought that name,

140
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,890
but my board said,
uh,

141
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I had named it the center for the study 
of popular culture as a,

142
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,663
as a leftist.
I thought it's a very hard to attack a 

143
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,230
center for studying anything,
let alone just.

144
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,230
But conservatives see the word culture 
and they think left.

145
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:56,830
So there was just confusing skype.
Amy and I said,

146
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,690
just kind of put your name on it.
So.

147
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,500
So here we are.
Alright.

148
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,383
So I don't know,
in the years that I've been doing this 

149
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:08,271
show that I've read anyone's bio and 
found it more interesting than your bio,

150
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,273
it will,
at least not someone that was born in 

151
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:11,860
the United States.
I thought it was just,

152
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,150
there's so much richness there.

153
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,983
Your evolution politically,
it has a lot to do with some of the 

154
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,164
things that you write about,
about going from the left to the right 

155
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,320
and all that.
Um,

156
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:22,240
so I want to start with your history 
first.

157
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,470
Your parents were communists hard.
Gary card carry everybody.

158
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,383
We,
it's like the communist that kids that 

159
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,550
think it's cool today doing an old 
school.

160
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,980
These are people who are part of a vast 
international conspiracy orchestrated by

161
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,010
Moscow.
Um,

162
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,950
my parents,
my,

163
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,093
my,
I don't think my mother ever got a 

164
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,010
traffic ticket.
They were,

165
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,830
they were very middle class.
Not break the law,

166
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,630
but they did hide and East German 
communist in the basement.

167
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,680
Who,
who the government wanted to deport

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,930
a.
How did he get to your basement?

169
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,880
I have no idea.
I was very young.

170
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,210
Did you know there was someone down 
there?

171
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,044
I mean,
did you notice something was going to 

172
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,920
either,
was his name the last name?

173
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,940
His brother was the mayor of East 
Berlin.

174
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,890
Okay.
Um,

175
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,640
but um,
yeah,

176
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,474
they were very conspiratorial.
They never referred to themselves as 

177
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,990
communists,
only as progressives.

178
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,470
Even then because it wasn't a dirty.
Well,

179
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,820
oh,
it was very dirty.

180
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,420
He was a dirty word.
It was very healthy period.

181
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,220
But because this anya American left very
subversive,

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,420
ready to work with the,
our enemies the up.

183
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,254
So you know,
a horrible totalitarian dictatorship 

184
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,663
where effectively quarantined.
We lived in a kind of ghetto where you 

185
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:54,390
couldn't say what you,
what you believed in that for a Democrat

186
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,290
with a small d for a liberal minded 
person,

187
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,124
that doesn't seem right,
but it was actually healthy given the 

188
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,890
cold war at the time.

189
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,363
So,
so,

190
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,250
so what did it mean to have a stigma on 
people who hate this country?

191
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,280
We've lost that completely.
So,

192
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,650
so we'll get to that part because that 
really sort of,

193
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,960
that gets to the evolution part of where
you're at.

194
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,200
We were stigmatized and a well,
what did they believe?

195
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,780
Like what did that actually mean?
If you said you were a communist,

196
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,770
and we're talking the 19 forties now,
nothing.

197
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,023
My mother was a registered Democrat.
I don't think anything different from 

198
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:35,820
certainly not the Democratic Party of 
today,

199
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,180
although then,
I mean,

200
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,550
when Roosevelt was president,
they were all happy Democrats.

201
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,384
When Truman declared that America would 
defend free peoples fighting for their 

202
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:52,500
freedom against the Soviet Union,
they all defected.

203
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,920
And that formed the Progressive Party 
which was run by the Communist Party.

204
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,710
Yeah.
And then around 1956,

205
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,710
if I'm not mistaken,
all the information that comes out about

206
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,300
Stalin and then that sort of.

207
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,503
That was my away.
I was 17 at the time and that was my 

208
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,050
kind of awakening that everything that 
the William Buckley's.

209
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,120
So we hated to write that.
The right set,

210
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,150
the right set of Stalin had killed 7 
million people.

211
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:21,190
He actually killed about 40 million.
Um,

212
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,780
and we said was this was all anti-soviet
lies.

213
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:28,140
The Soviet Union was a paradise of the 
future.

214
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,280
Everybody equal everybody working,
everybody happy,

215
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,920
all lies.
But we've,

216
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,573
my community believed them.
And then Khrushchev came along with 

217
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:42,900
this,
gave it a secret speech that the Israeli

218
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,733
Mossad smuggled out and it just,
it blew up my community that there were 

219
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:49,464
divorces in our,
that we do have a over people over the 

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,680
Khrushchev report.
People felt betrayed.

221
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,530
They had lived a lie and other people 
felt,

222
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,660
you know,
you continue,

223
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,330
you go on and they defended it.
Yeah.

224
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,790
And that made marriage is untenable,
right?

225
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,770
You think p,
it's tough now for marriages when people

226
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:12,060
are going to.

227
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,120
I love trump.
I hate trump,

228
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,290
but,
but that's why.

229
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,690
That's earthshaking stuff.
Your whole narrative.

230
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,790
Yes.
So I came into the,

231
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,763
when I went to college,
I mean my mission self self developed a 

232
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
was to rescue the left from Stalinism.
Um,

233
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,630
I still believed in this future,
wherever,

234
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,500
you know,
common government ownership of the means

235
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:45,160
of production and quality and 
everything.

236
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,090
Um,
and so I,

237
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,960
I was a fervent new leftist.
I was one of the,

238
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,230
actually one of the creators of the new 
left.

239
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,793
I was at Berkeley.
We published a magazine called root and 

240
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,493
branch.
But by the end of that decade it was 

241
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,600
clear.
The left was a totalitarian forest.

242
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,990
It couldn't fit in with supporting,
you know,

243
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,580
whatever was the men of malice,
malice.

244
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:15,910
Mao killed more people in style.
Um,

245
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,283
and uh,
so you saw that change from what you 

246
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,950
thought,
something decent.

247
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:21,784
You saw that basically anything related 
to authoritarianism would be sort of 

248
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,970
pieced into my,
my most.

249
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,923
I had two serious deviations.
I had a nuclear family and everybody 

250
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:35,530
else was living in communities or 
whatever.

251
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,000
Um,
but the more serious one was that I read

252
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,790
books.
So I,

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,833
I mean,
I remember when billy airs was elected 

254
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,870
vice president when the weather people 
took over,

255
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,480
sds is a,
a college senior.

256
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,450
He boasted that he hadn't read a book in
a year.

257
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,170
I was horrified as a leftist by that 
statement.

258
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,930
Um,
but what was his argument was what?

259
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,610
I'm not being programmed by these 
people,

260
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,850
but then know to choose an irresponsible
twit.

261
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
I mean,
it's,

262
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,800
you know,
came from wealth very privileged.

263
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,243
I have,
I have nothing good to say about billy 

264
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,653
airs,
but by saying I haven't read a book in 

265
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:17,591
here,
who is he?

266
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,424
How is he trying to impress somebody?
But I know doing well because the books 

267
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:25,390
are written by the ruling class or when 
a got.

268
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,313
What did mark say?
The brulee ideas or the ideas of the 

269
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:30,910
ruling class?
Completely false.

270
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,240
How would you explain our universities 
today is full of crap.

271
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,080
I'd be the first thing yet.
Yeah.

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,920
Well we'll get to our universities.
Don't worry about that.

273
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,660
But wait a minute.
The first one you mentioned there was,

274
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:43,150
you came from a nuclear family and that.
Was that a problem?

275
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,910
I had a nuclear fence.
Yeah.

276
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,430
Oh,
you had your own nuclear.

277
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,930
I also came from a new,
quite the end of the decade.

278
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,150
I had four children.
Yeah.

279
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,060
Yeah.
So why was that a problem for them?

280
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,050
Because they want.
They didn't,

281
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,360
I wasn't expelled from the left.
I,

282
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,810
uh,
I was um.

283
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,590
Well what happened to me was that I,
I edited ramparts,

284
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,333
which was the leading,
it was the biggest magazine of the left 

285
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,520
and a Hollywood producer,
producer.

286
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,580
Vz Writer,
um,

287
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,890
was a big funder and sponsor of the 
Black Panther party.

288
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,380
And He introduced me to Huey Newton 
because he wanted me to take eldridge.

289
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,420
Cleaver had been on our masthead,
uh,

290
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,643
and eldridge there was a war.
It was basically a Black Panther party 

291
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:37,100
as a street gang.
And uh,

292
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,300
this was a contest for leadership.
Um,

293
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,060
so he,
uh,

294
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,753
he introduced me and I got to involve 
raising money for the panthers I raised 

295
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,910
per school.
Um,

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,833
I was very impressed.
They had a lot of children and the 

297
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,164
Panther party was a,
there were a genuinely good people and 

298
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,850
they were gangsters.
Um,

299
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,100
and the good people impressed me and 
I'm,

300
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,973
one of them was running the school,
a school and they were jammed into a 

301
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,030
brown shingle house in,
in Oakland.

302
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,813
I mean the,
they had double decker beds from one 

303
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:22,880
wall to the other,
but the kids.

304
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,150
So I,
um,

305
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,840
I thought this Hollywood producer would 
give me the money but it didn't turn out

306
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:32,230
that way,
but I raised a,

307
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,173
I think it was $125,000,
which a lot of money in those days and 

308
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:36,944
bought a church at Baptist Church in 
East Oakland that had been overtaken by 

309
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,184
the,
uh,

310
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,113
inner city.

311
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,150
It was a white Baptist church.
And,

312
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,760
and I,
I signed up the check,

313
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,030
I created the Oakland community learning
center,

314
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,790
a five zero,
one c three to how's the school?

315
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,110
I'll never forget the,
uh,

316
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,950
the minister said to me as I handed him 
the check,

317
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:01,784
I hope you're not going to turn this 
over to the black panthers and the 

318
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:06,794
nation of Islam.
When did he know that you were working 

319
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:10,820
with them at all?
At the time?

320
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,490
That we had no idea.
It was literally,

321
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,460
I know I'm talking to you like most of 
the left today.

322
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,800
I had no idea who they were,
the panthers.

323
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,890
Um,
but anyway,

324
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:25,250
I've told this story in a radical son,
my autobiography.

325
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,990
Anyway,
in 1974 I,

326
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:29,824
I recruited the bookkeeper,
my bookkeeper at ramparts to do the 

327
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:34,304
books for the school because I believed 
our own propaganda that the government 

328
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:38,654
was racist and that they would shut down
the panthers if they didn't keep the 

329
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,320
books,
which was ridiculous.

330
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,880
I mean,
look at Jesse Jackson,

331
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:51,881
look at Dale Sharpton.
Huge tax evader yeah.

332
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,333
And he's walking the streets because 
he's progressive and Blackie's 

333
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,210
protected.
Um,

334
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,340
and in December 1974,
uh,

335
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,243
betty disappeared and by the time the 
police Fisher body out of San Francisco 

336
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,310
Bay,
I knew the panthers had killed there and

337
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,730
I had been interviewed by the police.
They explained to me lots of things.

338
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:12,564
It's very difficult to high to dispose 
of a body unless you have an 

339
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,720
organization and then it's not so hard 
you have safe houses and this and that.

340
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,290
Um,
and so when that happened,

341
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,760
I was personally devastated.
I mean,

342
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:32,070
I was in the same place.
My parents were being embarrassed by the

343
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:32,904
Khrushchev report,
something I swore that I would never 

344
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:37,550
happened to me.
Um,

345
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,350
and I,
I'm curious,

346
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:41,700
what were your parents around at the 
time?

347
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,050
Yeah,
my mother was very,

348
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:45,690
they were worried for my safety as they 
should be.

349
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,523
I was threatened by Elaine Brown,
who was the head of the panthers and is 

350
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,114
alive today,
a toasted by the Atlanta journal 

351
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:55,960
Constitution.
And uh,

352
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,433
funded by actually conservatives have 
often not always speak on college 

353
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:05,520
campuses.
Um,

354
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,383
she was the head of the party.
Why would conservatives phoned her now 

355
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,520
as she evolved?
I'd forget that.

356
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,160
What's the name of.
It's a big orange county foundation.

357
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:17,610
They gave her $10,000
to speak and uh,

358
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,070
I can't remember.
It was UC Santa Barbara.

359
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,840
I with the students there and informed 
the now because,

360
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,140
uh,
uh,

361
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,023
conservatives in this country are a well
meaning a liberal minded people 

362
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,440
generally,
especially the ones with money.

363
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,580
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.
I mean,

364
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:41,880
here's a black person claiming that 
America is an oppressive country.

365
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:46,881
All sure he has money anyway.
Uh,

366
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,640
I was personally devastated.
I was clinically,

367
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:54,474
I would say clinically depressed for 
seven or eight years where I wake up in 

368
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,454
tears every morning.
I felt responsible for having recruited 

369
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,070
betty.
Uh,

370
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,750
my name is Betty van patter.
The woman who was murdered.

371
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,733
She was a mother of three children.
I'm the etiology is so precious that on 

372
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:15,144
the way to betty's funeral,
her daughter who worked for me and I 

373
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:21,810
didn't know if she was 19 or 20 at the 
time,

374
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,690
I tried to warn her.
I mean,

375
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,260
I was afraid for my children and I said,
I think the panthers killed your mother.

376
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,840
And her response was,
no,

377
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:31,710
they're good people.

378
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,733
So,
so I set out then to warn when I had 

379
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,580
sort of assimilated all this,
uh,

380
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,683
I,
my mission was to warn other people and 

381
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,770
that's how I know that Barack Obama is a
communist.

382
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,021
All right.
So wait,

383
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:54,780
let's,
let's pause before we jump to modern day

384
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,943
because everything that you just 
described there was why I thought your 

385
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,170
bio is so interesting because you grow 
up with communists,

386
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,180
you know,
now I didn't know about the.

387
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,033
I didn't,
I didn't know about the guy in the 

388
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:04,270
basement.
But you,

389
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,831
I mean,
you,

390
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:05,664
you are firmly on the left.
Your whole first 40 some ideas with 

391
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,923
Maurice.
I wrote a book called Empire in 

392
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,870
revolution,
which the left used,

393
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,640
right?
So leftist,

394
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,350
Communist,
Marxist.

395
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,780
I mean,
so bourbon for example,

396
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,550
um,
set of the,

397
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,760
of my book that it was like a,
I don't know what he said,

398
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,870
a handbook,
a Bible for the,

399
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,053
for the left before I,
he called me a renegade for leaving the 

400
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:34,110
left.

401
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,921
Right,
right.

402
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,190
So that's.
So you're,

403
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,540
you're a hero.
But the second you now change.

404
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:40,141
Now,
of course,

405
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:40,974
if you deviate from the party line,
this is what political people don't 

406
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:46,140
realize,
political correctness is

407
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,083
turn that Mousey tongue,
the greatest mass murder in human 

408
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:53,420
history and vented to shut people up.
It's the party line.

409
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:56,690
If you deviate from the party line,
they throw you into the cold.

410
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,740
Yeah.

411
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,090
Alright.
So now we're,

412
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,013
let's flash forward.
Unless there's something that shoot you 

413
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,780
or shoot you,
right.

414
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,080
So they,
they silence you,

415
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,240
then they shoot you,
you know,

416
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,570
uh,
so unless I'm missing something,

417
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:10,790
I think we can flash forward now to 
around 85,

418
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,460
which is really when you,
um,

419
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,100
what happened was when this happened,

420
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,550
no,
I was writing,

421
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:18,430
I,
I had,

422
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,690
um,
left ramparts with Peter Collier who was

423
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,690
by buddy.
Uh,

424
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,950
and uh,
it was Peter's idea that to write a,

425
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,260
a dynastic biography.
Uh,

426
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,660
the goals were,
the saga was on pbs at the time,

427
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,633
so it was a generational saga.
So I was in the midst of writing a book 

428
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,780
on the rockefellers,
which became a best seller.

429
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,650
And then we were asked to do a book on 
the Kennedys,

430
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,430
which came out in 1985.
And,

431
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,800
uh,
in 19 eight and,

432
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,683
and,
uh,

433
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,410
uh,
when it came out it was a number one New

434
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,560
York Times bestseller and uh,
the Washington Post,

435
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,394
the editor of The Washington Post Sunday
magazine called me to pick my brain 

436
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:16,480
about young Joe Kennedy was a 
congressman and he said,

437
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,020
what have you guys been doing?
Our whole,

438
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,570
Oh,
you won't believe this,

439
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:20,404
but Peter and I just voted for Ronald 
Reagan and neither Peter and I had 

440
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,690
talked before casting that vote.

441
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,010
Wow.
Oh,

442
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:28,840
that's a good story.
You want to write it?

443
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:33,841
So our story was better run than red,
but he renamed it lefties for Reagan.

444
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,743
Right?
So then that's when the knives came out 

445
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,880
and Peter said to me at the time,
I just show you how deep the current rot

446
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,080
the fake news is.
Um,

447
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,173
we were front page New York Times,
both books about the rockefellers and 

448
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,430
Sunday Times.
And The New York Times sets the standard

449
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:58,780
for all the media they even reprint 
them.

450
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,200
May View is.
But um,

451
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,680
and when our article came back on,
we voted for Reagan.

452
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,060
Peter said to me are literary careers 
are over.

453
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,010
Wow.
Alright.

454
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,770
So you must be joking,
so you really had no idea.

455
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:16,604
I have no idea.
Even though you knew some of the 

456
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:20,930
tactics,
but it was exactly right.

457
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,140
That was the end.
I don't lie less 20 bucks.

458
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,240
I'm a New York Times.

459
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,110
They noticed one and called me a relic 
for using the word Communist.

460
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,830
That was just a squib.
Right.

461
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,693
So even though you knew all the tactics 
that could be coming down on your way 

462
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,330
and the way you be treated,
ever been a realist about that then.

463
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,570
So you.
So that's it.

464
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,404
You just weren't a realist and your own.
Even though you saw you had such a 

465
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:45,854
history of seeing what would happen and 
not the hare instant cognitivism black 

466
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,980
could never believe that people can be 
so ideological and so duped and I should

467
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:55,911
know.
Yeah,

468
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,470
I think I've been suffering from a 
little of this right now and immediate.

469
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,920
The rubber's meeting the road with me at
the moment of of this kind of what,

470
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,013
but what was it about?
Was it something about Reagan or was it 

471
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:08,460
really about Mondelez?
Reagan was.

472
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,663
This happened earlier.
My bumped in to the parking lot of the 

473
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,383
Berkeley Co op,
which is a supermarket that was 

474
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,600
everybody liked because it was a 
cooperative.

475
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,170
Um,
we're not rolling stone actually publish

476
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:27,320
a story that Peter and I did on the 
weather,

477
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,620
the weather underground,
telling the truth about it.

478
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,990
Um,
and uh,

479
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,070
this woman I knew that me and the 
parking lot and she said,

480
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,761
David,
you know,

481
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,170
people really hate you.
Now.

482
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,250
The truth about these crazy terrorists 
is what they were,

483
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,330
who got people killed and they hate you 
now.

484
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,620
Hey me for saying the truth about it.
Yeah.

485
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,663
But,
but what was it about Reagan also that 

486
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:59,330
then they hated Reagan the way they hate
trump.

487
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,400
Yeah.
It was the same kind of hatred.

488
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,600
That ticket,
they just hate it.

489
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,420
It's,
it's because he's,

490
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,740
he's not one of us.
That's,

491
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,500
it's very visceral.
Yeah.

492
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,740
Is that what anything?
Ironically,

493
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,530
yeah.
He's not one of them,

494
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:16,780
you.
No,

495
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,613
he was an,
he didn't know the trump phenomenon and 

496
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:28,310
problem is a little different,
but it's not all that different.

497
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,144
I mean,
Reagan was an actor that they looked 

498
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,180
down on that,
um,

499
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,660
you know,
a fun,

500
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,300
wrote a pamphlet called,
uh,

501
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,380
an essay which is a pamphlet called the 
anti capitalist mentality.

502
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Why do academics,
he capitalism,

503
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
why are they so left?

504
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,680
And the answer is because they feel 
superior to businessmen.

505
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,240
And here's trump.
The businessman.

506
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,320
A businessman are,
yeah,

507
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,910
they have no respect for what it takes 
to build a billion dollar empire of,

508
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,840
for them it's all theft or something 
underhanded.

509
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,040
It's after it's crony capitalism.
We're.

510
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,310
So Reagan was like that.
He was an actor.

511
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,210
How dare he be present.
We're so much smarter than he is.

512
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,140
We should be running the country.
So intellectual stat,

513
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,630
I think it was about intellectual.
It's generally they don't,

514
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,513
they,
they feel that they're smarter than 

515
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:30,600
everybody else because they haven't 
actually created for the most part.

516
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,990
So they have to sort of elevate what the
pad.

517
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,833
I think the power should go to them.
And I learned very early when I was 

518
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:37,944
still leftist when Jack Kennedy was 
assassinated and Lyndon Johnson became 

519
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,164
president.
I was living in England and of course 

520
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:47,670
Europeans looked at on an Americans from
the beginning of the republic,

521
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,590
but um,
uh,

522
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,333
Lbj,
he had the Lbj cufflinks and the Lbj 

523
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,610
children and the Lbj dogs and the MPG.

524
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,690
So they,
they just thought he was.

525
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:04,540
This is a,
yeah,

526
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,600
this is,
uh,

527
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,980
uh,
you know,

528
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,143
and Johnson was much smarter than Jack 
Kennedy and he went to East Texas State 

529
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,560
Teachers College,
but he,

530
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,830
he unfortunately,
he put in place the great society,

531
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:24,831
which is an Albatross on America's neck,
has been for lo these this half century.

532
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,883
But he was smart.
He knew how to get it through Congress 

533
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,050
and Jack Kennedy couldn't get any of it 
through.

534
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,240
Yeah.
I now congress barely worked.

535
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,074
So that's why when trump came along,
I wasn't one of these never trumping 

536
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,590
inside the beltway snobs.
Although some of my,

537
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,350
my good friends from path,
okay,

538
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:52,470
so you have this final awakening.
You write this thing.

539
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:54,900
Then a year later,
I think in [inaudible] 86 year old,

540
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,880
why?
It wasn't why I left the left.

541
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,280
I wrote it and say,
look,

542
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,660
I,
as I say,

543
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,530
I,
I,

544
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,363
W,
I was personally threatened by Elaine 

545
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,130
Brown.

546
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,410
Um,
and then in a,

547
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,580
I have a tape of the phone conversation 
was he said,

548
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,390
if you,
if you should get run over David,

549
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,950
really,
I'm,

550
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm,
I'm going to be your best friend because

551
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,080
people will say I did it,
something like that.

552
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,550
I mean,
it was a threat.

553
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,050
Um,
so I was afraid I fed to Kate Coleman,

554
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,230
who wrote an article for a now defunct 
leftwing magazine,

555
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,980
uh,
what's called the party's over about the

556
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:38,814
criminality of the panthers,
which I had discovered by personal 

557
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:44,090
investigation.
Um,

558
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,180
uh,
uh,

559
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,713
yeah,
I forgot.

560
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,880
Well,
getting to the village voice piece,

561
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,050
the village voice.
Yeah.

562
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:57,020
So I finally in 1986,
which is,

563
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,740
it's a decade later,
I wrote a piece why I am not no longer a

564
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:05,200
leftist.
And uh,

565
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,340
and we've heard to this,
I did not name the killers,

566
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,110
but I did refer to the murder and the 
path that the panthers and murdered her.

567
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,753
And I'm a poem.
Berman wrote this piece about the 

568
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:23,740
renegade Horowitz,
the intellectual life,

569
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,574
and the renegade Horowitz.
That was a vicious attack and he had me 

570
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:31,580
at the end of his piece cheering on 
suicide.

571
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,700
Sita,
who was a psychopath.

572
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,593
That was a contract in Nicaragua who 
might hadn't even heard of when he 

573
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,543
called me,
he said in Horowitz's cheering wakes up 

574
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,543
the next morning cheering suicide.
So basically you went off the 

575
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:46,114
reservation officially with this article
and then you had said the knives were 

576
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,413
already out.
We'll know it was with the Reagan 

577
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:56,101
article with the Reagan article.
This is why this is a right and left.

578
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,940
Right.
So this was a way.

579
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:58,900
He was a year later,
right?

580
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,150
I think it was 85 and 86,
so a year later.

581
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,390
So the knives were already out and then 
this was like sort of the final door on.

582
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,510
That's right.
And I saw 1986,

583
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,120
87.

584
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,130
That's 30 years ago.
Is that what it is?

585
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:14,131
Something like that.
In 30 years my work has never been taken

586
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,400
the work,
the ideas,

587
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,980
my arguments with the left.
Why am no law?

588
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:24,160
I wrote a long essay on,
on leaving the left,

589
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,540
um,
and why I left it a never responded to.

590
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,150
I'm the nation,
made one stab at it,

591
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,063
but I'm not a very good one.
On the other hand is like hundred 

592
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,570
thousand attacks on me on the Internet 
from leftists.

593
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,410
So it's not like they don't think that I
need to be refuted anything.

594
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,600
It's just more effective to pretending 
it makes you feel any better.

595
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:52,270
Right before we sat down,
I was scrolling my twitter feed and some

596
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:53,104
article was written about me were they 
referred to me as a right winger and 

597
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:55,984
then got a few other things incorrect 
about me and then my own audience 

598
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,080
actually started attacking them on 
twitter and then they,

599
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,273
they didn't issue a retraction,
but they changed the headline at least 

600
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,214
and change one other thing,
which of course is not journalistically 

601
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,100
sound,
but I guess maybe I'm picking up some of

602
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:12,600
the.

603
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,480
Well at first it hurts,
but eventually you get to be liable.

604
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,314
Proof thing.
They libel used so much that it just 

605
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:21,640
seems ridiculous more than anything 
else.

606
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:23,640
It's just lazy,
Lazy and ridiculous.

607
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,973
So you know,
I'm an easier target than you are 

608
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,460
because I vowed when I left the left 
that I'm gonna talk to the left.

609
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,900
Address them in the same way that they 
addressed everybody else.

610
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,870
No.
Oh,

611
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,660
I didn't know you could have nicely.
Yeah.

612
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,740
You and barry very hard to demonize.
I'm sort of easy.

613
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,240
So when you see,
you had some nice things to say about me

614
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:48,074
when you sat down and when you see 
someone like me that's understands the 

615
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:51,734
title of this book,
that understands your journey and all 

616
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,550
that.
Do you think I was just.

617
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:56,384
Even though I'm obviously are we have 30
some odd years between us that I was 

618
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:01,850
just late to the game and picking up 
what was going on here?

619
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,683
Or do you think something also happened 
in the last couple of years with the 

620
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,513
left?
Alright.

621
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,910
First of all,
starting with the mcgovern campaign.

622
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:14,210
That's when it started.
The communists left,

623
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,360
infiltrated and took over the Democratic
Party.

624
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,730
Um,
I mean Tom Hayden was no longer with us,

625
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,390
was a cynical and I am American,
lying radical.

626
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,630
Uh,
and he was given the medal of freedom by

627
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:34,640
Bill Clinton.
Um,

628
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,853
uh,
he was a state legislator in the state 

629
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:40,004
of California.
You can still see his work whenever you 

630
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:47,321
see prop 65 that warns you about the bad
effects of chemicals in your whatever.

631
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,240
Oh yeah.
It's everywhere here in la.

632
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,083
Um,
but the Democratic Party took the left 

633
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,100
in the,
the Ana,

634
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,790
the Nih,
American totalitarian,

635
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,790
and I would say racist.
Left.

636
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,380
I will explain that later.
But racist left was taken into the bosom

637
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,530
of the Democratic Party in the Clinton 
administration.

638
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,233
And with Obama,
they got one of theirs in the White 

639
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,221
House.
Okay.

640
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,650
So let's.
So let's pause there for a second.

641
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,290
So when I hear you said about the 
Clinton administration,

642
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:25,610
that's hard for me to picture because 
those eight years were basically,

643
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,850
I don't think we saw a lot of what we're
seeing right now.

644
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:31,190
So what am I missing?
If you miss them?

645
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,510
You didn't know the personalities from 
one.

646
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,820
Um,
I've written a,

647
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,923
let's put it this way.
I think back to the Clinton 

648
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,760
administration very fondly still that 
things were basically,

649
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,360
there were terrible that they were 
basic.

650
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,780
Bill Clinton's was not an idiot log in 
the way that Hillary Clinton,

651
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:55,781
this Bill Clinton's etiology was.
Why was this ideology and was.

652
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,730
But that you would argue that's probably
a saving grace.

653
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:01,790
Then corruption is far better than 
communism.

654
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,653
Yeah.

655
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,680
If it burned for the corruption of the 
Clintons,

656
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,950
Bernie Sanders would have been a 
nominee.

657
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,020
Um,
that's a great quote there.

658
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,233
You just go out corruption as far better
than communism as a good way because it 

659
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:17,720
is because you've got a meeting that you
can deal with.

660
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:18,554
It doesn't have the ideology that sweeps
people along with Bill Clinton 

661
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:22,910
domestically was,
uh,

662
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,860
a fairly centrist,
uh,

663
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,933
you know,
I don't have too much to quarrel with 

664
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,730
them.
They are,

665
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,870
uh,
uh,

666
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,770
I'm foreign policy was terrible.
Absolutely terrible.

667
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,830
The World Trade Center was blown up in 
1993 a by Ramzi Yousef.

668
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,060
He intended to kill 50,000
people or $200,000,

669
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,970
top of one of the towers on the other.
The bomb is fired.

670
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,270
It wounded a thousand people and killed 
six.

671
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,613
Bill Clinton never visited the site,
dismissed it as an individual criminal 

672
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:00,450
act when it was inspired by the blind 
sheikh who's just been,

673
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,250
um,
assignment been London.

674
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,083
We should have been stopped in the 
nineties before the World Trade Center 

675
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:09,830
was.
I mean,

676
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:12,300
I can't go.
I've written a lot about this.

677
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,733
So,
but in the case of that in case the 

678
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,940
first World Trade Center bombing.
So what do you think was going on?

679
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:20,100
They didn't Bill Clinton's head.
So this happens.

680
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,710
He never visited.
Say what is the,

681
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,570
what's the ideology there that would 
lead him to that?

682
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,433
It's an interesting question.
I wish we had a one of these Democrats 

683
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:33,010
on and you could ask them the question.
Um,

684
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,003
I'll,
I'll try to get a former just to skip 

685
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:40,890
ahead in this book.
I've written big agenda.

686
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:44,430
I,
I lay out what I think is going on that,

687
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,463
that,
uh,

688
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,330
the Democratic Party is now a racist 
party.

689
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,640
Uh,
you used the phrase people of color is a

690
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,474
racist phrase.
Identity politics is racist and it's 

691
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,134
anti American.
The fundamental American idea is that 

692
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:07,671
we're all creatures of a divinity or 
maybe nature's God,

693
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:13,041
whatever Jefferson wrote there and equal
in the eyes of our creator.

694
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,263
Therefore we should be treated equally 
by our government and we have rights 

695
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:23,310
that are inalienable at government can't
take away.

696
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,320
So it's all about individual freedom.
And most importantly,

697
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:33,321
individual accountability.
When I was a kid in public schools,

698
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,160
we always,
there was this phrase,

699
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:40,050
regardless of race,
color,

700
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:40,884
or creed,
who an American is somebody who doesn't 

701
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:48,720
look at your origins.
We're a nation of immigrants that way.

702
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,700
Don't look at your origins.
Of course,

703
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:55,701
if you come from a terrorist country,
we should have a little vetting process.

704
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,710
Um,
identity politics is the opposite.

705
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,180
What the left seeks.
We are in a civil war situation now.

706
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,763
Um,
and the reason is the reason it's so 

707
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:13,734
irreconcilable is that the left believe 
is a racist that believes in a racial 

708
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,690
hierarchy.
So if you're the right skin color,

709
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,524
which is dark,
you go to the head of the line for 

710
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:27,000
admissions to college and go to the head
of the line for job.

711
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,950
You go to the headline for our 
promotion,

712
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,163
you go to the head of the line for 
almost anything and everything's not 

713
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:35,160
diverse enough.
So we'll take.

714
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,170
Um,
so what would you say to the people that

715
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,004
would say,
well,

716
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,000
white people had a good for a long time 
and,

717
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,030
and,
and why?

718
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:44,980
People do bad things and they did good 
things.

719
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:49,270
And one of the good things that White 
America did was to liberate the slaves.

720
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,540
People forget that we inherited slavery.
This is how I've been myself,

721
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:55,834
notorious in the left by coming out 
against reparations for slavery a 137 

722
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:03,280
years after the fact.
Um,

723
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,270
America inherited a system of slavery.
Slavery existed.

724
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:11,110
I learned this from Orlando Patterson,
who is a black left of center,

725
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,863
a sociologist at Harvard who's written 
prize winning books on slavery and 

726
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:22,030
freedom.
Slavery existed for 3000 years.

727
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,730
Nobody ever said it was a moral,
not Jesus,

728
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:25,564
not Moses,
not aristotle until a white Christian 

729
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:30,904
males in England led by Wilberforce,
said it's a moral and an American slave 

730
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,460
owner.

731
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Thomas Jefferson wrote it into the birth
certificate of this country that all men

732
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:46,210
are created equal and a given right to 
liberty by their creator.

733
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,300
Within 20 years,
the slave trade was ended.

734
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,733
Um,
the reason that America didn't initiate 

735
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,294
a civil war in 1776 to free the slaves.
What are the biggest reasons was that 

736
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,530
England would have come and just,
we take in the colonies and reinstituted

737
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,390
a slavery anyway,
and within a generation or a little more

738
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,150
given in those days,
people live shorter lives,

739
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,440
uh,
at the cost of a 350,000

740
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:18,274
union soldiers.
We the braid that the slaves and 

741
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:22,330
liberated them throughout the 
hemisphere.

742
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,943
So black people,
Americans can be very proud of their 

743
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,080
heritage.
Um,

744
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,310
you know,
it's,

745
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,400
it's a human heritage,
so it's got a lot of bad spots,

746
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,650
but you look at any other country in the
world,

747
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,050
and uh,
forgive me,

748
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:41,500
left this for saying this one thing nice
about America is the best.

749
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,940
What other country do Asians get in 
boats and risk their lives to get into?

750
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,170
You think that coming here to be 
oppressed,

751
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,820
right?
I mean everybody,

752
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:54,750
everybody wants to be here,
and then the funny thing is this,

753
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,593
at the same time,
you go to watch some of these protests 

754
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:58,144
and the people that are screaming about 
how racist and evil and patriarchy and 

755
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:01,714
all this stuff,
they're also the ones calling for open 

756
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,580
borders.
They want everyone to share in the heart

757
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,433
that is to destroy the country.
Anybody with any sense knows so had it 

758
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,390
all.
But let me just say,

759
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,620
yeah,
the left is,

760
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,750
is it,
it's own.

761
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,823
Whatever ideas it has to marks.
It's the Marxist paradigm of the 

762
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:25,240
oppressors and the oppressed and it's an
economic.

763
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,320
It begins as an economic and they've 
layered on race and gender.

764
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,873
Um,
so the fact is determines a country's 

765
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,930
prosperity is culture,
not classes.

766
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,050
It's culture.
America has a great culture.

767
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,050
We take in.
I'm.

768
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,990
One of the things we do is we take in 
brilliant people from all over the world

769
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,640
and give them freedom to innovate.
Other countries,

770
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,670
copy our innovations.
And Israel is the same way.

771
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:56,504
It's why they hate it because they're 
bringing in people from all over the 

772
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,443
windows.
But also it's the freedom people do not 

773
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:08,090
appreciate freedom in this country,
obviously,

774
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,230
since we are universities and now 
totalitarian institutions,

775
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,110
I can't go to a university without 
bodyguards.

776
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,963
Yeah.
And that's been true for the last 15 

777
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:20,264
years I've been physically attack.
If I didn't have bodyguards and if the 

778
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:24,794
university has put in place security,
I could never get through a speech and 

779
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:30,590
I'm not alone.
It's any conservative,

780
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,083
virtually any conservative.
And now it's moderates and this is 

781
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:35,414
fascism and that's a.
it's totally embedded in our university 

782
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,680
system.

783
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,513
Yeah.
Do you make a distinction between sort 

784
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:45,350
of the leaders who really understand the
stuff that you're talking about?

785
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:46,184
So the people who,
who are the leaders of this leftist 

786
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,603
movement versus the,
the bulk of the people who I think are 

787
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,410
following along without bad intentions,
like when I see all these kids who I,

788
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,363
you know,
I lock them on twitter and people got a 

789
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:01,520
demonstration to get laid.
Yeah.

790
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,370
Yeah.
You know,

791
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,170
and people are gullible and they don't 
think.

792
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:11,171
And I can't put two and two together.
The phrase I didn't want to skip this.

793
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:17,140
People of color is a racist phrase.
It's not English.

794
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,233
Do we say,
here's a box of crayons of color and 

795
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:27,200
French.
That's the way French people or color or

796
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:28,580
whatever they say.
Yeah.

797
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,910
So it's a completely ideological 
construct.

798
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,820
So is that as its function?
Well,

799
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,680
let's look at the Mexico.

800
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,933
Two main ethnic groups.
The descendants of the Spanish 

801
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:42,854
conquistadores who slaughtered the 
indigenous Indians and the descendants 

802
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:49,100
of the indigenous Indians.
When they crossed the border,

803
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:51,620
they both people of color,
therefore they're oppressed.

804
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:53,010
Both of them.
The keys,

805
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,870
the doors and the indigenous people,
they are oppressed.

806
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,920
They deserve special sensitivities and 
special privileges.

807
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,023
Maharajahs in India are people of color 
be headers in Rocca are people of color 

808
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,480
who are people of color,
white people,

809
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,750
white people are evil,
bad.

810
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,490
And this is,
this is,

811
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,363
this is the racist ideology of our time.
Is it also lacking in several other 

812
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:22,041
ways?
I mean,

813
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:25,040
for example,
you could take American Indians,

814
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,043
uh,
people who've moved here from India or 

815
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:28,550
their grandparents moved here from 
India,

816
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,220
or you could take Asian people at 
virtually any nationality

817
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,310
and they don't count in this leftist 
thing because they've said,

818
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,830
well,
the Indians happened.

819
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah.
The native Americans.

820
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,130
I'm sorry,
not.

821
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,330
I thought that was ridiculous.
Now I'm going to,

822
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,560
we're not going to edit that out because
I don't believe in that,

823
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:48,060
but that was in the completely idiotic 
statement.

824
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,860
I American Indians from India who moved 
to America.

825
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:54,450
That's what native American,
correct?

826
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,440
Yeah.
Correct.

827
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,663
Chinese,
the Japanese and American Indians in 

828
00:44:58,011 --> 00:45:00,330
that native American.
That's correct.

829
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,990
Yeah.
I just ruined my list.

830
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,240
I don't like to say says my Nora.
No,

831
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,060
don't look over your shoulder.
There's only,

832
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,070
there's only arrows coming.
That was Indian joke right there.

833
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm in the,
the left.

834
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,760
It's pathetic.
Intellectually.

835
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,653
They don't have an argument.
So they have to purge those groups 

836
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,350
because those groups.
Yeah.

837
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,223
That's why they have to shut you up 
because they can't deal with your 

838
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,600
arguments is really simple,
straightforward,

839
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,690
and it's so invaded our literary 
culture.

840
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:37,920
The last two national book awards were 
given to racist tracks,

841
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,610
one by Ta-nehisi coats I can never 
remember.

842
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:46,611
The title of it was just a rank racist 
coats.

843
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,790
Uh,
what inspired him to write the book?

844
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:55,791
It's about how evil America is,
but how was the murder of his friend?

845
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,933
Not The bird.
I the killing of his friend by a 

846
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:00,174
policeman in Maryland.
It turns out as he tells you that the 

847
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:08,310
policemen,
the policemen accused the dead,

848
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,970
his dead friend of trying to run him 
over with his car.

849
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,100
The policeman is black.
So what does code say?

850
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,053
He was thinking white.
Now that isn't the purest racism and 

851
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:25,290
this one now it's called stamped from 
the beginning.

852
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,130
It's a semi illiterate book that,
that it,

853
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,673
that they have lowered their standards 
so dramatically as a still shocks me 

854
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,640
because these are intelligent people 
that people give the awards,

855
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:40,640
but I should know better.
Um,

856
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,460
but it opens with the police shootings 
of criminals in the last year,

857
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,073
which were totally distorted by black 
lives matter and other leftists into a 

858
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,410
cops gutting down unarmed blacks.
These were predators.

859
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,680
And who did they pray?
Pray on a braid on black people.

860
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,840
Freddie Gray.
I mean,

861
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,340
you know,
you could go on a,

862
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,130
again,
even remember the names,

863
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,360
the guy in Ferguson,
um,

864
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,070
they're criminals who prey on black 
people,

865
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,660
but this guy has them as innocent blacks
who were gunned down by racist cops.

866
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,703
So at the opening of his book,
which is which he has called the 

867
00:47:23,651 --> 00:47:24,484
definitive history of racism in America,
he's exposed as a liar and he won the 

868
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:29,044
national book.
So our institutions have been just 

869
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,460
generally corrupted.
Yeah.

870
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,270
So what is this racist ideology of the 
left?

871
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,913
So for a lot of people hearing this,
I think a certain amount of people 

872
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:41,074
hearing this,
we're going to go,

873
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,250
yeah,
I get it.

874
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:43,084
So you don't talk quite like this,
which is why I think you're much harder 

875
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,140
to,
uh,

876
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,770
I'm,
I'm,

877
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,603
I'm,
I'm wanting to see you with a so called 

878
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:53,130
liberal.
I don't call them liberals.

879
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,133
They're bigots.
Yeah.

880
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,450
Well,
I've had many progressive,

881
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:56,284
a progressive on this show and I treat 
them with the same respect that I treat 

882
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:00,860
anybody else I did.

883
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,750
My general rule is I don't find that 
braiding somebody or belittling them,

884
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,613
but yeah,
I made this bow ready 30 years ago that 

885
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:12,940
I was going to berate the left.
I was going to say,

886
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:15,850
Hey Lbj,
how many kids did you kill today?

887
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,223
I actually,
when I was still sort of leaving the 

888
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:21,670
left,
I thought about that statement a lot.

889
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,163
St.
Let's see if I were a prisoner of war 

890
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,944
and I was in a room with my captor,
would I rather it was Lbj or holcim and 

891
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:33,514
it was a no brainer,
so that's part of it is that you just 

892
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,614
constantly say the worst thing about 
your intellectual opponents because 

893
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:42,364
there's no end here that you just 
constantly say anything to you and 

894
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:48,244
that's why I love Milo because he just 
throws it right back in their face and 

895
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,800
that's what really needs to be done.

896
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,490
These people need to be embarrassed.
Alloying probably beyond embarrassment.

897
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:02,710
Yeah,
I mean ABC news stuff.

898
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:05,870
Annapolis is sitting there with Katrina 
Vanden who oval,

899
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,723
whose entire life has been spent 
apologizing for defending and advancing 

900
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:13,750
communists causes.
That was that.

901
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,100
That's ABC.
That's how far gone this country is.

902
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,473
So are all the answers then for you on 
the right or do you have frustrations 

903
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,000
with the right?
Because I think right before we started,

904
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:28,580
we only talked for about 30 seconds.
Liberal.

905
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,950
I've,
I tried to,

906
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,860
um,
no,

907
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,570
I mean I,
I get know what did I.

908
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,740
Oh,
I,

909
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,913
I took on the leaders of the religious 
right over a mark raw rash cope was the 

910
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:50,200
governor of Montana and was the chairman
of the RNC,

911
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,890
met with the thing that's called the 
human rights association,

912
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:58,891
which is a gay group.
And he addressed them or whatever.

913
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:02,680
I met with them and he was denounced by 
Paul.

914
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,550
Why Rick and very well known leaders of 
the religious right.

915
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,013
And I wrote an article saying that I'm a
political party is not a religious 

916
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,340
movement or shouldn't be and it's the 
job of the RNC chair to reach out and,

917
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,610
and,
and so forth.

918
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,850
And I've never been an opponent of gay 
marriage and I,

919
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,290
you know,
I could go on on.

920
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,020
Yeah.
And you mentioned before that abortion,

921
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:31,854
you're,
although you're not a fan to say the 

922
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:35,780
least,
but you are a pro choice,

923
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:36,220
right?
So,

924
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,053
no,
I wouldn't describe myself as pro 

925
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:38,630
choice.
Okay.

926
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,463
I,
I,

927
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,343
I,
um,

928
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:46,270
and it's been a long lifetime of 
rethinking this issue when I grew up,

929
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,413
uh,
abortions were illegal after the third 

930
00:50:53,171 --> 00:50:54,004
month and we know a lot more now and 
medical techniques where we just know a 

931
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:04,810
lot more about fetuses and the,
you know,

932
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,500
if you think about it,
their children from conception.

933
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,401
I mean,
I just,

934
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:11,920
it's not an argument as a person 
already.

935
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,690
Um,
do you think from the moment of women,

936
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,520
it's not about the woman's body alone,

937
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,383
uh,

938
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:21,801
you know,
I,

939
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:24,750
I think that fathers are involved as 
well,

940
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:28,470
but certainly this child there,
so you know,

941
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:29,304
the argument against it as you want to 
bring a kid into the world that's going 

942
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:32,534
to have a absolutely miserable life 
because it's wrong parent at the wrong 

943
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:37,410
time.
You know,

944
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:38,244
and I,
I think the energy should be spent on 

945
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:46,310
finding ways to take care of children 
that the parents are unable to take care

946
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:49,800
of it.
It's a very vexed problem and I don't,

947
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,613
I've,
I've confronted a right winger is 

948
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:56,670
actually was in the heritage foundation 
debate,

949
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,490
you know who said it's murder?
I said,

950
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,750
well,
if you think it's murder,

951
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:04,260
then you should be demanding.
The execution of every mother in America

952
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:08,220
has had an abortion and if you don't,
it's a much more complicated problem,

953
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,533
so that's kind of where I am.
What was his response to that and shine 

954
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:12,940
them up?

955
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,500
That has a real quite well.
That's why the abortion went to me is is

956
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,443
one where I think very good people on 
both sides of this are just struggling 

957
00:52:21,481 --> 00:52:22,314
with it because it almost is coming down
to the basic questions of life and it 

958
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:28,560
is,
but you can't discuss basic questions in

959
00:52:28,561 --> 00:52:30,870
our political atmosphere and not with 
the left.

960
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,620
The left wants to convert everything 
into a morality play where they are.

961
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:37,140
Right.
How much of this is culture?

962
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,750
Did you see that change to that?
It's just.

963
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,823
I know what you're saying,
that culture is the most important 

964
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:43,620
thing,
but when did it go from,

965
00:52:43,621 --> 00:52:45,160
like I was thinking,
even left,

966
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,263
started taking over the universities in 
the seventies now and they've got the k 

967
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:52,290
12 schools as well.
Um,

968
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,143
and you know,
I conducted a was literally five or six 

969
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:01,610
year campaign to try to get a,
an economic bill of rights,

970
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,493
really a student bill of rights that 
students have a right to a professional 

971
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:07,344
education and a democracy that means 
that they have professors can express 

972
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,354
their opinions but they have to present 
the opposing sides of controversial 

973
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:17,460
issues in a fair minded way.

974
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,470
And I was attacked from one end of the 
country.

975
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:25,680
Other is a Torquemada and a controller.
It's very liberal.

976
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:25,980
And

977
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,813
I did it all out of their own documents.
There's a very famous academic freedom 

978
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,230
statement that was drawn.
Well,

979
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:36,300
what's the thought control part of 
trying to get more in there?

980
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,010
Don't you know,
he can't be logic.

981
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,170
This is the aup.
These are stalinists.

982
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,120
I mean I debated them across the 
country.

983
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,470
They,
gosh,

984
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,810
I mean they put me through the ringer,
but you know,

985
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:50,644
like I say,
he'd get to a point where you're liable 

986
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:54,580
proof because they've liable you so 
much,

987
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:55,570
and it does,
it does,

988
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,440
but they fought it tooth and nail.
And for example,

989
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,480
I had praised,
uh,

990
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:06,320
in all of my speeches,
this is a 1915,

991
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:07,154
the statement on academic freedom by the
American Association of university 

992
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:11,044
professors and the Penn state still has 
or had as its academic freedom 

993
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:20,710
provision,
the statement that the obligate the,

994
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:21,803
it is not the place of a professor in a 
democratic society to indoctrinate his 

995
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:27,514
or her students.
Therefore they must present divergent 

996
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:32,074
opinions in a fair minded manner.
That's a paraphrase of and I praise 

997
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:39,420
that.
And so the head of the Aup,

998
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,210
Carrie Nelson,
I made it a personal crusade to get that

999
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:46,840
ripped out of the Penn state academic 
freedom.

1000
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,950
So the so called liberal person right 
now this to be removed.

1001
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:52,690
He's alive.

1002
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,150
Okay.
Yeah,

1003
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:54,770
carry.
He actually,

1004
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,520
I mean he's defended me in some places,
so he's like an,

1005
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,940
an whatever.
It is.

1006
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,850
Not quite a bit a doctrinaire,
but he did the faculty senate.

1007
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:09,970
They're ripped it out and took out 
explicitly the thing.

1008
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:12,000
It's not the place to indoctrinate the 
student.

1009
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,460
Yeah.
Do you find when you,

1010
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,323
when you meet people,
maybe some young people that are waking 

1011
00:55:16,491 --> 00:55:17,324
up to some of this stuff at once,
they see one piece of it that the rest 

1012
00:55:20,031 --> 00:55:20,681
of it crumbles.
Right?

1013
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:21,514
Exactly.
Because I see this because I saw it 

1014
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:24,520
happen with myself obviously,
and I,

1015
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,890
and for me it's still an unfolding 
process I think.

1016
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,050
And that's why I'm happy to have these 
conversations,

1017
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,580
but I see it happening with other 
people.

1018
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:33,080
Now.
I get emails every day.

1019
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:33,914
People would be like,
one little thing happened and then 

1020
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:40,970
months later I now believe everything 
that was Steve Miller says it was guns.

1021
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,270
That's what turned him from a liberal 
and conservative.

1022
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,070
Um,
I have,

1023
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,363
uh,
somebody who writes occasionally for 

1024
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:53,350
front page website,
uh,

1025
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,370
who

1026
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,170
let me speak in Camden,
New Jersey.

1027
00:55:56,171 --> 00:55:59,050
And I pointed out,
as I said I do in my book,

1028
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:01,060
big agenda.
Um,

1029
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,033
every inner city of any size is 100 
percent controlled by the Democratic 

1030
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,220
Party and progressive it has been for 50
to 100 years.

1031
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,780
Clinton,
Camden.

1032
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,140
So every little walkie Atlanta,
Chicago,

1033
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,250
St Louis,
Baltimore,

1034
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:16,950
right?

1035
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,783
Um,
everything that's wrong in the inner 

1036
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:23,850
cities that policy can affect Democrats 
and progressives are responsible for,

1037
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,443
once you see that it's all over.
And then there are people out there 

1038
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:31,090
screaming that.
And even president,

1039
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:36,140
we had this.
Here's some leftist mentality when Peter

1040
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,660
Collier and I wrote the bestseller on 
the Kennedys,

1041
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:45,010
we found ourselves in a green room,
have a good morning.

1042
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:48,070
America sitting.
There were only three people.

1043
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:53,071
The other person was William F Buckley 
and was dead silence in the room.

1044
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,353
And uh,
the reason that Peter and I were silent 

1045
00:56:58,661 --> 00:56:59,494
as we,
as we,

1046
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,373
we had no idea who buckley was.
We just knew we didn't want to be nice 

1047
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:04,594
to a fascist.
That's what the left and called him a 

1048
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:09,640
fascist.
We didn't want to be nice to a fascist.

1049
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,600
So Peter broke the ice by saying,
my mother is a big fan of yours.

1050
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:17,260
And then we find out from Buckley who 
was a very gracious human being,

1051
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,633
um,
that he was silent because his son had 

1052
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:25,990
just written a very critical attack on a
Kennedy book.

1053
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:28,540
That was another one that came out and 
he didn't know if it was.

1054
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,980
Huh?
Uh,

1055
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,670
civility on the left.
Yeah.

1056
00:57:34,671 --> 00:57:35,640
It just,
it's so,

1057
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:37,560
it's fascist.
That's what it is.

1058
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,330
And if this,
there's no way.

1059
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,170
I mean,
the only response you can have this one,

1060
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:45,570
like Milo's it just go in their face.
But anyways,

1061
00:57:45,571 --> 00:57:47,520
I just shot you down.
Yeah.

1062
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,620
There is a,
uh,

1063
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,473
an incredible video that I saw a couple 
of years ago have you at University of 

1064
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,080
San Diego I think.
And a young Muslim student gets out,

1065
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:00,720
very articulate with a head scarf.
Yeah.

1066
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,593
And she,
at first she opens by thanking you for 

1067
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,284
coming and saying she's sarcastic.
Diversity of thought and people can 

1068
00:58:09,341 --> 00:58:11,860
watch it and we'll link to it below so 
people can actually watch the video.

1069
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,873
There's a weighing of sarcasm in it or,
or it was either sarcasm or she was 

1070
00:58:15,611 --> 00:58:17,710
trying to butter you up before she went 
to kill.

1071
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,753
Uh,
can you explain the rest of what 

1072
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:20,641
happened there?
So that,

1073
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:20,910
I don't know.

1074
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,710
Yeah.
Then edit it.

1075
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,633
She said I'm falsely accused the Muslim 
Students Association of being a front 

1076
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:32,610
for the Muslim Brotherhood,
which it is and Hamas.

1077
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,080
So,
and,

1078
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,580
and we had distributed a pamphlet 
showing this.

1079
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,100
Um,
so I,

1080
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:47,120
instead of arguing whether about whether
the Muslim Students Association students

1081
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:49,740
for Justice in Palestine,
they're both amongst friends,

1082
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,360
Brotherhood Fronts A.
instead of arguing with her,

1083
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:56,820
I just decided to cut to the chase.
I said,

1084
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:59,700
will you condemn a Mohs as a terrorist 
organization?

1085
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:01,820
And she said,
uh,

1086
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,510
you want to crucify me company?
Oh,

1087
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,610
I don't know how I respond to coming in.
And she said,

1088
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,444
well,
if I don't condemn Hamas then I will be 

1089
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:15,210
arrested by the Department of Homeland 
Security.

1090
00:59:15,211 --> 00:59:19,850
This is how delusional these people are.
So I changed the question.

1091
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,600
I had done this at other.
So I knew what to expect.

1092
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,270
I said,
let me put it to you this way.

1093
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,104
I'm a Jew and the head of his bullet 
says he wants us choose to gather in 

1094
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:31,394
Israel.
So he won't have to hunt us down 

1095
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,343
globally for it or against it.
She leaned into the microphone and said 

1096
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:38,143
for it,
and she was dependent afterwards by the 

1097
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,883
Muslim Students Association.
A whole left.

1098
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,290
Hey genocidal.
They want to kill the Jews.

1099
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:48,723
When she said that,
I suspect you were not shocked as 

1100
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:53,110
insanely shocking as that sounds.

1101
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,670
No,
because I had it at UC Santa Barbara.

1102
00:59:56,671 --> 00:59:57,504
I asked the same question of the head of
the Muslim Students Association when he 

1103
01:00:00,961 --> 01:00:03,420
said it was too complicated a question 
for a yes.

1104
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:04,820
No answer.
Right?

1105
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,510
Genocides.
Too complicated.

1106
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:09,410
He was smarter than she was.
Hers was just like,

1107
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:12,390
hers was just showing you what they 
think and what they want.

1108
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,651
So.
All right,

1109
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,640
so let's,
let's shift

1110
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,160
to Islam then.

1111
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,383
I,
I've been talking about it and I've 

1112
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,940
tried to bring on.
I brought on liberals to talk about it.

1113
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,900
I've had,
you know,

1114
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,990
very measured people like Sam Harris,
quote pupils.

1115
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:27,973
I've had ion Hirsi Ali on who talks 
about her own personal enemies on the 

1116
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:34,420
left.
People who are at my new eyes,

1117
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,330
who's a Muslim,
you know,

1118
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,760
is still a leftist liberal.
Yeah,

1119
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:39,620
he's a,
he's a liberal,

1120
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:40,454
he's a liberal.
Whether that I don't want to speak for 

1121
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:44,030
him,
I don't get into any extra trouble.

1122
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,500
Um,
but I've had.

1123
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:46,334
My point is that I've had plenty of 
people thought of as liberals or on the 

1124
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:51,080
left discuss it.
They get hate from the left.

1125
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,590
Then I've had people more on the right 
talk about it,

1126
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:55,424
such as Lauren Southern and Ben Shapiro 
and some others that of course they're 

1127
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,920
going to get a certain amount of hate 
for it.

1128
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:05,300
How do you gauge how much of a problem 
this actually is

1129
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,233
at the moment?
The problem being the problem being 

1130
01:01:09,271 --> 01:01:10,230
Islamic extremism

1131
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,413
where God or whatever you call it,
I think Islam is a problem and no 

1132
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:21,640
rational person could not look at Islam 
and say it's not a problematic religion.

1133
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,730
It preaches hatred against all other 
religions.

1134
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,080
It's sanctions.
There's just a series of quotes from the

1135
01:01:29,081 --> 01:01:33,970
Korean sanctions where they're beheading
infidels,

1136
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,833
which is what we are.
I'm the Prophet Mohammed has has said 

1137
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:39,454
that the day of judgment will only come 
when the Muslims fight the Jews and 

1138
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:45,634
killed them when the Jews behind the 
rocks and the trees and the rocks and 

1139
01:01:49,631 --> 01:01:50,770
the trees cry out.
Oh,

1140
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,020
Muslim descent.
You hiding behind me.

1141
01:01:53,021 --> 01:01:54,180
Come and kill it.
Yeah.

1142
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,710
Talk.
Not only.

1143
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,433
Yeah,

1144
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:02,170
by organized Islam.
Uh,

1145
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,920
but it's repeated use of our Kara 
doorway.

1146
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,843
I'm set as much.
The Holocaust was a punishment and on 

1147
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:16,840
Gypson TV and he is the [inaudible],
the leading man.

1148
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:22,100
Not only put the bustle of brotherhood,
but for whom Aberdeen,

1149
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,270
Hillary's righthand.
That's her man.

1150
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:29,730
That the Holocaust was God's punishment 
of the Jews for their corruption.

1151
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,700
And it will come again.
Uh,

1152
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:33,534
this time,
Allah willing at the hands of the 

1153
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:39,660
believers is a genocidal.
Nancy is Garrett Dally,

1154
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,840
and he's the image of Hillary Clinton's 
right hand and deputy,

1155
01:02:43,841 --> 01:02:46,470
but in charge of bustle of affairs for 
the State Department.

1156
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,870
Yeah,
it's a big problem.

1157
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,340
Not a little one.
Yeah.

1158
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,190
So Keith Ellison is the Muslim 
Brotherhood.

1159
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:58,170
A candidate is now the number two guy in
the Democratic Party,

1160
01:02:58,171 --> 01:02:59,004
only missed by 13 boats.
How could the Democratic Party embraced 

1161
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,810
this?
And Tom Perez is no better,

1162
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,540
but at least that'll.
Allison has an open record,

1163
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,980
uh,
but you know,

1164
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:09,220
uh,
uh,

1165
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,130
being in bed with the Muslim 
Brotherhood,

1166
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,550
being supported by them and being a 
Farah can,

1167
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:17,790
Jew hater and America Hainer and white 
hater.

1168
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,850
I'm on what happened to the Democratic 
Party.

1169
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,733
Yeah,
I mean in America and stuff is amazing 

1170
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:24,650
because even in the last couple of days,
I don't follow,

1171
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,800
fabricate,
verified Milo's not on twitter anymore,

1172
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:28,873
but I was looking at fire cannons,
twitter feed or something got retweeted 

1173
01:03:31,161 --> 01:03:32,510
into my feed.
I mean,

1174
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:36,360
it's all God will destroy America.
Haydel the Jews hate white people

1175
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,760
for 11 years.
The spokesman for the nation of Islam.

1176
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,733
And you know,
people have to repudiate what they did 

1177
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:45,161
that,
this is,

1178
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:48,040
this is why I say Barack Obama is a 
communist.

1179
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,690
He was raised by communists.
He,

1180
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:51,723
his whole political career until he 
became United States senator was in the 

1181
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:57,430
Communists,
left.

1182
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:58,720
Uh,
I mean,

1183
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,890
I know these people.
Um,

1184
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:05,290
if you are a part of a movement that you
know is evil,

1185
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,140
the first thing you want to do is warn 
other people about it,

1186
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,063
especially when it's so deceptive.
It talks about social justice and all 

1187
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:15,900
this crap anyway.
No,

1188
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:17,230
well,
I mean he hasn't.

1189
01:04:17,231 --> 01:04:19,840
So that's how you know what his 
allegiances are.

1190
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:20,973
And when you asked me about the,
this was earlier in our conversation 

1191
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,033
about why,
why is the Democratic Party so soft on 

1192
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:31,174
Islamic terrorists?
There are people of color that has to 

1193
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:40,150
play a big role.
The first thing you do is all we have to

1194
01:04:40,151 --> 01:04:44,260
understand if they're killing people,
it must be because we did something

1195
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,940
very sick.
Yeah.

1196
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:51,280
What is that self flagellation that so 
many people in the West have guilt.

1197
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:54,410
I mean,
steel is really guilty of success

1198
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,750
has written a whole book called white 
guilt.

1199
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:59,460
Yeah.
It'll bring down our,

1200
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:03,980
our great civilization if it's the,
you know,

1201
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,530
and we haven't talked about Donald 
Trump.

1202
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,070
Yeah.
Objective my book.

1203
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:08,581
Yeah.
Okay.

1204
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:10,030
So let's,
I think is,

1205
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,630
I think if we have an antidote,
he's,

1206
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:13,503
is it?
So you really believe that that trump 

1207
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,070
and that,
you know,

1208
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:17,980
was gonna say a second

1209
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,810
ago when you were talking about,
you know,

1210
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,630
fighting the roots of Islamic extremism.
I mean,

1211
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,710
Bannon,
from what I understand,

1212
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,720
seems to be the architect of that.
That is a good guy.

1213
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,920
Steve Bennett.
Yeah.

1214
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:35,860
So you don't believe him to be an anti 
Semite though.

1215
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,510
First of all,
the chief evidence,

1216
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:38,344
there's evidence given that Steve Bannon
is an anti Semite one is a disgruntled 

1217
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:45,980
wife in the middle of a divorce 
proceeding,

1218
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:50,800
a custody case who said who claim that 
he said that Jewish children are whiny,

1219
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:53,200
which melt way.
Well,

1220
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:55,240
be the case of,
you know,

1221
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:56,403
the whole ritual of Bar Mitzvahs you 
shower a 13 year old with tons of money 

1222
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,330
and give them an audience of adults.
Okay.

1223
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:07,170
So they might be allowed to deal with.
They might be whining,

1224
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,340
right?
Um,

1225
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,130
but that's certainly not true.
Waiting,

1226
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,140
right?
Regardless,

1227
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,410
even if even if it did,
that's not,

1228
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,780
you'd have a big deal.

1229
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,103
His wife that over the kids and when 
they go to school and maybe the school 

1230
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:26,830
was very expensive.
There's an expensive school.

1231
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,053
The archer school,
the other evidence is an article that I 

1232
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:34,480
wrote.
I gave the title tooth bill,

1233
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:37,570
Kristol,
Republican spoiler,

1234
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,930
renegade Jew,
so people who haven't read your.

1235
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:43,780
I read the article,
I did not find anything and he's no read

1236
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,633
a gay because he,
he's going to return Houma Aberdeen and 

1237
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:51,310
Ben Rhodes,
who was the architect,

1238
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,163
uh,
one of the architects of the Iran deal 

1239
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,300
back to power.
It's a death knell for Israel.

1240
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,290
I mean,
what they've done,

1241
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,983
and not to mention the United I ran 
isn't powerful enough to destroy the 

1242
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,390
United States,
but it's leaders do chant,

1243
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,370
lead,
chance of death to America.

1244
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:10,204
That's what they believe.
Why if Franklin Roosevelt gave nuclear 

1245
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,090
weapons to Hitler,
what will we call them?

1246
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,463
Obama is an American trader and that's 
because he's a communist and always has 

1247
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:23,290
been and always will be.

1248
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,760
So I know enough people are going to 
watch it and go,

1249
01:07:24,761 --> 01:07:25,594
wait a minute,
but the deal says that they can't get 

1250
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:27,341
new,
but you would say,

1251
01:07:27,341 --> 01:07:30,390
well,
it expires one.

1252
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,080
It expires to the effect of the deal was
to lift the sanctions,

1253
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,840
bring a ran back into the community of 
nations.

1254
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:41,260
He gave them $200,
billion dollars,

1255
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,750
$200,
billion.

1256
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,780
100.
I forget all the payments and there's no

1257
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:50,410
controls.
But even if there were controls,

1258
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:52,540
why would you bring them out of 
isolation?

1259
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,640
Now?
Ran is running over the Middle East.

1260
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:55,923
They overthrew the government in Yemen,
which is why we now are losing American 

1261
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,440
lives,
their mind.

1262
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,790
Anyway.
So if some of the.

1263
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,700
So that's why I sought that crystal and 
I didn't attack crystal during,

1264
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,920
during the campaign,
you know,

1265
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,660
look,
I,

1266
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,700
you know,
I can see Donald trump.

1267
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:18,850
I can see why he upset some people.
Yeah,

1268
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,400
I can see how in my view they're 
exaggerated,

1269
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,470
you know,
the whatever,

1270
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:26,050
the fears that I,
you know,

1271
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:31,060
I don't think it per second that he's 
anti Mexican or a bigoted in any way.

1272
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,450
Um,
and it,

1273
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:33,601
you know,
and I'm,

1274
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:34,970
I'm one of those people that says,
well,

1275
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:37,070
like he's been in public life for 30 
years.

1276
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,083
He didn't become a racist and until he 
was running against a Democrat for 

1277
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:43,480
crying out tears,
uh,

1278
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:44,330
I,
so I,

1279
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:45,283
but I,
I could see a lot of people would get 

1280
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:52,580
bent out of shape during the campaign,
but once he's the nominee,

1281
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:56,180
then it's him or hillary.
And if it's Hillary,

1282
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:58,280
it's whom I aberdeen.
I mean it's,

1283
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,010
you know,
the whole anti Israel crew.

1284
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,430
So you can sympathize then with bill.
Crystal is intense.

1285
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,740
So Bill Kristol,
who wanted conservatism,

1286
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:07,574
Ole,
you know,

1287
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,960
what's thought of as relied real 
conservative.

1288
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,623
These are,
these are people treating politics as a 

1289
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:15,454
religion.
Yeah,

1290
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,453
if you don't refer to the United States 
is a constitutional republic 

1291
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:23,480
conservative if you don't use the phrase
limited government,

1292
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,700
limited government.
He never said that,

1293
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,850
that I know what he's doing now.

1294
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,340
I mean,
he's cutting the government and a big.

1295
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,550
So there'll be.
I mean,

1296
01:09:34,551 --> 01:09:37,100
it's just crazy.
He won me over this way.

1297
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:38,263
I mean,
I was nervous about him through the 

1298
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:41,380
campaign because you don't know,
uh,

1299
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,150
you know,
this is his first venture into politics.

1300
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:47,570
I don't know.
I'm not nervous about him anymore,

1301
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:49,820
although I think he'll disappoint me on 
some things,

1302
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:54,050
but he won me over in the first debate.
Here's a guy,

1303
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,850
he's never been a political candidate 
before,

1304
01:09:59,130 --> 01:09:59,963
is on a platform with a 12 of the top 
Republicans in the country is in front 

1305
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:07,394
of.
I don't remember if it's 30 million 

1306
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,033
people or whatever it is and the front 
and he gets the first question because 

1307
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:17,180
he has the highest percentage in the 
polls and it's not a question.

1308
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:22,181
It's an attack from a beggar and Kelly,
you called women fat pigs,

1309
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:25,700
slobs and dogs,
and he says,

1310
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,320
oh,
that was just rosie o'donnell.

1311
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:29,090
I said,
this guy is a guy.

1312
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:34,210
They can intimidate because political 
correctness is a party line.

1313
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,040
As I said,
it comes from now,

1314
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:40,220
let's say like a Communist Party line.
It shuts you up.

1315
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,923
There is no other Republican under the 
sun who on national TV this time in 

1316
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:50,300
front of 50 million people would elect 
Hillary Clinton in the eye and said,

1317
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:53,660
you're a liar and a crook even though 
she's both.

1318
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,210
If it were a male,
they would say it.

1319
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,613
Why?
Because because there's this gigantic 

1320
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:01,094
double standard,
it's politically incorrect to say 

1321
01:11:05,151 --> 01:11:08,570
anything critical about a woman.
This is ridiculous.

1322
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:11,210
If that's the case,
they shouldn't be in politics.

1323
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,960
Now I've left.
We'll just take that phrase,

1324
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,960
but you can't be protected and at the 
same time pretend to be strong.

1325
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:19,973
You know,
it's interesting how pernicious some of 

1326
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:22,650
this stuff is because I'll even see 
sometimes if if a,

1327
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:23,543
if a man attacked me on twitter,
not that twitter fights are that 

1328
01:11:25,711 --> 01:11:26,544
important,
but I'll immediately defend myself and 

1329
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:28,734
come back and I've had a few instances 
where women have and I've just ignored 

1330
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:34,470
it because I don't want to attack a 
woman and I know that's my own.

1331
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:39,700
Then that's just my own reflection of 
what we've all been schooled in that and

1332
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:43,410
then there's penalties.
You have to think quickly about what the

1333
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,303
consequences are,
so that desire to punch back or to not 

1334
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:50,550
be held hostage by political correctness
or I said,

1335
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,780
would you argue that that is far more 
important than any of his political?

1336
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:58,100
Totally.
That's what I saw.

1337
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:01,050
Here's a guy who the Democrats can 
intimidate.

1338
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:04,110
Look,
I use this phrase in my speeches,

1339
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,650
whenever I see a Republican square off 
against the Democrat,

1340
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:11,610
it looks to me like Godzilla vs Bambi 
because the Republican,

1341
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,503
the Democrat is going to call the 
Republicans are racist or sexist or 

1342
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:16,734
homophobic and Islamophobic,
and the Republican will call the 

1343
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:23,850
Democrat a liberal who's going to win 
that argument.

1344
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:24,863
So this is a bulldozer or,
but I love the way they call trump a 

1345
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:30,930
blitzkrieg.
The Democrat blitzkrieg.

1346
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:34,200
Uh,
we have a tradition in this country.

1347
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:37,890
It's sacred to a democracy of a 
honeymoon for an incoming president.

1348
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,130
It says there's a peaceful transition of
power.

1349
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:41,964
It says we're all part of one community 
since we're going to see what you do 

1350
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:50,601
have that will free to criticize you.
And the remedy is the next election.

1351
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,600
Trump didn't get seven seconds,
he didn't get confirmation hearings.

1352
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:56,390
He got a witch hunt.
The,

1353
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:00,030
and this is another example of how 
political correctness works.

1354
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,990
A Jeff sessions,
I've known him for 20 years,

1355
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,323
and I've known a lot of senators,
one of a handful of the most decent 

1356
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:12,540
human decent human beings in the senate.
A champion of civil rights,

1357
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,733
this was an attorney general and the 
deep South say state who prosecuted the 

1358
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:21,180
Ku Klux Klan,
who desegregated the schools and there's

1359
01:13:21,181 --> 01:13:22,014
Elizabeth Warren calling him a racist 
and then violating Senate rules to 

1360
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:29,430
repeat calling him a racist,
and when she's told to shut up,

1361
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,110
they say,
oh,

1362
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,920
they're silencing another woman.

1363
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,900
Yeah.
I tell effect of political correctness.

1364
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:39,840
Is it just to be clear for people that 
they didn't follow that whole thing?

1365
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,793
She was reading other people's words,
which isn't technically allowed in the 

1366
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:44,604
sentence so that she was doing something
that she wasn't allowed to do by their 

1367
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:47,334
own rules exam.
Everyone turned it into a letter from 

1368
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,650
Coretta Scott King that she was 
repudiated.

1369
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:57,830
What happened was in Alabama there were,
there were three blacks who,

1370
01:13:58,820 --> 01:13:59,653
who's were defrauded of their voting 
rights because they were in opposition 

1371
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,680
to three other blacks who were NACP 
corrupt officials.

1372
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,023
That's the whole case and and a sessions
didn't know how to defend himself the 

1373
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,670
first time he was up in the eighties.
I mean,

1374
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:16,504
this is a thing.
Republicans are not used to fighting 

1375
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,460
back that you're used to getting out of 
the way.

1376
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,730
Why wouldn't you if people are calling 
you racist,

1377
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:25,750
sexist,
homophobic,

1378
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:30,440
so it's obvious to me that that stuff is
not working as much anymore.

1379
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,950
So then my last question,
given that that is amazing,

1380
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:35,420
right?
So the words aren't,

1381
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:36,283
but what I now think is we're going to 
see more violence because they've been 

1382
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:39,463
pinned into a corner where everyone that
they're against is a Nazi and a racist 

1383
01:14:42,231 --> 01:14:43,064
and all those things.
So I suspect we're going to see more 

1384
01:14:45,201 --> 01:14:48,650
violence.
But my last question to you is with this

1385
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:53,030
evolution with,
with now the first Republican,

1386
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:55,280
as you were saying with trump,
that's not going to take it.

1387
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,533
What's the good path now?
Like what if you could see something 

1388
01:15:00,231 --> 01:15:02,210
good coming out of these next couple of 
years?

1389
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,350
What is that path?

1390
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:05,953
No,
I am a Antonio Gramsci won't said that 

1391
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:16,850
the revolutionary for the revolutionary 
must have pessimism of the intellect and

1392
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:24,040
optimism of the will and I think he 
stole that from somebody or I can't.

1393
01:15:26,061 --> 01:15:28,010
I can't remember who,
but I think he did it.

1394
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,780
It's in wikipedia.
Well,

1395
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:32,740
if it's in Wikipedia,
but definitely stolen from somebody,

1396
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,140
I um,
yeah,

1397
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,250
I,
you know,

1398
01:15:37,251 --> 01:15:39,410
my head was telling me there's nothing 
is good.

1399
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:42,770
Is gonna come and you know,
and you can see,

1400
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:43,760
I mean,
there's so many,

1401
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,530
so many problems of,
you know,

1402
01:15:48,531 --> 01:15:49,780
as I pointed out in,
in,

1403
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:50,960
in my,
in my book,

1404
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:52,340
big agenda,
the left,

1405
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,040
the Democratic Party.
Uh,

1406
01:15:55,210 --> 01:16:00,210
it's a totalitarian party now.
It lied to get obamacare and lied about.

1407
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:03,560
You can keep your doctor lied about,
you can keep your plan.

1408
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,750
And it,
and its mission was control.

1409
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:11,380
It's a credible assault on individual 
freedom.

1410
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,930
The government tells you you have to 
have insurance.

1411
01:16:14,931 --> 01:16:16,910
The government tells you you have to 
have,

1412
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,820
you have,
what are they for packages.

1413
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,880
This is the kind of insurance you have 
to have.

1414
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:26,840
And the government gets all your health 
information.

1415
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,110
That is a totalitarian threat right 
there.

1416
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,870
But Republicans,
they're lame.

1417
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:38,350
Why aren't they saying that?
So replacing Obamacare is obviously,

1418
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,551
um,
you know,

1419
01:16:40,551 --> 01:16:41,384
as,
as we're speaking and Republicans are 

1420
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,050
all in disarray.
Um,

1421
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,593
I dunno,
I don't know what's going to happen of 

1422
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,133
trump is fairly isolated.
You have all these conservative idiots 

1423
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:56,690
like crystal,
um,

1424
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,083
and make mullen gunning for him.
A Republicans marched to the tune of 

1425
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:08,351
their own set of traumas all the time 
were individualist.

1426
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:10,243
I was amazed when the tea party came in 
and held a demonstration in Washington 

1427
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,553
before that you couldn't get three 
Republicans to march together because 

1428
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:20,830
they look at each other and say,
what are we collecting this?

1429
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:24,020
So does that.
Then Eric said it was the last question,

1430
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:25,670
but we'll keep going for a bit.
So there's that though.

1431
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:29,180
So when the tea party organized and the 
tea party was gaining momentum,

1432
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:32,330
everyone was saying there were these 
redneck back race,

1433
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:36,740
very decent people who cleaned up after 
themselves.

1434
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:40,640
That's just destructive.
Nobody was hurt.

1435
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,690
There was no violence.
Cops this,

1436
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,060
when people start referring to the left 
as fascists and not liberals,

1437
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,070
then I'll say,
okay,

1438
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,790
we're winning now.
Right now it isn't happening.

1439
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:54,680
They go on.
They,

1440
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:55,790
like I say,
I mean,

1441
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:58,620
it's corrupted our culture.
It's corrupted our schools.

1442
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,520
Uh,
I just very,

1443
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:03,740
very bad.
But I think,

1444
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:05,031
you know,
I,

1445
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:05,864
I,
my faith isn't Steve Bannon and Stephen 

1446
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:08,743
Miller.
These are two fighters and trump and 

1447
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:15,290
trump understands instinctively that 
when you get attacked,

1448
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,990
you attack back and throw them off.
Well,

1449
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,540
I,
I have this phrase that I,

1450
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,810
I picked up from Chris Lehane is a 
democratic,

1451
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:24,703
uh,
was in the New York Times article about 

1452
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:29,360
him,
a democratic strategists,

1453
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:32,360
but he,
he stole it from Mike Tyson,

1454
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:37,490
which is everybody has a game plan until
you punch them in the mouth.

1455
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:39,403
And the Democrats have a massive punch 
in the mouth for Republicans calling 

1456
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:47,111
them racists and Republicans at the 
Comeback and Democrats.

1457
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,900
The Democratic Party is the party of 
racism.

1458
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,700
It's the party of racial categories.
It's the party of identity politics.

1459
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:59,870
It's the party of the inner cities.
It is a racist party.

1460
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:02,220
It is also,
and I loved this,

1461
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,080
but what trump said in the was in the 
second debate,

1462
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:07,543
he turned to the cameras and said,
you have to understand Hillary has 

1463
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:11,714
tremendous hatred in her heart.
And what he was referring to was the 

1464
01:19:15,921 --> 01:19:18,200
basket of deplorables,
which he named.

1465
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:21,860
She identified all of her opponents or 
whatever.

1466
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:23,390
Half it was.
The same thing,

1467
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,390
um,
are racist,

1468
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:27,860
sexist,
homophobes,

1469
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:29,540
Islamophobes.
Xenophobes,

1470
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:30,374
you name it and he's raised them up.
There isn't a conservative or a 

1471
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,253
deviating liberal who hasn't been in an 
argument with a so called liberal who 

1472
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:44,780
hasn't been called a racist or sexist or
homophobic to in a way that was a gift.

1473
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:48,230
The Democratic Party is a party of hate.
That's what they run on.

1474
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,633
Everything they're doing now is,
is hate invent conspiracy theories with 

1475
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:58,700
the Russians.
I mean this from a party who's candidate

1476
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,720
turned over 20 percent of America's 
uranium reserves that are Russians.

1477
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:05,360
I mean,
how do you deal with that?

1478
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:09,000
The only way and politics.
You have a nine second soundbite.

1479
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,160
Just go for the juggler.

1480
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,350
Well,
I hope I don't want you.

1481
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:15,000
I,
I like your style.

1482
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,420
I want to see if we can convert people 
at way.

1483
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,190
Yeah.
Well I think interesting,

1484
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,080
isn't it?
I think interestingly,

1485
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:25,580
people or can be converted on both sides
because I think what's happening is I,

1486
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:26,623
I know for sure that I've helped a lot 
of progressives realized what true 

1487
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:30,714
liberalism is and at the same time I 
think I've had and I know that I've 

1488
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:34,973
gotten a lot of more conservative people
to realize that not all liberals are 

1489
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:39,384
bad.
And I think that's where most of us 

1490
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:42,600
actually are.
That's good.

1491
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:44,250
I don't want to take anything away from 
you,

1492
01:20:44,251 --> 01:20:45,750
but I,
I found

1493
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,633
when I came into the right,
I conservatives are generally very 

1494
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:54,221
decent people.
And when I criticize the religious right

1495
01:20:54,921 --> 01:20:55,754
leadership,
I had different reactions from things 

1496
01:20:58,641 --> 01:21:02,180
like the Family Research Council.
I had people in my face,

1497
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:08,250
blood vessels popping screaming at me.
Um,

1498
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:10,250
and I had people who were very 
supportive,

1499
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:11,430
very Christian,
uh,

1500
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,793
and that way.
And I also had this experience in the 

1501
01:21:15,441 --> 01:21:18,080
2008.
I was at the moral majority,

1502
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:19,843
uh,
Ralph Reed and invited me to come down 

1503
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:25,390
to Atlanta.
And the woman who,

1504
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,720
who was my connection there and a moral 
majority member,

1505
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:30,800
I asked her,
I said,

1506
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:33,140
well,
if John McCain gets the nomination,

1507
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:34,490
will you vote for him?
And she said,

1508
01:21:34,491 --> 01:21:35,324
yeah.

1509
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,550
So you know,
people that what the,

1510
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:39,384
what the religious right needs to 
understand is that there's religion and 

1511
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:42,783
there's politics and religion is about 
saving your immortal soul and if you 

1512
01:21:47,831 --> 01:21:51,370
mess with the devil you in danger it and
politics,

1513
01:21:51,371 --> 01:21:53,110
you make pacts with the devil all the 
time.

1514
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,513
It's about getting into office and 
trying to practically changed some 

1515
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,374
things.
And one thing that I wanted to talk yes 

1516
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:04,070
to talk to you about that I just 
remembered it.

1517
01:22:04,071 --> 01:22:05,550
The home studio so we can keep going.
Yeah,

1518
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,640
you go ahead.
Go ahead.

1519
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:11,100
Is this um,
why is the,

1520
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:14,620
why is the left and now so called 
liberalism?

1521
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:20,180
Why are progressive totalitarians?
And the answer is that they,

1522
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,220
it's,
it's a crypto.

1523
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:25,173
Religious ideology.
It's modeled on Christianity in the 

1524
01:22:32,241 --> 01:22:34,910
world is a fallen place so that he never
used that.

1525
01:22:34,911 --> 01:22:39,230
The world is an oppressive place.
It's injustice rules.

1526
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,760
But there will be a redemption and we 
are the redeemer's.

1527
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:48,500
That's the danger we have to re and they
use it all the time.

1528
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:52,610
We have to remake humanity so it fits 
our model of the redemption.

1529
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,300
That's why they're so,
so if only Bernie was in,

1530
01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:00,320
we have to outlaw.
We have to stamp out racist,

1531
01:23:00,321 --> 01:23:03,680
sexist,
homophobic people who we disagree with.

1532
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,790
Milo,
we can let him speak.

1533
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:09,893
That is what is the only difference 
between that and an actual totalitarian 

1534
01:23:14,361 --> 01:23:17,330
state is if they had the power,
they would execute my law.

1535
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:20,540
It'd be in a gulag or he'd be dead.
Do you remember?

1536
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:21,374
There was a line a couple of years ago 
that oprah who and I basically like 

1537
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:26,090
Oprah and respect are open and I'd be 
happy to run the show.

1538
01:23:26,091 --> 01:23:26,924
Of course when she was talking about the
older generation and some of their 

1539
01:23:30,321 --> 01:23:31,880
backwards ways,
Vega and she said,

1540
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:32,300
well,
we just,

1541
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,730
they just have to die.
I remember thinking like,

1542
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:38,130
even if what you're saying that yes,
there might be,

1543
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:38,964
you know,
studies show that younger people are 

1544
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:42,710
generally more liberal on the social 
issue,

1545
01:23:42,711 --> 01:23:43,570
not more liberal.
They'll,

1546
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,980
right.
The older blacks are liberal.

1547
01:23:45,981 --> 01:23:49,540
That's why Oprah doesn't like them that 
so well,

1548
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,320
that sort of fits everything else that 
you're saying,

1549
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,360
but.
But my point being that when she said,

1550
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,400
it sounds so nice to me because one day 
if you just,

1551
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:58,580
if you take that logic to its end,
guess what?

1552
01:23:58,581 --> 01:23:59,414
One day the young people are gonna want 
all of you did when you're old because 

1553
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:04,880
it just will.
It'll just keep going.

1554
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,250
Can't try to make sense out of it.
But it is,

1555
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:08,084
it's the reverse.
It's the actually the reverse 

1556
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,000
shareholder.
Blacks

1557
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:16,310
I know as racist,
as younger blacks,

1558
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:17,653
racism is pervasive now.
I mean this is a very politically 

1559
01:24:21,231 --> 01:24:25,330
incorrect to say,
but I think it's pretty obvious racist,

1560
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,413
pervasive racism is pervasive in the 
black community and especially among 

1561
01:24:30,021 --> 01:24:30,854
younger people who've been to schools 
and told that their all their problems 

1562
01:24:35,091 --> 01:24:38,390
come from white racist.
Very bad.

1563
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:39,703
You know,

1564
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:43,960
the fifties were much better times in 
this country.

1565
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:44,943
So I think I only got a half answer then
before you said my head doesn't have a 

1566
01:24:48,371 --> 01:24:50,710
lot of hope.
Something to that effect about Roger.

1567
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,780
But what about you?
Well,

1568
01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:55,750
I'm,
I'm an optimist by genes.

1569
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,210
I don't know.

1570
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:57,043
Wow.
I am.

1571
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,850
I just am.
I,

1572
01:24:58,851 --> 01:25:02,390
you know,
I phrased it in a book I wrote.

1573
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:03,653
I,
when my head is in conflict with my 

1574
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:07,370
heart,
I followed my heart,

1575
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:12,610
so I'm going to fight so I drop as long.
There's going to be a positive outcome.

1576
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,880
But um,
you know,

1577
01:25:16,881 --> 01:25:18,920
there's that.
What was his name?

1578
01:25:18,921 --> 01:25:23,921
Skipio Africanness was a Roman general 
who burned carthage.

1579
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:29,330
And when he saw carthage going up in 
smoke,

1580
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:35,200
he wept because the classical view was 
that,

1581
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:39,220
oh,
it's all cyclical empires rise and fall,

1582
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,083
societies rise and fall.
And this idea of progress is one of the 

1583
01:25:44,121 --> 01:25:48,290
really bad ideas that the Jews gave to 
us.

1584
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,630
The idea,
what is the promise land,

1585
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:54,620
although maybe Moses didn't beat it in a
way that left this meeting,

1586
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:58,640
but that idea of a progress is the 
problem.

1587
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:03,140
Can't redeem the world,
can't be fixed.

1588
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,003
Why can't the world be fixed?
Because the root source of all social 

1589
01:26:08,211 --> 01:26:13,211
problems is us individuals.
So you can maybe,

1590
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,500
you know,
it's,

1591
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,333
it's very hard to take one individual 
who's gone off the day band and bring 

1592
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:21,110
them back.
Yeah.

1593
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,570
But you know,
modest.

1594
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:24,291
It's,
you know,

1595
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:27,530
and this is the oldest thing as the 
voltaire 10 year old garden.

1596
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:32,240
You can make the space around.
You may be a little bit more humane.

1597
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:36,830
You can help an individual,
but you can't change the world.

1598
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,610
Well,
on that note I sent,

1599
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,380
we could do a lot more,
so we'll have to do this again.

1600
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,520
Okay.
We'll see.

1601
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:43,383
Maybe we'll do this.
How about we do this one year from now 

1602
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:49,500
and we'll see if I've incorporated 
optimist.

1603
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:52,290
I'm an optimist.
I can't.

1604
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:54,940
No,
I'm old enough to know that,

1605
01:26:54,941 --> 01:26:57,310
that,
that will be a blessing.

1606
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:59,380
You're 78 years old.
How do you look?

1607
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,214
So good.

1608
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:01,723
Your makeup,

1609
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,080
that's all the makeup.
No,

1610
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:05,260
I saw you when you walk in and come on.
What's the trick?

1611
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:06,983
No,
no.

1612
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,520
I have a great marriage.
Wonderful Wife.

1613
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,943
Um,
I tried to balance the political with 

1614
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,350
you.
Real,

1615
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:20,270
real life stuff.
My animals.

1616
01:27:20,271 --> 01:27:23,330
I have all these dogs I love.
Um,

1617
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,910
yeah.
I don't know.

1618
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,380
And it's also in the genes.

1619
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,870
All right.
One year from now we will do it again.

1620
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:34,230
