1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,620
We're going to be talking about 
marijuana this week.

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,990
I'll give you guys just a sec to roll a 
joint,

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,630
pack a bowl or put fresh water in the 
bond.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,793
Of course,
those are just a couple of the old 

5
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,420
school ways of getting stone these days.
It also includes vaping,

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,790
waxes,
edibles and oils.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,923
I should tell you,
I've tried all of them a couple times 

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,384
each to cure this darn glaucoma.
I diagnosed myself with back in high 

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,340
school.
I still have been being cured,

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:30,480
but there is always hope before we get 
into a big discussion about marijuana,

11
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,670
meaning legalization,
health benefits,

12
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,170
recreational use,
and more.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,550
It's only fair if I tell you guys a bit 
about my history with weed.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,713
After smoking,
my first joint during Sophomore Year of 

15
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:42,324
college for a couple of years,
I was probably what most would consider 

16
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,910
a pothead.
I'd get stoned and watch TV,

17
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:50,550
right,
or go grocery shopping and gathering all

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,020
the best snacks I could get ahold of.

19
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,303
I should note I never got into a fight,
robbed a bank or murdered anyone while 

20
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,790
smoking weed.
After College.

21
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,624
I smoke now and again,
usually while just hanging out with 

22
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:05,970
friends,
despite the marijuana raging through our

23
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,060
systems,
we also seem to never get into a fight.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,923
Rob a bank or murder anyone since moving
to la where medicinal marijuana is 

25
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,080
legal,
at least on the state level.

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,410
I got my med card and I smoke every 
couple weeks.

27
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,244
Usually I enjoy a nice bowl at the end 
of a long day when I just want to veg 

28
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:23,814
out and watch Seinfeld or the simpsons 
and to this day I haven't gotten into a 

29
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,854
fight,
robbed a bank or murdered anyone while 

30
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,810
smoking weed.
When it comes to marijuana,

31
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:34,644
I'm a libertarian through and through 
what I do with my own body in my own 

32
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:42,570
house is nobody else's business,
much less the government.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,420
As long as I'm not doing harm to another
person,

34
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,960
then I have the right to do as I wish.
As a citizen.

35
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,980
This is a place where libertarianism 
makes absolute sense to me.

36
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,843
We don't even have to get into the 
health benefits or the dangers of other 

37
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,924
currently legal drugs.
The liberal argument for weed is pretty 

38
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,460
good too,
which basically is.

39
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,670
It's not doing any real damage,
so you should be able to smoke it.

40
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,504
Plus we're putting too many people in 
jail for partaking in a drug that 

41
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:11,430
generally doesn't lead to criminal 
behavior.

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,773
This is a case where libertarians and 
classical liberals take on something 

43
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,170
really lines up.
On the other hand,

44
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,800
conservatives in the US have generally 
been against marijuana.

45
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,693
They call it a gateway drug,
which is pretty much like calling 

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,323
Gerber's a gateway.
Food conservatives have scared people 

47
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,224
into thinking that marijuana will make 
you a criminal or degenerate and they 

48
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:35,844
don't mind wasting your taxpayer money,
locking up people for a personal choice 

49
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,180
that they do with their own bodies.

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,403
There are some conservatives who even 
now with all we know about the multiple 

51
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:51,531
benefits of marijuana are still against 
legalizing even at a medicinal level.

52
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,930
Ironically,
it's conservatives who also preach about

53
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:55,764
small government.
Yet they seem to want to regulate what 

54
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:58,764
you do in the privacy of your own home,
while at the same time wasting taxpayer 

55
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,304
dollars,
which they say they want to save on 

56
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,570
trumped up criminal charges.
Of course,

57
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,404
none of these examples are perfect,
which is why ran Paul Libertarian still 

58
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,490
hasn't fully come around on the 
marijuana issue and Hillary Clinton,

59
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,620
a Democrat hasn't either.
Meanwhile,

60
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:20,830
the Republican candidates are all 
against it in one form or another,

61
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,664
despite the fact that the only tolerable
way to watch a republican debate is 

62
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,863
milestone.
The one candidate who I do think 

63
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,534
understands the issue is Bernie Sanders,
who wants to decriminalize marijuana at 

64
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,270
the federal level.
Ironically,

65
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,104
in this incidence,
it's the big government guy who is 

66
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,164
making the government smaller by getting
them out of your private life and not 

67
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,480
putting you in jail for having a good 
time.

68
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,720
If you are sick with cancer or with 
Parkinson's,

69
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,554
why should the government or any other 
human being be able to stop you from 

70
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,400
doing anything that would alleviate your
pain and suffering?

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,713
If you get caught with marijuana,
should you have your life ruined by 

72
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,194
being thrown in a federal jail?
If you get really high and watched the 

73
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,260
wizard of Oz with dark side of the moon,
playing in the background doesn't really

74
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:06,094
sync up.
These are just some of the important 

75
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,210
questions that talking about weed brings
up.

76
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,620
My guest this week is Angel Tieger 
Angeles,

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,473
part of the Los Angeles medical cannabis
taskforce and owns her own edibles 

78
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:18,160
company,
Ruby Doobie.

79
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,220
She got involved with marijuana after 
Western medicine,

80
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,400
failed to help her with her debilitating
migraines.

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,760
Angel now speaks about the medicinal 
benefits of marijuana,

82
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,594
the ongoing quest for legalization and 
removing the stigma attached to the 

83
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,214
conversation.
Some of you have probably heard me tell 

84
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:35,974
the story of how in 1997 I went to see 
the movie Air Force One after eating 

85
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,560
some pot brownies with a couple of 
friends.

86
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,613
The movie was sold out,
so we walked into another movie called 

87
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,840
contact,
which I had never heard of.

88
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,203
Remember that incredibly mindblowing,
extended panorama of the universe that 

89
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,270
opens the movie.
Well,

90
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,990
it may sound Corny,
but my world actually felt bigger.

91
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:56,824
After seeing that movie stoned,
I ended up reading many of the books by 

92
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:01,264
Carl Sagan,
who is the author of contact and 

93
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,110
brilliant scientists.
After seeing that movie,

94
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,303
that stoned moment opened up something 
in me that got me interested in many of 

95
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:13,930
the ideas that I talk about today.
Maybe it would have happened without the

96
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,280
weed,
but it sure didn't hurt.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,833
That also reminds me,
I'd love to tell you about the week I 

98
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,350
spent in the red light district in 
Amsterdam a couple of years ago.

99
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,760
I just can't remember any of it.

100
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,300
Angel Tieger is a speaker and activist 
and an entrepreneur.

101
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,163
She works with the La Cannabis medical 
task force and runs her own cannabis 

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,913
edibles company known as Ruby Doobie and
we've got a lot of Ruby doobie goodies 

103
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,460
in front of us right now.
Angel,

104
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,840
thanks for.
Thanks for joining me.

105
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,700
Thank you for inviting me.
Dave.

106
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,623
Yeah.
I'm very excited to talk to you because 

107
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:49,810
I've wanted to do something a little 
more in depth on pot for a long time.

108
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,063
And uh,
and you brought pot cookies and 

109
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,080
brownies.
Let's get into this stuff first and then

110
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,040
we'll talk about the history and 
legalization.

111
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:58,790
What,
what are we going

112
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,130
in front of some of the things that I 
make.

113
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,023
I'm sweet dreams Brownie.
It's a dusted with a little bit of sea 

114
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,470
salt on top.
It's about 57 milligrams here.

115
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,010
Okay.

116
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,510
Fifty seven milligrams of thc.
What does that mean?

117
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:14,010
So you,
you eat that.

118
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,203
How do you feel after?

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,353
Well,
I personally would not eat a whole 

120
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,244
Brownie.
I would have half and that's plenty for 

121
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:24,910
me,
but it really depends on your metabolism

122
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,050
and your,
your,

123
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,063
uh,
how experienced you are and it can 

124
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,110
differ on things depending on the day 
and on how much you've eaten that day.

125
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,730
But um,
and,

126
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,340
and dosage,
dosage guidelines.

127
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,360
Very,
you know,

128
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:41,194
I've seen a recommended dosages that 
between five and 15 milligrams for 

129
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,070
people or some who want between 20 and 
30

130
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,663
and this is all sort of unchartered 
territory for a lot of people because 

131
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,180
for a long time,
you know,

132
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,370
I,
I think I said once I,

133
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,223
the show,
when I got my weed card I went in there 

134
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,671
and I said,
you know,

135
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:00,200
they showed me wax.
They showed me oil.

136
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,790
They showed me edibles and I said,
well,

137
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,500
do you have any just weed,
you know,

138
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,510
green buds,
like old fashioned weed.

139
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,810
And that made me feel like,
oh,

140
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:07,141
like,
oh,

141
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:10,010
that guy wants to smoke weed,
but this is sort of the new thing,

142
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:10,340
right?

143
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,710
Well,
I mean,

144
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,653
you,
I think not as many people are familiar 

145
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,600
with edibles,
but it's been around and um,

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,260
it's a great way to make use of the 
whole plant because really what,

147
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,530
when you smoke,
you're smoking the flowers,

148
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:28,240
the buds,
but you still have all of the leaves and

149
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,083
the trim and the small buds and all of 
that has you active ingredients in it 

150
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,844
too.
And that's primarily what I use to make 

151
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,470
my goodies.
And here's the peanut butter Brownie.

152
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,040
A ginger cookie crew is very excited by 
the way.

153
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,943
Oh,
I'm happy a ginger cookies and cream 

154
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,040
cookies and chocolate chip cookies.
And I make cakes and other things

155
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,953
to lemon bars.
So you make all this stuff and this is 

156
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:58,680
for people that may want the medicinal 
benefits.

157
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,020
This is for people that may want the 
recreational benefits.

158
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,850
A,
it doesn't matter to you,

159
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:03,684
right?
Like you're selling it for then and 

160
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:05,544
yeah,
it's nice if someone could alleviate 

161
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:07,584
some pain.

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,130
Well,
I worked with the dispensary's,

163
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:11,340
I worked with a handful of dispensaries 
in,

164
00:08:11,341 --> 00:08:13,170
in my area.
Um,

165
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,050
so I,
I'm,

166
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:15,884
I'm a member that's,
that's providing edibles for my fellow 

167
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,730
members.
Sure.

168
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,700
And um,
you know,

169
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,930
you can't really,
you can't in California,

170
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:26,764
you still have to get a doctor's 
recommendations even go to those 

171
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,683
dispensary's so it isn't tried and it's 
tough to make the distinction between 

172
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,570
what's recreate for,
in my mind,

173
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,523
it's,
it's tough to distinguish between a 

174
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,440
recreational and medicinal because if 
it's,

175
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,210
if you're using it to relax at the end 
of the day and um,

176
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,240
to,
to distress.

177
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,120
Yeah.
Um,

178
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,023
all right,
so let's get a little bit into your 

179
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:04,310
story and then we'll talk about business
and legalization and all that shit.

180
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,010
So you got into,
we'd basically,

181
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,840
I think you were smoking it 
recreationally,

182
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,674
but the reason you really got into this 
was because you were having migraines 

183
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:15,460
and pretty much the western medicine 
that you were trying

184
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,570
wasn't working,
right?

185
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,563
Yes,
but I,

186
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,403
I think there were two forces that kind 
of a both intersected in and drove me 

187
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:27,040
into cannabis and definitely my 
migraines.

188
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,640
Um,
I,

189
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,033
I've had migraines for many,
many years and about 10 years ago they 

190
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:36,850
started getting a lot worse and more 
frequent and I was,

191
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:40,060
I'm trying all kinds of different 
medications.

192
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,350
I had,
um,

193
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,440
steroids injected into my nap to try to 
get rid of them.

194
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,573
I had some prescriptions that were so 
strong that they require the triplicate 

195
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,870
prescription and nothing helped me.
I mean a,

196
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,930
lots of times that the drugs would 
irritate my stomach so much that I would

197
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,283
feel worse sometimes they would just 
knock me out and that's how I survived 

198
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:08,620
my migraines.

199
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,740
And cannabis is really what allowed me 
to,

200
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,100
to continue living and manage them 
without having to check out for weeks at

201
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,620
a time or days at a time.
Um,

202
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,100
so that definitely treating my migraines
was one for us.

203
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:31,420
And also a desire to simplify my life.
You know,

204
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:32,254
I,
um,

205
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,620
I was working at the x prize foundation.
I was a chief of staff there and um,

206
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,000
you know,
very rewarding,

207
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,290
challenging position.
Um,

208
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,320
but I just felt that there was something
missing.

209
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,021
You know,
I,

210
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:53,021
I wasn't spending very much time with my
son who was two years old at the time,

211
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,050
uh,
I would have to travel a lot and um,

212
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I just wanted to create a change in my 
life where I would,

213
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,070
uh,
not be so dependent on,

214
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,710
on a check,
a grow,

215
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,230
grow my own food and Cook my own meals 
and,

216
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,920
and rather than pay someone to do this 
and that,

217
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,710
I wanted to do those things I wanted to 
be the one with,

218
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,270
with my family.
Right.

219
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,133
So that's really interesting.
So it wasn't just I want to get stoned 

220
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,720
and had the good time.
You got into the edible garden thing,

221
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:32,554
which was nice.
You were growing weed but you were also 

222
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,520
growing stuff to actually eat and to eat

223
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,080
your child.
We were growing and at one point we were

224
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:46,081
going enough food in our garden that it 
was too much for us to even eat.

225
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,313
I mean,
neighbors would come and we encouraged 

226
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:51,130
our neighbors to come and,
um,

227
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,290
tomatoes,
artichokes,

228
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,820
peppers,
eggplants,

229
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,430
a,
uh,

230
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,830
collared Greens,
Shard Kale.

231
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,300
I mean,
we still have,

232
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,081
you know,
lemon trees,

233
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,240
apple trees,
a nectarines,

234
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,250
oranges.
It's a beautiful thing to,

235
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,440
to just go outside and pick your food 
and you know,

236
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,413
you don't have to get in your car.
You can't get anything fresher than 

237
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,030
that.

238
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,721
Yeah,
it's funny.

239
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,351
I have,
I mean,

240
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:20,184
I live in La too and you know,
I have a little outdoor space with a 

241
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:25,290
little garden and even if I'm just 
plucking tomatoes or something,

242
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,300
I find that very therapeutic.
Oh,

243
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:32,010
it is just that action of doing,
of growing something for yourself,

244
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:35,540
whether it's marijuana or a tomato or 
pepper or something.

245
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,383
Even right there connecting with nature.
So this is all intertwined with 

246
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,190
ultimately you going into this business.

247
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,190
I believe so.
I mean,

248
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,050
it's wanting to simplify,
wanting to be more in touch with nature,

249
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,700
you know,
it's,

250
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,533
it's so easy to get disconnected from 
food and to know what food looks like 

251
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,820
when it's actually growing.
I mean,

252
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,650
um,
when I,

253
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,290
uh,
when we first planted our garden,

254
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:05,291
it was with the help of a nonprofit 
called La Green grounds and uh,

255
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,130
we had 50 volunteers come out and help 
us plant our front yard and our parkways

256
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,473
and um,
I was intimidated because I had never 

257
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,063
tried to grow food before and I didn't 
know how it all worked and it's never 

258
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:28,481
put my hands in the dirt and planted 
anything and to watch things grow and to

259
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,690
be able to feed my family that way and,
and help,

260
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,820
you know,
feed the neighborhood.

261
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,090
Um,
it was an amazing experience.

262
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:39,800
And food.
Food is medicine.

263
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,230
You know,
cannabis is medicine.

264
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:45,050
I mean,
I really don't see much of a difference.

265
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,320
Right?

266
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,250
So you see this green thing that grows 
naturally from the earth,

267
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,084
like all this other stuff that we eat.
You see that just sort of as an 

268
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,790
extension of every other thing,
but the city wasn't that thrilled.

269
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,710
Right?
With your,

270
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,853
with your garden.
So here you are a person that sort 

271
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:04,070
already takes life into your own hands 
on your own property and the city of Los

272
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,903
Angeles.
What did they do?

273
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,230
Well,
okay.

274
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,510
Going back a little while.
I.

275
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,740
What got me inspired to plant the garden
was I watched a Ted talk by Ron Finley.

276
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,850
I don't know if you've heard of him,
the,

277
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,923
uh,
a guerrilla garden against gangster 

278
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,143
gardener.
So the whole idea of that he presented 

279
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:26,870
growing your own food is like printing 
your own money.

280
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:27,704
I mean,
there was some things that just 

281
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:32,450
resonated so deeply with me that 
immediately after I saw the talk,

282
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:35,990
I,
I got in touch with la green grounds and

283
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,090
said,
I need to learn how to do this.

284
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,860
How,
how can I volunteer?

285
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,200
Um,
and,

286
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,034
uh,
it turns out they were actually looking 

287
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,220
for an la resident.
I'm a to plant a garden.

288
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,720
Um,
and,

289
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,850
uh,
the timing was perfect.

290
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,684
So we planted,
we were selected in and that's how we 

291
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,220
got our garden.
Um,

292
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,770
so yeah,

293
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,060
the city though,
didn't want you to do it at some point.

294
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,640
Right.
So Ron,

295
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,350
when he,
when he did his ted talk,

296
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,100
he had planted an edible garden a few 
years before mine

297
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,620
and was cited and um,
went to city council and,

298
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,673
uh,
made the case that it doesn't make 

299
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:20,764
sense.
You should allow people to grow food on 

300
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,260
their,
on their parkways,

301
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,790
and the city council at that time agreed
and said that,

302
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,923
um,
they would work to change the laws and 

303
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,770
fast forward two years later,
I plant,

304
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,963
we plant our garden and I was operating 
under the assumption that it was all 

305
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:39,380
good.
Right?

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,020
But the changes were in the works.
Um,

307
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,970
but a few months after,
um,

308
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,620
this w we were cited,
I'm a guy,

309
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:53,380
came to my house and kind of 
aggressively said,

310
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,410
you know,
all of this has to come out and you have

311
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:59,050
48 hours to put it all back to the way 
it was.

312
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,360
And,

313
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,480
and there's nothing to do with weed.
Just to me,

314
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,500
this is growing squash,
eggplants.

315
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,050
Yeah.

316
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,801
Yeah.
Things like that.

317
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,270
So,
um,

318
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,310
that because we had the support of a lot
of,

319
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:17,890
you know,
La Green grounds and Ron and um,

320
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,480
it was easy to,
to get attention drawn to the,

321
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,860
to the issue it had been going on for 
some time.

322
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:29,070
Steve Lopez from the La Times came out 
and wrote an article about our,

323
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,630
our garden and it,
it,

324
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:32,464
uh,
it helped bring the city council's 

325
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:41,041
attention back to this issue and I'm not
long after that they did change the laws

326
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:44,440
so anyone in La can,
can,

327
00:16:44,441 --> 00:16:46,210
uh,
grow fruits and vegetables on their,

328
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,313
on their parkway before you had to.
There was only a short list of approved 

329
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,470
things you could grow.
And if you wanted to deviate from that,

330
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,120
you had to,
uh,

331
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:01,750
I think a file a request and I think it 
was like $400.

332
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,310
Stephen asked just to ask

333
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,660
to use your own property,
your own yes.

334
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,620
And then,
you know,

335
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,090
you might not get the approval.

336
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,850
Now,
I think the way the law reads is you can

337
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,010
grow whatever you want except for,
um,

338
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,630
uh,
some,

339
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,940
some fruit trees are not allowed to be 
on the parkway.

340
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:21,070
But it was,
it's a huge step.

341
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,921
Right?
Right now,

342
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,860
as long as you have a medical marijuana 
license,

343
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,694
you can also grow weed.
I'm guessing you can't do that in the 

344
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:27,704
front of your house though with.
I don't think I would say it would be 

345
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:32,420
such a good idea.
Probably not the greatest idea.

346
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,254
All right,
well I don't want to get too into the 

347
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,300
weeds on that.
No Pun intended,

348
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,763
but I thought it was an interesting way 
to start because it shows how marijuana 

349
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,324
and legalization and the distal uses and
all that are so tied into our legal 

350
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,290
system and then we can get into some of 
that stuff.

351
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:48,861
So.
All right,

352
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,810
so you have the Migraines,
you start saying,

353
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,644
all right,
I'm going to smoke weed to make myself 

354
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:55,434
feel better.
How long did it take to figure out what 

355
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,300
worked for you,
what actually was the right strain?

356
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,070
And can you talk about strains a little 
bit?

357
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,211
You know,
I,

358
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:07,810
I,
I know with some conditions,

359
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,350
um,
people look for particular strains.

360
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,020
Um,
uh,

361
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,500
you know,
I think.

362
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,230
Okay,
so there,

363
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,210
there are.
Yeah,

364
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,420
let's do,
let's do one on one.

365
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,920
When you talk about cannabis there a 
cannabis,

366
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:22,690
indica and sativa,
right?

367
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,610
I'm sit there.
They look different physically,

368
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,110
like sativa plants are usually taller 
and leaner,

369
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,570
thinner branches and a grow better in 
warmer climates.

370
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,450
Indicas are kind of shorter and Bush 
year and heartier.

371
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,720
Um,
besides that,

372
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,120
indicas are usually,
um,

373
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,970
they helped you relax.
You,

374
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,080
um,
most people will use them at night to as

375
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:58,081
a sleep aid or um,
and sativas generally will give you more

376
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:05,071
energy and let you keep more focus.
So more people will use.

377
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,940
Sativa is during the day because you can
still function

378
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,980
all my comedian friends that get stoned 
on sativas and write all day.

379
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,310
Right?
And then,

380
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:17,110
um,
uh,

381
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:18,470
within,
uh,

382
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,413
okay,
so you have strains that are either 

383
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,840
endeca or sativa or they can be a 
hybrid.

384
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,263
Um,
and then each particular strain has its 

385
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,170
own,
uh,

386
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,613
profile,
uh,

387
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,390
how much thc is in there,
how much cbd is in there.

388
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,090
So let's unpack that a little bit.
So thc is the psychoactive part.

389
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,890
Correct.
And CBD is,

390
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,620
is the medicinal part.
Is that fair to describe it?

391
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,250
That thc also has medicinal

392
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,870
properties,
but it is the psychoactive element.

393
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,990
CBD is,
is cannabidiol.

394
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,250
It's another cannabinoid.
Those aren't the only two.

395
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:57,680
I mean,
there,

396
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,440
there are others,
um,

397
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,483
and,
but CBD does seem to have most of the 

398
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,850
medicinal value.
I mean,

399
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:08,080
it can,
it can.

400
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:08,914
Um,
it's been shown to a stop some tumor 

401
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:13,380
growth.
It's um,

402
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,430
uh,
you know,

403
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,930
it's great for pain relief.
Um,

404
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,880
it's a,
uh,

405
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,970
reduces inflammation.
Um,

406
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,003
you know,
it's,

407
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,330
I have a friend that takes cbd oil for 
anxiety and she told me all she does,

408
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,230
literally as she was a little dropper in
the morning,

409
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,870
she drops two drops every time.
That's it.

410
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,073
She doesn't have the diarrhea and 
vomiting and thoughts of suicide and 

411
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:39,954
restless leg syndrome and all the other 
crazy things that come with all the 

412
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:44,184
commercials that you see on tv for all 
these other antidepressants and 

413
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,250
antianxiety it's,
it's,

414
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,890
it's so gentle.
I mean,

415
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,470
it has so many benefits and has never 
killed anyone.

416
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,420
Um,

417
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,550
you mentioned that at the top.
I've never murdered anyone,

418
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,680
but it's still,
boggles my mind that,

419
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,090
uh,
a plant,

420
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,040
first of all,
that has so many medicinal properties.

421
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,770
So besides medicine,
I mean,

422
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:16,820
what about renewable energy and uh,
you know,

423
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,470
paper,
you know,

424
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,890
I mean,
it's strong.

425
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,010
It's a strong fiber,
replaced so many things.

426
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,343
Um,
the fact that we look at it as such an 

427
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,630
evil thing,
um,

428
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,480
I don't understand.

429
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,240
I can,
I can tell it.

430
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:36,910
It truly boggles the mind.
Yes,

431
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,041
yes.
Alright.

432
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:42,810
So we have a thc cbd,
uh,

433
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,900
and then you have the indigo and the 
sativa and the hybrids of that.

434
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,940
Um,
so for the medicinal stuff,

435
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:50,610
let's just do that first.
Most people,

436
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,670
if you didn't want to get stoned but you
just wanted medicinal benefits,

437
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,190
that's where you would use just the cbd,
is that right?

438
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,680
Okay.
CBD,

439
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,090
yes.
You want that.

440
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,253
But there's been a lot of research 
researched that shows that a cbd alone 

441
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,620
is not as effective as when you mix it 
with thc,

442
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,430
meaning that it's the whole plant that 
you want to treat you with.

443
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:23,431
Not just taking one piece of it.
Um,

444
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,420
I think it's referred to as the 
entourage effect because there's so many

445
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:30,460
elements and they all kind of worked 
together.

446
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,793
Um,
so people who are looking for cbd are 

447
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:41,251
usually looking for cbd rich strains or 
in some cases,

448
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:42,724
you know,
like the,

449
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,350
the concentrates and things like that.
Um,

450
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,760
but I think for the most part you'll 
find that they're more effective when,

451
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,810
when there is a little thc in there.

452
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,773
Yeah.
So when you found the right one for you 

453
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:55,940
for.
Well,

454
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,560
first off,
how long did it take for you to find the

455
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:58,670
weed that was like,
oh,

456
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,940
these migraines?

457
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,541
Nah,
you know,

458
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,374
I didn't even think about weight as a 
treatment for my migraines because when 

459
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:09,651
I get bad migraines I would get barrier.
I'm nauseous,

460
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,930
dizzy.
Um,

461
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,590
uh,
smoking pot was the last thing I thought

462
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:21,580
would help me really.
Um,

463
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,090
but then I did read that it,
it helps.

464
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:27,150
And um,
for me it's,

465
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,023
it,
it,

466
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,940
it relaxes me enough that,
I mean,

467
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:33,500
it,
it,

468
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,090
it,
it helps the nausea.

469
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,930
Um,
and also it helps me control the anxiety

470
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,170
that comes along with,
with,

471
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,610
um,
the onset of a migraine.

472
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,863
I don't know,

473
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,310
two things attacking you at once,
you have the Migraine,

474
00:23:50,311 --> 00:23:51,830
but then knowing it's coming now you're 
saying,

475
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,010
oh my gosh.
About that.

476
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,340
And try to hit both of those.
Both of those things.

477
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,000
Um.
Alright.

479
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,080
So then you started doing that.
It was working.

480
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,280
When did you say,
all right,

481
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,114
I could make a business out of this or I
gotta I gotTa tell people what's going 

482
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:06,594
on here.

483
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,070
Well,
you know,

484
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,220
a friend of mine was baking and I was 
fascinated by it and so I would um,

485
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,470
look up recipes and send them to me.
You should try this,

486
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,180
you should try that.
And he's finally,

487
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:22,980
he got to the point where you said,
you know what angel,

488
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:28,430
you should try it.
So I started experimenting and um,

489
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,013
that's how I got introduced to making 
edibles and then I started trying them 

490
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:36,264
because,
well honestly I tried a few edibles and 

491
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,220
hated them.
You Go,

492
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,490
this is going back to like 2008 or 
something.

493
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:45,001
I mean,
because you.

494
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,170
Before they had perfected.
Exactly.

495
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,730
I mean,
at that time he'd go to a dispensary and

496
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:55,200
you see stuff that was just in like 
Ziploc bags and,

497
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,393
you know,
totally unappetizing to look at and 

498
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,540
oftentimes didn't taste very good and I 
mean,

499
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:04,374
I,
I found myself in those early days just 

500
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:09,030
sort of like,
you know,

501
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,030
eating it real quick and just hoping for
the,

502
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,550
we're now,
it's like literally,

503
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,460
it's like going into a great big

504
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,510
Oh,
you can get any,

505
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,840
anything,
pizza sauces.

506
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:20,674
So

507
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,350
this can be anything you can think of.
Yeah.

508
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,300
So you started making this and it was 
really for yourself and then you started

509
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:29,134
selling it.
How quickly did you realize they were 

510
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:34,330
going to be some legal issues?
Even in California where it is legal?

511
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,490
Uh,
well,

512
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,270
right away,
right away.

513
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,380
I mean,
you know,

514
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,970
there's still such a problem with 
perception first of all.

515
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,900
So,
okay.

516
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:48,480
California was the first to allow for 
medical marijuana.

517
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:52,650
It's been that way for about 20 years.
But,

518
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,020
uh,
beyond doing that,

519
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,310
there really aren't any regulations 
established.

520
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,770
So,
uh,

521
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,430
it's like the wild west or it has been 
like that.

522
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,743
Um,
and there are a lot of people who want 

523
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:14,640
to do the right thing,
wants to operate in a safe way,

524
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,820
but without guidelines,
without regulations,

525
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,700
you can't really do that.
And um,

526
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,630
you know,
there because of the perception problem,

527
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:29,130
because of the stigma problem,
because there are no clear laws.

528
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,990
A dispensary's are still being attacked,
closed down,

529
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:35,760
shut down.
And um,

530
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,470
literally,
I mean,

531
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,200
you're not making the dispensaries in 
California,

532
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:41,034
there was a dispensary maybe five blocks
away from me that about six ago was 

533
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:44,784
closed down.
It was legal within the California set 

534
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,780
of laws,
but federally,

535
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:49,614
because it's not legal,
the feds pretty much at anytime could 

536
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,100
come in and stop you.
Right,

537
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,760
right.
But I'm at risk right now and we have no

538
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,910
fans watching.
Sorry about that.

539
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,940
Yeah.
But in,

540
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,480
and it's not even just,
it's not that the,

541
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,553
I guess that is the case in some 
instances that the feds do come in and 

542
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:09,384
shut them down,
but even local municipalities are going 

543
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,540
in and shutting down places because 
they're using,

544
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:16,880
um,
um,

545
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,070
land use codes to evict people and 
threatened their landlords.

546
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,600
And I'm sure shadow places down.

547
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,300
Yeah,
so how do you operate knowing that,

548
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,610
that sort of out there,
it's a very precarious position to be in

549
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
as,
as a business person?

550
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,280
Yes.
Well,

551
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,114
first of all it's a business,
but for me it's primarily a passion 

552
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:42,470
project.
You know,

553
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,490
I do this because it means a lot to me 
to be in the industry and um,

554
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,910
to help change how help change 
perspectives on it.

555
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,260
Um,
I,

556
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,710
I know that I believe that a lot of 
people who are anti marijuana,

557
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,940
I really just a misinformed,
you know,

558
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:09,580
there's been a lot of negative 
propaganda,

559
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,693
um,
and it's going to take some time to get 

560
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,160
good real information out to people.

561
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,223
Yeah.
This is sorta like for people that are 

562
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:23,730
pro marijuana even,
not even recreationally,

563
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:24,564
but even medicinally,
this is sorta the fault of you've had 

564
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:28,890
the government which scared people about
marijuana,

565
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:29,880
right?
You can think of those,

566
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:32,190
just those posters in the sixties,
you know,

567
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,130
just like making everyone look evil,
smoking weed,

568
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,710
and then even the Hollywood side of 
things,

569
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:38,544
Hollywood,
which is obviously very liberal and pro 

570
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:42,480
drug generally,
but every movie related to Pod is just a

571
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,120
bunch of goofballs doing ridiculous 
things.

572
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,013
So it makes it seem like it's going to 
make you dumb or stupid or something 

573
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:48,420
like that.
Yeah.

574
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,640
There's really nothing in between those 
two places,

575
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,331
which is.
Well,

576
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,040
I guess this is,
this is between those two years,

577
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,800
you'd be surprised at how many of us 
really fall in between.

578
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,160
Most people aren't at the extremes.
Me,

579
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,480
I can't believe it.
It's just that people are afraid to come

580
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,314
out and,
and rightly so because because it is 

581
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:08,574
still federally illegal and,
and there is still this stigma attached 

582
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:14,100
to it.
Uh,

583
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,330
when I was working full time and in the 
corporate world,

584
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,283
I definitely kept,
might use a private because I didn't 

585
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:25,360
want to be judged.
It's,

586
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,753
I didn't feel ashamed,
but I didn't want anyone to use that 

587
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:34,590
information against me.
And I think that,

588
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,783
um,
that a lot of people fall into that 

589
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:38,994
category and it's a shame because it,
it's so easy to keep those stereotypes 

590
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,890
going of the pot head stoner,
um,

591
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,690
you know,
it's easy to,

592
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,553
to,
to dismiss the whole industry if that's 

593
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:55,720
all you have in your head when you think
about it.

594
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,370
But there's so much more to it than 
that.

595
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,930
Yeah.
I'm so fascinated by that because,

596
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:02,860
you know,
I've talked about,

597
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,750
you know,
gay people coming out,

598
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,370
they're not trying to push anyone else 
interested in gay.

599
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:08,980
There is coming out for themselves.
Exactly.

600
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:09,814
I've talked about this related to 
atheist because I get emails all the 

601
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,544
time were atheist,
even in western societies where it's 

602
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,304
okay to be atheist will say I'm afraid 
of coming out because you might have an 

603
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:21,790
effect on my job or my parents or my 
cousin or something like that.

604
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,480
And I never thought of it really in the 
context of marijuana.

605
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,970
But yeah,
as a professional person you didn't want

606
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:31,360
to be seen a certain way.
So how did you remove that stigma?

607
00:30:31,361 --> 00:30:32,980
I mean,
did you go home to your parents and say,

608
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,010
I'm going to go on and do this and weed

609
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,320
once I decided that this was important 
and this is what I wanted to do,

610
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,160
I definitely made a shift to being out 
and I told my parents,

611
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,460
you know,
and this is what I'm doing.

612
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,320
I use cannabis for my migraines.
I use cannabis,

613
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,110
you know,
I,

614
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,770
I,
I'm still a good mother,

615
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,640
you know,
a productive member of society.

616
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,530
I mean,
not that they questioned me.

617
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,210
Um,
but,

618
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,270
but you felt it was like sort of on you 
to sell your case in a way or something.

619
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,320
Yes.
And it's interesting,

620
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,530
you know,
there's still,

621
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,490
even though they know what I do is,
is good.

622
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,900
Um,
they believed that I'm providing a good.

623
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,780
Um,
but there's,

624
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,733
you know,
they worry,

625
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,680
they worried they,
they,

626
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,100
they see how the laws are and see how 
um,

627
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,450
you know,
there's a risk.

628
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,150
Um,
yeah.

629
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,083
Yeah.
So one of the laws that I simply cannot 

630
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:47,440
believe is this section one thing,
right?

631
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:48,274
So this is that the federal government 
basically says at this point that 

632
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:52,564
marijuana has no medical benefit.
There's a jillion studies that show 

633
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,483
that's not true.
There is a zillion examples of people 

634
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,040
like yourself that show that that's not 
true.

635
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,550
I've smoked weed after hurting my knee 
playing basketball and fell better.

636
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,630
So,
you know,

637
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,493
most people know that this isn't true,
but this is the Obama administration 

638
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:12,604
that still is backing this.
So when these dispensaries are closed 

639
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,660
here in California,
where again,

640
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:20,140
it is legal,
this is coming from Obama who was pretty

641
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:21,740
good on weed.
So it's,

642
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,080
it's so complex,
isn't it?

643
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,973
Yes.
I,

644
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,760
I had hoped for more change,
uh,

645
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,640
you know,
I did read the other day,

646
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:31,474
who knows if this is true that Gary 
Johnson predicted that Obama would we 

647
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,850
classify or declassify it on his way out
and,

648
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:43,320
you know,
that's kind of one by the way.

649
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,490
Um,
so that would be amazing if he did that.

650
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,040
Um,
yeah,

651
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:52,670
it's,

652
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,060
I had Gary Johnson on the show and I 
mean a libertarian,

653
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:55,894
as I was saying at the top,
a libertarian should be the most pro 

654
00:32:58,151 --> 00:33:02,830
we'd person there is,
this is you and your life and you're not

655
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:03,664
pushing it on kids.
You're doing something that makes you 

656
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:05,950
feel bad.

657
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,430
Yeah.
I,

658
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,430
I think the problem is just this,
it's been this way for so long.

659
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:16,750
It's hard to change course,
especially when you're going pretty much

660
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,280
one 80,
you know,

661
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:23,780
I mean to have cannabis,
uh,

662
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:25,064
on the schedule one,
it has led to so many people suffering 

663
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,980
needlessly,
you know,

664
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,343
being put in prison.
I'm having criminal records that affect 

665
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,493
the rest of their lives.
And what's horrifying about it is that 

666
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,374
it's,
it impacts communities of color more so 

667
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,140
this whole war on drugs is a failure and
it,

668
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:57,880
it's been used as a way to target 
certain communities.

669
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,080
And um,

670
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,373
I think just this week there was 
something that came out at one of 

671
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,030
Nixon's advisors has now admitted.
Yes.

672
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,983
Part of what they did related to 
criminalizing certain drugs was 

673
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:14,340
purposely aimed at minority communities 
that you're not just picking up

674
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,130
exactly fact,
yes,

675
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,510
I read that same thing and he,
he admitted it was the hippies and,

676
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,433
and the African Americans that they 
wanted to be able to go into those 

677
00:34:26,071 --> 00:34:28,290
communicate communities,
um,

678
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,370
arrest their leaders,
raid their homes with.

679
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:33,410
That was the goal.
Um,

680
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,120
and here we are,
it's,

681
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,550
it's,
it's still happening,

682
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,680
it's still happening.
Um,

683
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,950
and so I think we're asking people,
you know,

684
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,270
law enforcement to give up control of 
this.

685
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,060
Um,
and um,

686
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,770
you know,
there are a lot of law enforcement that,

687
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,653
that believe that's for the best,
but there's still resistance because 

688
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:02,010
it's the way we've operated for so many 
years.

689
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,270
Right.

690
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,170
So basically if you're a business owner,
like yourself or someone at a dispensary

691
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,004
or you're just somebody that likes weed,
if you want this thing to flip as 

692
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:12,830
quickly as possible,
basically you want pretty much a lawsuit

693
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:17,831
to get involved where the dispensary is 
shut down and that case has to get up to

694
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:18,710
the supreme court.
Right?

695
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,653
Like,
is that where you see that ultimately 

696
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,020
the only way we're going to stop this 
federally is through the Supreme Court?

697
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:24,854
Right.

698
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,080
I don't know.
I mean,

699
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:28,190
you know,
I just read something that,

700
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,203
uh,
I think it was normal issued it about 

701
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,020
how,
uh,

702
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,650
that's probably not the fastest track,
you know,

703
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,350
it's more of a state's issue and the 
more states that,

704
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,490
that,
uh,

705
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,710
legalize it then,
then we'll just kind of give us,

706
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,290
we'll follow.
Hopefully,

707
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,453
you know,
Bernie Sanders said he would schedule 

708
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:49,704
it.
A Hillary Clinton said she'd move it to 

709
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,760
schedule to write waffling on this thing
as I mentioned,

710
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,750
but you know what,
for California at least,

711
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,430
I can speak to that a little bit.
I mean,

712
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:03,264
that's what the La medical cannabis task
force is trying to accomplish here 

713
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,130
locally.
You know,

714
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:08,964
California is like 49 percent of the 
national market when it comes to 

715
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:12,624
cannabis and La is,
is the center of all of that for us to 

716
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:21,330
not have common sense regulations for 
this industry.

717
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,980
It's ridiculous.
And you know,

718
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,180
we all know it's here,
you know,

719
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,070
the majority of La residents want it 
here.

720
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,640
Um,
so how are we going to provide access to

721
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,880
people as part of it that it's hard to 
motivate people that smoke pot?

722
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,100
You know what I mean,
like I was trying at the top,

723
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:38,934
I was trying to say,
you know,

724
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,490
it's hard to,
to have this conversation without saying

725
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,640
things that sound silly like that,
but there's some level of that,

726
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,151
right?
Like,

727
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:48,300
I can think of my four years of college 
when I sat on a couch stone,

728
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,150
but if you had told me,
if I would just go next door,

729
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,280
we could legalize it.
I probably wouldn't have got up.

730
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,800
You know what?
I think it's more fear that,

731
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,793
that has stopped the community from 
coming together because when you know 

732
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:07,731
that you could get busted at any time,
it's hard to form alliances,

733
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,460
you know,
it's,

734
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,080
it promotes everyone having a,
you know,

735
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,363
a,
a mentality of being just out for 

736
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:15,930
themselves,
you know,

737
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,120
um,
that's the way it's been.

738
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,983
People operating kind of in the shadows 
because I don't want to draw too much 

739
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:26,010
attention to themselves because who 
knows what's gonna happen next week,

740
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,290
you know?
Um,

741
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,350
but that's what the task force is trying
to accomplish is,

742
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,193
you know,
the state of California recently passed 

743
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,810
some laws that went into effect at the 
beginning of this year,

744
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,830
uh,
uh,

745
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,740
Murcia medical marijuana regulation and 
Safety Act,

746
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,060
uh,
which,

747
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,510
uh,
creates a path for legitimacy and,

748
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,770
and licensure for,
for everyone that's in this industry,

749
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,360
but it's up to all the cities,
the cities to,

750
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,600
to then enact regulations that comply 
with that.

751
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,913
So La does have an opportunity now and 
that's what we're hoping to accomplish 

752
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,780
is to,
uh,

753
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,490
get some regulations on the books that 
really encourages this industry.

754
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,843
I mean,
we,

755
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,460
we want it here,
you know,

756
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,130
so what should that look like?
What's the,

757
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,390
how do we need to make that happen?
Yeah.

758
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:19,740
It's so interesting because it's so 
much.

759
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,574
Reminds me of the fossil fuel versus 
green energy argument because obviously 

760
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:28,710
like the fossil fuel lobbyists,
big pharmacy has a lot of lobbyists,

761
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:29,544
right?
They're all paying all the politicians 

762
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,980
to basically keep weed illegal at some 
level,

763
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,070
keep cannabis illegal

764
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,920
because they are trying to sell a lot of
pills.

765
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,150
And it sort of goes back to what you 
started with about creating a garden and

766
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:43,984
a life that you could grow something out
of the earth that could take care of 

767
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:50,020
some of your problems.
And yet we're so afraid of that and we'd

768
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:53,470
rather them handed to us in pill form.
And then at the same time,

769
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,393
half the commercial for that pill tells 
you worse things than you had to take 

770
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,250
four in the first place.
Side effects may include doing it.

771
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,510
They should have to show those people 
having those side effects,

772
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,033
show someone vomiting and on the toilet 
I've been diarrhea and thoughts as soon 

773
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,790
as we hang gliding and they're dancing 
around and it's like,

774
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,690
come on.
Like how much of that is just related to

775
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:19,450
politics that the pharmaceutical 
companies don't want this to happen.

776
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,210
So

777
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,060
I think that is a big part of it.
I mean,

778
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,100
the way things are a benefits,
a lot of people,

779
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,483
those people don't want to see things 
change because that takes money out of 

780
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,050
their pockets and it's,
it's pretty simple.

781
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,180
But,
um,

782
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,440
for me,
you know,

783
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:42,680
it's,
it's not about getting rich for me,

784
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:44,450
it's about simplifying,
like I said,

785
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,313
and you know,
I would love to just be as self 

786
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,710
sufficient as possible.
I mean,

787
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,700
to grow my own food,
to grow my own medicine,

788
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,830
to compost,
to,

789
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,030
to,
you know,

790
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:04,031
to not have to go to a store for 
everything that I need.

791
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,060
I mean that,
that's kind of the default mentality,

792
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,961
you know,
you need something,

793
00:40:08,961 --> 00:40:10,620
you go out and buy it,
you,

794
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,770
you use something,
you're done with it,

795
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:17,570
you throw it away.
And we're so disconnected from nature,

796
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,703
um,
from what we're doing to the 

797
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:21,620
environment,
you know,

798
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,470
it's so easy to,
to not think about that.

799
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,680
And for me,
um,

800
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,730
cannabis is an important part of taking 
care of myself,

801
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,590
you know,
in a way that,

802
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,400
you know,
um,

803
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,920
you know,
it,

804
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,260
it helps me in so many ways.
Um,

805
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,440
I don't need to go to a doctor to get 
it,

806
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,090
you know.
Um,

807
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,493
yeah,
it's,

808
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,150
yeah,
when you see those guys,

809
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,043
you know,
if you walk down Venice Boulevard right 

810
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:56,804
on the Strip there and we've got the 
guys all dressed in green and there the 

811
00:40:58,821 --> 00:40:59,654
four slash 20 doctors,
they got a hat on with a weed leaf and 

812
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,470
all that.
Do you think that actually is doing some

813
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:05,780
of the reverse effect because then 
people are like,

814
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,940
this seems so silly.
Yeah,

815
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,070
I think so.
I,

816
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,163
I,
I see a lot of tourists taking pictures 

817
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,720
of those a lot.
Um,

818
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,510
I think I did it exactly.
Um,

819
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,750
so it's,
it's,

820
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,180
um,
you know,

821
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,830
it's,
it's a spectacle.

822
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,440
I guess that's mostly what they're going
for.

823
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,140
I think I'm down there on Venice beach.
Yeah.

824
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,690
Um,
but I,

825
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,530
I do think it,
it points out kind of the,

826
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,110
the,
uh,

827
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,643
the,

828
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,140
that there isn't really that much of a 
difference,

829
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,520
you know,
between,

830
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,050
for,
in my mind,

831
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:49,280
between medicinal and recreational and 
um,

832
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,073
yes,
you have to get a recommendation from a 

833
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:55,790
physician to get it in California.
Um,

834
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,770
yes,
it's pretty easy to do that.

835
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,800
Have there been any.
I mean,

836
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,620
everything that I've read about what's 
going on in Colorado right now,

837
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,840
I'd say 90 percent of it has been very 
good.

838
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,420
Basically they're bringing in a lot more
tax revenue.

839
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,400
It's,
I don't,

840
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,233
I don't,
I haven't seen anything about crime 

841
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:14,840
suddenly going up or suddenly other 
spikes and other drug use.

842
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:15,674
You know,
they always say marijuana is a gateway 

843
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:17,291
drug.
What,

844
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:18,710
what do you say to that?
When people say that

845
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,791
I can't wait.
Uh,

846
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,130
what,
that's what I wonder about,

847
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:22,964
you know,
I mean,

848
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,320
uh,
okay.

849
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,154
So I've,
I've used cannabis for many years and I 

850
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,500
don't like to drink alcohol.
I can occasionally,

851
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:38,410
but it makes me a sneeze now I get 
really congested and I don't,

852
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,590
I just don't really enjoy it.
Um,

853
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,970
so,
and,

854
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,690
and you know,
I think there's been research that shows

855
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:47,960
that,
you know,

856
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,310
a lot of people that can use drugs and 
not get addicted,

857
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,710
you know,
addiction is a,

858
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,603
is a problem.
But to say that just because I smoke 

859
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,530
cannabis,
I'm,

860
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,770
I'm,
you know,

861
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,800
headed down this road where there's,
I'll never come back.

862
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,270
It's,
it's silly.

863
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:08,890
Well,
I always,

864
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:09,723
I remember thinking how crazy it was,
the way they've demonized weed because 

865
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:13,414
when I said at the top of the show,
I had never smoked weed until I was a 

866
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:15,664
sophomore in college.
I remember smoking weed and then 

867
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:19,900
laughing or whatever,
whatever went on.

868
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,520
And I remember thinking,
well,

869
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:23,500
wait a minute,
they've told me weed is so horrible.

870
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,930
So what about these other drugs?
So in a weird way,

871
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:29,080
by demonizing weed or marijuana and 
cannabis,

872
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:30,980
whatever we're calling it now,
uh,

873
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:31,923
they actually have convinced a lot of 
people I think to try other drugs 

874
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,390
because then you try weed,
you go,

875
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,560
this isn't so bad.
Well,

876
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,320
what about crack and crack?
But I'm just saying.

877
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,140
Yeah,
no,

878
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,150
I understand.
Yeah.

879
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:47,151
Because it's so clearly a 
misinformation,

880
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,040
you know,
and people aren't stupid,

881
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:50,963
you know.
So,

882
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,860
um,
yeah,

883
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:54,390
I,
it does send the wrong message.

884
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:54,830
What

885
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,580
do you think about how I noticed that a 
lot of my friends who used to be huge,

886
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:03,410
huge potheads either don't smoke anymore
or barely ever smoke or when they do,

887
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,230
they only need the tiniest flub.
As I said at the top,

888
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:07,064
I,
I spoke at this point maybe once a 

889
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,260
month,
I take one puff,

890
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:11,560
a granddaddy purple,
the Grand Daddy,

891
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,033
which is an indycar because I told the 
guy I just want to melt into the couch 

892
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,820
and watch tv and that's it.
And I really,

893
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,840
it's once a month,
one pup,

894
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:18,674
I'm good to go.
But something about weed is different 

895
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:24,500
than other drugs because people that use
it a lot of seem to.

896
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,060
I think George Carlin did a bit about 
this.

897
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:29,090
They seem to not grow out of it 
necessarily,

898
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:31,950
but it has a reverse addictive thing in 
some ways.

899
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:32,740
You know what I mean?
Some people,

900
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,350
because for the people that get 
paranoid,

901
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:35,280
let's say,
well,

902
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,800
I don't want that anymore.
And I think you would probably say,

903
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:38,634
well,
that may be trying to go more than a 

904
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:40,350
sativa.
Right?

905
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,930
But what's interesting is,
okay,

906
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:47,931
so they have found that your body has an
endoccanabinoid system,

907
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,140
right?
So there are receptors in your brain and

908
00:44:53,141 --> 00:44:58,030
all through your body that are there to 
accept canabinoids.

909
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,460
Um,
you're,

910
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,673
you,
you produce cannabinoids in your own 

911
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:03,730
body.
You know,

912
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,470
it's in breast milk,
so,

913
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,850
um,
they've found that what cannabis does,

914
00:45:09,851 --> 00:45:10,684
it's just,
it affects your endocannabinoid system 

915
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,834
which then brings your body into balance
and that's why it helps with so many 

916
00:45:19,631 --> 00:45:20,464
elements and that's why for many years 
people couldn't believe that it helps 

917
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,173
with so many things.
How could it do this and this and this 

918
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:28,000
and this.
No,

919
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,893
no drug does that.
It's because you have this built in 

920
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,760
regulation system in the endocannabinoid
system and cannabis helps bring.

921
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:40,804
You're bringing that into balance.
So it Kinda does make sense that if 

922
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:45,970
you're using it,
you know,

923
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:46,804
and that after a certain amount of time,
maybe he need to use less because it's 

924
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,950
just such an interesting

925
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,180
thing.
Thing about a drug,

926
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:55,270
right?
That you know,

927
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:55,891
you think,
oh,

928
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,030
you need more,
you do it more,

929
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:57,864
you're going to need more.
And in a lot of ways I know that that 

930
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,180
exists at some level with marijuana that
some of my friends,

931
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:04,014
you know,
they need to smoke more because it 

932
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,204
doesn't hit them the way it used to or 
they'll change strain or something like 

933
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,123
that.
A lot of people eventually either need 

934
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,020
much less or have much less of a desire 
that,

935
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,200
that doesn't fit any of the definitions 
of what addiction and drug.

936
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,340
Exactly.
You just need to.

937
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:21,460
Normally with addiction you have to keep
upping the dosage and the dosage and you

938
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:23,150
know,
like for when I use,

939
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,440
when I have an edible cookie at night,
I mean it's 12,

940
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,770
13 milligrams and that's plenty for me.
Yeah.

941
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,693
And I

942
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,330
may not be migraine related.
That might just be

943
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:37,190
just to,
as a sleep aid,

944
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,173
you know,
or if I'm feeling like it helps if your 

945
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:41,390
muscles are sore,
you know,

946
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:46,391
just relaxes you.
But 12 milligrams is not a lot.

947
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,440
And um,
and if,

948
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,790
if it were,
you know,

949
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,780
if that were true,
addiction and,

950
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:01,030
and having to have more and more.
I mean I would be eating more,

951
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,300
more cookies,
you know,

952
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:04,400
and it's one is fine

953
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,730
right now.
These are all carb free,

954
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:06,920
right?
Yeah.

955
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,113
So with some of the medicinal stuff,
when I was doing a little research for 

956
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,780
this,
you can see all kinds of crazy things.

957
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:14,760
I mean,
you can see people that say literally,

958
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:18,490
I cured brain cancer with just by,
you know,

959
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,463
using cbd oil or something like that,
and then you can see people that it 

960
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,920
helped with pain or it helped with 
nausea.

961
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:25,590
I got my appetite back.
I mean really the gamut of everything.

962
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,500
What's like the most amazing case that 
you've ever seen of,

963
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,910
of helping,
you know,

964
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:33,540
something really serious like cancer or 
Parkinson's or somebody.

965
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,950
Well,
I have a good friend that had kronos,

966
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,930
has crohn's disease and,
you know,

967
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,823
he really credits cannabis with giving 
him his life back and he was suffering 

968
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,590
tremendously for many,
many years.

969
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,760
And another friend of mine has a,
uh,

970
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,890
a young niece,
um,

971
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,210
who had a brain tumor and she,
her family was treating it with the Rick

972
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,430
Simpson oil.
And um,

973
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,880
what's that?
Um,

974
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,460
it's uh,
it's,

975
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,020
I've never tried it myself,
but it's,

976
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,973
it's,
um,

977
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,203
it's.
Rick Simpson developed this method of 

978
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,810
making this concentrated oil.
Um,

979
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,480
and you can find directions on how to 
make it yourself.

980
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,710
Was this like what they give very young 
kids?

981
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,860
Right.
Does this sound to do with what happened

982
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,694
in New Jersey?
And Kristy got in all that because I 

983
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:32,850
think he didn't want to pass it,
but then got sort of into it,

984
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:35,220
which made no sense anyway.
I think,

985
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:37,480
wasn't he just allowing the CBD stuff?
Right.

986
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,940
All right.
So we'll,

987
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,210
we'll try that again.

988
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,910
You don't have to know everything.
Yeah,

989
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,080
I try.
But I think that,

990
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:48,890
um,
uh,

991
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,823
you know,
uh,

992
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,253
I've seen a lot of people who really 
believe that it's helped them for so 

993
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:02,740
many different things.
Um,

994
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,360
even if it's just,
you know,

995
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,290
I have a bad back and I rub a topical on
my,

996
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,770
on my back and I feel better.
Um,

997
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,470
it's not always about getting stoned.
So,

998
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,110
um,
you know,

999
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:17,944
and,
and for a while I was volunteering in a 

1000
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,930
cannabis physicians office and,
you know,

1001
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,893
different.
I would see different patients and how 

1002
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:26,710
they were using the medicine.
I mean,

1003
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:28,300
it's,
it's great for any kind of.

1004
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:31,810
I'm a neuro neuro,
uh,

1005
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,800
neuropathy,
you know,

1006
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,020
any kind of nerve pain.
It,

1007
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,370
it,
it's,

1008
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,710
uh,
provides great relief for that.

1009
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:39,580
And,
you know,

1010
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,920
breast cancer,
there has been studies showing that,

1011
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:42,963
I mean,
they've shown that it can really just 

1012
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,010
kill certain cancer cells.
I mean,

1013
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,510
to me that's incredible.

1014
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,570
So for the people that would say this 
is,

1015
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,760
they still have this stigma attached to 
it,

1016
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,680
you know,
I think a lot of them,

1017
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:59,980
they don't want people to even deal with
their own pain.

1018
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,893
It's unfathomable to me that if someone 
across from me had cancer or had 

1019
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,820
Parkinson's,
the rite eight or whatever it is,

1020
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,550
what right would I have to say?
Well,

1021
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:14,230
you can't do that to yourself to 
alleviate your pain.

1022
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,540
Right.
What do you think goes on in the mind of

1023
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:17,460
that person?
I,

1024
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:18,910
I really,
I cannot imagine.

1025
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,420
I,
again,

1026
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:24,110
I think it's fear and misinformation and
that's why.

1027
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,720
Thank you so much again for having me 
here because think it's,

1028
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:28,554
it's,
it's so important to come out and speak 

1029
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:33,810
on the topic.
Uh,

1030
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,330
I know I'm fighting a stereotype,
you know,

1031
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,513
um,
but I do not consider myself a stoner 

1032
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,120
and I am very productive,
you know?

1033
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,080
So,
uh,

1034
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:45,870
I think that's

1035
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:46,703
the board.
There's money to be made here for a lot 

1036
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:50,300
of people.
It's happening in Colorado right now.

1037
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:52,490
It's happening across California.
So this is,

1038
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:54,540
these are serious business people,
right?

1039
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,580
It's like the new California gold rush 
in a way where you have to be willing to

1040
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,310
sort of put your butt on the line,
I suppose for hopefully not

1041
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,820
too much longer.
I mean,

1042
00:51:03,821 --> 00:51:05,830
we'll see.
We'll see.

1043
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:06,664
I mean,
I think that the energy is definitely 

1044
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:09,694
going in the right direction and 
hopefully we'll get some regulations in 

1045
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:15,820
place,
especially here in la because,

1046
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,220
you know,
we,

1047
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,353
we are the center of this industry and 
we should take a leadership role in 

1048
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:28,111
creating regulations that could be used 
other places as well.

1049
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,560
Um,
and what I'd really like to see is,

1050
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,053
uh,
an industry that encourages 

1051
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:37,953
entrepreneurship,
encourages a small business owners and 

1052
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,360
encourages creativity,
uh,

1053
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:48,510
and not a monopoly.
And that's really another,

1054
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:53,820
a goal of the task force is to allow 
that to happen.

1055
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,193
You know,
really bring everyone in out of the 

1056
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:03,001
shadows and operate a legitimately.

1057
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,890
Yeah.
So I know you don't buy the gateway drug

1058
00:52:05,891 --> 00:52:06,724
thing.
Where do you stand on legalization of 

1059
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:08,854
all drugs in general?
Because I think this is probably one of 

1060
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:14,440
the places where the argument gets tough
where suddenly you say,

1061
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:17,230
I'm all in on weed and then there's 
probably a lot of people that say,

1062
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:18,064
well,
I'm just all in on everything and then 

1063
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:20,194
you could get what I would think,
even though I'm basically for 

1064
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,003
legalization of most stuff,
pretty much I think people could make a 

1065
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,860
more sound case and say if you legalize 
all of this stuff,

1066
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,560
people are going to just be trying all 
kinds of really crazy.

1067
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,630
Okay,
now I'm not,

1068
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,580
I'm still sort of vacillating where I 
stand.

1069
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,800
Okay.
Drugs,

1070
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,100
there are many drugs that aren't legal 
now that people try and it doesn't limit

1071
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,940
people's ability to access,

1072
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,003
right?
They can get

1073
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,780
right.
Um,

1074
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,500
you're risking a going to prison,
you know.

1075
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,330
Um,
so I mean,

1076
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,373
legalizing all drugs,
I do believe that there are drugs that 

1077
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,770
don't have any real health benefit and 
are dangerous.

1078
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,300
Um,
but I don't think criminalizing activity

1079
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,450
that way.
Um,

1080
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,650
is,
is the right answer.

1081
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,130
You know,
if you're trying to fight addiction,

1082
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,490
putting someone in prison is not going 
to solve that.

1083
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,180
I'm preventing them from having a,
a life is not going to solve that.

1084
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:33,130
It's a crazy system that someone could 
try to alleviate their pain because of a

1085
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:35,260
chronic disease.
And our,

1086
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:36,580
our,
uh,

1087
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,380
the way we deal with them is by putting 
them in jail.

1088
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,570
Yeah.
I mean,

1089
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,413
you know,
veteran veterans right now I really 

1090
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,060
fighting to get access to medical 
marijuana.

1091
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:50,080
I mean the fact that um,
they've had to fight to be able to treat

1092
00:53:50,081 --> 00:53:54,640
their ptsd with cannabis is crazy,
you know,

1093
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:56,320
I mean,
I think they've earned that.

1094
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,240
Yeah,
I agree.

1095
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,480
All right,
well we have to wrap up.

1096
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:02,360
So first off,
I'm very happy about this.

1097
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,020
This is very exciting.
Uh,

1098
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:05,610
I think I've got it already,
but give me your.

1099
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,473
Give me your file sale.
Give me your 62nd sell on why all this 

1100
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:10,794
is important for our.
So we can clip it for facebook 

1101
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:13,794
perfectly.
Why is making this legal and do it all 

1102
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,550
this?
Just give me,

1103
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,793
give me the elevator.

1104
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,900
Cannabis medicine is,
you know,

1105
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,670
cannabis is an amazing plant.
It has so many health benefits.

1106
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,880
It has saved many lives,
um,

1107
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,110
to,
to,

1108
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,223
to,
to make it illegal or to continue to 

1109
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:37,990
keep it illegal.
It just hurts.

1110
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,950
It hurts us as a society.
It hurts individuals.

1111
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:43,870
I mean,
it's just bad all around.

1112
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:44,704
I mean,
this is,

1113
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,550
this is,
um,

1114
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,093
you know,
for me it's about really getting people 

1115
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,930
to understand that I'm,
I'm,

1116
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm not a bad person.
You know,

1117
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,323
I'm,
I'm here to provide a product that 

1118
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:07,390
people enjoy and that people benefit 
from.

1119
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,790
And um,
you know,

1120
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:13,990
it's time to,
for La especially to,

1121
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,770
to,
uh,

1122
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,810
accept this industry and to create some 
framework for us to,

1123
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,093
to,
uh,

1124
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,220
to be successful.
Yeah.

1125
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,470
Yeah.
I think you nailed it.

1126
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,390
Well,
as I told you before we started,

1127
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:28,160
you know,
I spent a lot of time here talking about

1128
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,510
terrorism and politics and jihadism in 
all kinds of crazy stuff.

1129
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,523
So this was an absolute pleasure and 
this will help me relaxing after the 

1130
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,540
show.
So I thank you for that.

1131
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:41,420
And you guys can follow along with 
angels doing a.

1134
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,203
So give her a father at Ruby,
ruby based and it's also at Ruby Ruby 

1135
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,230
lakes on instagram.
How is that?

1136
00:55:51,231 --> 00:55:52,160
Pimping is.
That's pretty good.

1137
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,271
That's pretty good.
All right,

1138
