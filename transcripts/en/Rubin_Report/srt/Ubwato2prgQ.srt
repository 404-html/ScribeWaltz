1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,650
Alright,
let's shift altogether.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,690
Let's talk about the step.
You really know.

3
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,830
How about that.
Okay.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,100
Biology,
evolutionary biology.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,900
I thought this would be an interesting 
place to start.

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,734
You just recently did a talk with 
Richard Dawkins just in the last couple 

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,440
of weeks.
Uh,

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,780
as I understand the video of it should 
be up online somewhat soon.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,750
It will be up within a couple of weeks.
Okay.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,770
So hopefully people will be able to 
actually watch this conversation.

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,023
I'm very quickly,
this event was put together by 

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:35,904
Pangbourne philosophy.
There's been a little tumbled around 

13
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,910
that and I know you just wanted to 
quickly address what's going on there.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,673
So pangbourne philosophy is obviously 
imploded and that has left people 

15
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:50,304
speculating about what happened and why 
some of us like myself continue to 

16
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,300
participate with Pangbourne.
I just very quickly for people that have

17
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,134
no idea,
they were putting together a lot of the 

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,963
public events that included a,
well the one that you moderated with 

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,220
Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris and 
Vancouver.

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,290
Also the one that Douglas Murray 
moderated,

21
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,124
which I think.
Was that in the UK or was that 

22
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,190
Australia?
One in Dublin and one in London.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,250
Yeah.
Um,

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,133
and then a series of other events like 
the one that you did with Dawkins and 

25
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,830
this this day of reflection that was 
supposed to happen on November 17th that

26
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,400
we all pulled out of which now I think 
you can take it from there.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,360
Sure.
So,

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,243
um,
let me just say that I know that there 

29
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:31,050
is a lot of speculation about what took 
place,

30
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,970
why people pulled out of the New York 
event,

31
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:33,804
why some of us like myself stayed in and
I was in at the point that it was 

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,703
canceled a couple of days ago and I do 
hope people will recognize that there 

33
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:45,120
was a predicament for those of us like,
uh,

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,530
like myself and like Eric who were 
looking at the,

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,453
uh,
the Pangbourne situation and trying to 

36
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:54,324
figure out what to do,
which was at the point that Pangbourne 

37
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,840
canceled the Auckland event.

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,470
Something new emerged.
So other events had been canceled,

39
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,170
but there had always been refunds for 
people who had bought tickets.

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,270
At the point he canceled the Auckland 
event.

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,553
There was a lack of refund money,
which called our attention to the fact 

42
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:19,581
that something was off money that should
have been kept separately for that event

43
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,990
so that if it was canceled,
it could have all been refunded,

44
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,180
somehow wasn't,
which we didn't know.

45
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,830
And to be clear,
you guys,

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,153
and I think not just,
you guys hadn't been paid for some 

47
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:29,334
previous things too,
so it wasn't just about the people that 

48
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,470
were buying the tickets.
Just.

49
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,560
Oh,
it was an auckland,

50
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,680
it was Sydney.
Sydney is where speakers,

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,573
as far as I know,
that's where speakers didn't get paid 

52
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,184
for the first time.
And I'm certainly one of the people who 

53
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,470
didn't get paid and still haven't been.
Anyway.

54
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,590
Yeah.
And also as a sidebar,

55
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,424
that's.
So that is why I pulled out of the day 

56
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,720
of reflection thing in New York.
I was supposed to host the whole day,

57
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,620
but then when I realized that people 
hadn't been paid for previous things and

58
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,454
I had heard through the grapevine that 
there was some shady stuff going on and 

59
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,144
I just said,
you know what,

60
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,363
let me just

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,940
get involved in this mess.
And that's right,

62
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,280
which makes perfect sense.
Yeah.

63
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,620
So I think what I did also makes perfect
sense,

64
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,380
which is I looked at the situation and I
said,

65
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,873
well,
you've got people who haven't been 

66
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,213
refunded their money for Auckland.
You've got speakers from Sydney who 

67
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:20,551
haven't been paid and if the New York 
event comes apart,

68
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,293
then it's going to compound that.
It's going to create a new ticket 

69
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,000
holders who haven't been paid.
Um,

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,073
and so my thought was let's have an 
event that gives people what they paid 

71
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,330
for so that we don't make the damage 
worse.

72
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:40,990
And I certainly didn't sign up for 
anything new after the Auckland.

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,680
A event was canceled and there was a 
failure to repay patrons.

74
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,514
But my thought was from the point of 
view of a protecting the fan base from 

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,800
whatever was going on a behind the 
scenes at Pangbourne,

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,873
the better part of valor was to make the
event happen and be successful rather 

77
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,720
than create another auckland situation.

78
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,663
So in any case that you know,
and I should also point out that up 

79
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,961
until so Pangbourne gave us a,
a little bit of warning just a couple of

80
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,123
days before he canceled it,
he said he was about to cancel it and 

81
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,320
Eric and I tried to save it.
In fact,

82
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,800
Eric who had pulled out of the event 
quietly so as not to cripple it,

83
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,233
uh,
he and I got on the phone with Travis 

84
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,523
and we tried to get travis to agree to 
hold the event and to lead us rescue 

85
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,594
that we offered to work for free and we 
would have liked to have held the event 

86
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,580
so that it wouldn't cause further harm 
to people.

87
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,630
And I don't know why Travis refused,
but he did.

88
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,440
So anyway,
it got canceled and I,

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,170
uh,
I just,

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,033
I do want people to understand that it 
was not that anybody was unaware that 

91
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:05,821
something was going on.
The question was what's best for the fan

92
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,110
base,
the movement,

93
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:08,944
to the extent that there is a movement,
is it better to have another event 

94
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,110
canceled and have more harm?
I didn't think so.

95
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,013
Yeah.
And I know this is all a little insider 

96
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:16,694
baseball for people,
so I know you just wanted to get that 

97
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,060
out.
So I'm glad that it is a few of us.

98
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:20,894
Also,
we had discussed possibly doing a free 

99
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,624
thing and who knows,
maybe there will be something in the 

100
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:25,694
future if people ended up getting 
stiffed on ticket prices because 

101
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:28,304
obviously we want people to get 
something and if we can all figure it 

102
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:30,711
out,
we will.

103
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:31,670
Okay.
So that being said,

104
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,504
you did do an event with Richard Dawkins
as we said the video should be up soon 

105
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:35,960
enough.
Chicago,

106
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,970
what should we expect from this?
And uh,

107
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,350
I think on its face,
I think a lot of people would say,

108
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:43,184
wait a minute.
Well,

109
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,690
we've got Weinstein and Dawkins,
these guys should agree on everything,

110
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,823
shouldn't they?

111
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,473
Well,
this goes back to the question of what 

112
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:56,591
happened to evolutionary biology 30 
years ago and um,

113
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,380
darkens and I do agree on a tremendous 
amount,

114
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,710
but the place at which we start 
disagreeing I think is a,

115
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,783
the branching point where you have the 
way evolutionary theory went 30 years 

116
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,970
ago and the way it should have gone,
and you know,

117
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,690
that's not an indictment in and of 
itself.

118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,553
Fields take wrong turns all the time.
But what should happen is you should 

119
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,790
detect that you're on the wrong path 
because suddenly progress,

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,460
uh,
ceases and that didn't happen.

121
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,323
So,
so what actually happened 30 years ago 

122
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:34,160
that got us that ironically a,
I would argue that the,

123
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,503
the last piece of progress that we all 
really agree now there's been lots of 

124
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,813
empirical work,
but the last piece of theoretical 

125
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,570
progress actually involves a Dawkins' 
selfish gene,

126
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,550
which essentially encapsulates a 
synthesis that does lots of things,

127
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,443
including,
brings a proper theory of cultural 

128
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,200
evolution online.

129
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,700
Which cultural evolution is a non issue 
for almost all creatures.

130
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,460
But for birds and mammals,
it's a big deal.

131
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,294
And for human beings it is the big deal.
So to the extent that we did not have a 

132
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:17,270
way of discussing cultural evolution 
prior to the selfish gene doctrines,

133
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,470
introduction of the concept of memes 
which have now been trivialized by,

134
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:22,304
you know,
people putting funny captions on 

135
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,800
pictures,
but the concept of,

136
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,634
I think you could argue they've become 
the most relevant way of communication 

137
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,720
in a bizarre way.
Yes,

138
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,280
but they'd be,
they've become,

139
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,263
you know,
little tidbits become little bites and 

140
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:35,144
the fact is almost everything about 
human beings that is interesting and 

141
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,304
special,
at least touches cultural evolution if 

142
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:46,880
not is entirely housed there.
So in order to understand ourselves,

143
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,810
we have to get this cultural evolution 
thing straight and documents set us,

144
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,280
I believe,
on the right path.

145
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,310
Chapter Eleven,
he introduces the word meme,

146
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,560
he introduces the concept,
he sets us in motion,

147
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,190
but he makes an error in that chapter.
No big deal.

148
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,083
We all make errors,
but it hasn't been corrected in 30 

149
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:04,670
years.
And so,

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,320
so.
So what does that error?

151
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,453
The error is in a,
a misportrayed of the relationship 

152
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,973
between culture and its evolutionary 
units and genes and the way that they 

153
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,044
evolve.
So what Dawkins says in that chapter is 

154
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,050
that means the units of cultural 
evolution exists in a new primeval soup,

155
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,201
right?
He says,

156
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,034
this is a new kind of evolution.
It begins at the point that culture 

157
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,784
begins to happen and it is independent 
of the genes that cannot be the case 

158
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,713
cannot be the case because the only 
reason that you are able to pick up 

159
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:44,474
units of cultural evolution is because 
you have a brain that your genes 

160
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,320
created,
which is hospitable to those things,

161
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,230
which means that to the extent that 
your,

162
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,943
a culture starts wasting the time and 
the energy and the resources of your 

163
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
genes,
the genes are in a perfect position to 

164
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:03,834
shut it down.

165
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,423
Right?
So my point to dokkens on stage in 

166
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:08,844
Chicago was that can't be right,
and if you make an adjustment to the 

167
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,910
theory that you presented to the 1976,
if you adjust it correctly,

168
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,853
you discover that um,
many things that are paradoxical about 

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,273
cultural evolution are no longer 
paradoxical and many things about human 

170
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:36,330
beings are suddenly tractable.
So can you give me an example of that?

171
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,240
I can give you the ultimate example,
I will accept that.

172
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:44,241
And so the ultimate example has to do 
with a religion and things that function

173
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:47,850
like it.
So if you think about,

174
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,931
um,
you know,

175
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:52,970
this is the antithesis of some little 
picture with a caption on it,

176
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,560
right?
You Imagine Catholicism,

177
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,820
for example,
Catholicism is a set of beliefs that has

178
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,910
profound implications on the way that 
believers deploy their efforts,

179
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
their resources to things that they 
elevate,

180
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:12,630
the things that they issue,
all of that.

181
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,510
So the question is why,
right?

182
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,643
So,
Docklands and I would agree there is no 

183
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,320
supernatural explanation necessary to,
uh,

184
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,720
interpret what is taking place on earth 
or anywhere else in the universe.

185
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:29,700
You don't need a supernatural 
explanation.

186
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,580
Um,
if you were trying to explain phenomena.

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,313
So why is it that people who hold a 
belief that supernatural forces are at 

188
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:43,761
the heart of a human affairs?
Why are those people so successful?

189
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,200
Historically,
that's the question.

190
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,330
And Dawkins,
and I disagree with it,

191
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,520
I would disagree over it,
uh,

192
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,413
because a,
he has this view of what cultural 

193
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:55,800
evolution is that it's independent of 
genes.

194
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,400
I say it is actually much more flexible 
than jeans,

195
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,430
but it is subordinate to the will of the
genes.

196
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,780
Um,
and he also does not subscribe.

197
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,183
Actually,
he came around a bit on this on stage I 

198
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,350
thought,
um,

199
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,140
but he also does not subscribe to a,
uh,

200
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,950
a lineage level interpretation of 
selection.

201
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,903
He is a traditional kin selectionist who
believes effectively that the 

202
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,214
individual,
that the gene and the individual or the 

203
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,840
places that we must interpret a 
evolution.

204
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,770
And if you do that,
then lots of things are paradoxical,

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,870
hard to explain.
Maybe intractable.

206
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,280
If you accept that lineages evolve,
um,

207
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,910
that adaptation can apply to the 
lineage.

208
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,970
Then you can begin to understand 
phenomena like a religious traditions as

209
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,730
adaptive properties of a population.
And uh,

210
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,773
there is tremendous progress to be made.
So what happened on stage with Dawkins 

211
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,930
was at dinner prior to the event,
we more or less agreed that I would lead

212
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:14,200
the discussion because I had a sense of 
where we disagreed and he would react to

213
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,034
it.
And I put together a list of points on 

214
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,700
which I was certain that we agreed 
points on,

215
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,580
which I was pretty sure we disagreed and
points on,

216
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,200
which I wasn't sure which way to call 
it,

217
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,390
which we didn't get to.
But anyway,

218
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:29,224
I started out by pointing out the vast 
agreement between the two of us and 

219
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,663
asked them about each one and more or 
less I had been right about where we 

220
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,844
agreed.
And then I started going through the 

221
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,644
list of places that we disagree.
And I thought it was a fascinating 

222
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,384
conversation.
It was definitely a closer to the 

223
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,590
conversation I hoped we would have won.
I feared we might have,

224
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,990
um,
there was a lot of progress.

225
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,960
Could you,
could you sense which way?

226
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:57,780
Not that this matters in the grand 
scheme of things,

227
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,410
but at some level it does.
Which way the audience was going.

228
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:02,244
Not that it,
not that it is about who gets more 

229
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:04,464
cheers or anything.
But what I do find fascinating about 

230
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,524
these things.
And although I didn't attend any of the 

231
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,920
live events with Sam and Jordan,
um,

232
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:11,754
you know,
I've watched some of them and just sort 

233
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:13,674
of noting a little bit of crowd applause
and jeers and pauses and things I think 

234
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:22,140
gives you some extra taste that may be 
for you guys on stage.

235
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:25,890
You can't quite quantify.
Well,

236
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,180
I mean,
first of all,

237
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm a believer in that and it was one of
the most of them

238
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,370
important tools that I used to use in 
the classroom,

239
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,070
you know,
figuring out what people heard,

240
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,950
how it landed,
what they don't yet have.

241
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,053
So anyway,
I'm very cognizant of what people are 

242
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:46,450
hearing and I was listening carefully to
the audience and um,

243
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,480
you know,
the thing was set in motion,

244
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,230
you know,
as another new atheist event.

245
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,303
And so in some sense I was,
I was battling uphill because my basic 

246
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,460
point was new atheism is,
is a Culdesac,

247
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,380
it's,
it's a problem in and of itself.

248
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,773
Um,

249
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,530
it's a problem because at the end,
at the end of it,

250
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,453
there isn't enough.
Is that like the most simplistic way 

251
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:11,820
that I could present it?
No.

252
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,090
I mean,
let me just put it in stark terms.

253
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,090
Atheism is defensible,
but new atheism is wrong and new atheism

254
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:25,710
is wrong because it portrays religious 
belief as a

255
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,233
of mind rather than an adaptation,
non literal adaptation and so in a room 

256
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,460
full of people who,
you know,

257
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,413
Dawkins is a very famous person because 
people presumably showed up to hear a 

258
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,600
Dawkins.
Almost all of those people have at least

259
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,493
deep sympathies with the ideas of new 
atheism and so somebody setting out to 

260
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,684
say actually new atheism is an incorrect
instantiation of atheism because it is 

261
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:03,461
effectively ideological and and accuses 
people who have religious faith of being

262
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:08,690
mentally defective and in fact darkens 
and I tangled over this.

263
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:09,261
You know,
I said,

264
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,030
look,
you're,

265
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,330
you've called religion a mind virus.
That's an incorrect interpretation.

266
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,141
And at first he said,
well,

267
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:17,510
I don't really mean anything deep by 
virus.

268
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:18,321
He said it's,
you know,

269
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:21,140
you could argue that every gene in the 
genome is like a virus.

270
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,940
Right?
And I said,

271
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:23,774
well,
but what people hear when you say that 

272
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,383
is that,
that they're mentally ill for believing 

273
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:28,580
this.

274
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:28,941
And he said,
well,

275
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:30,530
they are mentally ill,
right?

276
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,393
And so you know,
you could see the division in his own 

277
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:33,711
thinking,
right?

278
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,300
Because at that point he's then saying 
both things at the same time,

279
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:37,940
Sandy's saying both things and I,
you know,

280
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,403
I understand his position about you 
could interpret each gene has 

281
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,160
independent,
you know,

282
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,113
I could defend that position too,
but in order for there to be an 

283
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,233
honorable atheism,
we have to own up to what all that 

284
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:56,310
religious belief was about.
And then I mean,

285
00:15:56,311 --> 00:16:00,950
and this is the place that I get into an
easier pickle,

286
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:01,784
but a pickle with Peterson as well is 
the question of if we acknowledge that 

287
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,873
religious belief is adaptive,
then all of the things that are true of 

288
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:20,900
adaptive phenomena kick in and the most 
important one is that adaptive phenomena

289
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,153
are not timeless.
They are adaptive relative to a 

290
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,200
historical time and place.

291
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,630
And it may be a very long standing time 
and place.

292
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,610
But the point is there is nothing.
It is purely magical thinking to imagine

293
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,743
that religious traditions that are 
thousands of years old are the core of 

294
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,983
the toolkit for moving forward.
Our existence in 2018 is so novel that 

295
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,374
if there's one thing we can be sure of,
it's that are adaptive nature is a poor 

296
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:55,370
match for it.
So then can anything be truly timeless?

297
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,010
Is that the right question?
Well,

298
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,980
yeah,
but the way you do it is this,

299
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,700
the longer standing,
some truth of some kind is the closer it

300
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:10,310
gets to being timeless.
In other words,

301
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:14,630
if we look at things that are um,
very evolutionarily longstanding,

302
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,363
well those things have persisted through
environments that were very different 

303
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:20,594
from each other.
So what that means is that thread still 

304
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:26,270
functions irrespective to an extent of 
the context.

305
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,110
The longer it lasts,
the more likely it is to speak to truths

306
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,990
that continue to be relevant,
but the,

307
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,923
the bitter pill for modern people with 
respect to understanding the degree to 

308
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:40,964
which evolution is the key to seeing 
ourselves properly is that we live in 

309
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:54,801
circumstances that are more novel than 
almost any creature has ever faced.

310
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,940
Now,
you know a creature can,

311
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,693
you know,
fish and flop into a boat and it's 

312
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,420
suddenly a novel circumstances and it's 
dead within minutes,

313
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,170
right?
Don't tell that to the dinosaurs and the

314
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,640
media was coming.
Well,

315
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,980
there you go.
That was so novel that you know,

316
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,030
I mean dinosaurs didn't survive that one
group,

317
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,073
the birds,
you're still with us and they're doing 

318
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:14,754
great,
but we are creatures living in 

319
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,423
circumstances that are not only novel at
an unprecedented level but are changing 

320
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,220
so rapidly that even to the extent that 
we can figure out what to do,

321
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,040
the world changes out from under us.

322
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,600
We have to stop that,
right?

323
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:34,434
That is going to kill us.
That if you want to know what the 

324
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,870
greatest existential threat to humanity 
is,

325
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,140
it is the rate of change that we have 
set in motion,

326
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:46,200
which makes it impossible for us to 
adapt fast enough to it.

327
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,980
It has to be slowed down to a point that
we can catch up.

328
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,943
Is that impossible though,
because we already have that power 

329
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:56,640
because I'm with you on this.
Just from my limited knowledge of this,

330
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,740
just from what I do,
you know,

331
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,430
from doing these shows and that people 
can watch more,

332
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,273
you know,
the amount of information that you can 

333
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:06,060
intake on a given day,
the amount of things that you can share,

334
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,090
you can speed things up and listened to 
them two times as fast.

335
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,170
You can clip everything and that we can 
take all of this information.

336
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,610
Things can be live streamed like all of 
this bang,

337
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:14,941
Bang,
Bang,

338
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:15,271
Bang,
Bang,

339
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:15,691
Bang,
Bang.

340
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,430
It's happening faster.
We're learning more.

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,310
We know there's a great thirst for this.
Um,

342
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
but can it be slowed down?
I mean,

343
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,313
what,
what force could slow down progress 

344
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:30,020
really wisdom.
Um,

345
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,883
and that that's the,
that's the problem is that we are 

346
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,740
children in this landscape and children 
grow up,

347
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,060
right?
I mean,

348
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:43,140
the key to raising children properly is 
to,

349
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,033
is to back off the things that protect 
them enough that they actually get 

350
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:52,050
burned without being burned so severely 
that they're crippled.

351
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,943
In other words,
you have to experience the places that 

352
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,830
your notions are naive in order to 
become less night.

353
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,580
We are now in a situation in which we 
are behaving in a childlike fashion in,

354
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,440
you know,
in a very,

355
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,540
in a foundry or something like that.

356
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,403
Right?
We're like children running around in 

357
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:13,110
the foundry.
There's molten metal that we need to,

358
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,960
you know,
figure out how to recognize it,

359
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,020
how not to touch her were just pressing 
every button.

360
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,940
Going buttons are cool.
There's power.

361
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,940
We've got to stop doing that.
I don't think,

362
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,340
you know,
if I'm to be candid about it,

363
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,930
I don't think we are in an unrecoverable
situation.

364
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:35,790
I can see the path forward and it's all 
still plausible as far as I know,

365
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,073
but I'm worried that we won't get there 
and the reason we won't get there is 

366
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:44,010
that there are lots of things that have 
been true that just aren't true anymore.

367
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,173
In other words,
the people who are in love with a 

368
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,223
limitless market in which you can do 
anything that you can manage and it's 

369
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:52,744
all cool.
And then at the point we find out that 

370
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,474
it isn't cool.

371
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,240
We might have to take some action,
but in the meantime,

372
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,340
you know,
you're,

373
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,173
you're free to explore.
I'm very sympathetic to this view as 

374
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,470
well.
I would be sympathetic to this view if I

375
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:08,890
didn't recognize that there was a 
problem in which,

376
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,963
for example,
if you look at the way our economic 

377
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,670
system is hooked up to our political 
system,

378
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,290
there's a problem where anytime you set 
a new force in motion in the market,

379
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,850
if that force pays a at a high rate in 
the short term,

380
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,490
but it costs at a high rate in the 
longterm,

381
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,680
by the time you get around to 
discovering the costs in the long term,

382
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,600
it has found its way into the political 
system so that it cannot be reversed.

383
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,240
You can't have a system in which you 
can't reverse things.

384
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,103
So this,
the simplest way to frame this would be 

385
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:41,050
some sort of crony capitalism kind of 
thing,

386
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:41,884
right?

387
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,780
Well,
you know,

388
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,843
we're not,
we're not truly free market because 

389
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,310
we've politicized a competition 
basically.

390
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,751
Well,
you know,

391
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:53,440
I try to look at everything through an 
evolutionary lens and to me,

392
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,550
politics and economics are just one more
landscape.

393
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,680
And they're interesting because it's 
humans and humans are,

394
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,910
um,
especially capable in this regard.

395
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,080
But the,
um,

396
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,023
the natural tendency for a creature that
has found its way into a niche is to 

397
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:15,934
protect its access to that niche.
And the way creatures do that is they 

398
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,640
freeze other creatures out.
So there is this natural pattern,

399
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,230
and I mean I can't not see it now that 
I,

400
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,273
now that I've understood that it exists.
There's this natural pattern where the 

401
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:32,944
upstarts who succeed,
the stories that we know we don't know 

402
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,144
about the upstarts that failed mostly,
but you have startups that succeed end 

403
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:44,290
up tremendously powerful.
And then they go through this process in

404
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,124
which they become hostile to upstart 
newness and they become hostile to 

405
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,164
upstart and us for the most natural of 
reasons which is that their wellbeing 

406
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,860
depends on shutting down the process 
through which they became successful.

407
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,903
So this could be like facebook buying 
all of their competitors and things of 

408
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,140
that nature.
It's the,

409
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,513
let's put it this way,
there are obvious versions and then 

410
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:09,400
there are innumerable versions that are 
cryptic and we,

411
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,313
we're never going to understand the 
whole landscape of ways in which those 

412
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:17,230
who have reached this level of power 
that you and I will only dream about,

413
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,110
that they will then shut down the access
to others.

414
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,193
It's like there's a,
I don't even want to call it a 

415
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:26,320
conspiracy because it doesn't have to 
have any consciousness to it at all,

416
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,270
but there is a tendency for,
um,

417
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,650
for those who have succeeded to shut 
down the,

418
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,890
the mechanisms through which they 
succeed.

419
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,753
I mean,
you can see this with a people 

420
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,013
frequently remarking on the fact that 
immigrants are often not that wildly 

421
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:47,270
enthusiastic about immigration.
Why is that?

422
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,440
For obvious reasons.
You know,

423
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,293
you're talking about do people who've 
just entered at the bottom of the 

424
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,890
economic ladder want more competition?
Well,

425
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,583
they're actually a.
there's a tension between what people 

426
00:23:58,941 --> 00:23:59,774
should want that you shouldn't imagine 
that there's some immigrant ness that 

427
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,110
necessarily has you favorable to anybody
else who has that label.

428
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,203
Does this also sort of explain a little 
bit of what's happening in the tech 

429
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,940
world right now in terms of it seems 
that these companies,

430
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:13,780
twitter,
facebook,

431
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:14,614
youtube,
are potentially at least using 

432
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:20,590
algorithms against their own audience,
a shadow banning people.

433
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:25,591
I mean that they are basically now 
turning against their own people because

434
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:30,841
of their whatever they perceive to be 
their own protection or longterm health.

435
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:32,980
Even though I would probably argue in 
most cases,

436
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:34,840
that's not really what's going to 
happen.

437
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,920
Oh,
without question.

438
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:41,430
This is what's going on and let's put it
this way.

439
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,310
If you're at the top,
if you're in that strata,

440
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,840
you have a lot to lose through anything 
you can't predict,

441
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,963
and so there is a way in which we expect
the upstart who got there through some 

442
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:58,044
sort of radical transformation to be 
favorable throughout a radical 

443
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,434
transformation.
But the way we should understand it is 

444
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:03,744
that once you've gotten there,
radical transformation becomes 

445
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:06,744
threatening and you start to 
conservatizing evolutionary force and 

446
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,153
you know,
we can look at what twitter is playing 

447
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:19,821
with these days with a potentially 
eliminating like some follower counts.

448
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,760
You know,
at a breathtaking act of paternalism,

449
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,780
you know,
at best and are doing it for us,

450
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,621
for us,
right?

451
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:31,290
Because we shouldn't be so concerned 
about who's paying attention.

452
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:35,590
But really the truth is,
as much as we all recognize that there's

453
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,320
a problem with,
you know,

454
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,270
tweeting to get trivial likes,
on the other hand,

455
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,460
understanding what your audience hears,
what they find favorable,

456
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:51,540
what doesn't ring true to them is the 
way you learn,

457
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,374
it's the way you steer.
And so effectively twitter is playing 

458
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:59,640
with blinding us so that we can say 
whatever we want into the void,

459
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,450
but we have no idea how it,
there's no ping back to you basically.

460
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,180
And so,
you know,

461
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,610
I mean,
I don't need to tell you,

462
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,070
you're a comic,
you're standing in front of the room and

463
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:08,630
you get a

464
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,880
lot better when they laugh.
It's better,

465
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,450
it's better when they laugh.
Yeah,

466
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:13,640
exactly.
Yeah.

467
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,850
Um,
what should we be thinking,

468
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,840
you know what,
before I get to that.

469
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,240
So as you know,
I was just in a,

470
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:21,074
in Europe and I did a bunch of the 
Scandinavian and Nordic countries and 

471
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,063
uh,
Sweden was a particularly interesting 

472
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:30,500
case because I know that our fifth most 
viewed country for this show is Sweden,

473
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,560
which is sort of fascinating considering
how tiny Sweden is.

474
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,530
Uh,
so I,

475
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,770
I sort of circled that we did two shows 
in Sweden.

476
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:39,200
I kind of circled them on the calendar 
because I was like,

477
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:42,260
something's going on in Sweden.
I want to figure out what it is now.

478
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,690
I thought if you would've asked me 
before I did the show that first night,

479
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,760
I thought it was gonna have a lot to do 
with immigration.

480
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,463
What I realized,
although there were a lot of questions 

481
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,414
about immigration at the end,
it had much more to do with gender and 

482
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:56,874
what is happening to their highly 
egalitarian society that have done most 

483
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,220
of the things related to gender and true
equality correctly for many,

484
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,054
many years.
And all of our friends on the left 

485
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,170
always point to Sweden and Norway and 
Finland.

486
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,004
These countries that I was just as the 
examples of their perfect societies and 

487
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:16,880
they're really struggling with certain 
things that you know,

488
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:17,714
that the government's forcing them to 
have genderless kindergartens and that 

489
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:21,534
the,
the emasculation of men and the removal 

490
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,623
of the father and that they have 
supposedly Europe's first feminist 

491
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,823
government and all of these things.
So I thought as long as I have you here 

492
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:33,744
and since gender seems to be such an 
endlessly a provocative and also 

493
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,490
misunderstood topic,
um,

494
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,420
what should we do on gender right now?

495
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,860
Yeah.
Um,

496
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,940
well beyond you going to Sweden and 
figuring out what's going on there.

497
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,971
Something.
Well,

498
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,804
what struck me as is that they've done 
everything right in effect in terms of 

499
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:58,050
egalitarianism and they've done it for,
for decades now.

500
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,750
They've done it right.
And when they got to the end,

501
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,910
which is now,
and they got to the current day,

502
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,700
they realized that despite all of this 
equality,

503
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:06,534
men and women are still different.
That women still care more about people 

504
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,184
and men still care more about things.
So even though they've been given the 

505
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,274
exact same opportunity,
women are still becoming nurses and men 

506
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:18,774
are still becoming engineers and it's 
like the social justice warriors or 

507
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:22,584
whatever you want to call that crew,
they still don't like the results of 

508
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:30,030
true equality.
So I think that's why Sweden's in such a

509
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,800
weird place,
the average person's like,

510
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:32,910
what?
We've done it right,

511
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,980
we did it right.
Everyone's equal.

512
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:35,814
You can do whatever we want,
but then the result isn't being allowed 

513
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,110
to be accepted.
Does that,

514
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,270
does that make some sense?
Oh,

515
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,630
it makes perfect sense.
In fact,

516
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:42,930
right?

517
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,190
I think the,
uh,

518
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,360
the naive left finds the failure of its 
hypothesis absolutely galling.

519
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,523
And so they're effectively trying to 
erase that failure by hard coding the 

520
00:28:59,011 --> 00:28:59,844
solution into government.
So I think that's exactly what's 

521
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:05,010
happening in Sweden right now.
And it's tragic.

522
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:08,400
And with respect to sex and gender,
it is so needless,

523
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,443
right?
The fact is the truth of sex and gender 

524
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,413
is,
there are parts of it we don't fully 

525
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:16,020
understand yet,
but in general,

526
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,003
actually we do.
We pretty much understand how we got 

527
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:22,770
here.
And the truth is,

528
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,370
it is asymmetrical.
It is a complimentary.

529
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,090
The truth of male and female is a 
complimentary truth.

530
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,420
It may be largely irrelevant in the 
present.

531
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,523
In other words,
technology has eliminated most of the 

532
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:45,220
basis on which the division of labor 
between men and women initially evolved.

533
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,810
So I think we have actually an 
opportunity here to become,

534
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,673
to behave in an enlightened fashion that
the the easiest place to solve this 

535
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:55,420
problem,
insects and gender,

536
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,523
what we should do is pretty clear and it
is not hard to ground and evolutionary 

537
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:05,980
theory because unlike other places like 
a race,

538
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:09,130
for example,
we do know what to think with respect to

539
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,090
sex and gender and the.

540
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,943
The basic outline is this.
Men and women are different for 

541
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:14,944
historical reasons.
The basis for that difference and the 

542
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:23,371
utility of that difference has largely 
been neutralized by the modern world.

543
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,920
We don't need to retain those 
distinctions,

544
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:34,120
but some of those distinctions are built
in at a deeper level than others.

545
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:34,983
So meaning you could potentially be a 
stay at home dad and that could be 

546
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:38,134
perfectly fine,
but that probably for evolutionary 

547
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:44,290
reasons is not going to be the thing 
that usually happens,

548
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,780
right?
But here's your would be my point.

549
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,040
We can democratize access to almost 
every with respect to sex and gender,

550
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:55,744
there are very few places where we 
actually need to have some asymmetry in 

551
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,370
access,
but probably,

552
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,533
you know,
the firefighter who comes into the 

553
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:07,684
burning building through the roof to 
pull you out when you're panicking and 

554
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,210
you don't know what to do because you've
never been in a fire before.

555
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,220
Um,
on average,

556
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:17,680
that should probably be a guy.
They're just better built for it.

557
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,850
If there's a woman who is well enough 
able to do it,

558
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,803
should you be picky about the 
firefighter who plucks you out of the 

559
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,290
burning building?
Absolutely not.

560
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:29,200
I mean,
I personally am thrilled to see it every

561
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,780
time it runs against the narrative that 
we expect.

562
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,543
You know,
I,

563
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,800
uh,
I'm very fond of Stacey Brown,

564
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,963
the police chief at Evergreen,
who was driven out along with heather 

565
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,043
and me.
I thought it was great that she was 

566
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,360
female and that she was a,
an excellent cop.

567
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,893
So I'm,
I'm up for the narrative being broken 

568
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:50,170
by,
by,

569
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,840
uh,
by reality as often as possible,

570
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:53,674
but you democratize the access,
but you don't force people to do what 

571
00:31:58,811 --> 00:31:59,644
they otherwise would for one thing,
you wouldn't even want to force it 

572
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:05,830
because for every job that you would,
you know,

573
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,503
force women into at some higher rate,
let's say engineering jobs because it 

574
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:12,490
sounds like a good thing to do.

575
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,413
There are some awful job that men are 
disproportionately represented in that 

576
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,910
you would also have to force them into 
to be fair.

577
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:23,800
So you democratize the access.
You recognize that the division of Labor

578
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,663
that we have,
that we have inherited is largely 

579
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,090
outdated.
Um,

580
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,430
but you don't override people's a 
choice,

581
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,663
you know,
if,

582
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,150
if women,
if you democratize access to engineering

583
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,270
perfectly and women go into it at equal 
rates,

584
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,190
great.
If they don't,

585
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,340
that's cool too.
Um,

586
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,040
so in any case,
it's,

587
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,120
it's a question of allowing liberty to 
decide where people go after you've done

588
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,620
away with unnecessary barrier.

589
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,120
Well,
it's so interesting because I think then

590
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:57,950
you hit it right on the head that,
well,

591
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:58,784
Sweden's now politicizing it.
They're making a point of making this 

592
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:01,844
political because they will not accept 
the science of what they've done 

593
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,763
correctly.
And I think at that is what is what has 

594
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:12,600
led this sort of average person there to
go this,

595
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,050
this is just not right.
So it's,

596
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,363
I don't know what the way out is and I 
sense that most of the people there 

597
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,310
didn't know what the way I was.
Well,

598
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,060
I mean,

599
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,560
the way out really is to recognize that 
the,

600
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,220
the ire of the authoritarian left on 
this point is actually indicative of the

601
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,450
whole problem.
In other words,

602
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,180
because sex and gender is more or less 
clear,

603
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,560
the desire to erase it,
irrespective of the collateral damage is

604
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,110
an indicator of just how wrong this path
is.

605
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,390
So,
you know,

606
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,250
I find this all the time where people 
have,

607
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,263
if you're not focused on biology and 
you're focused on the world that you 

608
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,260
find in your galled by,
uh,

609
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,930
by inequality,
then you think,

610
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:04,490
well,
let's just solve the inequality.

611
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:05,324
Which is hard code the solution,
but then you hard code the solution and 

612
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:09,524
it says men and women of the same to the
extent that there's any difference in 

613
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:13,724
what they choose to do,
that's the result of a either cryptic 

614
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,480
barriers or internalized misogyny or 
whatever,

615
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,840
and then the problem is you're now 
interfering with my biology class.

616
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,753
You're now telling me that we that the 
received wisdom is that men and women 

617
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:29,744
are the same thing.
When I know damn well that can't be 

618
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:31,814
right,
so you don't want to build a solution 

619
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,070
that forces you to confront your 
biologists,

620
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,170
physicists,
your statisticians,

621
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,393
right?
You want all of these stories to the 

622
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:46,370
extent that they're true,
have to reconcile all true stories,

623
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,204
records to the extent that you've got a 
naive notion over here and you want to 

624
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,453
just write it in because it seems very 
important to you and you're willing to 

625
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:56,660
tolerate all of the cascading effects 
elsewhere.

626
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,580
You don't belong in a position of power.

627
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,503
Unfortunately though,
a lot of those people are in a position 

628
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:03,084
to power and I think we're seeing more 
of them get into positions of power and 

629
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:08,340
I think it's also now having a counter 
effect in Europe,

630
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:09,174
which is why we're seeing the rise of 
more far right parties because people 

631
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:14,310
are just like,
screw this,

632
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,340
this is so wrong.
I'm going to take my chances over here.

633
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,420
People who inherently are not say far 
right or certainly not racist,

634
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,493
are now playing with people that perhaps
they wouldn't have played with before 

635
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:28,410
because they're so sick of this and I.
and I'm worried where that leads us.

636
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,040
Oh,
I think,

637
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,980
I think this is exact and I've,
I've heard you say this,

638
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:31,814
is that you were afraid that the,
the lunacy over on the authoritarian 

639
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:37,400
left is actually going to,
you know,

640
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,020
it's collapsed.
It's going to leave people who otherwise

641
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:43,290
wouldn't play ball with the far right 
over there,

642
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,870
but not because they're racist.
That's the key to this.

643
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:47,704
It's not that they'll suddenly become 
wake up and be racist or hate women or 

644
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:51,364
hate gays,
but it will be such a disgust of 

645
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,880
reality.
And,

646
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,723
and,
and a rejection of what's provable that 

647
00:35:57,701 --> 00:36:00,460
they'll going to be like,
at least there's something over here.

648
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:02,080
I mean,
it's awful bargain,

649
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,970
but I think it is.
I think,

650
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,280
I just think it is.
I see this,

651
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,840
uh,

652
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,240
frequently where people,
you know,

653
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,163
because they detect that there's 
something wrong with communism and 

654
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,144
socialism are often driven,
right pretty far into the let's not 

655
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:24,411
regulate anything camp and the answer is
actually have to regulate stuff just out

656
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,930
of a desire to continue as a species.
So,

657
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,033
you know,
I don't want to see people driven 

658
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,950
because there's something wrong over 
here.

659
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,784
I don't want people to be driven into,
into a reactionary position that is not 

660
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,073
justified.
The thing on sex and gender though is 

661
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,283
maybe this is the key question.
Every reasonable person who just simply 

662
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,300
observes the world knows that men and 
women are not the same thing.

663
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,190
They know that,
uh,

664
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,143
those differences have an implication 
for the way we view all sorts of things 

665
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:00,810
like mating and dating,
what careers we want to have,

666
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,620
how we view risk and all of these things
for historical reasons.

667
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,753
All reasonable people can infer that 
from just their own observations of the 

668
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:09,714
world.
You are now confronted with people who 

669
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,650
insist that you not acknowledge what you
can see.

670
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,440
Those people are crazy,
right?

671
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,393
They're dangerously out of control.
They are dangerously out of control on 

672
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:26,550
other topics where it's harder to know 
what's true,

673
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,870
but you wouldn't want people who were so
naive as to argue that men and women are

674
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,460
effectively identical,
but for depression,

675
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,593
in charge of any policy,
you don't want them in charge of 

676
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:39,570
economic policy,
in charge of,

677
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,650
uh,
you know,

678
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,690
a prisons,
anything.

679
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,063
Um,
so having seen just how far their 

680
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,400
confusion goes,
can we all agree to shut them out of the

681
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:53,244
discussion about how power is to be 
wilted and the rest of us can have a 

682
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,830
discussion about what our values are,
what we think we know,

683
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,440
what we don't yet know,
and what its implications are.

684
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,603
That that's the place we should go.
That seems like an effective ending 

685
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:08,400
here.
Unless you want to throw in one more.

686
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,490
Did we not hit something that's been 
rattling around in your brain?

687
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,270
Actually,
he's a know I covered a lot of territory

688
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:15,870
here.
Yeah.

689
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,520
All right,
well it's always a pleasure sitting down

690
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:20,040
and India.
And you joined me last night for standup

691
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,530
in Bray California.
This will be up already,

692
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:24,450
but you're joining me tonight and 
Oxnard,

693
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,960
I'm turning into a standup comic,
which is a biologist.

694
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:28,810
Worst nightmare.
No,

695
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,620
no,
it's a,

696
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,390
it's not quite the,
uh,

697
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,413
the thing where you're,
the lead singer of your favorite band 

698
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:35,574
has laryngitis

699
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,983
data,
but it's about as close as I could hope 

700
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:39,371
to go.
Yeah.

701
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:40,740
All right.
Well we're going to do this.

702
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,500
Will do.
Well,

703
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,540
we did it about a year ago after the 
original line,

704
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,730
but we'll do this more than once a year 
because you're,

705
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,490
you're right in the center of all the 
things that I think are,

706
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,610
are right at the moment and for more on 
Brett,

707
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,563
follow him on twitter as long as they 
can track how many followers he has at 

708
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,334
Bret Weinstein.
