1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,210
I think a healthy dose of skepticism is 
one of the most important attributes one

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,044
can have,
but also saying most of us could use a 

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,414
little more of.
You guys know I'm big on definitions 

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,534
around here,
so let's actually define the word 

5
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,204
skepticism before we go any further.
An attitude of doubt or disposition to 

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:22,830
incredulity either in general or toward 
a particular object.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,113
The doctrine that true knowledge or 
knowledge in a particular area is 

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,690
uncertain.
The method of suspended judgment,

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:34,890
systemic doubt or criticism,
characteristic of skeptics,

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,240
doubt concerning basic religious 
principles as a mortality,

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,343
providence and revelation.
So all skepticism really is then is the 

12
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:47,730
desire for more information before 
making a judgment.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,930
This seems like a really simple and 
pretty obvious concept,

14
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:54,750
yet we're so lacking it in our public 
discourse.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,913
We're so quick to dismiss people.
The second they say something we don't 

16
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,070
like.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,710
We ignore evidence when it doesn't fit 
our narrative,

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,550
and too often we pick sides when we 
don't really know the facts.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,683
This is why pundits on cable networks,
radio and online media or yelling all 

20
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,244
the time,
instead of making a compelling argument 

21
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:13,974
based on fact and reason,
they just yell with righteous 

22
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:17,454
indignation.
So you think that what they're saying 

23
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,930
must be true after all,
they're really fired up.

24
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,690
So they must have a true indecent cause,
right?

25
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,090
Well,
usually the opposite is true.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,310
Of course,
it's not just these talking heads.

27
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,380
You could use a healthy dose of 
skepticism.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,513
We're in the midst of an election year,
so all of us should be skeptical of 

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,843
everything.
Each one of these politicians running 

30
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,230
for office says,
we shouldn't take their word for it.

31
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,064
Instead,
we should question whether what they're 

32
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,690
saying is true,
and take the time to learn the facts.

33
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,080
Politicians prey on an uninformed,
uninterested,

34
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:49,914
and non skeptical electorate.
It's our job as citizens to make them 

35
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:53,934
more honest and more forthright.
Pretty sure we all know they're not 

36
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,430
gonna do that on their own.
Going even deeper.

37
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,790
It's not just pundits and politicians we
should be skeptical about,

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,620
but it's also our very selves.
The word skeptic even has a slight tinge

39
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,180
of negativity to it,
right?

40
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:09,661
Like,
oh,

41
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,580
he's a skeptic.
You better watch out for him.

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,013
All the skeptic actually wants is more 
information to form an opinion on the 

43
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,400
world in a rational way using facts and 
proven methods.

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,533
Sure,
that's not as comforting as blind faith 

45
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,814
and it certainly isn't as easy,
but perhaps the satisfaction is in the 

46
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:27,654
journey of questioning.
My guest this week is Michael Shermer 

47
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,554
and author who has written much on this 
subject and as a thought leader in the 

48
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,830
skeptic movement using science 
improvable methods.

49
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,500
He talks about how we can have morality 
that is based,

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,630
in fact,
not fiction.

51
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,853
It's a harder road,
but it is one that more and more people 

52
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:49,440
seem to be taking.
It's also an idea I try to use in all my

53
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,630
interviews.
I'm the first to admit that I don't know

54
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:56,430
everything and I'm genuinely curious to 
learn from people of all walks of life.

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,940
Talking directly to them is one of the 
ways that we can actually do that.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,073
One hundred 40 characters is nice,
but there's nothing like the true 

57
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,910
personal connection.
At the end of the day,

58
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:11,320
none of us truly know the meaning of 
life and the answer to the big questions

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,010
we can think we can guess we can create,
we can destroy,

60
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:15,844
but we simply cannot know.
It's the age old question that will 

61
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:19,594
remain until the end of time in a way 
not knowing is perhaps the most human 

62
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,940
trait there is.
So when preachers,

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,793
politicians are conspiracy theorists 
tell you they know what's really going 

64
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,694
on,
just know that they're full of 

65
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,340
something,
but it ain't knowledge.

66
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,110
Michael Shermer is the author of many 
books,

67
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:38,944
the founding publisher of skeptic 
magazine and is very skeptical of 

68
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,540
everything I'm saying right now.

69
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,330
Welcome to the show.
You are a professional skeptic.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,180
Yeah.
As a worrier.

71
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,043
Well,
given that I publish a magazine called 

72
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:54,520
skeptical,
I guess that's technically

73
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,281
true.
Yeah.

74
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:57,860
And you run skeptic.com.
So you've got the.

75
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,020
We've got a book called skeptic right 
here.

76
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,570
Yeah.
You're a skeptical dude.

77
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,210
I am not by nature necessarily.
I.

78
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,153
I would like to believe lots of things.
I'd like to believe that the stock 

79
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,370
market is not catered cratering this 
week.

80
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,730
You know,
I'd like to believe that,

81
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,301
uh,
you know,

82
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,000
aliens are out there and visiting us,
you know,

83
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,670
there's a lot of things.
If there was an afterlife,

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,533
you know,
I'd like to live for centuries to see 

85
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,160
how all this turns out,
you know,

86
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,780
but the fact that I'd like it to be true
doesn't make it true,

87
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,614
so I have to kind of override my own 
subjective biases and preferences in 

88
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,060
favor of the facts,
which is sometimes hard to fake.

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,113
Yeah.
So I started the show by talking about 

90
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:41,771
reason and using logic and science to 
get a sense of morality,

91
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:45,410
which you've written a lot about.
But before we get into that,

92
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,244
I want to talk a little bit about your 
history and your sort of evolution to 

93
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:50,360
getting to where you are.
Uh,

94
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,820
so you weren't,
you didn't grow up religious,

95
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:53,654
right?
You became religious for a small period 

96
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,220
of time around high school or late high 
school.

97
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,240
Yeah.
Well,

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,380
I was a evangelical born again 
Christian,

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,920
a in highschool and college for my four 
years undergraduate.

100
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,010
And in the start of graduates,
let's talk about seven years total.

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,310
My parents weren't religious,
but they weren't antireligious,

102
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,144
you know,
back then the whole atheism thing was 

103
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,514
not a thing.
It was just something that most people 

104
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:16,614
didn't talk about.
But the born again movement was kind of 

105
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:21,270
picking up in the seventies and my 
friends were into it in high school,

106
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,200
so you know,
it's that,

107
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,034
that sort of after parental influence 
and there's peer group influence and 

108
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,870
that's was my case.
My friends were doing it.

109
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,070
I remember my friend frank was really 
religious and when I became,

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,313
became a born again,
it happened at a Presbyterian church 

111
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:35,664
because this other friend of mine went 
there and when I came back to school on 

112
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:42,810
Monday until Frank I did it,
I went to the Presbyterian church.

113
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,431
He goes,
no,

114
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,790
no,
that's the wrong one.

115
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,970
Which one did he wait?
He was Jehovah witness.

116
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,340
Yeah.
So I'm like,

117
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,000
wrong one.
Oh,

118
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,100
okay.
So that was my first inkling that,

119
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,560
okay,
there's these little factions and tribes

120
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:56,394
even within the,
within the Christian Christianity 

121
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,580
Movement and anyway,
but I take it fairly seriously.

122
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:04,610
And I went to Bible classes and then I 
went to pepperdine,

123
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,480
which is a church of Christ school,
very conservative jury.

124
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,400
President Ford came to speak and you 
know,

125
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,234
it was,
uh,

126
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,700
it was in a bubble where everybody 
believed and you know,

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,510
when you're in the bubble 
psychologically it makes sense,

128
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,583
logically coherent,
it's internally consistent and 

129
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
everything falls into place.
And it's not really until you're out of 

130
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,500
the bubble and you encounter other 
worldviews that you think,

131
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,610
Huh,
you know,

132
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,760
maybe maybe mine's not so solid as I 
thought.

133
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,160
And that was how I kind of chipped away 
at it later.

134
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,123
Right.
So what kind of stuff were you 

135
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:36,744
questioning before you got into the 
bubble that led you to jumping in and 

136
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:42,460
becoming born again?
And actually before you,

137
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,920
uh,
before I let you answer that,

138
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,963
when you're born again,
I always think of born again as someone 

139
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,530
that's left the religion and comeback.
And that's why they are born again.

140
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,900
Born again,
just means

141
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,950
you're born physically and then you're 
born again.

142
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:58,070
When you accept Jesus as your savior,
it's sort of a new.

143
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,070
You start life anew and you get eternal 
life.

144
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,850
Because you've accepted,
Jesus says,

145
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:06,200
that's what they mean by born again and,
and evangelical.

146
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,270
They mean you were supposed to 
evangelize.

147
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,230
So this is why evangelicals are always 
talking to people about Jesus,

148
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,780
where they hold up the placards at 
sporting events.

149
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,170
John Three 16,
for God so loved the world.

150
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,660
He gave his only begotten son for you.
And they,

151
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,240
they were the black face and football 
with the three John Three 16,

152
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,860
right?

153
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,690
And then they thank God after they win.

154
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,630
Yeah.
So the idea is that,

155
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,280
uh,
you,

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,710
you wear it on your sleeve,
you know,

157
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,130
you're the,
the shining beacon on the hill.

158
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:37,131
You do not hide your faith underneath of
a Bushel basket to you tell people about

159
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:38,634
it in a way you kind of have a moral 
obligation to do so because if you know 

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,553
that this is the way,
the truth and the light and you get 

161
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,920
eternal eternity for this person's soul,
you really have to tell them about it.

162
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,470
They're missing out.
So it's not like the old school,

163
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,280
like maybe George H,
w Bush's,

164
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,743
uh,
you know,

165
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,390
he was a methodist and they're pretty 
quiet about it.

166
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:01,680
You know,
you believe what you believe.

167
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,960
I believe what I believe and we just 
don't talk about it.

168
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,060
A evangelicals not like that.
They're more like h,

169
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,490
George,
w dot Bush,

170
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:09,324
you know,
you tell people Jesus was my favorite 

171
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:14,670
philosopher and I'm a born again.
And you witnessed people literally going

172
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,340
door to door and I did that.
I've knocked justly.

173
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:17,740
So.

174
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,590
So you did all that and then you're in 
the bubble.

175
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:24,220
And then what caused the chipping away 
that led you to sit here?

176
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,540
Well,
I went to graduate school,

177
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,190
uh,
at cal state Fullerton,

178
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,350
which is a secular school and said,
and it's not.

179
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:31,510
Again,
it wasn't that atheism was a big thing.

180
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,850
It was just that no one was religious or
if they were,

181
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:34,684
they were quiet about it.
And so I began taking classes in social 

182
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:40,120
psychology,
anthropology,

183
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,190
and I can see the psychological basis of
belief and where you happen to have been

184
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,090
born determines what you believe.
And particularly in anthropology,

185
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:52,780
you study all these indigenous peoples 
who never even heard of Jesus Christ,

186
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,860
let alone Christianity or anything that 
you know.

187
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:56,401
And it's like,
well,

188
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,320
why?
Why would they be condemned?

189
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,380
They didn't even know about it.
You know,

190
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:00,841
so.
Oh well,

191
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,790
they know God has a special place for 
them.

192
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,560
Little waste station or something.
You know,

193
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,180
what about the Jews?
I mean they,

194
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,014
you know,
they believe pretty much everything I 

195
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:08,280
believe.

196
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,110
But except Jesus.
Well,

197
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:11,700
if God has a special place,
okay,

198
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,550
well how does,
how does this all work?

199
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,384
You know?
And Yeah.

200
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,420
And then also the problem of evil.
I never thought that they see that Chris

201
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,180
Theologians provided a cogent answer to 
that.

202
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,070
Why bad things happen to good people.
And I don't mean like homicide case that

203
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,480
we have a human nature.
We're sinful,

204
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,820
so people do bad things.
That's the quick answer to that.

205
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,010
Why childhood leukemia?
You know,

206
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:37,011
why tsunamis that wipe out entire 
villages have tiny children that,

207
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:37,830
you know,
why should,

208
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,380
why do they have to suffer?
Sure.

209
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,540
And beyond the,
because God works in mysterious ways and

210
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,480
he has a plan for everybody,
which was never satisfying to me.

211
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,410
You know,
that pretty much did it in a.

212
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,760
and then finally,
while I wrote about this,

213
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,150
uh,
you know,

214
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,320
my girlfriend at the time was in a car 
accident and broke her back and uh,

215
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,840
and I was pretty much on the way out at 
that point,

216
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,680
but I remember it being at the emergency
room thinking this poor woman.

217
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:04,650
I mean,
she is the sweetest lady and w why would

218
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,450
this happen to her?
This is not right,

219
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,783
you know,
so I sort of made one last ditch effort 

220
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,490
and prayed,
you know,

221
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:12,324
and it,
it's not that this was the big test and 

222
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,540
if it fails and I won't believe it,
it's just like,

223
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,090
you know,
what course he's still paralyzed today.

224
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,960
And I was like,
okay,

225
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,441
I,
you know,

226
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,900
I just don't think there's anybody up 
there pulling the strings.

227
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,823
Yeah.
So why do you think so many people are 

228
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:28,260
just afraid to say,
I don't know,

229
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,393
because that seems to me to be the real 
question and the real basis of sort of 

230
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,224
everything that you do.
You're not proclaiming to know any sort 

231
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:38,570
of wisdom that I don't know.
Right?

232
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,961
I mean,
we,

233
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:39,794
we know different things,
but you're not proclaiming to have the 

234
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:44,520
answers and people are so afraid of that
question.

235
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:45,780
What do you,
what do you think that's about?

236
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:46,911
Uh,
well,

237
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,770
I think cognitively we know now that 
once you comprehend a,

238
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,540
an idea,
a concept,

239
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,950
uh,
anything,

240
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,890
uh,
the brain automatically just believes it

241
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,724
to be true.
Just accepts it as part of the factual 

242
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:01,304
world that is.
And then being skeptical of it or 

243
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:06,200
saying,
I don't know.

244
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,650
I'm not sure I challenges is an extra 
cognitive load.

245
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,030
You can do it.
Lots of people do.

246
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,320
So think of the difference between type 
one and type two thinking type one.

247
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,450
Cognition is rapid,
intuitive,

248
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:18,284
instinctive,
emotional type two thinking is 

249
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,980
deliberate,
slow,

250
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,300
methodical,
rational,

251
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,820
and,
and,

252
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,480
and most of our thought processes that 
we initiate our type one,

253
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,314
we just kind of a feeling about things 
we gut instinct go about the world and 

254
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,070
type two requires,
okay wait,

255
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,820
let me stop and think about maybe I 
shouldn't make that investment.

256
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:40,820
Maybe I'd better not marry this person.
Maybe I shouldn't buy that company.

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,790
Whatever it is that requires additional 
steps.

258
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,250
So that's an extra cognitive load.
It's uncomfortable,

259
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,720
it takes time.
Um,

260
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,230
and uh,
anyway.

261
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,083
Uh,
and that's true with religious beliefs 

262
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,100
think,
you know,

263
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,800
it just feels like,
you know,

264
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,730
the earth is the center of everything.
We're,

265
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,180
we're the center of creation.
God's here for me,

266
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,060
it,
it just,

267
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,230
you know,
everything that happens,

268
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,380
happens for a reason.
It just kinda feels right.

269
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,383
So it's really just,
I mean it's just as simple as comfort 

270
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,294
really is what you were saying.
It's just like there is some stuff out 

271
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:11,384
there that I don't understand and I 
better just pick this belief because 

272
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,540
then I don't have to spend that much 
mental energy.

273
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,890
It's almost like a,
you know,

274
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,620
the creationist arguments or arguments 
with people about,

275
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,160
you know,
who built the pyramids or whatever.

276
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,940
It's just,
well God did it or the aliens did it.

277
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,090
And then,
and then for me to deconstruct the whole

278
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,980
thing,
like in a debate or on a TV show,

279
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,940
you know,
I have to go through,

280
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,810
well,
how do you know what happened?

281
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,930
I got 15 minutes to explain natural 
selection or,

282
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,040
you know,
whatever.

283
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,920
It's just easier to go,
oh,

284
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,420
God did it man.

285
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,390
So there's some of that.
Also,

286
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:45,224
the way our technology works now,
we're twitter of 140 characters and 

287
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,630
buying of six seconds and all of these 
things.

288
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,480
Those are what you just described it.
Those are type one thinking,

289
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,314
right?
Because it's just quick easy stuff and 

290
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:02,090
this I guess is type two where we're 
actually going in and out of an idea,

291
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,280
but in a way it would be really hard for
type two to ever win the great debate,

292
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,630
right?
You just don't have time.

293
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,720
It does win,
but it takes time and it's delivered and

294
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,880
it takes effort.
It's uncomfortable.

295
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,690
You know,
sam is a doctoral thesis,

296
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:21,680
was based on this idea of scanning 
brains while they read a while.

297
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,960
People read statements that are 
obviously true,

298
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:25,490
obviously fall through.
You can't tell,

299
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:28,350
you just don't know any show that,
uh,

300
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,180
that,
that,

301
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,013
that the brain activity is very rapid 
and simple and easy and positively 

302
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:37,730
reinforced with dopamine for questions 
that were obviously true or false.

303
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,610
The ones where you had to deliberate on 
and so on,

304
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,920
where the areas of the brain that lit 
up,

305
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,990
we're not,
not only did it happen slower,

306
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,824
but they were associated with things 
like bad smell and discussed and 

307
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,150
negative emotions,
so really you know,

308
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,390
an idea that stinks or an idea that's 
been,

309
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,640
in other words,
being skeptical saying,

310
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,563
I now comprehend this and I doubted it's
a little bit like why line is 

311
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:01,934
cognitively a heavier load because you 
have to know what the truth is and then 

312
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,130
take another step and go,
okay,

313
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:07,964
now I'm going to manipulate the truth in
this particular way and I have to 

314
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:13,280
remember both of those and then maybe 
you tell it to a third person.

315
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,050
Now you've got three different stories 
you've got,

316
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,173
so that load gets heavier and it's 
harder and it's just easier to go the 

317
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:20,354
simple route.

318
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,263
Yeah.
Did you happen to see Sam's blog post 

319
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,610
around Christmas time about lighting,
lighting a fire?

320
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,673
Oh yes.
It was a really interesting piece 

321
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,120
because a lot of what we're talking 
about,

322
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:30,954
it's not just couched in religion.
I think that's what his point was that 

323
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:37,980
he said he was saying that we're all 
comforted by a nice fireplace fire,

324
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,963
but then he goes into the carcinogens 
and toxins and all this horrible stuff 

325
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,540
and I read it that day and then I did 
light a fire to that.

326
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,600
I think it was.
I think I read it on Christmas Eve and I

327
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:52,580
lit a fire and I think it illustrated 
his point perfectly.

328
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:55,760
Like we have this idea,
we really like the fire,

329
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,594
right?
It's a really nice comforting thing and 

330
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,750
then we can cognitively know that it's 
doing a lot of damage to us.

331
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:06,500
So not all crazy beliefs and crazy 
actions are sort of based in religion.

332
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,020
That's right.
I mean it goes across the spectrum.

333
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,243
Again,
aliens or deities for atheist is like 

334
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:15,710
all of them were even if you don't 
believe in God,

335
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,220
but there's somebody out there who is 
looking out for us,

336
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,050
who knows we're here,
you know,

337
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,780
loves this.
Maybe looking out for us morally,

338
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:24,614
something like that.
That's kind of how aliens are described 

339
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:29,570
in a way.
It is like somebody cares about me.

340
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,310
It's like the fire,
it makes you feel good.

341
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,760
The afterlife is like that as well.
You know,

342
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,930
we're all set.
Scores are settled,

343
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,981
you know,
were,

344
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:37,814
were,
were you get to have the perfect body 

345
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,530
and you're 29 years old and uh,
you know,

346
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,390
and so on and,
and,

347
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,520
and all justice is served and that just 
feels good.

348
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:47,354
I mean,
that's the way the world should be and 

349
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,090
you can just look around and go,
well,

350
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,020
it isn't.
So,

351
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,983
you know,
it's so funny what people take comfort 

352
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:56,250
in because just this past weekend I was 
watching the history channel that,

353
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,380
you know,
they've gone from what once was history,

354
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:00,120
now they do a lot of God stuff,
right?

355
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,750
So I think it was God versus the devil 
is the name of the show or God first God

356
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,530
versus Satan or one of these things.
And there was so much horrible imagery,

357
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,364
you know what I mean?
Burning people and endless war and 

358
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:13,890
armageddon and all this stuff.
And I kept thinking the entire time.

359
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,023
This is incredible to me.
I mean this is what people are taking 

360
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:19,620
comfort in what it was pretty horrible 
stuff.

361
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,160
So that right there shows a cognitive 
system

362
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,253
well.
So part of that is that we're also 

363
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:27,190
moralizing animals,
moralizing primates,

364
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:29,710
we care deeply about justice and right 
and wrong.

365
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,770
So it's not just we want a good life and
easy life,

366
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:36,930
a life with plenty of food and water and
milk and honey and you know,

367
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,930
the,
it's not just that we want to,

368
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,813
we want to cause we can be behind that 
we feel is a good cause and all causes 

369
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,960
have to have an antique cars,
you know?

370
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:46,794
Well.
So who's preventing us from achieving 

371
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,900
this utopia?
And it's those guys,

372
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,240
those bad guys over there,
you know,

373
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,074
and,
and they're preventing us from having 

374
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:57,400
eternal bliss forever.
How bad are they?

375
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,770
They are really bad.
And what does that mean?

376
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:02,500
We can do to them whatever we want 
because they're so bad.

377
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,980
And that's what leads to genocide and 
wars and conflicts.

378
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,030
Even homicides,
you know,

379
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,280
90 percent of homicides are moralistic 
in nature.

380
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,980
That guy deserved to die.
Why?

381
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,300
Well,
he scratched my car,

382
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,610
he insulted me or he stole my girlfriend
or you know,

383
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:16,690
whatever.
They're always these,

384
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,913
these kind of moralistic reasons.
So it was an interesting commentary on 

385
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,534
this,
uh,

386
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,040
recently about the interest in trump and
other strong leaders and then reflecting

387
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:27,874
back on the interest of in Mussolini and
Hitler Back in the thirties and George 

388
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,600
orwell writing about this saying,
I really get this.

389
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:35,434
You can see the passion and the people.
It's not just that Hitler or Mussolini 

390
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,724
said I will give you economic prosperity
and jobs and in three square meals a 

391
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:44,344
day,
it's that we are going to change the 

392
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,564
world.
We are going to make Germany great 

393
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:48,880
again,
are really great.

394
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,480
So it's about easy answers.
Then right?

395
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,314
Again,
going to your type one thinking and 

396
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,410
these guys like trump that just black 
and white,

397
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,860
black and white,
simple simple stuff.

398
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,903
So how do we,
and this is I guess really what you've 

399
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,574
done sort of more than how do we wrestle
that conversation back and get it to a 

400
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,330
place where people are willing to 
extrapolate ideas and,

401
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:13,380
and open them up and get in there and 
really figure out what's going on.

402
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,843
How do we do it?

403
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,020
Well,
you do what we're doing now,

404
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,240
but most people don't sit down like 
this,

405
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,080
you know,
you go to a bar or whatever and it's,

406
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,493
it's much more black and white and in 
part I think the diffusion of culture 

407
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:29,550
through the Internet and all the radio 
stations and television stations helps,

408
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,830
you know,
despite the,

409
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:33,330
a history channel two with the ancient 
alien and stuff,

410
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:33,830
you know,
it's like,

411
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,120
are all formally all Hitler all the 
time.

412
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,130
Now it's all conspiracy then is all 
bigfoot foot.

413
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,020
Then it's all aliens.
Yes,

414
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:41,130
I know,
but at least there's.

415
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,073
And I love that stuff,
but what we're going to talk a little 

416
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:44,360
bit about,
I love that stuff,

417
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:45,860
but I know that,
you know,

418
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:47,300
they're just playing with your mind.

419
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,453
It's good to remember.
Television is a series of commercials 

420
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:52,604
with blank spots in between.
They have to be filled with something 

421
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:56,570
interesting to keep you from the 
clicker.

422
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,970
The clicker culture.
Uh,

423
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,050
so.
Well,

424
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,370
and then literacy rates,
the more of that,

425
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,010
more literate people are,
the more they read,

426
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:07,100
the more options they have.
So it's true twitter,

427
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:07,934
140 characters,
but you can embed a link to an article 

428
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:14,600
that maybe is 3000 words and then maybe 
from there you go to the 10,000

429
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,370
word analysis from there you go to the 
book.

430
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,310
And so any.
As a book author,

431
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:20,144
I,
I like to think maybe I'm dilute 

432
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,260
delusional here that people still like 
to read long books.

433
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:28,330
I hope and move from the twitter to,
you know,

434
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,840
to face.

435
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,401
But listen,
I,

436
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,234
I hope so too.
That's why I'm doing this and that's 

437
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:33,220
exactly what I'm doing this.
So it's interesting.

438
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:38,221
You're talking about why people have 
done bad things in the name of morality,

439
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,690
but how do we get morality than without 
religion?

440
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,793
How do we using science,
and this is what you've written a lot 

441
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,374
about,
how do we use science to get some sense 

442
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:49,894
of morality so we don't end up doing the
same things that the religious people 

443
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:53,570
are doing?

444
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,291
Right?
Well,

445
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,700
so.
Well it starts with the idea,

446
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,440
the recognition that that moral values 
are part of our human nature.

447
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:01,274
We have a sense of right and wrong and 
justice and it's built into us and you 

448
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,710
can see it in all humans and actually 
all primates,

449
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,160
even other mammals like elephants and 
dogs and so on.

450
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:12,830
They have a sense of guilt and,
and uh,

451
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,770
and shame and things like that.
And,

452
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:15,604
and they,
and they have a certain amount of 

453
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,650
empathy,
sympathy,

454
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,990
cooperativeness as well as selfishness 
ingredient and so on.

455
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:25,610
They have these suite of moral emotions 
maybe scaled down from what we have,

456
00:20:25,611 --> 00:20:27,950
but so it's there in our nature.
We evolved it,

457
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,130
we got it as part of the package of just
being human.

458
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,490
And then.
So that was just a survival thing,

459
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,230
right?
Like just a Darwin,

460
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:37,090
like you have to play nice with people,
otherwise they're going to.

461
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:37,990
Exactly.
Okay.

462
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,983
So you start with something like a 
Dawkins' selfish gene model and you 

463
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:43,201
know,
what,

464
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,080
what,
what does,

465
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,943
what,
what would a self replicating molecule 

466
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,850
to perpetuate itself into the future?
It,

467
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:50,783
it needs to be build a,
a cell to put itself in and then 

468
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:56,860
multiple cells and then an organism,
you know,

469
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,694
survival machine to carry it forward.
So our bodies are behold into the the 

470
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,833
genes we are the genes survival machine.
And so why shouldn't I just be as 

471
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,770
selfish and greedy as I possibly can,
hoard all the resources,

472
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,640
take all your stuff in our knock you on 
the head and take you know well,

473
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,474
because you would do the same 
calculation is me and I know that you 

474
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:20,284
know that I might be thinking that and I
know that you know that I know that you 

475
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,824
might be thinking that and so therefore 
maybe it's better if I'm just nice to 

476
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:27,694
you and,
but I can't just fake and pretend I'm a 

477
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:34,090
nice person because in time you will 
pick up the cues,

478
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:34,924
subtle cues that I,
I'm not genuine in my feelings about 

479
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,580
you.
I'm,

480
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm just coldly manipulating your 
emotions to get something in time.

481
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:45,040
People can see that in other people.
So you can't just fake it.

482
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:45,874
You have to actually believe it and 
actually feel like I want to be a good 

483
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,680
person.
And,

484
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,623
and so you have that tension.
Then the good moral emotions and the 

485
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:56,110
dark side of emotions and they're there 
for all of this.

486
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,670
So isn't that strange though,
because that does show sort of,

487
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,533
you're giving me the scientific 
explanation of why to be good and then 

488
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:07,260
at the same time that is sort of why 
religion would tell people to be good to

489
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:08,094
write to,
to better their community or to work 

490
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:11,214
with people or that kind of thing.
So there is some place that you could 

491
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:14,950
use both of those things?

492
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,620
Well,
I,

493
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,453
I,
I think what religions discovered this 

494
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:18,944
by,
by trial and error over thousands of 

495
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,913
years,
there are certain things that we 

496
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,800
shouldn't do because most people don't 
like it.

497
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,190
You know,
so you know,

498
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,920
killing and you know,
this kind of thing.

499
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,690
Even though there's a lot of bands 
Bible,

500
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,460
they kind of figured out,
look,

501
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:33,470
we're a community so we need a set of 
rules.

502
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,420
You know,
maybe we disagree about the rules,

503
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,254
but Dang it,
we need the rules and everybody has to 

504
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:38,081
obey him.
And if it,

505
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,250
if not,
then there'll be punishments.

506
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,830
And if you think you got away with it 
because there was no one around,

507
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,910
there's an eye in the sky,
you know,

508
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,753
this is in a way,
that basis of God beliefs and in part 

509
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:50,450
there's multiple reasons for God,
but that's one of them.

510
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,261
There's,
you know,

511
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:53,420
there's a moral eye in the sky keeping 
track.

512
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,280
Now,
if you're a psychopath and know care.

513
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:55,791
Well,
all right,

514
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,624
it's not gonna work for you,
but for the bulk of the population that 

515
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,200
would work.
And so in a way,

516
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,910
you know,
the conservative Christian belief in the

517
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:05,744
sinful nature of humans is in,
in a way a Darwinian model as well 

518
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:12,770
because yes,
we're greedy and we,

519
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,750
if we think we can get away with it,
we might.

520
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,350
So in a sort of like a prisoner's 
dilemma,

521
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,350
Game Theory Type Model,
uh,

522
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,940
you know,
tit for tat in,

523
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,793
okay,
I'll start off cooperating and if you 

524
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,820
cooperate I'll cooperate again.
But if you defect that I'm gonna,

525
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,270
I'm gonna nail you for that.
So that,

526
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,640
that desire to,
to,

527
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
to nail you,
to,

528
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,250
to,
to,

529
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,620
to get justice for the thing you did,
that was wrong.

530
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,323
That's actually a good strategy.
You know the Gandhian turn the other 

531
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:39,740
cheek,
Jesus turned the other cheek.

532
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:40,574
That's not a good game theory strategy 
because that just means you'll be 

533
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,610
exploited by other people.
Right.

534
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,453
It never works out well for that person.
Unfortunately it doesn't and it won't 

535
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:53,150
work for a whole society that those 
kinds of societies won't survive because

536
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,340
other groups will or clans or whatever.
We'll try,

537
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,300
we'll take them over so it actually 
helps to cultivate a reputation of being

538
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,900
a bad ass.
You know,

539
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,870
you take my stuff,
I'm going to kick your ass.

540
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:03,741
Woo.
Okay.

541
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:04,401
All right.
All right.

542
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:04,941
Sure.
I'm all right.

543
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,774
Well,
okay,

544
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,933
well you're coming from

545
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,970
to that point,
using a moral compass,

546
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:10,804
right?
I mean you're,

547
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,360
you're saying I'm doing this sort of for
myself,

548
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:15,820
but that in itself is sort of for the 
greater good.

549
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,460
Right?

550
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,820
Well,
but it's a bite.

551
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,060
The greater good.
It turns out to be a byproduct,

552
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:22,580
but I think there's evolutionary 
arguments you can make that,

553
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,830
but that actually really is good for the
group.

554
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:25,664
Not a group selection argument.
Just that the more of us individuals 

555
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,864
that are cooperating within our group,
our group will be better off for that 

556
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,570
group is not the target of selection,
still the individuals,

557
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,763
but societies are better off.
And so what I argue in the moral arc is 

558
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:40,770
that over the centuries,
uh,

559
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,683
tweaking social,
political and economic systems this way 

560
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:44,894
and this way,
we've been kind of hovering around this 

561
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,194
idea that there is a better way to live 
for in a utilitarian type or more of us 

562
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,624
will be better off and live longer and 
prosperous and healthy lives if we do 

563
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,200
this.
Rather than that,

564
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:01,220
you know,
that a democracy versus a dictatorship,

565
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:02,054
a relatively free markets of trading and
allowing people to do it their thing 

566
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:07,634
versus a command and control economy 
like in North Korea or having a set of 

567
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:14,420
rules and the rule of law and a police 
force has good,

568
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,950
good,
good fences,

569
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:17,630
make good neighbors.
So we,

570
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,760
we've been doing this,
these experiments.

571
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,370
So that's what I mean.
It's kind of like a science.

572
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:22,911
It's like,
okay,

573
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:24,620
let's run the experiment and see how it 
goes.

574
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,454
And then we'll tweak the variables in 
four years called an election and we'll 

575
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,230
try it again.
And there's no,

576
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:32,480
they're there to get there.
There's no utopia.

577
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,610
We're just trying to make a little bit 
of progress.

578
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,630
So we'll increase taxes there and lower 
him there.

579
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,420
Will will change the gun control flaws 
here but not there.

580
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,770
And we'll seat list to see what happens.

581
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,653
Right.
So you're saying when politicians 

582
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:46,090
promise they can fix everything.
They're not actually.

583
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,940
Yeah.
Well that's what you're saying.

584
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:49,010
It's a shocker.
I know.

585
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,223
What do you.
What do you make of people that would 

586
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:58,100
believe everything that you've said that
lived their lives in a secular way using

587
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:02,420
science and reasoning and their own 
personal morality to guide their lives,

588
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,660
but at the same time do take that leap 
of faith and still believe in some crazy

589
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:09,014
stuff.
Still believed that maybe there's 

590
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:12,020
someone upstairs watching them.
Because I think.

591
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,873
I think that's probably where most 
people fall that they do live their 

592
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:17,054
lives based in secular ideas,
but at the same time if you really sat 

593
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,094
them down and said,
well,

594
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,043
you know,
because people want to believe at the 

595
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:27,070
end that they're going to go and play 
tennis with God,

596
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,660
right?
Will there be competition in heaven?

597
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:33,120
This is what I want to know because if 
it's too boring,

598
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,560
there's nothing to do with challenges,
but then it wouldn't be worried.

599
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,394
It wouldn't be worth it to you,
but what do you make of that type of 

600
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,960
person?
It's a super good point.

601
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,333
In reality,
most say conservative Christians today 

602
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,760
are more liberal socially than liberals 
were in the fifties say,

603
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,730
but they don't even know it.
They,

604
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:53,521
they,
they're just like,

605
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:53,761
well,
I,

606
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:57,090
I'm doing this because it says so in the
Bible and I'm a Christian,

607
00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:58,290
and Jesus,
you know,

608
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,220
it was like that.
He said,

609
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:00,054
you know,
Jesus should love all the gays and 

610
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,270
blacks,
and so it was like,

611
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,070
where does he say that and where are you
getting this?

612
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,410
But I know where they're getting.
They're getting from culture.

613
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:10,500
That's been shifting for decades from 
the bottom up,

614
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:11,334
just from everybody changing the way 
they talk and think about shows or 

615
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,624
presented a scripts are written novels,
books and so forth and all of us have 

616
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,970
changed our,
our expanded,

617
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:25,971
our moral sphere to be more encompassing
and so that the standouts like the,

618
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,233
the Donald Sterling's of the world,
who insults African-americans is the 

619
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:31,590
owner of the clippers.

620
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,580
This,
you know,

621
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,000
his life is just ruined for this idiotic
statements.

622
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,340
But most,
all the guys back in the fifties used to

623
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,174
think like him.
My Dad was Kinda like that and it's 

624
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,890
like,
dad can't say that anymore.

625
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,320
Is that one of the scary things about 
society's changing too quickly?

626
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,320
I mean,
I know I,

627
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,293
I follow you on twitter and you do push 
against some of this regressive left 

628
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,044
stuff and some of the social justice 
warrior stuff because in a way they're 

629
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,360
gonna come for us to.
Things will keep changing.

630
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:00,194
And then some of the things that you're 
saying right now that don't sound 

631
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,560
controversial at all,
to me,

632
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,710
depending on the way we evolve in the.
Depending on the way ideas,

633
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,590
you know,
the way that they move throughout time,

634
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,420
someone 20 years from now could look at 
this and say,

635
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,254
ah,
you see schermer was a real big it for 

636
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,290
some reason.
We can't even think of it.

637
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,020
Right,
right,

638
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,853
right.
Yeah,

639
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,630
of course we,
you know,

640
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,260
we worry about that or wonder about 
that.

641
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,310
Uh,
you know,

642
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,550
we look back on say the debates about 
interracial marriage.

643
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,280
It's like what were they thinking?
Right?

644
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,240
And,
and just,

645
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,860
you know,
the last year,

646
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,810
looking back at gay marriage,
what were they thinking?

647
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,270
We know what their thinking is so 
recent.

648
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,910
And so,
but now what are we thinking now that in

649
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,160
20 years people go,
what the,

650
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,250
what were here?

651
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,410
So yeah,
look at that.

652
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,483
I think about that all the time.
I'm tweeting out all this stuff all the 

653
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:43,760
time and he's 20 years from now,
someone going to go,

654
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,620
man,
that guy was a complete lunatic.

655
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,520
And they might be saying it now.

656
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,780
Well we don't know because we're buried 
in the culture.

657
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,833
It's just hard to say.
I will say just projecting forward 

658
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:53,670
maybe,
um,

659
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,780
the rights of the unborn in here.
I don't mean fetuses,

660
00:28:56,781 --> 00:29:00,140
I mean future generations to inhabited 
earth that's habitable.

661
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,750
That is there's resources available and 
so on.

662
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:06,050
So the environmental movement I think is
part of that.

663
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,040
Uh,
you know,

664
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,670
that would be one area.
Artificial intelligence is maybe another

665
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:12,800
one is data a person,
you know,

666
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,140
do they have personhood?
Yeah,

667
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,153
those kinds of things I think we can 
think about those are not particularly 

668
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,760
controversial.
Uh,

669
00:29:19,761 --> 00:29:22,910
the social justice warriors,
so called the regressive left.

670
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:25,070
It's an interesting term that's really 
caught on.

671
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,970
Um,
that was a measure.

672
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,070
Yeah.
So I thought,

673
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:31,904
I think it's very effective.
That's an example of how far for first 

674
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:36,290
of all,
how far we've come,

675
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,153
how much moral progress we've made.
That the biggest thing on your plate as 

676
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,310
a college student is to protest 
costumes.

677
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,020
Really.
That's it.

678
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,110
That's good.
That means things are pretty dang good.

679
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,410
So is that the part that we need to 
focus on more than.

680
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:51,640
Because I do think that,
you know,

681
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:52,474
we all get in this big workup frenzy 
over this stuff and they sent out this 

682
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:56,524
letter and you know,
they didn't want them to wear offensive 

683
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,780
Halloween costumes or something.
So to that,

684
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,710
if you just look at it in that narrow 
view,

685
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:03,730
it's like,
Oh shit,

686
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,060
free speech is really being attacked,
but if you look at it,

687
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:07,894
and I think this is what you're saying,
if you look at it from the broader 

688
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,360
spectrum,
it's like,

689
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,490
well,
look what's left now we're just fighting

690
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,860
over Halloween costumes.
So in that sense,

691
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,810
things really have progressed really 
well.

692
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,060
Exactly right.
You compare it to say what students were

693
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:22,100
protesting in the sixties,
seventies,

694
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,710
and uh,
again,

695
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,370
that's science.
But also the,

696
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,260
these moral pendulums tend to swing back
and forth to one extreme to the other.

697
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,810
And I think it has gone too far now.
I mean,

698
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:33,644
uh,
you know,

699
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,543
it seems like free speech as a moral 
principle is being trumped by other 

700
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,793
moral values that some people hold the 
right to not hear something 

701
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,890
uncomfortable or offensive or something 
like that.

702
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,593
I was arguing this back in the nineties 
with the Holocaust deniers when I wrote 

703
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,624
my book on the gated them when they were
kind of big and Canada had anti 

704
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,983
Holocaust denial laws.
It was incorporated under their hate 

705
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:00,044
speech laws.
I remember first reading about this 

706
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:02,690
going,
hate speech.

707
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,510
What?
Why is that hates if you're Jewish.

708
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:06,500
I could see,
but,

709
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,710
but who's actually being harmed by this?
These guys,

710
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,730
you could just just shine a light on 
him.

711
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:12,564
You just black.
They are and they'll go nowhere because 

712
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:19,010
they don't have anything.
Why suppress them and lock them up?

713
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:22,690
And then I remember when David Irving 
got arrested in Austria,

714
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,743
he didn't even say anything.
He was just going to give a lecture and 

715
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,840
hitch hitchins defended him publicly and
I thought,

716
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:32,420
that's good.
You know this case free speech.

717
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,373
Trump's so called hate speech because 
the problem is who determines what's 

718
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:37,724
hate?
Hateful.

719
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,250
Sure.
And doesn't that hitch defending him?

720
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:44,780
You debating these people in and 
allowing for these terrible ideas.

721
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,220
Right?
We all know the Alec has happened.

722
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:49,290
This is a terrible idea to deny it,
but doesn't that show you that,

723
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:54,260
that the secularists are pretty 
consistently on the right side of things

724
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,410
that we are the ones that are defending 
ideas even when they are scary to us and

725
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,680
things that we don't like.
Most of people do what most of us,

726
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,250
but people don't know if you do 
something that's against the religion,

727
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:11,150
generally religious people aren't going 
to defend you were secularists will,

728
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,410
they'll stand up for the idea.

729
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,353
Right?
So I'm religious do defend free speech 

730
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,160
and,
and they're willing to allow their,

731
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,840
allow their religion to be criticized.
Uh,

732
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,200
but for the most part,
most of us sort of circle the wagons and

733
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:27,980
protect our group or whatever.
And so it takes an extra effort.

734
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,960
It's sort of that type to collectors.
Wait a minute.

735
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,973
Free speech is really important.
So you have to sort of run through the 

736
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:37,580
arguments that a John Stuart mill made 
in his on liberty that,

737
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,080
okay,
what if they're right?

738
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,950
Okay.
They can't be right.

739
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,671
Yeah.
But what if they're right?

740
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:42,260
Just like a little bit,
you know,

741
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,980
then you'll learn something.
And,

742
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,770
and second,
um,

743
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:46,923
a second,
you could learn something from just the 

744
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,031
debate,
you know,

745
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,620
just the,
just how,

746
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,543
how confident are you in your arguments?
Can you explain evolution by natural 

747
00:32:56,661 --> 00:33:00,440
selection in five minutes in a debate 
because that's what you gotta do,

748
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,240
opening statement,
rebuttal,

749
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,040
rebuttal,
rebuttal q and a boom,

750
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:04,551
boom,
boom,

751
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,840
can you do it?
And,

752
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:07,970
and when you actually have to do it like
this,

753
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,760
in the case of debating creationist,
boy,

754
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:15,080
I really sharpened my skills about how 
do I know that evolution happen?

755
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,600
What are the four best arguments we 
have?

756
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,880
And it's actually kind of a good 
exercise in that sense.

757
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:20,714
But mostly it's just let this guy talk 
and the whole room can see how idiotic 

758
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:28,700
these arguments are.
Just go for it,

759
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:29,040
dude.

760
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,050
Right?
Isn't that a little bit like when the,

761
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,760
who's that creation is that.
Did the ham it when Ken Ham debated Bill

762
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,091
Nye,
right?

763
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:36,924
And it was like,
this was actually ridiculous and all he 

764
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:43,530
had to do is just let him hang himself.
But we're so afraid of doing that.

765
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:46,200
Are we so afraid of just letting someone
go?

766
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,213
And,
and

767
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,910
it's counterintuitive,
it doesn't feel like we should do,

768
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,070
we should circle the wagons and smack 
them down.

769
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,851
But yeah,
no,

770
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:56,270
it's actually better if you don't,
if you just provide better arguments and

771
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:57,710
let the world see,
you know,

772
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,810
how bad those arguments are.
And yes,

773
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:04,811
maybe he'll convince a few people,
but in the long run truth will win out,

774
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,180
you know,
the bright light of reason will,

775
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,960
will shine,

776
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,793
right.
I'm pretty sure he was just trying to 

777
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,180
sell tickets to that,

778
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,680
the park or whatever that good 
intention.

779
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:16,050
And you know,
some fundraising for his arc park,

780
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,930
which I see as going forward today.
A boy,

781
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,921
I don't know,
Bill,

782
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:21,450
I know bill,
Bill's a good friend and uh,

783
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:21,970
you know,
he,

784
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,930
he had some doubts about whether he 
should do it or not.

785
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:26,730
I think in the long run it was a good 
thing to do.

786
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,690
He did a good job

787
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,823
because there's a fear of debating these
people because then you could end up 

788
00:34:30,391 --> 00:34:32,360
debating every crackpot ever.
Right?

789
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,203
Because it was always.
And we see this is something that I see 

790
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,613
every now and again.
I'll see you argue with someone on 

791
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:37,734
twitter or or some of the other people 
that are arguing with somebody and it's 

792
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:41,041
like,
man,

793
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,140
how much energy,
and I'll do it sometimes too.

794
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:46,920
How much energy should we put in to 
debating people either that have,

795
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,903
you know,
just ideas that are terrible or aren't 

796
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,230
debating from an honest place or that 
you know,

797
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:53,064
we're going to twist your words after 
and there's a certain opportunity costs 

798
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:56,670
with that.
Yeah,

799
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,503
there is.
And so one of the criteria I use is to 

800
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:03,480
what extent do people care about the 
subject is an influencing thing.

801
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,314
Is it being disgusted the in the 
political debates at currently or is it 

802
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:11,190
in the newspapers?
So like in the Holocaust deniers,

803
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:12,900
back in the nineties,
it was kind of a big thing.

804
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,770
They were on a donahue.
Yeah.

805
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,570
And Montel Williams and they were,
you know,

806
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:21,900
there's articles written about them in 
time and Newsweek and New York Times and

807
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,060
the Schindler's list came out and it was
big debates.

808
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,030
They were challenging it and there was 
articles about us.

809
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:28,050
I thought,
you know what?

810
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:31,440
It's time for us to engage that.
What are they claiming?

811
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,640
What,
what exactly?

812
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:34,440
So they actually gave me this list,
39,

813
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:35,274
uh,
arguments that holocaust historians 

814
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,820
cannot answer.
I said,

815
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:38,700
all right,
give me the list.

816
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,953
So I actually went down and just worked 
my way through the list and a lot of 

817
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:43,290
them were hard to find actually.

818
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,500
And went in a lot of his holocaust 
historians that I consulted,

819
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,210
they did not know the answers to these 
things.

820
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:49,960
And now we know because,
you know,

821
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,711
I,
you know,

822
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:52,230
there's one out and track these things 
down.

823
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,731
And uh,
you know,

824
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,040
Richard Evans did this in the,
in Irving's trial.

825
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,150
David Irving sued Deborah Lipstadt for 
calling.

826
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:01,110
I'm a denier now,
here's an interesting sociological thing

827
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,750
because I've always called David Urbina 
Holocaust Denier,

828
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,853
but he likes me because we've gone out 
for beer and dinner before and I engage 

829
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:10,520
him and I talked to him.
David said,

830
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,750
what,
what's going on with you working on now?

831
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,670
So we had this thing.
So he doesn't,

832
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
he likes me.
He did like Lipstadt because she,

833
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,960
she's nasty tumor,
didn't talk to him or was it?

834
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,390
So,
uh,

835
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,790
one of the things I like to do is as an 
investigator,

836
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,043
um,
I shouldn't call it an experiential 

837
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,200
journalists because Sean Penn could do 
it.

838
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,034
Maybe I could do it.
You sort of get out there and you talk 

839
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:37,500
to people and really they do open up if 
you're nice and respectful to them,

840
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:38,400
friendly,
you know.

841
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,550
So just tell me about this.
What is it you think is going on because

842
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,384
I don't really understand the arguments 
and then they'll kind of open up and 

843
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,740
then if you could give him a few beers,
they'll start talking about,

844
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:47,820
you know,
oh the Jews,

845
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,620
the Jews are doing.
Oh really?

846
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,750
Tell me more.

847
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,730
So is that how you ended up sort of 
beating him in the public space that you

848
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,823
got to know the guy you were able to 
sort of unravel some of the arguments 

849
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:04,070
and I would guess that it's one of those
things where you can just get,

850
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,320
when you pull out one little pin,
the rest of it starts to

851
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,820
exactly right.
I say beat,

852
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:11,650
but just you sort of lay it out there.
Here's what he said,

853
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:13,840
here's what he did.
Here's his arguments and so on,

854
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,400
and it just let the arguments speak for 
themselves and I think they do.

855
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,970
And so those guys are largely gone now 
and the creationists,

856
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:22,930
you know,
they're still hanging on,

857
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,640
the poll numbers are starting to shift 
and the whole young Earth creationism is

858
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:29,840
largely being marginalized,
you know,

859
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,250
the Ben Carson's of the world,
you know,

860
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,550
seventh day adventist.
So they're young earth creation.

861
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,830
This is where all this silliness about 
the pyramids come from.

862
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,143
It's because he's a seventh day 
adventist and it follows from these 

863
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,830
other beliefs that he holds about 
genesis and all that.

864
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,480
Uh,
but,

865
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,313
but you can see he's not going anywhere 
and he's just one and more popular is 

866
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:51,220
either pretty mainstream or really not 
very religious centrus like trump.

867
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,250
Um,
you know,

868
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,083
I think,
I think the power of the moral majority 

869
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:58,690
is passed.
I don't think to get elected you have to

870
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:00,430
be an uber religious person anymore.

871
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,710
Yeah.
You know,

872
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,843
so trump was just at liberty university 
and this is a guy who by any estimation 

873
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,014
that I've ever seen,
has no real religious religious Osetra 

874
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,470
to him as not even worried.
But he was up there and he's like,

875
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,763
yeah,
there was definitely an extra s in 

876
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,340
there,
but he's in there.

877
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,500
He's at Liberty University and he's 
quoting scripture,

878
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,900
wrongly apparently made mocked up a 
couple things,

879
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,063
but I was thinking this is really what's
wrong with our political system really 

880
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:29,850
in,
in the most perfect way because here's a

881
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,230
guy who,
for whatever,

882
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,560
all the reasons that people like him is 
because he's saying things very clearly,

883
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:35,500
whether the,
you know what I mean,

884
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:36,970
whether it's true or not,
he's just saying.

885
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,163
And here even he who says I'm beholden 
to no one has to pander still to the 

886
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,750
religious rights.
So we're not fully out of it.

887
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,890
Yeah,
no,

888
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:46,850
for sure.
But yeah,

889
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,590
you have to have a little bit of it,
but it's not,

890
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,480
that's not what's going to win the 
election.

891
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:53,420
I think it's going to be the centrist 
votes this time,

892
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,630
which is more secular,
just more real world problems,

893
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:57,410
you know,
that kind of thing.

894
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,243
Anyway,
so,

895
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,780
but it's still there.
It's an inch.

896
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,890
Another interesting,
you know,

897
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,520
that it seems to be the Republicans,
the right are the ones identifying,

898
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,811
um,
you know,

899
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,250
the problem of terrorism,
what,

900
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,410
what's behind it,
you know,

901
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,520
there's certain religious beliefs that 
are behind it.

902
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,661
Now.
It's true.

903
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:12,494
I know some of the Isis fighters are 
young men out for money and sex and 

904
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:17,900
adventure and whatever,
but,

905
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,640
but underneath it is,
you know,

906
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,730
that sort of apocalyptic in other 
worldly Utopian society.

907
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:25,361
This,
you know,

908
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,194
this kind of really quasi religious 
beliefs that are driving them and it's 

909
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,124
the left that doesn't seem to want to 
acknowledge that they're so afraid of 

910
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,741
this.
Again,

911
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:37,220
political correctness run amok,
so afraid to use the word.

912
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,630
Our own president won't use the word and
he's a guy I admire.

913
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:42,464
He's obviously very bright and thinks 
that he's a type two thinker all the 

914
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:48,030
way.
Maybe it'd be better if he sometimes use

915
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:49,010
type one.
Sure.

916
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,343
At least in this instance,
because then he would at least say the 

917
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:53,130
word,
but yeah,

918
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:55,670
this is coming out of the left.
So I,

919
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,840
I'm a liberal.
What do I do about this?

920
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:58,674
This has been the theme throughout the 
four or five months that we've been 

921
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:00,910
doing this.

922
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,743
Sure.
I understand.

923
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,580
I've watched it and I think you're doing
exactly what you have.

924
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,453
What we have to do is push back and you 
just push that pendulum back and if 

925
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:11,050
enough of us do that,
uh,

926
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:13,510
then,
then it will get knocked back and people

927
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,344
will stop saying those.
They'll start identifying things 

928
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:17,584
correctly,
I think.

929
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,633
Yeah.
Why do you think the left is so hung up 

930
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,400
on this one issue so that if,
anytime,

931
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,680
you know,
I was just watching some another program

932
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,860
where after the Cologne,
a sex attacks,

933
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,694
right,
a thousand men and there were rapes and 

934
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:35,650
all this terrible stuff that immediately
the argument became,

935
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:36,431
well,
you know,

936
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:41,170
Christians do bad stuff to and you know,
the West done this and we've bombed this

937
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:42,004
or that,
this sort of knee jerk reaction to make 

938
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:47,470
everything in this moral equivalence and
sort of make everything about us.

939
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,580
Whether when it had it been a thousand 
Christians that had done this,

940
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,290
they never would have flipped it the 
other way.

941
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,180
So what do we do?
I mean,

942
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:56,250
we,
we just kept talking about it.

943
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,920
Okay,
well a couple things.

944
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:58,520
First of all,
why?

945
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,353
Why do they do well?
Because as Steven pinker points out in 

946
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:05,390
the blank slate,
that blank slate model that you know,

947
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:08,210
that culture determines everything and 
otherwise people are equal.

948
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,960
That's more of a left wing and right 
wing view of human nature.

949
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,110
Conservative Christians have more of a 
realistic,

950
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,660
Steve Calls a realistic model of human 
nature.

951
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:20,780
That is both genetics and culture and,
and uh,

952
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,450
and,
and,

953
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,930
and second,
uh,

954
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,430
that again,
this all inclusiveness,

955
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,090
we don't want to offend other people 
because look what w,

956
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,933
w,
what were you doing to blacks in the 

957
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,940
fifties and sixties and Jews in the and 
forties and that was really bad.

958
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,070
Okay.
So that's sort of taking a principle and

959
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:37,940
then running with it,

960
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,060
right?
No one's denying that that's a fact.

961
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,960
Yes,
that's right.

962
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,793
Yeah.
And so therefore it would be wrong to 

963
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,174
stereotype all Muslims and,
but it gets to the point where even if 

964
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:50,510
you say,
if you preface every sentence with,

965
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,463
of course most Muslims are good and nice
and moral people that would never do 

966
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,020
this,
but then you can't even get past that.

967
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:00,290
But what,
but what now my wife is from Cologne,

968
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,603
Germany.
She's German and she just moved here 

969
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,820
last year and married me and we live 
here now.

970
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:05,654
But her,
uh,

971
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,773
uh,
we were going to go to Cologne next 

972
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,043
month for carnival and now we're not 
going because she's worried about 

973
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,030
really.
And her mother was just attacked about a

974
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,470
week ago.
So this is a week after,

975
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,393
two weeks after the new year's thing.
And there's a lot of this going on 

976
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,233
that's not being reported because 
they're afraid to use the word to say 

977
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:25,923
because her mom was attacked by an Arab 
looking Syrian man who said he mumbled 

978
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,220
something about Western wham and grabbed
her breast and,

979
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,740
and really offensive bottle of booze.
You know,

980
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,793
it's a lot of these young men that are 
drunk and they're sort of using as an 

981
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,060
excuse to what extent they're really 
religious.

982
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,400
Who knows?

983
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,230
Sure.
It's a confluence of a zillion things,

984
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:45,450
but that's why we have to talk about.
Exactly.

985
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,020
Right.
Yeah.

986
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,990
So is that where,
where,

987
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,750
where is that going?
Right.

988
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,610
Yeah.
So we're going,

989
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,570
oh,
I'm Angela Merkel,

990
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:53,660
who I've admired very much.
I think maybe she just went too far.

991
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,480
Uh,
you,

992
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,050
you,
that we have to do some screening,

993
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,150
but the moment you say screening,
then you.

994
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,830
Are you talking about targeting certain 
people and,

995
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,070
and isn't that stereotyping and doesn't 
that lead to genocide?

996
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,400
Okay.
So you ended up down that road,

997
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,510
but just,
just take a little step.

998
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,830
Just a little.
Just a tiny bit to find out what's going

999
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:13,664
on here before.
That's why trump made that comment and 

1000
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,040
he's felt a bigot and a racist.
But wait,

1001
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,450
he's just saying maybe we should just 
figure out what's going on here.

1002
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:21,090
First.

1003
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,923
Clean.
It gets twisted into something and I'm 

1004
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:25,080
not defending what he says at all.
And that's,

1005
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,123
that's also why language is so important
to this because we've gotten so afraid 

1006
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:29,634
of saying anything the wrong way or 
writing anything the wrong way that 

1007
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:34,710
you'll immediately be labeled a bigot 
and a racist.

1008
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,370
And the rest of it,
when all you're saying is we should have

1009
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:40,740
some decent screening to figure out 
who's here.

1010
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,840
And you're also giving me a firsthand 
example.

1011
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:44,380
I mean,
your wife's mother was attached,

1012
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,440
so this isn't,
this isn't made up stuff.

1013
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,370
No.
And this,

1014
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,270
you know,
it's cold.

1015
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:49,104
She's 65 year old woman all bundled up 
and umbrella and hat and jacket and 

1016
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:55,800
everything.
And so it's not like they're out groping

1017
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:56,634
young women in bars wearing miniskirts.
It's just grabbing anything that's 

1018
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:03,330
female and you know,
so who knows what the motivations are,

1019
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,164
you know,
some of it again is just young men on 

1020
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,520
just on a rampage,
but you know.

1021
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,590
But again,
I think it's not just random who's doing

1022
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:13,500
it and everybody's afraid to say what it
is.

1023
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:16,200
And so merkel who I think has been a 
great leader,

1024
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:17,670
I think she just gone too far.

1025
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,080
Yeah.
What do you make of the situation?

1026
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:21,914
I wasn't planning on going here,
but I'm glad we were taking this road 

1027
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,310
that Germany,
a lot of people are saying,

1028
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:26,750
and I've had a lot of people email me 
about this,

1029
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,840
that they're saying that the reason that
they opened the borders the way they did

1030
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,850
was because there's this guilt because 
of the Holocaust,

1031
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,670
so they don't want to see people,
you know,

1032
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,570
if they,
if they can help,

1033
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:37,404
they want to help,
but now it's gotten out of control and 

1034
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:42,210
now what this is going to do is,
is help the far right.

1035
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,193
We're seeing hints of this here with,
with trump and xenophobia and we're 

1036
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,000
seeing this all over Europe now.
So again,

1037
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,910
it's when the left doesn't deal with 
things honestly,

1038
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,290
that we allow the

1039
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
right.
Exactly right.

1040
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,440
I mean if the left wants to defend their
position,

1041
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,274
they should do the opposite what they're
doing because it's the right that are 

1042
00:44:58,271 --> 00:44:59,104
going to sweep sweep in.
So my wife tells me that the sentiments 

1043
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:02,334
in Germany about this and before this 
attitudes toward Israel and the Middle 

1044
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:07,314
Eastern conflicts is that we just have 
to bite our tongue because what we did 

1045
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:15,510
was so bad that we just have to always 
support Israel.

1046
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:18,960
And even though there's,
there's numbers of people in branches,

1047
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,330
in the society that do not support 
Israel,

1048
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,180
they can't say anything.
And uh,

1049
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,014
and even though there are debates about 
Palestinians and who's doing what and 

1050
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:29,454
who's the real terrorist and you know,
no one has perfectly clean hands in 

1051
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:34,160
those,
in that conflict.

1052
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,360
Uh,
but in Germany you can't,

1053
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,720
you can't say this because of the guilt.
There's a lot of guilt.

1054
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,310
Uh,
and they've had,

1055
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,260
you know,
they've paid reparations to Israel for a

1056
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,050
long time and uh,
you know,

1057
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,450
so Merkel's try to navigate around.
It's very difficult to do.

1058
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:51,280
And so in part there's that,
but also they're the,

1059
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,960
they're the strongest nation of the EU.
And she was trying to set a precedence.

1060
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,540
And I see,
I see why she was trying to do that.

1061
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,610
But I just think it probably gone too 
far.

1062
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,444
And now there's a lot,
my wife tells me there's a lot of these 

1063
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:06,750
strong right Nazi type groups that are 
now bubbling up saying,

1064
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,180
see,
I told you I

1065
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,113
don't do well actually next week I have 
Tommy Robinson on who's the former head 

1066
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,304
of the edl who marginalized.
So you mentioned earlier at one point 

1067
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:20,430
helped get him out of the edl because he
felt it was too far.

1068
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:22,740
Right.
And there were some Neo Nazi element and

1069
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,633
he had emailed me about coming on the 
show and I had a real sort of debate 

1070
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:31,500
within myself whether here's someone who
I know a lot of people think he's just a

1071
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:33,480
racist and then I get a lot of people 
that say,

1072
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:34,170
you know,
he's,

1073
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,750
he's talking about things that people 
don't want to talk about.

1074
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:39,000
And I felt,
well if I talked to him are people gonna

1075
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,843
think I'm a racist.
And then that was why I felt like I had 

1076
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:43,620
to do the interview and I have to 
really.

1077
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,203
Because I can't be afraid of just the 
conversation and where that's going to 

1078
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:48,180
replace me.
But that's,

1079
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,600
that's where they've got us.
Right,

1080
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,583
right,
right.

1081
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,110
Yeah,
well,

1082
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:51,760
well,
but,

1083
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,160
but they're not,
they don't have this.

1084
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,003
There we are talking about it and you 
will do that and we will push back and 

1085
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,580
that's a good thing.
Yeah.

1086
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,180
Um,
and uh,

1087
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,820
you know,
so it,

1088
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,810
it in,
in Germany and Europe,

1089
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:07,750
you know,
they've made a major transition from 500

1090
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:12,751
years of very tribal and balkanized 
constantly in conflict history to,

1091
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,740
you know,
a completely different kind of society.

1092
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,830
And so when these tensions have been 
bubbling up,

1093
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,920
you know,
the temptation is to go back and,

1094
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,180
but then the,
then the put,

1095
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,601
no,
no,

1096
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:27,090
we don't want to do that because look 
what happened.

1097
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,400
This led to all these conflicts,
genocides and so on.

1098
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,533
But part of the problem is recognizing 
that there really are bad people in the 

1099
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:37,480
world.
They really do mean harm.

1100
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,140
They,
they,

1101
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,120
they really do behead people and they do
bad things for whatever reason.

1102
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,983
They're not all psychopaths.
A lot of them are just morally 

1103
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,110
motivated.
As I mentioned,

1104
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:49,270
90 percent of the homicides are 
moralistic in nature,

1105
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:54,271
but this is true for genocides and,
and ethnic cleansings and pilgrims.

1106
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:56,080
They're morally motivated.
They have,

1107
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,153
they have wrong ideas and ideas that 
dangerous ever have gestated without 

1108
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,110
religion because almost all,
if you think,

1109
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,840
you know,
holocaust pogroms what's happening right

1110
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,610
now in Europe,
all of these things,

1111
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,550
there's a religious underpinning to all 
of them.

1112
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:16,360
So could this type of math stuff ever 
happened without religion?

1113
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:16,811
Well,
it did.

1114
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,390
It did in the seventies and a 60 
seventies,

1115
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:22,900
eighties with Marxist.
I'm regimes and terrorists.

1116
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:23,734
I mean,
there was a lot of terrorism in the 

1117
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,204
seventies.
I mean,

1118
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,210
way more than now.
A CNN just ran that.

1119
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,830
They had those series,
the seventies,

1120
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:31,930
the eighties and so on.
And the one in the seventies,

1121
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:34,930
one of the episodes was just an hour 
long of all the terrorist attacks.

1122
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,750
I forgot I lived through it,
but I forgot how many there were.

1123
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,670
And uh,
you know,

1124
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:40,504
to the point where Monte Python parody 
did in the life of Brian People's Gdl 

1125
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,530
front the front of people's homes.
And yet that's how many there were.

1126
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:52,260
But like that.
And there was a,

1127
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,560
you know,
the rates of,

1128
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,320
uh,
of murders were much higher and bombings

1129
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,910
and in,
in the United States.

1130
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,060
Um,
so those are,

1131
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,530
but those were moralistically driven,
you know,

1132
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,101
but,
but it's,

1133
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:03,934
it's a kind of a,
because Marxism is sort of a quasi 

1134
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,770
religious.
So what's behind when we say religion,

1135
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:09,604
it's this idea of a Utopian society.
There's a place we can get to either 

1136
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,950
heaven above or heavens on earth.
We can get there if it weren't for those

1137
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,830
people that are stopping us,
the capitalists,

1138
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,390
the here is the or the Jews or the 
Christians or the,

1139
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,800
you know,
whoever it is.

1140
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,460
So it's engaging the moral module in the
brain,

1141
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,570
whatever that is a to be worked up about
a cause.

1142
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,430
I love that concept that it's,
you're always fighting the other,

1143
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:40,264
whoever the other is,
and it can be through the religious 

1144
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:43,684
prism or the secular prison event.
It's sort of up to us to figure out 

1145
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,190
which one we're going to.
Exactly.

1146
00:49:49,191 --> 00:49:52,180
And I'm worried about the EU and Germany
because,

1147
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,733
you know,
they've been moving in the right 

1148
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:58,180
direction of the very poorest borders.
You can travel across all the countries.

1149
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,473
Uh,
there's no border checks and it's just 

1150
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,250
like driving across the United States 
now.

1151
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:03,911
It's great.
And,

1152
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:04,744
and they've been kind of much more 
economically prosperous because of that 

1153
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,090
and politically more freedom and more 
democracies.

1154
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,300
All those things are good.
But now there's this,

1155
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,010
I'm afraid,
fearful,

1156
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,080
there'll be a backlash.
Close those borders.

1157
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,090
Balkan.
I see what's happening right now.

1158
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,610
And then,
and then if they abandoned the currency,

1159
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:24,280
the euro as a currency a,
that's going to be bad economically.

1160
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,890
All right,
well let's move on.

1161
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,980
Let's move off.
Politics are a little bit.

1162
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,983
Get to some of the sort of more out 
there stuff and find stuff because you 

1163
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:34,940
do talk a lot about conspiracy theories.
Uh,

1164
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,920
and I've seen you talk about,
you know,

1165
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:40,130
aliens and JFK assassination and all 
this stuff.

1166
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,860
Um,
it's fun to debunk this stuff,

1167
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:46,100
right?
It sort of fun to think about them.

1168
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,200
Uh,
you know,

1169
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,010
whether even nine slash 11 thinking,
you know,

1170
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:53,180
at least entertaining the ideas,
whatever they may be that our government

1171
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:54,680
did it or this or that,
whatever it is.

1172
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,140
It's sort of fun to always entertain 
those ideas.

1173
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:01,220
But basically you come down on all this 
stuff that I think what Carl Sagan would

1174
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:02,054
say,
that extraordinary claims require 

1175
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,940
extraordinary evidence.
Is that,

1176
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,670
did I sum up your view on how to deal 
with this stuff?

1177
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,850
Yes,
absolutely.

1178
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,593
The thing with conspiracy theories that 
are different than other claims that we 

1179
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:16,050
deal with it skeptic is they do happen.
There are conspiracies.

1180
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,913
Watergate was a conspiracy in the 
assassination of Lincoln was a 

1181
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:20,430
conspiracy,
you know,

1182
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:21,241
uh,
and you know,

1183
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:22,074
there's all those stories about the 
stuff that Kissinger was orchestrating 

1184
00:51:25,261 --> 00:51:26,094
and South American dictatorships we 
liked this dictator versus like we're 

1185
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,680
pulling the strings were sending money 
arms for hostages,

1186
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:33,270
you know,
all this stuff was going on.

1187
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,700
Those are conspiracies,
right?

1188
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,370
Definition.
Uh,

1189
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,730
and so we have to acknowledge that that 
does happen.

1190
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,890
But of course,
the to the conspiracy theorist,

1191
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:43,410
the fact that that happened over there,
it means that my pet theory,

1192
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,670
but not necessarily,
not all conspiracies.

1193
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,680
Uh,
so how do we tell the difference?

1194
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:51,070
What's the criteria?
Well,

1195
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,380
that sort of a conspiracy detection kit,
like the Baloney detection kit where you

1196
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:56,214
know,
the more people that have to be 

1197
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:57,624
involved,
the less likely the theory is going to 

1198
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:03,060
be true because people are incompetent.
They can't keep their mouth shut.

1199
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,133
We find out about it.
I remember I was on g Gordon Liddy's 

1200
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,750
radio show back in the nineties and uh,
he asked me about conspiracies.

1201
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,171
I was like,
well,

1202
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:13,290
you know more about it than I do data.
You're the Watergate guy.

1203
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,230
I didn't want to say this,
but you couldn't even break into a hotel

1204
00:52:16,231 --> 00:52:17,064
room.
I mean,

1205
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,570
you know,
people have this vision of,

1206
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,493
you know,
government says these super powerful 

1207
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,804
agents that can do anything.
Mostly they're just like bureaucrats at 

1208
00:52:24,301 --> 00:52:26,190
the DMV.
That's what you're dealing with.

1209
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:27,123
Right?
So in a way it's the same thing as 

1210
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:28,924
religion.
The people that are going down the 

1211
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:30,574
conspiracy path,
they want some easy answer for an 

1212
00:52:33,461 --> 00:52:37,580
extremely complex issue that we really 
often have no answer

1213
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,123
enemies,
not this complex system that no one can 

1214
00:52:40,451 --> 00:52:41,830
really understand or predict.
It's,

1215
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,520
it's 12 guys living in London calling 
the shots of the Illuminati.

1216
00:52:45,521 --> 00:52:47,890
And they're pulling the strings and 
making this happen.

1217
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,510
So it is the same thing as religion 
because that feels nice if you,

1218
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,680
if you could sort of wrap yourself 
around that,

1219
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,510
that that's how the world actually 
operates.

1220
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,490
We'd sorted the same thing as saying,
oh,

1221
00:52:57,491 --> 00:52:59,380
well there's a god and I'm going to 
believe that

1222
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,483
it is like a god or committee of gods or
something that's pulling the strings in 

1223
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:05,660
it and it grants way more power than 
they,

1224
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:09,190
than anybody actually has,
which is what we grant to gods that they

1225
00:53:09,191 --> 00:53:11,600
have more power than we have,
otherwise they wouldn't be gods,

1226
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,480
you know.
So what's the point of that?

1227
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,130
And uh,
so yeah,

1228
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:15,964
we worked through those and now 
politically since we've talked about 

1229
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:18,214
left and right,
that nine slash 11 is an interesting 

1230
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,840
take because that seems to be more on 
the left,

1231
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:23,703
uh,
and left and right both have their 

1232
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,740
handpicked conspiracies that they prefer
a,

1233
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,520
like,
like,

1234
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,070
but the anti-vaxxers tend to be a little
bit of both.

1235
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,933
You get antigovernment right?
And then the thing that the government 

1236
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,880
is in cahoots with big Pharma and then 
the left,

1237
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:40,714
it will,
big Pharma is making money off of 

1238
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:43,800
vaccines.
So you get a little bit of both,

1239
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,673
right?
That's interesting.

1240
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,513
Someone like Bill Maher,
I think it's anti-vaxxer for the most 

1241
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:48,520
part.
He's firmly on the left,

1242
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:49,090
but

1243
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:49,780
yeah.
So,

1244
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,480
but there,
it's,

1245
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,420
it's skeptical skepticism of authority.
Which Authority are you skeptical of the

1246
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:56,590
government or,
or,

1247
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,513
or the corporations.
And the perception is both have these 

1248
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:02,950
incredible amounts of power and studies 
on this show.

1249
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:05,470
They really don't have as much power as 
we think that they do.

1250
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,840
I mean,
ceos come and go and,

1251
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:11,050
and corporations rise and fall much more
than we think that they do.

1252
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:12,000
We think of,
you know,

1253
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,930
the microsofts of the world,
you know,

1254
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:16,000
even Google Apple,
they will fail.

1255
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,150
They will,
you know,

1256
00:54:17,151 --> 00:54:21,190
they're on top now.
But this will change just like Ibm,

1257
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,480
General Motors,
what,

1258
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,250
you know,
and um,

1259
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,290
you know,
so open.

1260
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,590
I was in Berkeley last week,
uh,

1261
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,600
that promoting the skeptic book.
I did talk for a KPFA PACIFICA radio,

1262
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,570
which is very far left progressive.
And uh,

1263
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,510
so it was that this church,
which was kind of wild because big cross

1264
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,730
behind me and I was like,
uh,

1265
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,910
but there were protesters,
I protesters.

1266
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,240
Oh my God,
what is this about,

1267
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:44,590
you know,
when they're handing out literature,

1268
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,693
you know,
the engineers and architects for nine 

1269
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:50,380
slash 11 truth and,
and shermer versus reality.

1270
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:52,380
The building seven could not have color,
you know.

1271
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,510
Oh,
I saw you tweet about this.

1272
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:55,211
Yeah.
Yeah.

1273
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:56,680
So they're okay.
This is a.

1274
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,833
So this is that the government is 
pulling the strings and doing these 

1275
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:02,704
things because of oil and the war.
And so it's after the fact reason he's 

1276
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,710
hindsight by.
So we went to war.

1277
00:55:06,711 --> 00:55:07,660
It was a big,
bad idea,

1278
00:55:07,661 --> 00:55:11,350
but we did it for oil.
Therefore we must have triggered the war

1279
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,660
in the first place.
Don't governments don't.

1280
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,643
Conservative and Republican 
administrations do those sorts of 

1281
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:17,650
things.
Yes.

1282
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,140
So do democratic,
you know,

1283
00:55:20,141 --> 00:55:20,974
Roosevelt could not get America into the
war to help churchill who he wanted to 

1284
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:28,870
help because of the American firsters 
were very powerful in the late thirties.

1285
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:32,590
And they could all see the Nazis rising 
and Roosevelt and Churchill wanted to do

1286
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:35,350
something about it.
And uh,

1287
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,213
but uh,
Charles Lindbergh and the American 

1288
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:40,790
firsters were very powerful Pearl Harbor
and a story we're going to reward.

1289
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:42,063
So isn't that an example of using an 
event that you didn't orchestrate to do 

1290
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:47,900
something politically you want to do?

1291
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:49,763
Sounds like a nice conspiracy theory 
that they knew it was going to happen 

1292
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:53,240
and they allowed it to.
Right?

1293
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,120
So there was two conspiracies about that
and same nine slash 11.

1294
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:56,954
Either either they did it or they knew 
it would happen in allowed it to happen 

1295
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:04,700
in order to get this political mode.
And so neither of them are true.

1296
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,640
And the reason we know this is because,
um,

1297
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,680
the,
the evidence that's used in favor of the

1298
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:13,040
conspiracy is all,
all along is hindsight bias is that,

1299
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,080
uh,
look,

1300
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,740
look,
look at this memo here.

1301
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:16,803
You know,
the famous August ninth memo from 

1302
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:19,540
Condoleeza Rice,
you know,

1303
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,160
Sama bid line will attack on US soil.
Wow.

1304
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:25,360
How come Bush didn't do about that?
Because there is 10,000

1305
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,194
pieces of info like that every week.
And then you're sorting through it and 

1306
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:30,520
no one's talking to each other,
you know,

1307
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,390
it's just chaos.

1308
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,303
So are you ever able to debunk a 
conspiracy theory to a point where the 

1309
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:41,310
theorists themselves will concede it?
Because that's sort of the fun in it.

1310
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,540
There's no end.
Right?

1311
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,070
So even if you lay down something that 
is just ironclad,

1312
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,353
still,
they're going to find some way to get 

1313
00:56:50,101 --> 00:56:51,150
around that.
I mean,

1314
00:56:51,151 --> 00:56:52,840
how often do you win in that,
you know,

1315
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,500
when.

1316
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,333
No,
uh,

1317
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,670
to the people that I'm debating or 
talking to probably never,

1318
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,610
never.
But we're after is again,

1319
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:01,830
the undecided voters.
The people that are like,

1320
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,150
yeah,
what's the story with that?

1321
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:05,550
I heard something about that memo.
Oh,

1322
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:06,420
I see.
And then they.

1323
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,240
Okay,
forget it.

1324
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,060
Nevermind.
Nothing to that.

1325
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,660
And you try to influence them by just 
some basic questions.

1326
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:12,961
You know,
like,

1327
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:16,320
I rifled through all the,
all the other things that,

1328
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,330
uh,
Islamic terrorists have done,

1329
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:22,230
you know,
London and Madrid and Boston and African

1330
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,064
countries and so on and so on.
Are they also part of this vast right 

1331
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:28,630
wing conspiracy that the bush?
No,

1332
00:57:28,631 --> 00:57:29,161
no,
no,

1333
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:30,990
of course not,
but that particular one,

1334
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,940
which is a little bit like,
okay,

1335
00:57:32,941 --> 00:57:35,790
we know those crop circles were faked,
but the ones over here,

1336
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,740
we don't have videos.
Those are the real ones.

1337
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,733
Yeah,
and there's also seems to be a need to 

1338
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:44,000
explain things that can't easily be 
explained.

1339
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,420
So even going back to the Cologne thing 
I saw that day,

1340
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,543
a fairly well known feminist saying this
was probably the work of 

1341
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:55,280
anti-immigration people that allow,
you know what I mean,

1342
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:56,114
that allowed this open because she 
didn't want to really deal with the 

1343
00:57:58,371 --> 00:57:59,204
world as it was and deal with the 
difficult questions related to 

1344
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:04,400
immigration and race and religion and 
all of that stuff.

1345
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,353
So instead,
and you kind of use it for your own 

1346
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,233
purposes and then you just open up 
another conspiracy theory and then that 

1347
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:14,060
gets retweeted enough and then you've 
opened up a whole other.

1348
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,233
Yeah.
So in that case it's okay to just call 

1349
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,110
bullshit.

1350
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:17,611
Just that.
Well,

1351
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:20,040
that's what I did.
This is a bridge too far.

1352
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:20,883
Yeah.
Let's do a little more on politics 

1353
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,950
though,
because you consider yourself

1354
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,060
a libertarian,
correct?

1355
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:26,460
Yes.
It's more of an issues guy,

1356
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:30,320
but I've leaned libertarian most of my 
life since college and uh,

1357
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,373
but I've changed my mind in a certain 
issues that libertarians are not too 

1358
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,550
happy about.
And the,

1359
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:39,590
and the reason I'm avoid using the term 
so much now a is because um,

1360
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,493
it pigeon,
it pigeonholes you into a category in 

1361
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:46,620
which you're in and then it makes it 
more like a religion.

1362
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,521
Like,
okay,

1363
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:48,354
so libertarian,
so you can't believe in any gun 

1364
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:50,791
controls.
Right?

1365
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:51,450
It's like,
well,

1366
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,370
no,
actually I think maybe background checks

1367
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:57,030
are a good idea in the magazine clip 
should be a certain,

1368
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:58,530
you know,
just a few things,

1369
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:00,480
you know,
it's like you've abandoned us,

1370
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,740
you know,
like what do we have tried,

1371
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:03,910
right.

1372
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,590
It's like a ride or you're Republican in
name only.

1373
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:06,131
You're a,
your,

1374
00:59:06,131 --> 00:59:07,000
a line or something.

1375
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,861
Yeah,
exactly.

1376
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:08,930
Right.
These are the,

1377
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,073
these are the points.
You have to hold to all of them or else 

1378
00:59:11,521 --> 00:59:13,110
you're not in our tribe.
Okay.

1379
00:59:13,111 --> 00:59:13,944
So,
well maybe I don't want to be in the 

1380
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,380
tribe.
Maybe I just want to look at issues.

1381
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:17,263
And what I like about Libertarians is I 
don't like either the far right or far 

1382
00:59:20,371 --> 00:59:23,000
left and so sort of pushes toward the 
more of the middle.

1383
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,983
I guess the spectrum,
the problem with the spectrum is that 

1384
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:27,920
it's not really a spectrum like that.
You know,

1385
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:32,050
there's other places you could be more 
of a peer,

1386
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,750
a diamond shaped,
uh,

1387
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,370
but nevertheless,
um,

1388
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,340
that and things like climate change,
you know,

1389
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:41,090
it's like we're supposed to be against a
believer in climate change because we're

1390
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:42,170
pro capitalists.
It's like,

1391
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,060
wait,
either it's getting warmer,

1392
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:46,040
it's not.
This is just an empirical question.

1393
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,420
It has nothing to do with politics.

1394
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:48,710
Yeah.
Does that show you?

1395
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:49,544
That's a good example of how politics 
and religion and just rationality and 

1396
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:59,150
irrationally it all gets mucked up.
So I hear you because a lot of people,

1397
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,073
you know,
I've always considered myself a liberal 

1398
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:02,443
and now I see,
I get emails and tweets everyday people 

1399
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:04,850
going,
ah,

1400
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:05,683
Dave's on his way to becoming a 
libertarian because I will always stand 

1401
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:09,194
up for liberty.
And I believe that the individual 

1402
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:12,410
person,
ultimately,

1403
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,740
I think you could know for gay marriage 
for example,

1404
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,140
while I can defend it from a liberal 
point of view,

1405
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:20,270
because I think people should be allowed
to marry who they want.

1406
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,810
It's also very easily defended by a 
libertarian point of view,

1407
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,970
right?
Or,

1408
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,960
or medical marijuana or things like 
that.

1409
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:27,794
So that's a place where I like that.
I think classic liberals and 

1410
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:34,400
Libertarians can sort of come together.
And I do think that that concept is sort

1411
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,100
of where politics should go in general.

1412
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,250
Absolutely.
I mean,

1413
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:42,140
Dr King made the point about gay 
marriage back when people were saying,

1414
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:42,974
Oh,
you shouldn't get involved in that back 

1415
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:44,610
in the sixties.
And,

1416
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,330
uh,
in a.

1417
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,280
and he said,
no,

1418
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:49,260
our freedom is wrapped up in their 
freedom.

1419
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,123
You know,
if you can suppress somebody because of 

1420
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,073
this particular way that they are,
then you can suppress them for other 

1421
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:56,340
category.
We want freedom across the board.

1422
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,140
And that's right,
that's the principle.

1423
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,033
Yeah.
So is that idea though a really what's 

1424
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:01,824
so dangerous about identity politics?
Because it's not what Dr King said that 

1425
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,880
we have to protect everybody else.
It's actually identity politics,

1426
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:09,714
like we got to protect ourselves.
And then what happens is everyone else 

1427
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:14,370
is sort of secondary.

1428
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,350
It's just tribalism.
It's just,

1429
01:01:16,351 --> 01:01:17,340
you know,
this is our tribe.

1430
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,400
These are what the things we believe.
Even like the humanism,

1431
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:22,410
when I got involved in the whole 
skeptics movement,

1432
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,550
uh,
in the late eighties,

1433
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,960
early nineties,
and I thought,

1434
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:25,800
well,
I'm a humanist.

1435
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:26,421
And then I,
you know,

1436
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:27,254
I started reading the humanist magazines
and going to their conferences and 

1437
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,333
Italian,
but I could clearly see they had a list 

1438
01:01:32,011 --> 01:01:35,910
of talking points that were just clearly
right down the straight political left.

1439
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:36,811
And it's like,
well,

1440
01:01:36,811 --> 01:01:38,400
what about these things over here?
You know?

1441
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,350
Oh,
it was the evil Republicans.

1442
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:41,184
Evil Conservatives.
Like,

1443
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,023
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1444
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,193
I thought you were a humanist.
Just science reason you stay out of 

1445
01:01:46,021 --> 01:01:48,900
politics.
But again,

1446
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:50,310
we're just,
we're political animals.

1447
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:52,020
You know,
we just want to be tribal.

1448
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,630
And so,
and you know libertarians,

1449
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,830
you know,
it's like hurting cats.

1450
01:01:55,831 --> 01:01:58,080
You know,
we're never going to be a big party.

1451
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,540
So I'm not even sure if it's a 
worthwhile label.

1452
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,453
Yeah,
I'd love to figure out a way to sort of 

1453
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:06,350
get those principles out there more even
though I don't as you know,

1454
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,930
as I just said,
I don't need the label for myself,

1455
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:11,870
but I think you can make a lot of strong
moral arguments.

1456
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:13,650
Not using religion.
Yes.

1457
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,590
Through the Libertarian Lens

1458
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,750
language matters.
So,

1459
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:17,610
you know,
maybe we're in,

1460
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,700
we were in favor of liberty and aren't 
you in favor of liberty and freedom?

1461
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:21,600
Yeah.
That sounds good.

1462
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,600
We're trying a new one on instead of gun
control.

1463
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:27,330
Gun Safety.
I believe in gun safety.

1464
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,640
I think people should be trained if they
have a gun,

1465
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:31,620
I think they should keep their gun 
locked up safely.

1466
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,850
Don't you agree?
You know,

1467
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,410
anyone in the NRA should go,
well,

1468
01:02:34,411 --> 01:02:35,041
yes,
of course.

1469
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,320
That's what our organization is.
Gun Safety.

1470
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:38,154
That's why they were founded,
but control it makes it sound like 

1471
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:44,190
you're trying to control my freedom.
You're going to control my individuality

1472
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,110
and that feels wrong.
You know?

1473
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:49,590
So the language does matter.
I think how we use these things.

1474
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:49,830
And

1475
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:50,663
so the kind of arguments kind of 
interesting because I think there is a 

1476
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:56,880
certain element of conspiracy theory 
with the people,

1477
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:57,714
the people that are totally pro gun to 
the point that you should be allowed to 

1478
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:03,570
have whatever it is you want and that 
one day you're gonna have to rise up and

1479
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,790
fight the government and all that stuff.
I understand,

1480
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:06,624
you know,
I've sat on the show many times like I 

1481
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:08,214
get it.
We left England because we didn't want 

1482
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:13,730
to live under a king and a tyrannical 
government and no tax agent was an agent

1483
01:03:13,731 --> 01:03:15,810
and all that stuff.
Um,

1484
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,140
but there's an element of conspiracy to 
that,

1485
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:20,340
that the government is coming to get 
these people,

1486
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,040
right?
So the more that the government tries to

1487
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,140
get their guns,
the more they want their guns,

1488
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,980
right?
So isn't that because Lee cycle,

1489
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:29,443
how do we break that?

1490
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,010
Obama has sold more guns.

1491
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,110
I mean,
they say that constantly,

1492
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:34,190
right?
So how do,

1493
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,300
how do we break that cycle?

1494
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:36,920
Um,
well I think,

1495
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,280
I think we need to get to organizations 
like the NRA and say,

1496
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:42,380
you've,
you've gone down the wrong path.

1497
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:43,214
You know,
you really should be in favor of safety 

1498
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:47,360
and these are the kinds of things that 
we need to have background checks.

1499
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,190
I mean,
just change the conversation.

1500
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:50,024
So.
So you're in favor of a terrorist 

1501
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,690
getting guns for free and killing people
in America.

1502
01:03:53,691 --> 01:03:55,010
You think that that should be.
Well,

1503
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:55,401
no,
no,

1504
01:03:55,401 --> 01:03:56,240
no.
They should be to.

1505
01:03:56,241 --> 01:03:57,074
Well,
how can you tell if they're a terrorist 

1506
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,784
or not?
I mean we just have to have background 

1507
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:00,224
checks for everybody.
They're not going to tell you at the 

1508
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:01,940
border.
Yeah,

1509
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,630
I'm coming here to kill Americans,
you know?

1510
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,910
So uh,
you know,

1511
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:06,890
you need the general principles.
And what about,

1512
01:04:06,891 --> 01:04:08,640
you know,
air let anybody fly.

1513
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:09,381
Airplane.
Well No,

1514
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:10,460
they should be licensed.

1515
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,550
Of course they should be licensed.
So I try,

1516
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:15,550
I try to use those arguments and also 
take the approach like I do with,

1517
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,300
with uh,
Christians.

1518
01:04:17,301 --> 01:04:18,134
You know,
I used to be one now used to be a 

1519
01:04:18,861 --> 01:04:19,760
Christian.
You are a Christian.

1520
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:20,391
Yeah.
What happened?

1521
01:04:20,391 --> 01:04:22,430
Okay.
So then at least they're listening.

1522
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:24,410
You know,
I used to be against all gun control.

1523
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:25,340
You know,
I had guns,

1524
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:26,450
I grew up with guns.
I had a,

1525
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,520
I had a uh,
uh,

1526
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,010
a handgun in my home for 20 years,
you know,

1527
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,930
but you know,
I got to change your mind.

1528
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,063
You change your mind.
I started reading and thinking about it 

1529
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:38,870
and look at these studies and so on and 
so to open the door to a conversation,

1530
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,213
but guns are almost tell asthmatic now.
They're almost like religious icons of 

1531
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,230
representing freedom and liberty and God
and Jesus and I don't know,

1532
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:49,183
it's all wrapped up in a package now 
that people just lose their minds when 

1533
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:53,384
you talk about it.

1534
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,233
So as long as we're talking guns,
let's knock out a couple other just hot 

1535
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:57,564
button political things and see if we 
can figure out the moral argument for 

1536
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:02,850
them before we wrap up.
So something like abortion,

1537
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:03,953
which as a general rule,
I'm for the woman being able to make 

1538
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:10,170
decisions about her body.
But at the same point I would understand

1539
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:11,004
that having an abortion at a,
at eight months or seven months or even 

1540
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:18,160
six months in my opinion,
are definitely destroying a human life.

1541
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,353
Now,
if your people don't want to have that 

1542
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:22,594
conversation,
right,

1543
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,070
people are afraid to have that 
conversation.

1544
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,520
So what,
what moral argument can you make that is

1545
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:28,270
for,
I assume you're,

1546
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,750
I'm guessing you're for abortion.
Actually I don't have.

1547
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:35,150
So your approach is,
so what's one piece of a.

1548
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,173
that's why language matters,
but what moral argument can you make 

1549
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:39,484
that for abortion that also understands 
that at some point before that thing 

1550
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,230
leaves the woman's body.
It is a life at the same point.

1551
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:48,163
Well,
I think the law is tracked this fairly 

1552
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,340
closely to our intuitions that,
you know,

1553
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,970
a third trimester abortion is wrong,
you know,

1554
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:56,893
the gray area in the second trimester.
No Gregory and the first trimester kind 

1555
01:06:00,741 --> 01:06:04,010
of tracking our sense about whether it's
an individual or not,

1556
01:06:04,011 --> 01:06:09,011
is that a person that's thinking,
cognizant can feel and suffer.

1557
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,910
And um,
and so there,

1558
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,970
I think you could make the case.
I try to,

1559
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,690
in the moral arc that,
um,

1560
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,643
that,
that the freedom of adult women to have 

1561
01:06:19,131 --> 01:06:19,964
control and choice over their own bodies
slightly trumps the rights or whatever 

1562
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:28,600
of the fetus.
Just barely a,

1563
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,513
I'm not pro abortion,
I am pro choice and it would be better 

1564
01:06:31,971 --> 01:06:34,070
if you know,
if the numbers got down,

1565
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,293
but if a but on that,
if it's our goal to decrease the number 

1566
01:06:37,521 --> 01:06:38,354
of abortions,
the best thing you can do is get women 

1567
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,610
educated,
prosperous,

1568
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:47,420
and access to birth control and the 
numbers just go down.

1569
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,313
Right.
That's where we really failed as a 

1570
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:50,610
society,
right?

1571
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,573
Yeah.
Because the same people that don't want 

1572
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,620
abortions also cut sex education and 
then it's like,

1573
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,310
well,
you know,

1574
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,143
and then they cut social services so 
people feel like if they're going to 

1575
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:02,550
have a kid and not have money for it,
well they don't want that kid.

1576
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,780
So it's like,
again,

1577
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:05,680
it's another one of these never ending 
cycles.

1578
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,613
And the other argument I make in the 
moral arc is it historical and that has 

1579
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,360
historically men have always lorded it 
over.

1580
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:16,361
Women,
particularly about sex and paternity and

1581
01:07:16,431 --> 01:07:17,710
so on.
And just,

1582
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,583
if you just look at the history of 
marriage and the history of men and 

1583
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:23,750
women's relationships for thousands of 
years,

1584
01:07:23,751 --> 01:07:24,584
it's always men trying to control women 
and there's good evolutionary reasons 

1585
01:07:27,771 --> 01:07:29,510
for this.
Pinker argues about this in,

1586
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,800
in the blank slate,
you know,

1587
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,620
whole chapter on sex and all that stuff 
and you know,

1588
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:38,120
men are obsessed with controlling 
women's sexuality and this is one of the

1589
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:40,790
big things that have helped the women's 
movement is to,

1590
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,600
is to break that,
those chains and give women the freedom.

1591
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,733
So that's my final argument is that in 
addition to the rights of the fetus 

1592
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,960
selling all those,
but,

1593
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:51,823
but just in the long run,
it's better to give women more freedom 

1594
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:58,400
than less end to end to keep men out of 
that area of control.

1595
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,283
Yeah.
So that sounds like it would line up 

1596
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:02,650
with some libertarian values pointedly.
Yeah.

1597
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,540
The liberty of the woman.
Yeah.

1598
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,740
So most libertarians are pro choice for 
sure.

1599
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,750
So there's a few,
like Ron Paul,

1600
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,700
who was sort of considered himself a 
libertarian,

1601
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,980
but he's Christian.
So see there,

1602
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:15,870
you see that interesting conflict.
So he was a gynecologist,

1603
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:16,950
right,
because he is a guy in the bottom.

1604
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,770
So that,
that's,

1605
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:18,603
that's a lot,

1606
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,100
you know,
there's,

1607
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,180
so again,
Libertarians are all over the board,

1608
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:24,600
you know,
there's,

1609
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,433
there's plenty of atheist libertarians,
but there's plenty of believers or are 

1610
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,210
just in the middle.
They're not religious at all.

1611
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,463
And,
and they're also very much split on 

1612
01:08:32,551 --> 01:08:34,110
foreign policy,
you know,

1613
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:37,890
should we be isolationists or do we need
to go help people that need help,

1614
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:38,940
you know,
so.

1615
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,120
Well,
like Rand Paul,

1616
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:42,180
he was very isolationist his father even
more so.

1617
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,570
Uh,
so I,

1618
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,220
I get those arguments,
uh,

1619
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,180
but on the other hand,
don't we have a moral obligation to help

1620
01:08:48,181 --> 01:08:49,014
people whose own freedoms and liberties 
are being oppressed by a tyrannical 

1621
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,490
dictators?
Yes,

1622
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:54,180
we do.

1623
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:54,841
Yeah.
Okay.

1624
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:57,510
So this is what that split in the left 
they were talking about earlier.

1625
01:08:57,511 --> 01:08:58,344
It's really a hugely about what can we 
do and are we imposing our values and 

1626
01:09:01,591 --> 01:09:02,031
all that.
But let,

1627
01:09:02,031 --> 01:09:02,864
let's,
let's just do one more and then we got 

1628
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:05,880
to wrap up.
So I want to talk about a moral argument

1629
01:09:05,881 --> 01:09:09,360
you can make on the economic level I 
think is really interesting.

1630
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,231
Uh,
you know,

1631
01:09:10,231 --> 01:09:11,064
when you hear people talking about what 
Bernie wants to tax everybody at 90 

1632
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:14,730
percent,
we know it's not 90 percent.

1633
01:09:14,731 --> 01:09:16,620
It's a progressive tax,
so it's not,

1634
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:17,454
you know,
without getting into too much into the 

1635
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:19,373
numbers there,
but it's not really taxing you at 90 

1636
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:24,750
percent.
It progressively increases versus a flat

1637
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:25,584
tax.
Can you make a moral argument for 

1638
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,790
economics?
That makes sense?

1639
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,133
Uh,
I'm not sure absolutely across the 

1640
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,440
board,
but um,

1641
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:38,020
but the idea of running different 
experiments were say different states in

1642
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:38,854
the 50 states have different tax systems
and you can kind of look at the outcome 

1643
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:46,300
of what happens socially in that and 
economically in that particular state.

1644
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,613
You know,
does it become more or less prosperous 

1645
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:50,800
with the progressive tax versus a flat 
tax?

1646
01:09:50,801 --> 01:09:54,490
I would actually like to see some states
just do a straight flat tax and just see

1647
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:56,860
what happens or maybe try it for awhile,
you know,

1648
01:09:56,861 --> 01:10:00,160
maybe maybe we should abolish the irs,
do with straight 16 and a half percent,

1649
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:02,890
whatever it was a,
I think the cruise wants that.

1650
01:10:02,891 --> 01:10:05,080
Right?
So let's see what happens,

1651
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,943
you know,
run the experiment and we can always go 

1652
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:08,380
back.
Uh,

1653
01:10:08,381 --> 01:10:10,240
you know,
so I'm in favor of just trying different

1654
01:10:10,241 --> 01:10:11,980
things on a lot of those things.

1655
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:15,850
I'm not sure that there's an absolute 
single answer here.

1656
01:10:15,851 --> 01:10:19,660
I like Sam's a metaphor of the multiple 
peaks on the moral landscape.

1657
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,850
Uh,
so how do we decide which peak is right?

1658
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,200
You can't.
There is no,

1659
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,123
there's no right peak is right for you.
So this is kind of the libertarian 

1660
01:10:26,651 --> 01:10:27,340
argument.
You know,

1661
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,470
you want to paint your house red with a 
purple door,

1662
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,393
fine.
But in our neighborhood we don't like 

1663
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,680
the houses that look like that.
They all look the same.

1664
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:36,514
That's,
that's what we like in this 

1665
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:39,490
neighborhood.
But that neighborhood over there make it

1666
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,000
topanga where everybody has these wild 
hippie homes.

1667
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:43,834
Okay,
fine.

1668
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,980
So you have different communities that 
live different ways and you know,

1669
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:50,170
I don't like the argument.
Well just if you don't like America then

1670
01:10:50,171 --> 01:10:51,290
leave,
go to Mexico if you like.

1671
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,151
Well you know,
come on,

1672
01:10:52,151 --> 01:10:53,410
my friends are here,
my family's here,

1673
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:54,430
my kids are gonna.
Come on,

1674
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:58,090
let's see if we can do local politics 
and just run different experiments.

1675
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,900
Yeah.
And often if you're complaining about it

1676
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,220
the most,
it means you care the most.

1677
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:02,990
So yes.
Well hopefully.

1678
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,510
What was it?
I could have done this for another three

1679
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,940
hours so you're definitely going to have
to come back because I barely got to any

1680
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:10,640
of this stuff on my note card.
So I thank you.

1681
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:11,673
And I want to thank Michael Shermer for 
joining me and you can check out his 

1682
01:11:14,391 --> 01:11:17,450
work@skepticdotcomanditMichaelShermer.com.
Correct.

1683
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,171
Alright,
there you go.

1684
01:11:18,171 --> 01:11:19,370
We'll do it again next week.
Thanks.
