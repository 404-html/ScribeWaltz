1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,903
You guys know that I try my best to stay
out of the day to day political 

2
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:08,934
bickering and focus more on big ideas 
and the philosophies which are behind 

3
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,714
all the fighting.
This doesn't mean I'm ignoring the 

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,350
issues of the moment,
be it North Korea,

5
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:19,020
the gun debate or the general state of 
Trumpism,

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,063
but focusing on why people believe what 
they believe is far more valuable to me 

7
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:27,030
than adding fuel to the fire of whatever
the story of the day might be.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,113
Toss in a healthy dose of political 
gridlock and we seem to have lots of 

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:34,590
people who were yelling,
but very few people who are doing.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,010
There's one issue happening in American 
politics right now,

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,980
which is a great example of the 
stagnation we face,

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,400
but that is totally flying under the 
radar right now.

13
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,234
Dozens of countries,
some of them key strategic allies don't 

14
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:48,954
have us ambassadors because the Senate 
has refused to vote on their 

15
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,120
confirmation.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,400
According to the rules of the Senate 
right now,

17
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,840
the Senate needs 30 hours of debate to 
confirm an ambassadorship.

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,720
You can imagine with all the nonsensical
waste in DC,

19
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:04,554
how impossible it would be to spend 30 
hours debating each of the new 

20
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:10,860
ambassador ships.
When a new administration comes in,

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,903
we'd be talking about literally 
thousands of hours of debate for a 

22
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:14,994
branch of government which can't seem to
agree on which flavor of yogurt should 

23
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,040
be served at the capital hill 
commissary.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,670
Back in 2014 when the Democrats 
controlled the Senate,

25
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,504
then majority leader,
Harry Reid used what is known as the 

26
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:27,774
nuclear option to get many Obama 
appointees through the Senate in effect 

27
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,704
read,
change the rules so that a simple 

28
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:34,704
majority rather than a 60 vote super 
majority would be enough to confirm 

29
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,990
ambassadors,
federal judges,

30
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,824
and other positions.
Though I was firmly on the left at the 

31
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,464
time and I had no issue,
I can remember with the Obama 

32
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,194
appointees,
I was against read using such a drastic 

33
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,560
tactic.

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,393
To me,
if you change the rules when you're in 

35
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,394
power,
it's incredibly obvious and probably 

36
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,840
quite deserved when those same rules 
will be used against your team.

37
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:58,674
When you're not in power,
you can rightly blame Republicans for 

38
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:04,050
not voting.
On the Obama appointees in 2014,

39
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,884
just as right now,
you can rightly blame Democrats for not 

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,643
voting on trump appointees in 2018.
This is exactly why people rightfully 

41
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,820
hate the political machine in 
Washington.

42
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,923
It either does nothing or it changes the
rules to suit itself while usually 

43
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:24,441
leaving the people it's supposed to 
serve far behind the Republicans now led

44
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,524
by majority leader,
Mitch Mcconnell could use what is known 

45
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:33,261
as the nuclear option right now just as 
Reid and the Democrats did back in 2014.

46
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,600
For whatever reason though,
McConnell refuses to do so.

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,553
Some were saying he has such an old 
school affinity for the rules of the 

48
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:43,950
Senate that he doesn't want to stoop to 
what reed did in a certain way.

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,480
This seems like a principled position,
but at this point in American politics,

50
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:49,314
I wonder if clinging onto the old ways 
while your ideological opponents chisel 

51
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:58,401
away at those very institutions at every
opportunity makes much sense at all.

52
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,573
Let me add another wrinkle to the story.
The highest ranking ambassadorship that 

53
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,034
we now have open Germany has been 
offered to former US spokesmen for the 

54
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,660
UN,
Richard Grenelle.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,750
Richard is the longest serving UN 
spokesman in history,

56
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,120
working for four different US 
ambassadors.

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,133
He's also served several other positions
in the government as well as worked for 

58
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,990
a few other high level political 
campaigns by every measure.

59
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
He's supremely qualified and I've seen 
plenty of people on both sides of the 

60
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:24,784
aisle that praise him as the exact type 
of person that we need more of in 

61
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,474
politics.
Richard and I have become friends over 

62
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,964
the past few years and I can personally 
tell you that he's truly a decent guy 

63
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,220
who just wants to serve his country.

64
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,650
Oh,
and there's one other piece to this.

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,460
Richard happens to be gay.
You may remember back in 2012,

66
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,294
Richard was briefly a spokesman for the 
Romney campaign until the media decided 

67
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,721
to attack an openly gay man for daring 
to work for the Republican candidate,

68
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,290
Mitt Romney thus causing Richard to step
down from the campaign because he didn't

69
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,760
want to be a distraction apparently.
Although Romney felt it was just fine to

70
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,594
hire a gay man,
and Richard felt it was totally okay to 

71
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,744
work for Romney.
The media just wouldn't let it be gay 

72
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:11,410
conservatives like Richard,
much like black conservatives like Larry

73
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:14,290
elder or female conservatives like Nikki
Haley,

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,333
challenge the orthodoxy that the 
Democrats must own all of these groups 

75
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:19,984
of people I mentioned Richard Sexuality,
not because it's important or even 

76
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,064
relevant,
unless you play the identity politics 

77
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:28,060
game as so many do.
In effect,

78
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,894
the Democrats are blocking and extremely
qualified openly gay men from serving 

79
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,060
his country aren't the Democrats and 
left these supposed to be for gays.

80
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,820
Isn't that part of their intersectional 
worldview?

81
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,630
Immutable characteristics,
often trump qualifications.

82
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,700
If you subscribe to this line of 
thinking,

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,833
shouldn't.
This also means supporting gay people 

84
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,174
whose political positions you might 
disagree with because you believe in 

85
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,134
their ability to think for themselves or
perhaps the so called tolerance side 

86
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:00,040
really isn't pro gay or pro any 
minority.

87
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:05,041
They are actually only pro those who 
believe as they do now,

88
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,943
obviously you know that I don't think 
anyone should be confirmed because of 

89
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,430
their sexuality,
nor should their sexuality matter in the

90
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,070
least when it comes to being nominated 
in the first place.

91
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,090
I just think that this particular cases 
interesting on so many levels.

92
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,103
We have the gridlock of Washington with 
Democrats refusing to vote on trump 

93
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:25,390
nominees.
We have a majority leader,

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,273
Mcconnell that refuses to use his option
to confirm nominees even though the 

95
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,920
previous Senate leader,
Reid did exactly just that.

96
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,993
We have dozens of qualified candidates 
waiting to do their civic duty and we 

97
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:42,250
have just as many countries waiting for 
our ambassadors to move there and get to

98
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:45,550
work cotton.
All of this mess is a good man,

99
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,384
Richard Grinnell,
who I happen to know personally who 

100
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:52,360
doesn't want extra credit for being gay,
but just wants to get to work.

101
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,940
How can you make a difference in all 
this?

102
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,370
Call your local senator and ask their 
assistant at the office

103
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,720
why they are in voting on these nominees
and you can also call Mitch Mcconnell at

104
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,850
his DC office by calling two.
Oh,

105
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:05,810
two,
two,

106
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,381
two,
four,

107
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,101
two,
five,

108
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,934
four,
one.

109
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,890
Actually,
I'm going to give him a call right now.

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,010
Joining me today as a guy who seen an 
awful lot of people get hit in the nuts,

111
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,153
a man who's lived in a house that 
constantly seems to be getting fuller 

112
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,714
and a standup comic who's new.
Special zero to 60 is now streaming on 

113
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,580
Amazon.
Bob Saget,

114
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,290
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you.

115
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,660
I'm excited to be here.
You're a very smart man.

116
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,494
I cannot keep up with you mentally,
but we did have dinner and I seem to 

117
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:41,330
keep up with the entrees.
Is that why you were applying me with so

118
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,670
much alcohol during dinner to kind of 
dumb me down,

119
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,680
so I just said that we could get on the 
level.

120
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,230
I wanted to see what you were like 
unconscious.

121
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,420
Yeah,
we did go because that's the world we're

122
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,680
in right now.
Yeah.

123
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,790
Yeah.
That's it.

124
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,950
Opposite day kind of statement.
In other words,

125
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,310
years ago when you would say,
I want to see what your unconscious.

126
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,443
That would be a joke,
but unfortunately we are in a world 

127
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,960
right now where that's actually 
happened.

128
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,020
So a lot of things that are a reverend 
and could be considered funny or not.

129
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,480
And so there's this buffering that goes 
on before,

130
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,314
but either way you did not get overly 
inebriated and you were more than 

131
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,184
pleasant.
And we had a lovely night with both of 

132
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:26,510
our significant others who we both adore
and we laughed and we had good food.

133
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,890
Yeah,
we will do it again.

134
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,930
We will do it again.
And that's all I want to talk about.

135
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,910
Talking about my career.
What do we have his entree,

136
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,140
I believe.
Uh,

137
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,540
I had the fish.
You did.

138
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,000
I think you had something not as 
healthy.

139
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,420
I think it was.
Maybe you had some kind of chicken.

140
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,420
So I'm to maybe.
Alright,

141
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,420
let's focus here and say I get.

142
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,530
So I'm here.
That's a good place to start.

143
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,220
What you just did there.
Just the state of political correctness.

144
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,920
Let's just do a little bit on that.
And then I want to do saget one-on-one.

145
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,780
Alright.
For this next hour,

146
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm teaching that course at a community 
college.

147
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,040
How many kids are taking it?
It doesn't matter.

148
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,010
Whoever applies.
That doesn't turn me in.

149
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm all in.
Everybody comes in to the trailer.

150
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,260
What do you think of a that you're doing
this?

151
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:11,261
We're live to tape so we don't edit and 
this did not exist four years ago.

152
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,180
This existed,
but it didn't exist like this.

153
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,680
I mean,
you've got millions of people that watch

154
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,514
this.
Yeah.

155
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,350
This is crazy.
Well,

156
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,360
what do you think about that?
Like you're used to doing.

157
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,070
I mean obviously I went to stand up and 
everything else,

158
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,740
but you do scripted series,
you guys,

159
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,220
you do movies,
things like that,

160
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,250
but you also do you do panel on talk 
shows,

161
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,250
things that are sort of,
they're kind of old school now.

162
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,060
Like that's very different than coming 
in here and right before we start I said

163
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,020
to you,
we're just going to go for it.

164
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,220
And you were like,
whatever you want.

165
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,061
I mean,
I don't have to look.

166
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,320
I can just do that and we're,
we're,

167
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,350
you can.
Yeah.

168
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,850
Well you get a little bit back again and
better.

169
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,110
Those are the smallest cards I've ever 
seen your interviews on.

170
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,340
Microfiche.
It's just,

171
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,410
I just write little silly things or.
No,

172
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,090
that looks all smart.
Um,

173
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,980
I,
I love the fact that this exists because

174
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,080
years ago,
if you wanted to go on a show and have a

175
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,150
one on one with someone,
it was,

176
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,013
you were a baby,
but it was Tom Snyder and we'd be 

177
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,600
getting that,
uh,

178
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,800
that you might be tiny bit older than a 
baby.

179
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,893
The camera was always very close to,
is incredibly close and Dan Akroyd on 

180
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:12,654
Saturday night live and the very 
beginning we do an impression of it was 

181
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:15,864
this tight and he would be smoking and 
Tom and just talking to camera do is 

182
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:22,110
discourse which is very much like a 
podcast is today.

183
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,600
Like bill burr friend of mine gets up in
the morning,

184
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,763
talks for an hour once a week.
It's unbelievable to listen to a lot of 

185
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,440
our great podcasters.
That's the,

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,320
everything has changed.
And in that regard,

187
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,213
this has changed for the better because 
you get to have an articulate 

188
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,840
conversation,
um,

189
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,760
that you can't normally have in 
commercial television because commercial

190
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,160
televisions meant to be entertaining.
Yeah.

191
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,620
Only I don't know what we're meant to be
over here.

192
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,610
Well,
interesting.

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,930
Interesting.
I guess.

194
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,310
Yeah.
And my fiance,

195
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,350
Kelly turned me onto your show and um,
I said I really like him and I like what

196
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,164
he's talking about.
And you had guests on and you wherever 

197
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,190
you're able to be a diplomat,
a,

198
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,024
which is very difficult to do when you 
have people with different points of 

199
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,980
view.
A conservative and a liberal,

200
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,370
which I don't understand.
I don't understand any of it.

201
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
I mean I understand it,
but I mean we're mammals,

202
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,133
whereas opposed to alive,
we're supposed to be nice to another 

203
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:28,200
mammal,
I suppose to hunt it and kill it depends

204
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,034
which kind of mammal you are.
If it's delicious then you have to go 

205
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,880
for it.
Yeah.

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,873
Just food.
Well we're gonna we're gonna dive into 

207
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:36,924
all that because I did notice that for 
you it's interesting I think because 

208
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,763
your standup is so different than your,
your television persona between 

209
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,190
Americans money.
So the video is in full as well that the

210
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,220
old ones.
But then entourage that was Kinda like a

211
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,054
thing.
But then.

212
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,310
But then I did a bunch of acting stuff 
too.

213
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,410
And I've done Broadway work,
which was,

214
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,423
some of it was similar to my standup,
but I've always done some mean that's 

215
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,730
every seven years.
There's some new incarnation that people

216
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:03,960
go,
who the hell is he?

217
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,490
Yeah,
well that's why I think it's interesting

218
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,324
because especially with celebrities,
people like to just get an or anyone 

219
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,440
that's public that they like to just get
a kind of image of you and then just run

220
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,274
with that forever and challenging that.
I refuse to be pigeonholed because it 

221
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:22,320
sounds like something you should not do 
to little pigeon now.

222
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,120
See that's the kind of joke you guys 
still do.

223
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,210
You still do that because it's not a 
human being.

224
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,210
It's a pigeon,
but the only people that are going to be

225
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,870
really upset about that would be the 
humane society and they are right.

226
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,170
They spcas all over the show.
They're just.

227
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,290
I don't see their name anywhere anymore.
I think they're out.

228
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,270
You think they're done?
I don't know.

229
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,240
I think it's the Aas,
PCA,

230
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:49,080
NRA.
I think it's a combined so that you take

231
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,790
care of the bird and then you fire at 
it.

232
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,743
Is that going to fly well on this show?
I think it will know we've got those 

233
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,330
chickens out there in one day.
People always ask me,

234
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:58,720
what are you going to do when they stop 
laying eggs or you just wait a minute,

235
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,463
but they're so beautiful.
I thought they were males because they 

236
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:06,670
had the red millet.
Millay millay was to call you.

237
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,760
We're very excited to say Kako.
I said you have three beautiful Cox,

238
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,560
but no,
those are actually.

239
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,730
Those are female hens that lay eggs and 
what are you doing this for?

240
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:17,620
The eggs,
not just as woody Allen,

241
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,060
which was Groucho Marx.
I need the eggs and the eggs,

242
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,800
but that's the truth.
Andy Hall.

243
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,690
That's the right.
Go ahead.

244
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,750
I.
This is a problem with me as a talk show

245
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:30,640
guest.
As a comedian.

246
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah,
and as someone without a script,

247
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,780
I free associate and I sometimes do not 
stay on track,

248
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,660
but you were so smart and linear.

249
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,583
You were going to keep me on track and I
will do my very best to accommodate you 

250
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,790
and I will do my best to accommodate.
You said,

251
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,850
okay,
this is fair.

252
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,820
Let's start at the beginning.
You were born in Philadelphia?

253
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,910
I was,
yeah,

254
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,930
in Einstein Hospital.
Einstein hospital.

255
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,500
And it's still there.
Is that an honor of Albert Einstein?

256
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,240
It is.
It is.

257
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,133
And it's on broad street and uh,
and I was born there and my dad worked 

258
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:09,340
for a supermarket company called Food 
Pantry,

259
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,640
pride supermarkets.
And he was an executive.

260
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,070
That all sounds legit.
What about your family?

261
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:18,190
What,
what background?

262
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,890
What business were they in?
I was born in Brooklyn,

263
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,650
grew up in Long Island,
lived in Manhattan my whole life.

264
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,610
Went to college,
upstate New York.

265
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,050
So I'm a true New Yorker.
So we're both.

266
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,800
You had the life I wish I had.
I was in Philly.

267
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,390
I lived at home during college.

268
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,223
You had it.
You had.

269
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,123
This is why you are smart.
And I go out and tell a bunch of wiener 

270
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,371
jokes.
I know,

271
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:38,620
but I'm going back into that now.
As you know,

272
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,480
you are,
you're out doing stand up.

273
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,820
I told you I'm going back into standup.
You were very excited.

274
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,683
I'm excited.
You also told me you were playing the 

275
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,710
Irvine Improv and when is that?
Oh,

276
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,600
that wasn't even public just now.
That's great.

277
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,493
Is that okay to say that April eighth,
April my first headlining Gig in 10 

278
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,094
years.
And this is one of the nicest clubs in 

279
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,180
Los Angeles and in,
in,

280
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,720
in anywhere really.
I mean it's,

281
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,050
it's like 600 people,
700 people.

282
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:02,884
It looks like a spaceship.
It looks like a Disney exhibit and it's 

283
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:06,430
um,
it's an irvine,

284
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,720
which is why they call it the Irvine 
Improv and couldn't put that together.

285
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,970
Why do they call it the Irvine Improv 
and there's spit,

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,270
I don't know,
but they're smart people and uh,

287
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,650
and then nice people.

288
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,400
Maybe you will bring some more people 
because you have so many people that you

289
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,990
will bring your audience,
which is,

290
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,570
that's the advantage of what we do and 
whatever we do,

291
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,050
whatever media we're on,
that's who comes to see us.

292
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,360
That's got to be the most beautiful 
shift in comedy.

293
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:32,194
Right.
Do you remember that moment when you 

294
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,754
went from being a guy that was just 
trying to get on eight out of 10 comics 

295
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,250
at the end of the night?
Nobody knows who you are.

296
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,530
Do you remember the beginning of when 
people were going,

297
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
I'm going to see Bob Saget.
Something weird happened with me,

298
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,820
which was I started doing standup when I
was 17 and I want to hear that.

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,070
That was a re heal.
Who uh,

300
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,800
the 70,
73.

301
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,240
Wow.
So because I'm 104 on the freeway.

302
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,670
Head of hair though for $100.
Not Bad.

303
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,870
No.
Very impressed.

304
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,040
But I had to do the drops.

305
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,873
I take the thing.
I take propecia that's supposed to take 

306
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,810
on the probation.
He seems fine.

307
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,760
Oh,
please don't compare me to that.

308
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,580
That's the hair.
We'll get there.

309
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,140
We'll get my.
It's not a comb over.

310
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,180
I know it's going to happen if we get 
right on trump.

311
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,790
I actually,
I,

312
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,660
I,
I believe,

313
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,860
but I don't want to.
I'm not doing.

314
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,723
I'm not doing anything to bash anyone.
I will not do it even though it's 

315
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:26,834
possible that his comb-over is from an 
onion in the kitchen that just snaggle 

316
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:34,100
tooth along the ground and then crawls 
up his back.

317
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,930
Did you see that moment when I saw that 
video on the airplane that done CGI?

318
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,170
Was that done with effects because that 
didn't look possible?

319
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,730
It looks pretty.
It looked pretty fake.

320
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:45,830
But let's,
let's put trump aside.

321
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,230
I want to talk stand.
Yes,

322
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,100
because.
Do you remember that moment when,

323
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,030
when things change?

324
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,460
Yeah.
What happened was I came out to la.

325
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,450
I went on,
I had one,

326
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,284
the Student Academy Award for a 
documentary I made about my nephew who 

327
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:59,540
had his face reconstructed,
um,

328
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,560
when he was seven and I won this student
Academy Award for documentary and then I

329
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,394
went on at the comedy store the next 
night and Mitzi the owner of the comedy 

330
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,750
store.
So you should work here.

331
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,660
So I started getting spots right away.
Wow.

332
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,460
And then I started a fight for that.
People fight and I didn't work the door.

333
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,930
Wow.
And I was,

334
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,230
I guess the likable but strange,
very strange jokes.

335
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,320
Like my first joke was I have the first 
show,

336
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,493
I have the brain of a German shepherd 
and the body of a 16 year old boy and 

337
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:31,330
they're both in my car and I want you to
see them now.

338
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,730
It's just an odd rambling,
but it symbolizes,

339
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,733
I think it answers the question of how 
did he become this because he was that 

340
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,110
you're going to be third person.

341
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,000
I myself,
but um,

342
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,670
and then I started going on a college 
tour.

343
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,790
She put me on a Mitzi shore for the 
comedy store,

344
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,624
put me on a college tour and I was a 
guitar act just to parodies and I would 

345
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:58,820
sing while my guitar gently weeps,
turn a valve and water poured out of the

346
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:01,970
guitar and you could only see it in the 
first 10 rows.

347
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:04,690
So it doesn't really work for the big 
stadium.

348
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,710
CanNot play the Irvine Improv with this 
bit.

349
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,890
Yeah.
And then I was headlining right away.

350
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:10,724
So in my early twenties,
I'd go out on the road while I was 

351
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:14,834
taking five years of acting classes with
a teacher named Darryl Hickman and La 

352
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,183
while I was doing improv classes at the 
groundlings while I was doing spots at 

353
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,250
the comedy store.
I'd go out on the road and then headline

354
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:26,180
and then make money.

355
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,940
Um,
but not enough to get a career.

356
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,893
And then it was like eight,
nine years of hosting the comedy store 

357
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,330
in Westwood and that was hard.
It was,

358
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,340
but I got to be friend people that I 
worshiped,

359
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:41,174
which were Richard Pryor and Robin 
Williams and David Letterman was one of 

360
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:44,774
my first emcees and,
and so I was 22 years old and the place 

361
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:53,220
was packed like it was then kind of now 
bad sentence.

362
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:54,054
But in the early eighties it was you 
could not get into any room and every 

363
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:04,680
single person on the lineup was like.
And I was hosting a lot of the shows,

364
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,080
so,
uh,

365
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,923
but then everybody went off and got tv 
shows and I was still at the comedy 

366
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,540
store hosting and thinking,
this is it.

367
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm never going to make it.
And then I got an,

368
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:20,211
a Richard Pryor movie and then I got on 
a cbs show and a morning show or movie a

369
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,720
critical condition.

370
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,420
Oh,
I've seen that on the young Dr Jaffe who

371
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:25,254
does all the jobs that are disgusting 
that he doesn't want to do because he's 

372
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:28,734
not a real doctor.
It sounds like the emcee at a comedy 

373
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:32,200
club.
Exactly the same thing,

374
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,413
you don't want to touch people and um,
I remember holding Garrett Morris from 

375
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:42,140
Saturday night live by the testicles and
Richard kept calling me,

376
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
kept telling me to squeeze harder and 
that was a reshoot.

377
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,123
They added me to that scene.
I can see them when you talk about it 

378
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,980
sort of,
and I've had this with a couple of other

379
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:54,030
comics that were around at that time.
There's like a real nostalgia for it.

380
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,340
Do you remember thinking it was a 
special that was yet,

381
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,100
but you remember it at the time thinking
like,

382
00:18:59,101 --> 00:18:59,934
I'm really in 100 percent because 
usually people don't like the good old 

383
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,080
days.
You only remember them as well.

384
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,890
They weren't good old days.
Yeah,

385
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,550
because you know,
you're,

386
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,130
you're in a place that is,
you know,

387
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,973
in the comedy stars a lot of history and
it Ciro's is the main room and there's 

388
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:14,604
supposed to be ghosts in there and Sam 
Kennison says Esau quarter floating in 

389
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:21,390
the air of a dead mobster or something.
And I believe all of it.

390
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,850
Um,
I spent a lot of time in there,

391
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,690
uh,
and it was struggling,

392
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,220
you know,
you'd have people come and see you.

393
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:32,580
Rodney dangerfield was kind to me,
put me on a young comedian special,

394
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,770
but it was all,
you know,

395
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,890
what I was the warmup comic for Bosom 
Buddies with Tom Hanks and Gary and um,

396
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,940
it was all struggling,
you know,

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,140
but,
but you need it.

398
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,483
But,
and I used to wait in line in New York 

399
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,280
at him at the Improv and catch a rising 
star for 10 hours a sign.

400
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,840
The lineup sheet.
We'll wait for 10,

401
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:52,674
12 hours.
And I think there's something if you 

402
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:55,674
come out of the Dugout,
if you really are the trenches are dug 

403
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,010
outs fine.
You're gonna,

404
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,740
you're gonna,
you're gonna,

405
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,810
you're gonna bat maybe.
But,

406
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:04,644
um,
but if you come out of the trenches and 

407
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,340
you,
you go through it,

408
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,810
it's almost,
oh,

409
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,150
guy had a heart attack of the audience.
I've had that happen before,

410
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,471
you know,
oh,

411
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:14,540
this guy's getting thrown.
Oh,

412
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,460
this guy's got a gun.
Oh yeah,

413
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:17,670
yeah.
That happened to me in Cleveland.

414
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:22,290
I remember that.
It gets to the point where you're almost

415
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,790
a pilot on a plane,
you know,

416
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,470
it's like,
I'm ready for anything,

417
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,960
but when you want to do is make people 
laugh.

418
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,093
And that was the hardest transition for 
me was to take off the guitar and to 

419
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:35,100
learn to be a comedian.

420
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,090
And um,
so I.

421
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,020
What was that moment like for you?
Really hard.

422
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,110
Um,
I had a guitar on for like four years.

423
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,590
I took it off and um,
I bombed for a long time.

424
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,120
I would do it.
I used the club for what it was supposed

425
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:54,430
to be used for,
but it didn't surprise me.

426
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,270
It didn't help me get a sitcom if people
saw me and they went,

427
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,870
he's amicable but he's not funny and I 
was trying to do jokes and a lot of them

428
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:02,704
were.
There was a talent coordinator for the 

429
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,850
tonight show I could never get on as a 
comic.

430
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,923
I got on to do panel with Johnny Carson,
thanks to Gary Shandling for putting me 

431
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,510
on the first time.
And then Jay Leno,

432
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,710
I was on once with him but that I was on
with carson 13,

433
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:21,790
14 times.
And then in and always panel,

434
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,683
but I never went on as a comedian 
because this talent coordinator who 

435
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,200
passed on named Jim Mccauley who helped 
a lot of people's careers,

436
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,080
um,
except mind.

437
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,460
But he did help me in a way.
He said you're very funny,

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
but your act is like a stone skipping on
the water.

439
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,690
It never really digs in.
Oh,

440
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,300
thank you.
Wow.

441
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,220
That's something to really take Kung Fu.
Wow.

442
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,961
Thank you.
Master.

443
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,400
Take the pebble from my hand.
So it,

444
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,450
it hurt me because I couldn't get on the
damn show,

445
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,550
but I wasn't,
I really wasn't meant to.

446
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,800
I mean,
I hate to say those kinds of words,

447
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,230
you know,
it's not meant to be or whatever,

448
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:04,120
but it was hell of a lot better to sit 
there and todd,

449
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,150
a couple of segments with Johnny Carson 
and him like me and be able to talk to a

450
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:11,344
guy that you looked up to so much 
because he was kind of a master like 

451
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,630
that.
Like I'm emanating true jealousy.

452
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:19,390
Whenever I hear any of you guys talk 
about Carson,

453
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:20,430
it's like that.

454
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,070
And I'm not even making this up because 
I'm not delusional.

455
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,620
He liked me and I still can't figure 
that out.

456
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,900
But I would go,
I would say something like,

457
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:32,530
and I,
David Letterman had a lot of his amazing

458
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,423
qualities and it would respond the same 
way to this because one of my patterns 

459
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,670
that I would say is,
this is true.

460
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,950
And Johnny would go,
I don't care.

461
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,733
I don't care if it's true,
just tell it wouldn't be the same thing 

462
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,080
would go on letterman.
And I would go,

463
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:51,010
this is true.
He goes,

464
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,700
I don't care if it's true or not.
It just make it funny.

465
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,573
Just say it.
I'm blanking on the title of Bill 

466
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,520
Maher's first book,
the novel that he wrote about standup.

467
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,790
Um,
but the first line in it,

468
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,624
he says something about this is true,
which is exactly what a comic says when 

469
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,740
they were about to tell you something 
false.

470
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,770
Correct.
And that's how that,

471
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,500
that's how the novel the Hell is the 
name of the book.

472
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,300
I'll get it in a second.
You should know I should.

473
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,960
This guy should I know him.
I saw a picture,

474
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,803
a,
we are deleted in reading each other's 

475
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:18,820
books.
He has a red mine.

476
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,590
Either.
True story is the name of the book.

477
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,940
Oh,
true story.

478
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,910
That's a bread.
And also think about this,

479
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,940
but seriously folks,
that is the segue into your next job,

480
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,050
our bob hope.
I want to tell you.

481
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,440
So anyway,
that's always good.

482
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,870
But these are all the same anyway,
so I'm in the car.

483
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:43,960
We,
you do learn tricks and it's always,

484
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:44,794
if you can kill them with kindness or if
you can fake sincerity with air guys 

485
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,090
during that because everyone,
everyone talks about.

486
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:50,924
It's like you could,
we could literally spend the next hour 

487
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,410
with you just naming all stars,
right?

488
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,253
You can just do that.
But were there guys drop name drop for 

489
00:23:57,891 --> 00:23:59,440
the next and they,
it'll be very easy to make a promo.

490
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,070
I'll do that.
Professor Irwin Corey.

491
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,720
See?
No one will know that.

492
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,900
Well I know,
but yeah.

493
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,753
But um,
but were there guys that you thought 

494
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:08,240
were true?
Bill Hicks transcendent?

495
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,920
Yeah.
So it of like Bill Hicks,

496
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,580
that's transcendent.
Yeah,

497
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,140
that's the guy who a worship Sam 
Kennison,

498
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,930
who was a friend of mine.
I got Ms.

499
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,430
I got Sam is for a spot at the comedy 
store.

500
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,120
Was it in the documentary?
No,

501
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,880
but,
um,

502
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,020
he was,
he was an unusual thing.

503
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,460
It was an anomaly.
It was,

504
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,253
no one had ever seen that before.
And Bill Hicks really thought about why 

505
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,890
are we here?
And um,

506
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,770
had a sweet philosopher in him,
had,

507
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,720
it was a,
a gentle George Carlin kind of thing.

508
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,280
That was it.
I mean,

509
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,910
from a gentler version I did because I,
I knew him,

510
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,710
he,
he and he was kind of,

511
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,573
I knew him when he was really young.
I met him when he was like 18 or 

512
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:02,070
something or 19 and he hated it.
He kind of took to me and,

513
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,140
and um,
his loss was very sad.

514
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,150
It would have loved to have seen what he
would have arrived at.

515
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
Yeah.
If he'd been,

516
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,960
he died very young.
He was,

517
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,830
that's the type of conduct we need more 
of.

518
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,600
Right.
Especially now like thoughtful,

519
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,490
but guys that are really saying 
something like being,

520
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,170
you know,
I'm getting back in,

521
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:25,310
so maybe I'll find them all like,
well,

522
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:27,500
you can't help but reckoned with 
Chappelle.

523
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,870
I mean the demand is,
you know,

524
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:35,170
he's also arguably the best living stand
up and remind you of Richard was at that

525
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,980
time,
the best living standup might be still.

526
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,353
I'm lenny.
Bruce was decomposed by being arrested 

527
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,690
by not being allowed to have freedom of 
speech.

528
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:50,300
George Carlin took it to another level 
where he said,

529
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,134
I'm cutting my hair no more and I'm 
going to let myself say the things that 

530
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:00,500
are on my mind and was a lot of anger 
and a lot of prophecy and people.

531
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,840
My Mother didn't like him because he was
unkempt.

532
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,360
Yeah.
She wanted to kempt person.

533
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,620
She would have loved you very much.
Yeah.

534
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,620
Yeah.
I don't know if every camp I'm very.

535
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,640
It's a lot of hairspray and she wasn't.
She's so smart and he's handsome.

536
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,250
Outright Zagat enough to tell you what 
my mother would say.

537
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,010
Carlin having that moment.
That's like you putting down the guitar.

538
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:19,990
Right.
That's why I think it's.

539
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,400
I think it's interesting when either get
good or not.

540
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,234
It's when you make that move you like,
you like learn something and then you 

541
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:28,490
kind of start all over again because you
get the,

542
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,533
you get some chops,
you figure out what it's like to be in 

543
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:32,144
front of people.

544
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,470
Um,
and then it's not an effort.

545
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,240
It's a pleasure.
Yeah.

546
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,500
I,
um,

547
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,700
I'm going to be 62 in May,
which is crazy.

548
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,590
So if you could delay this,
that would be great.

549
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,443
It's not letting that happen yet,
but I'm able to go on stage and I had a 

550
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:57,420
gift.
Now having a special just done that.

551
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:59,910
I'm very proud of this.
Zero to 60,

552
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:04,730
which is from zero to being 60th.
Brilliant title wordy.

553
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,800
And it's on Amazon prime.
So my joke is he was a joke with it.

554
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,373
With two clicks you can buy the lotion 
to watch the special inferring that 

555
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,380
that's how aroused you'll get watching 
my special can,

556
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,223
you know,
I retweeted your special the other day 

557
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,050
and then I think you deleted the tweet 
and I thought,

558
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:22,861
what,
what happened here?

559
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:24,840
Did you make a mistake in your tweet?
I did,

560
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,900
I made a mistake in my tweet and then I 
was like,

561
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:30,180
oh,
well we do it again.

562
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,980
Let's see how the rest of this goes.
Okay.

563
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,990
I know,
I understand if you don't want to.

564
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,390
So let's not get ahead of those.
I'll show myself out.

565
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,800
Uh,
but.

566
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,850
But I,
um,

567
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,740
yeah,
I,

568
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,000
I put something wrong on there because 
it's,

569
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,940
it's on many mediums.
It's not,

570
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,450
it's not a Netflix special,
but it's on every platform.

571
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:51,420
So it's on a spectrum.
DIRECTV,

572
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,283
Google.
So it's never been done like this till 

573
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:55,950
now where they put it on every,
on demand.

574
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:59,310
So it's like you can choose between 
wonder woman or zero to 60.

575
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,380
Hmm.
Let me think.

576
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,740
I'd much rather watch Bob than wonder 
woman.

577
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,750
That's pretty cool though that because 
right.

578
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,860
We all,
in the old days,

579
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:09,870
everyone just wanted the HBO special.
I mean,

580
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,580
I remember the day I started standing 
up,

581
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,000
I was like,
I'm going to have an hbs.

582
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,050
I wanted one of my God.

583
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,250
Now you can have all sorts of other 
things.

584
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,830
There's many different ways.
And,

585
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,410
and Netflix is kind of the jewel in the 
crown.

586
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:26,130
So it was hbo,
but they mostly have a few new people,

587
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,190
but mostly they're regular team members 
know bill or George Lopez of course,

588
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:34,080
who is just wonderful.
I just like George.

589
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,040
But um,
this has been a really cool model.

590
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:41,310
I'm being on Amazon.
Prime is actually in the world,

591
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,144
has it.
I just wanted it to be seen by as many 

592
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:46,590
people.
That's how I stumbled about this thing.

593
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,430
Let's just get it out.
This,

594
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:51,570
this is seen by everybody I would think.
Right?

595
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,913
As long as youtube.
Let's get to the feed and Youtube and 

596
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,480
now.
So every person that subscribes,

597
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,050
you make money.
No.

598
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,130
You do make money is they roll ads on 
this.

599
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,500
We make money.
But you made a roll ads on this.

600
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,393
It depends on what we talk about.
Say you may be deemed too controversial 

601
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,070
too.
I'm not controversial on fuller house.

602
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,700
That's on Netflix is a very family 
oriented show.

603
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,893
What do you need to sell?
What product but help you make money on 

604
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:20,280
this.
Will you know,

605
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,870
whatever they want to lay in before 
this.

606
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:23,760
I don't care what they put in before.
That's the funny thing.

607
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,670
No one associates the ad with the 
content,

608
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,620
you know,
so they just want me not to say anything

609
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:32,000
offensive so that the advertiser won't 
say,

610
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:34,410
okay,
say I get talked about whatever,

611
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,610
like a fabric softener because any one 
of those sheets,

612
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,770
that's like a good thing.
I would love that fabric.

613
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,850
I like fabric soft.
It's great stuff.

614
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,973
We did in and said to me what a bounce 
you have on your jacket when it was 

615
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,043
perfect,
perfect outfit and we compliment each 

616
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:50,440
other.

617
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,060
I feel good about this.
I think it's.

618
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,070
I think it's.
I think we're crushing.

619
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:57,370
This is full house thing.
Hit it.

620
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,820
Had not heard of it until I did a little
research for this.

621
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,570
Right?
Apparently it was a big sitcom.

622
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,530
Yes it was.
It was for eight years and I didn't know

623
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:06,364
either.
I just knew I had a place to go to work 

624
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,720
and that I would paid for kids private 
school.

625
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,970
So I told you this when,
when we had dinner a couple weeks ago,

626
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:15,640
but my sister was,
she's nine years younger than me.

627
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,070
She was so,
and I know you hear this all the time,

628
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:18,904
but she was so obsessed with that show 
that we were never allowed to watch TV 

629
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,231
at dinner.
My family,

630
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,010
that was it.
We would sit and,

631
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,300
and have a good time or a bad time or 
argue or laughed or whatever,

632
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,463
but my sister at some point took control
of the family and suddenly full house 

633
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,160
was being watched during dinner.

634
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,560
Right.
She loves stamos.

635
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,960
Everyone loves statement.
Yeah,

636
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,140
that's true.
Everyone loves statement.

637
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,230
No.
Tell me a little bit about getting in on

638
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:45,064
that and how that differed from standup 
and then suddenly even though you had 

639
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:48,124
studied acting and all that,
but just like doing something that was 

640
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:51,280
so different.
Completely different.

641
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,650
Um,
I'd always wanted to be on a sitcom.

642
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,990
I'd been around them,
you know,

643
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,460
I'd,
as I said,

644
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:01,600
I was a warmup bosom buddies or go visit
Robin doing mork and Mindy.

645
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:05,770
I would sneak into happy days.
I snuck into the Bob Newhart show.

646
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,350
I was under age.
It had to be 16 or 17.

647
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,550
I snuck into Mary Tyler Moore.
I would watch them filming these shows.

648
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,900
James l Dot Brooks,
uh,

649
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,260
producing Mary Tyler Moore show,
unbelievable.

650
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:18,094
And I saw Bob Newhart last night,
had the name drop once to know when we 

651
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:24,480
can go to dinner,
didn't mention you as don rickles,

652
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,323
that,
that is a direct lift of the kind of 

653
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:28,660
thing he would say.

654
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,720
I mean,
that's perfection that really is kind of

655
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,563
very professional.
He would say something like somebody 

656
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,870
very famous,
you know,

657
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:37,510
I saw someone last night,
I saw,

658
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,980
I saw Chris rock last night,
didn't mention to you,

659
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,353
just so you know,
they could make it now just because of 

660
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:46,170
the way we are about.
He was making it in an,

661
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,340
as a,
as a new young comedian.

662
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,490
Impossible.
Um,

663
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,970
but there's a new way to do it,
which is a way of love.

664
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:01,360
And some people do it.
So people will make fun of everyone.

665
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,030
My friend Jeff Ross is the postmaster 
general,

666
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,440
um,
you know,

667
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,250
there,
there are ways to bash people,

668
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:12,250
but it's turned mean.
And what happened is,

669
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:14,280
and this is an understatement,
you know,

670
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,420
the roast.
I was roasted on comedy central,

671
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,610
but I had John Stamos was the roast 
master.

672
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,970
I had all my friends were there,
I got to pick who was on it.

673
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,620
Most people don't.
You know,

674
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,710
Justin Bieber Roast,
no one knows him.

675
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,523
Most of the people and people think 
roasting people is supposed to be mean 

676
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,513
and it's a it.
If it doesn't come out of kindness and 

677
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:41,401
love of the person or just blind,
I'm going to attack them,

678
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,540
but there's no attachment of anger to 
this.

679
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,330
It's just evil.
It's just wrong.

680
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,300
And we're in a society where people 
will,

681
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,420
they'll hit you back on a tweet,
they'll watch something,

682
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:56,810
you will see people on the news,
you'll listen to political leaders talk,

683
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,090
you'll hear people bash each other back 
and forth,

684
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,420
and it comes from Don rickles thinking 
that that's what he did.

685
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,980
That's not what the man did.
The man would,

686
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,960
would just,
you know,

687
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:14,600
see a man and a woman in the audience 
and say,

688
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:17,660
is this your wife?
And the guy would go yes and dom and go,

689
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,563
Whoa,
whoa.

690
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,970
And that's just a but and his age has 
something to do with it,

691
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:23,804
but also his tenacity and his.
And he started in the lounge two in the 

692
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:29,354
morning,
doing three shows til five in the 

693
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:35,150
morning and talk about the trenches and 
all love.

694
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,343
So if someone comes out and makes fun of
people and does it out of love or does 

695
00:33:42,201 --> 00:33:43,034
it at a truth,
that's the safest way we're at right 

696
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:45,674
now.
That's where the Chappelle thing comes 

697
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:49,640
through.
That's where you look at certain people.

698
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,050
I really enjoy Mark Marin a lot.
And um,

699
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,160
Bill Burr,
um,

700
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,300
I mean there's so many people that are 
so good,

701
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,100
um,
that,

702
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,410
that some people don't even know about 
that sell out places constantly that are

703
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:11,210
just like Brian Regan and it's just,
he's so.

704
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,420
He's brilliant.
I mean,

705
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,880
he cares three,
two hours.

706
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,990
It was like,
what?

707
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,423
And it's clean.
Or you go see Seinfeld do what he does 

708
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:19,334
and you go,
that's why he's Jerry side because it's 

709
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:25,430
not just words Smith,
he's connected to everything he did.

710
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,640
It might be word for word in some ways,
but another night.

711
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:31,770
But my God,
it's fun and you know,

712
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:32,930
and then I'll,
you know,

713
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,123
I love anybody who is funny who just is 
there to entertain people and it's not 

714
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,204
only about them,
which is hard because we're a very 

715
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:43,880
narcissistic group.

716
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,770
Right.
I mean comics are particularly,

717
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,840
there's a certain breed of craziness,
right.

718
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:48,674
That comes to comedy.
The best line I ever heard about that 

719
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:50,630
was,
was,

720
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,493
I've mentioned this a few times,
George Carlin on the view once and he's 

721
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:56,510
sitting there with all the women around 
him and he's talking about,

722
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,411
you know,
he was given,

723
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,240
he was,
he was selling or they had just come out

724
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:01,330
with like this anthology.
So that's what he was there for.

725
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,563
But he said something about how to be a 
good comic you have to have a ton of 

726
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:05,984
shit.
Like you have to have all this pain and 

727
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,904
all this angst and all this stuff.
But then at some point you got to 

728
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,550
conquer it because otherwise it will 
conquer you.

729
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:16,490
And that's why so many comics die of 
drug overdoses and all this other stuff.

730
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,180
Yeah.
But if you can own it,

731
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,970
then you could be 62.
And

732
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:23,963
why are you doing?
I don't know if I'm made doing standup 

733
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,510
at nine,
but I'll be doing forms of it.

734
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,750
You couldn't stop even if you wanted to 
write.

735
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,810
I could not stop working.
I,

736
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,230
I just directed this movie,
Benjamin,

737
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,140
which I'll talk about at length in the 
third hour,

738
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,830
our interview.
But,

739
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,550
but I have to leave after hour or two.
But you're welcome to.

740
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,440
I'm going to stay.
We're just going to keep going.

741
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,540
It's just gonna be me and the camera.
But,

742
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,530
but I,
I love working without it.

743
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,780
I,
I,

744
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm an artist.
Uh,

745
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,690
and it sounds so fruity.
Pebbles to say that,

746
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:55,524
but I just am and I always will be and 
I'll be making whether it be directing 

747
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,420
or writing or performing.
I love acting.

748
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,553
There's no limit as long as you can 
stand and walk and bend and remember 

749
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:08,091
things,
you know,

750
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:08,960
it,
you know,

751
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,490
not fall into an open trunk.

752
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,490
The memory one goes first because now 
there's guys on Broadway,

753
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:15,324
they're using ips.
I was going to say id ib is going to 

754
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,630
look at the intercontinental missiles.
Yeah.

755
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,290
Not those.
No,

756
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,760
no.
That has been known and I hopefully will

757
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,893
live long enough that had 92 years old.
I'll be on Broadway and I'll have an 

758
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:38,790
earwig in and they'll feed me the lines 
and I don't care if I'm good,

759
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:39,624
if it's done right.
I saw Peter O'toole and Amanda plummer 

760
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,050
and my Fair Lady,
the most miscast version of my fair lady

761
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,920
on Broadway.
And I think he had a thing in his ear.

762
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:50,754
He was no child when he did it.
Playing that character is very 

763
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,920
fascinating because my fair lady,
which is a play,

764
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:58,140
I don't know if people are familiar,
but um,

765
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,010
sometimes the audience could use a 
little tiny bit older,

766
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,250
but it's not a millennial's favorite,
but you know,

767
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:08,550
she is pygmalion,
which of course loses more people.

768
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,120
Gen x doesn't even follow pygmalion,
but it,

769
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,270
what's amazing about it is he's 40 years
older than her.

770
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,820
Uh,
no matter how you play that play.

771
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,010
Yeah.
That is a musical.

772
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:24,360
Was Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn.
He's 40 years older than her.

773
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,040
He is maybe 50,
but he's 60 and she's 20 and that's that

774
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,850
and he's trying to make her a classy 
woman.

775
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,010
The chauvinistically misogynistic,
unacceptable way.

776
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,970
And it is one of the best musicals ever 
written for people that don't know.

777
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:42,804
That was the original premise of.
Or that was the original inspiration of 

778
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:46,314
pretty woman.
Right,

779
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,940
right.
That is true.

780
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,230
I'm not making that up.
No,

781
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,160
you're not.
No,

782
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:53,280
you're not usually trying to make it 
honest woman out of,

783
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,050
uh,
an honest hooker.

784
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,740
Yeah.
Alright.

785
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,510
Let's talk about this whole house thing.
So that right from honest hooker.

786
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,443
Hooker's you did it.
I was going to let you drop one of the 

787
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:03,510
girls names,
but.

788
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,730
Okay.
So.

789
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,670
All right.
So then you'd suddenly,

790
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:08,220
you're on television.
Everyone knows who you are,

791
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,850
what a lot of money is such a good edit 
point.

792
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,590
No,
we don't.

793
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,370
I've got offered the job.
Yeah.

794
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,353
Uh,
I was fired from a morning program on 

795
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:17,934
CBS,
which was against Good Morning America 

796
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,170
today show for being too hot for morning
TV.

797
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,440
They had another actor play the 
character of Danny Tanner.

798
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,890
Um,
I always feel bad about that.

799
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,430
The pilot we shot with the pilot we shot
with someone else makes me sad,

800
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,413
but the same producers and other people 
in this business have done that before 

801
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:37,480
with many,
many shows.

802
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,320
Robin Williams was not the first work to
perfect strangers.

803
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,030
Was was not a Mark Lynn Baker.
It was,

804
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,840
there was a gay housekeeper in the pilot
episode of the Golden Girls.

805
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,823
That guy got the boot I,
but that's what I played on full house 

806
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:50,854
anyway.

807
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,170
But I ended up with the part because I 
was fired and they made it available for

808
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,780
me.
And I'm Jeff Franklin.

809
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:01,690
The exec producer wanted me originally 
for it and Bob boy yet.

810
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:05,620
And Tom Miller who still produced fuller
house.

811
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,990
Um,
it's a complicated thing.

812
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:10,330
Show business.
It is so complicated.

813
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,130
All you want to do is entertain a bunch 
of people.

814
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,713
And then all of this stuff happens.
And I played a character because I want 

815
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,640
it to be on three men and a baby had 
just come out.

816
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,730
And we were talking about that before we
were rolling on this.

817
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:25,500
Fantastic show is we saw the Gutenberg a
dinner that night out of.

818
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,510
We did see the Gutenberg and he brings 
his Bible and he went over almost.

819
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,683
He had to,
he had the fish and he had enough for 

820
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:37,780
everyone and the water.
Guess what it turned it to.

821
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,490
Anyway,
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,420
So this,
this part was something that I wanted in

823
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:48,200
three men and a baby with Steven and Ted
Danson and um,

824
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,050
uh,
yeah,

825
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,193
uh,
I had just come out and so we were that 

826
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,960
we were Dave and John David again.
John Demos were already diapering Ashley

827
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,060
and Mary Kate and I was not in those 
scenes.

828
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,193
So they reshot the pilot and all of a 
sudden the show ABC fought to keep it 

829
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:07,840
on.
Doesn't happen like that anymore.

830
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,640
They,
they put it on twice a week.

831
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,503
It ran on Tuesdays,
didn't run on Fridays and then they 

832
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:13,894
started to run it twice a week for 
awhile and then they ordered more 

833
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:18,454
episodes and it wasn't doing very well,
but they believed in it and we were on 

834
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:23,320
against Seinfeld,
which also wasn't doing very well.

835
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:23,751
Right.
That.

836
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:26,800
So that's around what,
like 89 90 now at 87.

837
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:27,940
80 eight.
Oh Wow.

838
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

839
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,510
So then 89 is yes,
we're not doing well.

840
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,750
And then after four years we started to 
do well,

841
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:35,584
we switched studios from Sony because I 
know people want to give their 

842
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,574
demographics right on Google maps to 
warner brothers to be on the same stage 

843
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:48,271
exactly where fuller house has done now.
That's ended the last four years there.

844
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,450
And then it was a really big hit.
And of course with network television,

845
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,200
if you look at ratings now you go,
my God,

846
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:00,810
how could they cancel it with that 
chair?

847
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,910
Insane.
And then we were offered to go to the CW

848
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:04,744
or the web.
I can't remember what it was first 

849
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:07,444
because it's all a blur.
We were offered one more year to go 

850
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:13,690
there and we just Kinda said John and I,
I kinda,

851
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,610
I thought we did it,
you know,

852
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,300
we kinda got canceled.
So why do we want to beg to go somewhere

853
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:19,990
else?

854
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,823
And they do that.
Sometimes they say columns and it never 

855
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:22,710
works,
right?

856
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,340
No,
you're somewhere else.

857
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:27,310
And then people find it.
Would they do it for is for syndication.

858
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,550
So.
Oh,

859
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,360
what years is that from?
Everything looks different,

860
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,943
it looks smaller,
but it was the secret to that show was 

861
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:42,610
that there was actual affection between 
the cast and uh,

862
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,563
and in good writing and good morals,
things where kids could watch your 

863
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:50,420
sister could watch it and feel good 
afterwards because they had my sister,

864
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,860
Tanya,
Tanya,

865
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,893
a,
you were great in rocky and that's 

866
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:55,970
right.
That's right.

867
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,440
There you go.
And it just,

868
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,170
I,
your brother loves you very,

869
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:01,004
very much and,
and really appreciate that you would 

870
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,560
make them all watch full house instead 
of having Nice,

871
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,200
nice dinner.
In fact,

872
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,740
he'd make the dinner nights here.
All right,

873
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,033
let's do just a little bit more on TV 
and then I want to talk politics with 

874
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:16,160
you and just sort of,
you're a philosophical guy.

875
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,070
I am a philosophical guide.
It gets me in trouble sometimes.

876
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,720
So you do fuller house.
Yes.

877
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,583
Big Star.
Then you're also doing America's 

878
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:24,524
funniest home videos.
Another thing where it's a blooper show 

879
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,030
and I'm playing on Sunday night,
seven to 8:00

880
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:31,400
at night.
People were in church that day,

881
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,413
so then that night I'm hosting a show 
that has to be done very palatable for 

882
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:39,920
America and the world was number one in 
China.

883
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,870
Where was that hard for you because you.
I mean,

884
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:43,300
you really had to.
That was,

885
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,530
that was.
That had to.

886
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,830
It was a little difficult and it was a 
gift horse so the tree opens up,

887
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,320
you know,
it's the number one show,

888
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:55,970
the producer of into bona called me one 
day on my curly cord carphone and said,

889
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:57,530
we're number one,
and I said,

890
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,530
you mean PP anyway?
No.

891
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,580
I said,
we're,

892
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,830
we're,
we're number one show on television.

893
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,663
It was a phenomenon and the joke is if 
you wanted to see a man get hit in the 

894
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,240
nuts,
you had to come through me.

895
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,750
I was the gatekeeper but in a funny way 
and now it's all this I.

896
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,740
Youtube will give you anything you want.
That's exactly what I was going to say.

897
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:19,574
That somehow all of the stuff that 
people click that's just quick and you 

898
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,310
watch someone get smashed with saying or
he was sending her fault.

899
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,323
It was all born out of people walking 
around with cam quarters just because 

900
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:29,930
you guys were like,
well,

901
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:31,640
let's do it.
He had the savvy,

902
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,230
uh,
it was a famous show.

903
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:34,064
It came out of a show in Japan,
which I think are still partners with 

904
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:37,340
it.
I don't know the business dealings,

905
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:38,810
but I'm going to look it up.
Give me a minute.

906
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,490
Let me just get on my phone.

907
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,740
Yeah,
yeah,

908
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,250
no,
I'll do it right here.

909
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,990
But,
uh,

910
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,950
it became a,
a phenomenon because they took a,

911
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:51,950
did it amazing.
They did the grassroots approach,

912
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:56,810
which we don't see anywhere.
They asked in people magazine.

913
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:57,644
They took out an ad.
We have a new show called America's 

914
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:03,200
funniest home videos,
full-page people magazine.

915
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,603
I'm send your vhs tapes and you could be
on television and you could win prize 

916
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:11,110
money.
God,

917
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:11,943
it sounds like.
And that is how they got the first hour 

918
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,124
of tapes.
And what happened to me was I was doing 

919
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:20,150
a year of full house.
I get this tape.

920
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,850
They said this is an amicable,
a young man.

921
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,430
The man that now is,
is Walt Disney,

922
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:27,530
is Bob Iger.
He is ABC.

923
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,070
He wanted me for it.
Ted Harbert was at the network,

924
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,290
wanted me for it.
I'm from full house.

925
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,420
I seemed like a very amicable guy.

926
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,490
They'd seen my standup.
They didn't care.

927
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:42,360
They didn't know it was like,
it wasn't as a bluish as I became,

928
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,000
as I got more free with myself.
I was going to ask you about that.

929
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,890
It wasn't,
I didn't draw as many f bombs,

930
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,960
it just,
but it was all weird.

931
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:52,500
It all had things that you can't say.
So what was that like for you?

932
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:53,334
Because he was still there.
I mean obviously I'm not telling you 

933
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:55,704
anything you to know,
but like he was so sacral and the jokes 

934
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,120
you'd have to make and I,
and I'm proud of them.

935
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,730
Yeah,
I wrote it with two.

936
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,060
Uh,
the jokes were to Canadian guys,

937
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:05,940
so there was an 18 percent exchange rate
on the humor,

938
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,590
but it was todd.
Thanks brother.

939
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,230
May he rest in peace?
No,

940
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,820
his brothers a lot.
I'm Todd Thicke,

941
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,840
uh,
analytics brother and uh,

942
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,760
Bob are not as a writer from the 
smothers brothers show.

943
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,190
And we wrote all the jokes,
we wrote 55 pages a week.

944
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,830
I would do the voiceovers look out.
Oh,

945
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:23,750
look at me,
you know,

946
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,190
just bad mel blanc,
who was warner brothers,

947
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:27,024
bugs bunny.
That I have to explain it to the 

948
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,593
millennials.
Millennial who's bugs bunny thing after 

949
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:32,724
this?
Okay.

950
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,240
It was bugs bunny.
But who is Marvin the Martian?

951
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,930
You made me so mad.
It was Marvin the Martian.

952
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,640
I'm not a good impression.
But,

953
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,690
um,
it was a big production to.

954
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,890
I wanted it to be a variety show,
so we would have big guests on.

955
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:53,250
We'd have on a Rodney Dangerfield,
anybody that was a friend of mine,

956
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,350
we'd had Leslie Nielsen on Jonathan 
Winters,

957
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,100
full house,
you know,

958
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,020
we'd have and it was an hour and,
and it is still on to this day,

959
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:03,870
a testament to Vin and to the people 
that make that show,

960
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,060
you know,
it went to Tom Bergeron,

961
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,090
went through many people that went to 
Richard kind hosted at wants,

962
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,070
daisy frontage,
John Fugelsang.

963
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,753
And um,
there was no way to stop it because it 

964
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:18,630
was a guaranteed laugh.
And what I didn't like,

965
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:19,464
what would bother me is if a guy falls 
in a manhole and then you see somebody 

966
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,230
in the audience to other head back 
laughing,

967
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,480
but you never see him climb out of the 
manhole on like,

968
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,270
is he dead?
You know?

969
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,520
So I hadn't done a charity for people's 
nuts.

970
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,740
Like with Bob Saget charity for a great 
idea.

971
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,900
Something.
Yeah.

972
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,160
Agates Sag.
It's agates something that would have.

973
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,020
Yeah.
Because there should have been people.

974
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,710
There were a lot of not hits and it was 
all the good ones were when it was a six

975
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:50,040
year old taking a baseball bat and his 
chest just jab and his dad.

976
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,563
Even just before this I was,
I just quickly put Americans money 

977
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,840
selling videos in the youtube search and
it's just not hit after hit.

978
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,420
There's one that's like 600 hits in a 
row.

979
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,433
I mean they just cut him real quick 
because one thing that got to me was 

980
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,980
someone had sent me a clip reel that I 
think they aired on the show,

981
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:10,750
which was old people falling.
And I had,

982
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,320
when I was like,
I'm glad I'm not there because that was,

983
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,000
that was the only time I went,
like,

984
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,960
oh,
come on.

985
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,273
And they're falling on cement and stuff,
which sounds funny to Bros in a bar 

986
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,130
drinking beers.
But if you'll watch it,

987
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,820
it's kind of snuff fish.
But uh,

988
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,693
as long as I know everybody's okay.
I didn't want to be a where people 

989
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:34,861
filmed themselves hurting their friends.
So I felt like I was hurting before.

990
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,400
But that didn't matter.
I,

991
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:42,220
I enjoyed for those first few years of 
doing it.

992
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,170
I just,
I loved the hell out of it.

993
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,770
I mean everybody was talking about it 
and loving it.

994
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,830
I had friends calling me going,
what is this?

995
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,113
Because no one had seen it before.
But it's interesting because it's like 

996
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:55,920
kind of one of those things that we 
don't have anymore.

997
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,200
Like we don't have shows being right.
There are things like,

998
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:00,660
yes,
everyone watches game of thrones,

999
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:01,494
you're,
everyone watches this or that on 

1000
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:02,884
Netflix.
But we don't have like sort of 

1001
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:08,750
mainstream like decent things that 
families can watch anymore.

1002
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:11,050
And they know and they put all the 
nonsense aside,

1003
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,460
you know,
and that's what I want to do.

1004
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
That's kind of.
And um,

1005
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,820
I'm in,
I'm in talks about a couple of different

1006
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:16,960
things.
I want to do something,

1007
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,180
a variety.
I don't know what it is.

1008
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,140
You know,
I,

1009
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,340
I,
I love directing,

1010
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:23,860
so I just did this movie so we knock on 
wood people,

1011
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:25,270
go see this movie,
Benjamin,

1012
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:27,240
which we will,
we'll get to it for a second.

1013
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,790
Let's get to it right now if you want.
I feel that that was the right way,

1014
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,410
but I will give closure to that last 
thing.

1015
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:34,210
Just saying that I do feel that there 
would be,

1016
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,340
it would be wonderful to have a family 
sit down on a Sunday night.

1017
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,720
I mean wonderful world of Disney used to
be on at 7:00

1018
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:44,554
or 7:30
when I was a kid on NBC and you turn it 

1019
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:50,950
on now and it's just another one of 
those people punching each other in,

1020
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,863
in big sumo wrestler costumes.
And that's not what I want to see with 

1021
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:55,760
my family.
I want to say it,

1022
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,230
but that's the cheap replacement.
And that's variety,

1023
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,513
that's reality variety,
but real variety is we're going to 

1024
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:08,560
entertain you and we're going to bring 
on guests and it's going to be fun.

1025
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,394
I mean,
I guess snl is the closest thing to 

1026
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:11,350
have.

1027
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,370
Yeah.
But that's not really.

1028
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:14,500
It wouldn't play in prime time.
But you want something,

1029
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,480
you're talking,
you want something that's funny,

1030
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:19,240
but also you can do some serious stuff.
You want to staying relevant.

1031
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:19,630
I mean,
it's,

1032
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,950
you want.
I can have everything,

1033
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:26,350
but I think it needs to make people 
laugh the most and then it can have its,

1034
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,203
its waves in it.
And so I will be taking pitches right 

1035
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,080
after this.
All right,

1036
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:34,210
let's talk.
Benjamin and Benjamin.

1037
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,044
Benjamin comes out in the summer.
It is a movie that I spent seven years 

1038
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,170
on.
It is an independent movie.

1039
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,160
I'm very low budget.
I'm just getting hit in the nuts.

1040
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,463
Uh,
no one knowing that there is a fight in 

1041
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:49,070
it.
Um,

1042
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,953
at least I can't even.
I can't tell you who me and Dave Foley 

1043
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,310
won't talk.
I don't want.

1044
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:53,800
No,
no.

1045
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,360
Spoiler alerts.
Uh,

1046
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:56,194
it's about,
it's really about a dysfunctional 

1047
00:49:58,031 --> 00:49:58,864
family,
which is most families and we believe 

1048
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:02,764
that I directed it and I acted in it 
with some amazing people that are name 

1049
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,110
really quickly,
which are rob corddry,

1050
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,880
who's hilarious.
Kevin Pollak,

1051
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,601
Cherio,
Terry,

1052
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:13,300
Dave Foley,
Max burkholder plays my son.

1053
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,900
He was on parenthood.
We think that he is on crystal meth.

1054
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:20,440
So it's a dark comedy.
I thought you meant the actor.

1055
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,700
No movies about movies,
about plays.

1056
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,800
Benjamin,
we believe all the actors.

1057
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,490
I don't know what you're doing

1058
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,263
in the movie.
You were on crystal meth during the 

1059
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:33,154
making of the.
In order to be able to survive working 

1060
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:38,920
with me because I was out of my mind 
because we had a 15 day shoot.

1061
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,380
It was a low,
low budget.

1062
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,043
Yeah,
I know this show has longer to shoot my 

1063
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:47,590
movie and I'm so my,
in the movie,

1064
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:50,650
my son Benjamin we believe is on crystal
meth.

1065
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,080
And so Mary Lynn Rice cub plays my 
girlfriend.

1066
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:56,620
She's from 24,
very good comedian actress and she posts

1067
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:59,320
on facebook that we need an intervention
for the boy.

1068
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,630
And that's not where you post an 
intervention.

1069
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:04,240
People don't post interventions on 
facebook.

1070
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,240
It's supposed to be kind of quiet and 
done properly.

1071
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,170
Maybe a note posted.
And uh,

1072
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:13,510
so rob corddry is our family 
gynecologist.

1073
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:14,344
He leaves the intervention and Kevin 
Pollak plays my brother and Peri Gilpin 

1074
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,110
Santa and Clara Mamet.
GotTa have a Mamet.

1075
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,940
Uh,
she's so good at it and I'm,

1076
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,090
uh,
David Ho and uh,

1077
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,950
Johnny Western and uh,
it's just,

1078
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:27,813
it's an ensemble and it takes place in 
one night and it's just basically the 

1079
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:38,341
one line would be on it that the people,
the person you think has the problem.

1080
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,913
It's the people.
And I can't really give much more 

1081
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,270
family.
The family,

1082
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,090
your family is the woman,
the problem,

1083
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,973
you know,
people.

1084
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,450
So many write a one line for this movie 
quick.

1085
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,040
Yeah,
we need it for the one sheet.

1086
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,800
But the people that you think have the 
problem,

1087
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,720
the people that are accusing someone of 
having the problem are the ones with the

1088
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:03,150
problem.
Oh,

1089
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,180
that's a spoiler alert.

1090
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,053
That's a little bit of a spoiler.
But I feel like that transcends this 

1091
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:08,180
movie.
That's just a general thing,

1092
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,870
serious movie with,
uh,

1093
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,860
with a,
with a comedy bent to it and I,

1094
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:16,650
and I'm very proud of it and so thank 
you for letting me plug all of that.

1095
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,623
Alright.
Saget,

1096
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,670
we did career.
That was it.

1097
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,593
That my career is just beginning.
We Ngo or career ended my career 

1098
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,740
completely.
It ended.

1099
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,990
We never got past fuller house.
It's over.

1100
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:30,501
No,
we did.

1101
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:31,910
Benjamin were good.
We did Benjamin.

1102
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:33,530
We know we got,
we got other stuff coming.

1103
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,570
Yeah.
We didn't even talk about a half baked,

1104
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,433
but we'll just,
we'll just say that it never actually 

1105
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:42,190
did that in real life.
My real.

1106
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,310
I got it.
Okay.

1107
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,151
Um,
all right.

1108
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:44,984
Let's talk.
I just want to talk about politics and 

1109
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:46,484
just kind of what you think is going on 
in the world because if that's what you 

1110
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,730
do here,
that is what I do here.

1111
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:50,564
But even though I only know you a little
bit from the conversation we had at 

1112
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:53,654
dinner,
I got just got a sense that like you 

1113
00:52:55,281 --> 00:52:58,250
actually,
you're obviously very sensitive.

1114
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:01,040
Like that's pretty clear.
I'm overly sensitive or you strike me as

1115
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:01,874
like a good liberal,
like you want people to be treated well 

1116
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:06,830
as fair.
I think of myself as a liberal.

1117
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,730
I must be.
Well,

1118
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:09,820
what do I look good?

1119
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,783
Myself as a humanist,
I was on a plane the other day which no 

1120
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:17,700
comedians ever said,
and transducers,

1121
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,633
that gentleman was on the plane and he 
had a and he was about 60 years old and 

1122
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,480
he seemed like a successful businessman 
of some kind.

1123
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:32,190
And I was in the first class section 
because there was a cat back in coach.

1124
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,650
It was a cat for a case.
You get sick.

1125
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:35,484
She had her

1126
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,620
security animal to keep her.
What do you call those animals?

1127
00:53:38,621 --> 00:53:39,454
The,
a special animal if special needs or 

1128
00:53:46,271 --> 00:53:47,890
whatever.
But I'm deathly allergic.

1129
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,870
So I was upfront and allergic to cats 
too.

1130
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,163
Think so I was saying to this gentleman 
and he had on big bright Red America 

1131
00:53:56,091 --> 00:54:01,091
first shirt.
And so if I was uh,

1132
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,800
I guess,
uh,

1133
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,580
what your brand is a liberal,
I guess that shirt would bother me.

1134
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,030
But I just looked at the guy and he 
seemed like a nice guy.

1135
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,220
I didn't.
I just said,

1136
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,140
do you have an allergy to cats?
He went,

1137
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:17,060
no.
My wife's got a cat.

1138
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,530
I said,
so you have a category?

1139
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,463
No,
my wife has a cat and we laughed a 

1140
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:25,440
little bit.
And what it said on his shirt,

1141
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,960
on his shirt is a shirt I would wear.
It's not a where I'm at.

1142
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,530
I mean,
I do believe a tube.

1143
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,310
I love America.
I believe that where you live,

1144
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,270
you want to put first,
you want to take care of your people,

1145
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,890
you want to take care of your hometown.

1146
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,033
Oh,
you're coming out with that far right 

1147
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,014
craziness.
Or you want to take care of your 

1148
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:47,814
country.

1149
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,840
But,
um,

1150
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,890
down,
down,

1151
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:51,411
down,
down,

1152
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:51,990
down,
down,

1153
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,823
down,
down.

1154
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,520
But I don't,
but I'm not.

1155
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,873
If you're,
if you're kind and you're not out doing 

1156
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:01,000
some closet hatred,
uh,

1157
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:03,940
or blatant hatred,
I don't know.

1158
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,403
But I,
I just look at my dad's whole thing was 

1159
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:09,064
be kind to people.
So it sounds like a pacifist and might 

1160
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,300
bother people,
but that's what we're supposed to do.

1161
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,700
Yeah.
Is the problem with that,

1162
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:19,620
that you just get nipped off by both 
sides?

1163
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:20,454
I mean,
I see that a lot now that I do think 

1164
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:23,050
there's this interesting center 
developing.

1165
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,780
I don't even know why there's sides.
Of course.

1166
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,980
Yeah,
of course I do.

1167
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,120
But you know,
and,

1168
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,060
and,
and people go,

1169
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:31,990
well,
you're a democrat.

1170
00:55:31,991 --> 00:55:32,600
Right?
And I'm like,

1171
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,980
I'll vote for anybody that can get us 
out of this mess.

1172
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:37,623
You know,
I'd,

1173
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,660
I'd bring my dad back from the grave and
vote for him.

1174
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,870
He'd be such a good candidate.
A grateful dead video.

1175
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,420
Yeah.
I don't know.

1176
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,300
Are you,
would you consider yourself a liberal?

1177
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:51,380
Is that where you are?
Yeah.

1178
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,214
I still consider myself a liberal,
but most of the liberal things that I 

1179
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:56,174
believe in,
I can pretty much explain from a 

1180
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:58,754
libertarian perspective at this point 
and that I just don't want the 

1181
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:02,510
government involved in my life.
That's it.

1182
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:03,763
And I think you should live your life 
however you see fit and I'll live mine 

1183
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,690
however I see fit and like you have a 
lot more money than me,

1184
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:09,800
right?
Fair to say.

1185
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,663
I don't know,
but we're going to do spreadsheet exams 

1186
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:13,670
right after this is over.
Let's be clear.

1187
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,450
I'm on Youtube.
You've been on network television.

1188
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,280
You've got three chickens outside.
I don't have three chickens.

1189
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:21,740
I don't know their value,
but you could have chickens.

1190
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:22,723
The point is I don't any of your stuff 
just because you make more money than 

1191
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:26,410
me.
Right.

1192
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,080
I can't have any of your money.
It would be nice I suppose,

1193
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,460
but I don't deserve any of that.

1194
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,303
That's what taxes are about and that's 
where our are incredibly rich society 

1195
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:37,634
and are incredibly poor society are at 
odds with each other and that has been 

1196
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:42,074
since the beginning of time since you 
know castles were built with a dictator 

1197
00:56:47,121 --> 00:56:51,590
in a king living in it and everybody had
to go build all this stuff and they were

1198
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:54,930
slaves.
So I mean it's it,

1199
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,960
it does.
The metaphor doesn't change.

1200
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,393
The representation doesn't change that 
the downtrodden or downtrodden and are 

1201
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:02,804
disgruntled and then other people are 
angry at things that they should just 

1202
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,900
take a frikken chill pill over.
Yeah.

1203
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,510
Well that constant outreach thing.
Well,

1204
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:18,120
there's a lot to be outraged over also 
because how do they all have the,

1205
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:20,030
the,
the problem with,

1206
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,670
you know,
wanting to entertain people with wanting

1207
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:23,504
to be a comedian is,
it's nearly impossible when there's so 

1208
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:30,440
many deaths when there's so many tragic 
things happening,

1209
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:31,274
which there always have been,
but we are at a news ratio where it's 

1210
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,800
coming at us.
You just,

1211
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,470
you know,
you hit your computer on and it says,

1212
00:57:42,471 --> 00:57:43,304
you know,
news alert and you hit news alert and 

1213
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:47,360
you're like,
you're afraid to hit the button.

1214
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:51,860
You're afraid to get up in the Morton 
and hit whatever new service you go.

1215
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,053
So that's just a matter of us knowing 
about it more because I have steven 

1216
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:57,470
pinker on next week who's a harvard 
psychologist who,

1217
00:57:57,471 --> 00:58:01,730
and his whole argument is actually that 
things are better than they've ever been

1218
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:02,863
using empirical scientific evidence 
about the amount of people that are 

1219
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,950
being exposed quicker because we 
actually have more people out of poverty

1220
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:10,784
now worldwide than ever before.
More people with drinkable water than 

1221
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:17,120
ever before.
More people that leave the environment,

1222
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:18,950
uh,
enlightenment values and every port.

1223
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:19,784
But we

1224
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,640
why more people would drinkable water.
Yeah.

1225
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:26,630
More the around the world.
Know around the world more now than ever

1226
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:28,580
before.
But that might be true.

1227
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,400
Is that,
are we a hundred percent?

1228
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:33,140
That's true.
I'm pretty sure that's true.

1229
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:36,500
But what about,
what about more people being murdered?

1230
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,930
What about the safety of our kids?
What about,

1231
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,900
you know,
all these things over,

1232
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,130
but most of those,

1233
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,490
most of those markers actually,
they're better than ever before.

1234
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,410
It's just that we hear about them all 
the time now and we obsess over it.

1235
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:53,040
Not that we obsess over the negative.
Yeah,

1236
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,310
because we're not presented the positive
and if we're presented the positive,

1237
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:01,450
it's through a skewed broadcast.
It's,

1238
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,333
it's,
it's not really presented by someone 

1239
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:05,224
that comfort to you.
The show comforts you more than most 

1240
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,740
shows because of the way you handle it.
That's just a fact.

1241
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,260
If you're trying to have watched you 
several times,

1242
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,363
you're trying to put two factions 
together that might have similar or 

1243
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:27,191
report pose views,
discussing opposed views and are saying,

1244
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:28,844
why can't it be like this?
Because if you try to go toward an 

1245
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:32,444
idealistic goal,
the dream of it is how you can almost 

1246
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:39,800
get there.
That's,

1247
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,440
that's how the country was founded.
Besides,

1248
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,303
you know,
taking a lot of things away from the 

1249
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:47,390
people that lived here.
That's a whole other show.

1250
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,450
But you've got three Cox in your yard.
Pretty good.

1251
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,140
So I just trying to get you out of this 
now.

1252
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:58,510
I'm not really politically astute but 
did I make any sense?

1253
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,470
Yeah.
Well you aren't making some sense,

1254
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,930
but I think you actually articulated 
that.

1255
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,410
I mean you're around tomorrow at the 
time.

1256
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,583
That must be a.
I saw just last night and he said Aloha 

1257
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:11,870
because we were in Hawaii together.
But I do say that I'd rather get my news

1258
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,160
from,
you know,

1259
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,113
from John Oliver and,
and Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert and 

1260
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:20,360
Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel than the 
newscasters.

1261
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,263
What does that tell you about US media?
We need a relief and so the news itself 

1262
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:27,254
is already a parody and it's also so 
obsessive no matter where it's coming 

1263
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:31,994
from.
And we're also dealing with a regime 

1264
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,993
which flip flops in the media and on 
twitter faster than I've ever exist 

1265
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:43,310
because we never had a president tweet 
us,

1266
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,380
you know,
we did.

1267
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,090
I mean,
Obama did,

1268
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:48,980
but it wasn't.
It wasn't like,

1269
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,600
I hate this.
I love this,

1270
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:51,950
you know,
18,

1271
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:53,260
21,
21,

1272
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,500
18.
It's like you're in Vegas,

1273
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:56,600
you know,
just double down.

1274
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,550
Um,
do you see him as the problem though?

1275
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:01,960
Or is a symptom because I really see the
symptom.

1276
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,580
It's a symptom.
It was,

1277
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:08,050
it was voting for a guy that was on a 
show that said,

1278
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,610
you're fired.
So what do you expect to get?

1279
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,260
Um,
you know,

1280
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:13,094
if you're gonna,
if you're going to get the host of 

1281
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,793
America's got talent,
you're going to get the most out of 

1282
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:18,884
people.
This is going to be the best a 

1283
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,830
procession ever.
It's going to be dancers and singers.

1284
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,600
And Yeah,
if you had been the president,

1285
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,440
people would be getting be at a Dick,
jokes you,

1286
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,930
you would from me.
I guarantee you a dick joke a day.

1287
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:36,080
And I would treat them and not three in 
the morning.

1288
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:37,250
I do not tweet,
well,

1289
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:39,280
three in the morning,
no one should note,

1290
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:41,090
well no one except the president 
because,

1291
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,780
but I,
but I just think you know,

1292
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,553
what did we expect?
But I think a lot of people were 

1293
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:49,064
surprised and I think it doesn't matter.
It's happening and this is it and so we 

1294
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:54,554
want to better humanity and there are 
great people in the world and there are 

1295
01:01:58,731 --> 01:01:59,564
great people in other countries leading 
the world the best they can and there's 

1296
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:05,714
a lot of slackers and there's other 
people that are just part of the 

1297
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:08,354
political bunch of crap,
but they're still great people and 

1298
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:16,160
there's great people watching this.
There's nice people watching your show.

1299
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,420
Yeah,
you're a nice person.

1300
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:18,530
Nice people.
You don't.

1301
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,560
I don't think you get a lot of haters.
Do you get a ridiculous amount of haters

1302
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,040
do.

1303
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,200
Yeah,
because I talk about the problems that I

1304
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:26,034
see with the modern day left and the 
liberals and they don't like someone to 

1305
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,833
address those things.
That was once one of them by fake 

1306
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:35,190
manner.
Why can't I know they,

1307
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,950
they don't fall.
Don't fall for that.

1308
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,530
Perfect shrink.
You could,

1309
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,300
you could calm me down through tightrope
walking.

1310
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,340
That was because we slipped a little 
saying in your water.

1311
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,560
There is something in my water.
I'm feeling different.

1312
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:50,394
You notice the tone has changed.
I'm not leaving them on the show 

1313
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,780
tomorrow.
Otherwise vibrating it.

1314
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:55,350
Oh yeah.
Though.

1315
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:56,820
I bet things moved in.
Yeah.

1316
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:00,300
Is there anyone that chart behind you?
You know,

1317
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:03,090
that it's just Los Angeles,
but it's an eye chart.

1318
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,073
Pretty clever.
Huh?

1319
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,180
That's really it.
We call that art.

1320
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,380
Get well done.
Mr.

1321
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:08,460
Bond.
Pretty good.

1322
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,533
Uh,
is there anyone that you're paying 

1323
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:12,360
attention to these days that you think 
is making some sense?

1324
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,730
Because I appreciate all the comments 
but the compliments,

1325
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:15,564
but like that's what I think I'm doing 
here is just trying to make a little 

1326
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,550
census of things.
To be honest,

1327
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:23,420
John Oliver has been,
um,

1328
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:28,500
I can't think of anyone political that 
has made me go,

1329
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,600
oh,
there's a great hope there.

1330
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,500
Um,
and I'm interested in something.

1331
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,990
Some people have to say that seemed wow 
that was noble,

1332
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,550
but they're not going to do anything 
about it or they're not going to run or.

1333
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,250
But I'd like to think there's so many 
out there,

1334
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,833
you know,
I'd like to think you think that's part 

1335
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:48,690
of it,
that we all talk a lot,

1336
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,450
but we don't.
Do I sense that sort of what's happening

1337
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:53,700
here?
So is that everyone's saying shit,

1338
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,330
we're fighting always just a bunch of 
fucking voices.

1339
01:03:57,331 --> 01:04:00,330
It's frequencies everywhere.
All through our heads.

1340
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:01,164
It's just noise.

1341
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,190
So trump was like,
all right,

1342
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:04,110
I'm going to do it.
None of you do anything.

1343
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:05,010
And trump's like,
all right,

1344
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,450
I'll do it.
I'll run for president.

1345
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:08,040
You Morons.
And guess what?

1346
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,510
He was right?
Yeah.

1347
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:12,330
And the way he does it,
he can turn anything.

1348
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:13,164
He wants to do a rally.
If he feels the moment and he gets the 

1349
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:21,021
right South Park background behind it,
but he's doing it and I don't know,

1350
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,930
I just don't know anything.
It's too.

1351
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,103
You can't predict a thing.
And we want that security is feeling 

1352
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:38,010
secure that you know at least what 
tomorrow brings.

1353
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,380
We don't know what an hour from now 
brings.

1354
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:41,214
We have never been on our haunches more 
not knowing what's gonna come out of 

1355
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:47,790
him,
out of the White House.

1356
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:50,370
Who's going to get fired,
but that's not the issue.

1357
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,204
The issue is where's the world at and 
where's our kids at and where are the 

1358
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,150
things that really matter.

1359
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:57,983
What really matters is people.
This is sort of like you're giving me 

1360
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:05,190
the ending of a full house episode and 
you want to tell you something else.

1361
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:06,893
I don't want you drinking beer at the 
prompt and you cannot have a horse in 

1362
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:13,080
the living room.
This is where the synthesizer music.

1363
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:13,923
Yeah.
Yeah,

1364
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,233
and you know what?
Always follow your gut because your gut 

1365
01:05:18,121 --> 01:05:20,620
is not wrong.
If you feel it deep inside,

1366
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,690
then take imodium because any moment 
there could be a release.

1367
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,850
I wish I could have done full house like
that.

1368
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,253
That would have been nice.
Just full of diarrhea and give you a 

1369
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:32,920
chance for bloopers like that where you 
could just.

1370
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,311
Oh,
there.

1371
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:38,050
Bloopers grills that were that.
I said horrific things.

1372
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,910
Yeah,
there's is.

1373
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,250
I wrote a book called dirty daddy and I 
told.

1374
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:45,400
I talked about something I did on the 
set once and I got in a lot of trouble,

1375
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:49,600
but I won't say what it is because it's 
not repeatable on this youtube channel,

1376
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,310
but it is in that book and it was 
something I should not have done,

1377
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,630
uh,
with a,

1378
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,123
with a,
um,

1379
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,870
well I can't,
I can't say it,

1380
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,600
but it was something that happened 
because we have been.

1381
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,960
Okay.
I did something that we,

1382
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:03,823
we had stand ins for the kids that were 
mannequins and I was alone on the set 

1383
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:15,660
with just the crew and the monitors were
on and I didn't know that.

1384
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,020
Not acceptable under these conditions or
under this time.

1385
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,393
Do you ever worry about that?
Because you still know because 

1386
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:29,340
everything I've done is when someone 
goes,

1387
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,010
oh,
someone's going to come forward wind.

1388
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,120
When's you're being bad thing going to 
come out.

1389
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,100
I don't know.
Look at my last special.

1390
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,440
You want it?
It's right there.

1391
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,161
You know,
weird way.

1392
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,770
That's like your.
It's like your saving grace sort of like

1393
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,960
you.
I am a confessional.

1394
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,090
Yeah,
I mean I,

1395
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:48,990
there's a story in there in the,
in zero to 60 does special where I say I

1396
01:06:48,991 --> 01:06:52,450
was given ludes by a club owner which 
were serious drug.

1397
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:55,920
It was almost like a roofie terrible 
drug from wolf of Wall Street,

1398
01:06:55,921 --> 01:07:00,270
Jonah Hill and Leo Dicaprio and I'm a 
club owner,

1399
01:07:00,271 --> 01:07:05,271
told me to give it to a waitress and I 
could have my way with her and I instead

1400
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,020
to cut to the chase and ruin a joke.

1401
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:10,110
I actually took it myself to knock 
myself out,

1402
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:15,050
so because she was kind of hitting on me
because I did it too because that's kind

1403
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,570
of guy and so all my stuff's out there 
because I didn't,

1404
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:23,630
I didn't do anything a diabolical that I
can recall that roofing yourself,

1405
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,460
can you?
Yes.

1406
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,480
Yeah.
Can you,

1407
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,343
can you add that?
I can recall to every single thing I 

1408
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:33,570
said on this entire interview,
that's what politicians do.

1409
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,000
Okay.
So I'm going to come in and I'm going to

1410
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:39,540
voice over this new tire interview just 
so that I can recall.

1411
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,463
Yeah,
I feel we should end this either with 

1412
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:45,930
something hitting you in the nuts or 
something or a song.

1413
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,160
Oh yes,
we could do a song,

1414
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:49,170
but you already gave me the nice full 
house ending.

1415
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:52,710
What do you think is the you.
You were the one here with the brain.

1416
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:58,190
Tell me what you think is the hope of 
how we can get hope is is communication.

1417
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:03,384
Yeah.
That this is happening now that people 

1418
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:07,110
are doing this,
that you know what I mean?

1419
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,260
Your discourse,
your fiance Kelly came across me.

1420
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:13,140
We traded a couple messages on twitter.
I was like,

1421
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,003
oh.
She gets it like she's to find some 

1422
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:16,100
answers.

1423
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,740
I'm trying to find some answers and we 
went out for dinner.

1424
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:19,574
We all became friends immediately and 
that people and that whatever the 

1425
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,340
differences that we may have where you 
know,

1426
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:26,174
you're probably still a little more left
than I am on some things and just 

1427
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:29,300
doesn't even matter.
I,

1428
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,140
I think on some things probably you're,
you're probably a little more,

1429
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:32,751
Eh,
I don't know.

1430
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:33,920
It doesn't need to.
It's irrelevant.

1431
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:35,090
I dress left.
I don't know.

1432
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,953
The accounts just doesn't even matter,
but the point is that the reason that 

1433
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,630
shows like this are working is because 
of this,

1434
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,750
that you were willing to come here,
sit down to come here.

1435
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,073
Yeah.
You immediately said to me that you 

1436
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:48,080
wanted to come,
but that's the point.

1437
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:48,914
It's like people want this now they they
are so tired of the other thing and all 

1438
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:57,701
we're doing is exactly what Tom Snyder 
did and he was just talking to a camera,

1439
01:08:58,191 --> 01:08:59,024
but what were what cars.
He had a guest or William f Buckley or 

1440
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:02,984
any of these people who said,
let's try to find some answers and you 

1441
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:07,424
can get,
I think as many answers from Bob Saget 

1442
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:09,644
as you can from the guys.
I think you get far more answers from 

1443
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:15,650
listening to someone like you had some 
life experience and that cares.

1444
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,560
Then you can virtually listening to cnn 
all day long.

1445
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,960
Well you can get.

1446
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:22,380
Well,
we never got into which we don't want to

1447
01:09:22,381 --> 01:09:23,214
get into,
which is all the depth that I had in my 

1448
01:09:24,121 --> 01:09:26,130
family.
So much death of friends.

1449
01:09:26,131 --> 01:09:30,020
I just lost someone today.
I'm just talking about.

1450
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,850
We can go there.
Well,

1451
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,693
all I was going to say was that's what 
centers everybody because it seems we 

1452
01:09:36,571 --> 01:09:37,404
all go through our birth and death and 
they all happen differently and when 

1453
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:46,950
they happen at an unfortunate age,
like our last two sisters at 34 and 47,

1454
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:50,220
that's.
That's what centers you.

1455
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,020
That's bigger than everything is the 
loss of life and when people die,

1456
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:57,780
when young people die,
there's nothing more.

1457
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,290
That's all that matters.
Yeah,

1458
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,040
it does.
The rest of it is your belief.

1459
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:05,640
This is that this is that.
It's yes,

1460
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:09,060
you want to solve in a civilization how 
to keep people alive,

1461
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,583
but the empathy is,
is what's missing and just quickly to 

1462
01:10:16,981 --> 01:10:17,814
touch on what we didn't touch on,
but we talked about before the show 

1463
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:20,994
started.

1464
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,883
Okay.
I'm going.

1465
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:26,700
The talk shows that exist at night to 
chat shows as they call them in England.

1466
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:28,793
When I would do Johnny Carson Show and 
before him was Jack Paar who I got to 

1467
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:33,474
meet and before him was Steve Allen who 
I got to meet and these are guys that 

1468
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,780
they all had the tonight show those 
gentlemen.

1469
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,070
And then johnny ended up with it,
um,

1470
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:47,580
that was viewed how they would tell 
their guests,

1471
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:51,270
you're coming to a cocktail party,
how do I dress like a cocktail party?

1472
01:10:51,271 --> 01:10:53,280
How do I talk?
You're at a cocktail party,

1473
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:58,590
you're in Johnny's living room and he's 
sharing that living room with everybody.

1474
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,640
Well,
why does he have a desk in his living?

1475
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,990
Because he wants a desk.
He wants a place for his ashtray.

1476
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:04,950
Smokes.
Got a little.

1477
01:11:04,951 --> 01:11:06,530
Maybe he's got a drink there.
Whatever

1478
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,040
that,
that they used to do that.

1479
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,350
I mean,
there's a lot of white ones.

1480
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,590
They're smoking,
they're drinking,

1481
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,760
you know,
Burt Reynolds is.

1482
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,430
I mean,
it's amazing.

1483
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,610
And then talk about what we want.
We don't want to see it.

1484
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,300
Although sometimes we do.
We see some strange things that happen.

1485
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:23,360
I mean a lot of and certainly had some,
you know,

1486
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:26,070
Joachim Phoenix moments,
those kind of things.

1487
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,840
We're still going to see more stuff like
that.

1488
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:30,570
People are going to do whatever trippy 
stuff they're doing.

1489
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:35,550
But the truth of it is those late night 
shows are supposed to be entertainment.

1490
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:36,623
That's what this post to be.
They've become a bit of let's attack 

1491
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:45,750
everything today that we've been through
because look what happened today because

1492
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,703
it's been getting ratings and people 
that necessarily might not do political 

1493
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:54,090
comedy like James Corden.
He's in entertainment oriented man.

1494
01:11:54,091 --> 01:11:55,930
He's been very talented men from 
Broadway.

1495
01:11:55,931 --> 01:11:56,764
He's does at Carpool Karaoke.
He but he comes out and does a seven 

1496
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:03,540
minute monologue that might have a bunch
of stuff in it about the White House,

1497
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,260
but that's not.

1498
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:08,160
We're not born to do that,
but that's what's feeding the beast,

1499
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:13,020
but it's supposed to be a time when you 
chill at the end of the day where you're

1500
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:15,960
entertain,
where you relax and when you want to get

1501
01:12:15,961 --> 01:12:16,950
that.
Tom Snyder,

1502
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:20,430
when you want to get that,
dare I say the name in a sentence.

1503
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:23,400
Charlie rose because that's what he did.
He did a one on one,

1504
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:28,450
but when you say a name like that,
it can't help it cause someone to recoil

1505
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,050
dot Larry King for my purposes.
Larry King,

1506
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:34,440
I've known forever and I adore him.
He's a great guy.

1507
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,900
Larry King.
I'm a post to have dinner with them.

1508
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:39,990
Kelly and I are supposed to go ahead 
with him and Shawna on for dinner.

1509
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,940
We can go to that place if you invite 
Sean,

1510
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,280
that place that we went that place so we
would,

1511
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,420
we don't talk about but a neat place.
He is quite a character.

1512
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,850
He,
I went on Larry King Show,

1513
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:53,460
he read my book and every time he sees 
me he goes,

1514
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:56,910
I loved your book second.
And I know I'm thinking it's because he,

1515
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,060
he forgot that he keeps telling me,
but he's just,

1516
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,900
I've just known him a long time and um,
and he,

1517
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,400
he was very,
very good at it,

1518
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,263
you know,
and we've got some really good people 

1519
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,890
doing the news.
So some real good people out there.

1520
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:12,240
I mean,
Lorenzo Donald's,

1521
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:13,060
a friend of mine,
I,

1522
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:13,820
uh,
I,

1523
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,460
I like them a lot.
Um,

1524
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:20,560
that name right there might flag people,
Msnbc and uh,

1525
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,860
too many consonants.
We hate it,

1526
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,360
but I don't know,
I just see we need to be entertained.

1527
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:30,743
It's really complicated to do it at this
time in a way without bringing up human 

1528
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,510
issues,
moral issues.

1529
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,330
And I'm going to do the best I can to do
that.

1530
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,081
You know,
it's funny,

1531
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:41,640
I remember,
so I was never,

1532
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:43,470
even though I think you know him 
personally,

1533
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:45,570
I was never a fan of Leno on the tonight
show.

1534
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:48,330
I loved cars and even though it was my 
kind of very early years,

1535
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:50,670
but Leno to me,
I always liked the bill Hicks thing or,

1536
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:51,504
and you know,
they had that rival and I liked that 

1537
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:56,850
sort of more raw and gravity and Lenovo 
to me was like he was just the corporate

1538
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,140
version.
So I never liked it.

1539
01:13:58,141 --> 01:14:02,820
But in an odd way I suddenly had this 
bizarre respect for him now.

1540
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:03,923
Well he was,
he was a comedian hosting the tonight 

1541
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:06,600
show.
Yeah.

1542
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,540
And I that he wasn't overtly political 
all the time.

1543
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:12,250
Now it's always political and I almost 
missed that

1544
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,353
in a way,
even though he wasn't really my guy in 

1545
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,390
terms of comedy.
But I know,

1546
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,400
I know everyone says he's incredible 
standup,

1547
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,610
which has nothing to do with his great 
standup.

1548
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,473
And I was

1549
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:27,500
in turn on the Mike Douglas show within 
Philadelphia at 18 years old.

1550
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:31,090
And I was on his very first television 
appearance.

1551
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:33,730
Wow.
So I know Jay that long.

1552
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,330
And so there's a interesting history and
then,

1553
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,250
you know,
Johnny Carson,

1554
01:14:39,251 --> 01:14:41,050
David Letterman,
Conan,

1555
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:45,670
those were guys that I would go on those
shows and I felt the most connection.

1556
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:46,504
But Jay,
I would go on and promote a movie I'd 

1557
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:48,964
worked on that I directed that I worked 
so hard and he couldn't have been more 

1558
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:52,480
gracious,
you know.

1559
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,493
So yeah,
I don't have to do chemo is one of the 

1560
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:59,110
sweetest people alive that does this,
you know?

1561
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,810
Um,
and gold bears great.

1562
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:02,644
I mean,
it's an interesting time for media and 

1563
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:09,070
for broadcasting.
I just want to see us get into some kind

1564
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:14,071
of place of peace of mind in the world 
and we're not there.

1565
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,220
That's a big lift man.

1566
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,860
I mean,
that's right.

1567
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,733
Like that's why I'm doing this.
That's why you want to do this or I 

1568
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,470
never wanted to do.
So

1569
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,760
I've never wanted to perform more.
I'm more motivated to go do standup.

1570
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,840
I booked these Stena,
I'm on tour.

1571
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:33,043
I'm trying to work out trying to come up
with new stuff because I know you do a 

1572
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:36,250
special on,
you deplete it,

1573
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,173
but you know,
you don't want to just give them 

1574
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:39,394
something they just bought or heard,
but people really need it and I need to 

1575
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:48,811
do it because it takes people out of.
It brings them into their life.

1576
01:15:49,781 --> 01:15:50,300
You know,

1577
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,950
you think like the last sense makers 
these days.

1578
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:54,870
There's a couple others that I think 
there's a few.

1579
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,970
There's a few comedians that I would 
rather watch than almost anybody.

1580
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,133
Um,
there are some good motivational 

1581
01:16:01,611 --> 01:16:06,140
speakers.
There's some good good clergy out there.

1582
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:09,450
I'm not a subscriber that much.
Um,

1583
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,633
I'm a comedian so I kind of listened to 
the people that have a lot to say and 

1584
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:17,600
some of them really do have a lot to 
say.

1585
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,033
So I respect.
I respect people with a point of view 

1586
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:26,060
that aren't malicious.
That would be you.

1587
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,540
Did we do it all here?
I think pretty much.

1588
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:30,010
Unless you want to.

1589
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,870
You got to walk.
You want to make some vegetables,

1590
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,053
have a great walk.
And I knew you had a walk me one 

1591
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:35,464
disaster story one,
like a nightmare I was telling you 

1592
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:42,910
before about my my thing when I was on 
at the RNC convention and I was sweating

1593
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:45,380
like crazy and Larry King said it's more
like,

1594
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:46,713
like Albert Brooks in broadcast news.
I was on stage to take us out with a 

1595
01:16:50,381 --> 01:16:52,630
disaster.
Say I get a disaster of standup,

1596
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,130
but anything.
Give me some life.

1597
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:54,920
Very well.
Thank you.

1598
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,860
Give me a professional.
Not a life disaster.

1599
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,420
I gave you a life disaster.
All right.

1600
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,710
How about one life named her name?
Dropping like disaster.

1601
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,010
I'm on on an

1602
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:07,530
airplane on America on an a 7:47
A.

1603
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:08,383
I'm on the video show is number one at 
the time so you can then list famous 

1604
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,174
people on the plane in the newspaper by 
WHO's the most famous and how they're 

1605
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:18,254
listed in the newspaper.
But I was on a plane with David Bowie 

1606
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:25,930
and Amman and Greg Kinnear and Richard 
Lewis.

1607
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,853
Or where was that?
This was an American flight out of JFK 

1608
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:30,210
to La.
That's hilarious.

1609
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:35,290
And also mark mckeown who was on the CBS
morning news and a friend of mine,

1610
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,420
um,
and so the plane starts taking off.

1611
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:42,290
This would never exist today as we're 
taking off in the air.

1612
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:47,710
We hear an explosion and one of the 
engines apparently blows out.

1613
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,670
The plane goes,
rickety.

1614
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:53,990
We then land at JFK.
So a very long time ago.

1615
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:59,650
Um,
and we find out first they take the VIP,

1616
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:02,360
which is people I named on two carts.

1617
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,180
And Richard Lewis is yelling next to 
David Bowie,

1618
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,490
only a couple of us are Jews.
I'm like,

1619
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,530
I'm not to this.
So now we're in the club and I'm getting

1620
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:14,390
to talk to David Bowie.
So I'm going,

1621
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,430
okay,
this was worth an explosion.

1622
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:17,264
I'm fun.
And who could not have been more 

1623
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:22,500
gracious and um,
and it was just a,

1624
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,050
it was dangerous and upsetting.
They two hours go by,

1625
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,943
they put us back on the same plane,
turns out it was a fuel hose that came 

1626
01:18:32,601 --> 01:18:33,434
loose,
which is just like turning a screw on a 

1627
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:38,090
gasket on your lawnmower.
And they fixed it,

1628
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,013
which would never happen.
Now that would get you a new plane or 

1629
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:44,320
cancel you completely or whatever.
And uh,

1630
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:49,540
we then took off and I made some joke,
I think the movie outbreak had just come

1631
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:53,870
out and I said something like,
there was a monkey caught in the,

1632
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:55,040
uh,
in the engine.

1633
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,730
And then Richard Lewis yells out.
That's a good one.

1634
01:18:58,731 --> 01:18:59,564
Bob Amman is from Zaire.
And so I'm called out and then as we 

1635
01:19:06,021 --> 01:19:07,910
take off,
Richard Lewis Yells,

1636
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:08,744
thanks Bob to the whole plane and at 
that time you could go into the cockpit 

1637
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,770
this pre nine slash 11.
And um,

1638
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,340
I was able to ask the pilots what 
happened.

1639
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,910
So I actually told the VIP [inaudible] 
no one else.

1640
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:24,240
What happened?
Well,

1641
01:19:24,241 --> 01:19:26,060
you shouldn't,
they didn't tell the other people.

1642
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,520
So that was a,
that's true disaster story.

1643
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:29,354
I mean,
that could have ended incredibly badly 

1644
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:32,060
and I would have been fourth.

1645
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:37,400
I would put him to settle that with 
Louis because we could,

1646
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,120
we could get him here and we can 
moderate some discussion last night.

1647
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:41,954
And he and I are gonna.
He holds me by the face and hugs me and 

1648
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:45,643
we're going to figure out the list,
but he's going to tell me that I would 

1649
01:19:47,861 --> 01:19:50,570
have gone ahead of him simply because of
that dumb video show,

1650
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,830
but he would say dumb video show in 
order to do it because that was probably

1651
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:56,780
1988,
89,

1652
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:57,650
you know,
it's one of the,

1653
01:19:57,650 --> 01:19:58,483
one of the nicest moments I've had on 
this when I had Richard Lewis and he 

1654
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:01,094
left and you know,
he's kind of a Germaphobe is Larry and 

1655
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,400
you know,
he doesn't shake hands.

1656
01:20:04,401 --> 01:20:05,234
He does this as he said goodbye to me.
I walked him out and when I opened up 

1657
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:08,010
the

1658
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,580
door,
he just said,

1659
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,650
he,
he said something like,

1660
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:13,140
you're great,
and he touched me on the cheek and I was

1661
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,580
like,
I like melted.

1662
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:15,030
I was living.

1663
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:17,490
Does this rabbinical thing?
Is that what?

1664
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:18,324
That is?
Erotic rabbinical thing that I think he 

1665
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:23,730
learned from his shrink for a jury learn
differently shaped or the other story,

1666
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:25,530
which is a very simple one,
very,

1667
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:26,364
very short story.
I was in San Francisco performing 

1668
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,570
standup.
I learned that.

1669
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,820
Be careful what you do,
messing with a heckler.

1670
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:34,483
A guy who was about eight feet tall,
got up on stage and got me in a 

1671
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:38,754
headlock.
Holy Shit and wouldn't let go of me and 

1672
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:44,580
had me and it was hurting my neck badly,
no security,

1673
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:45,743
nobody there days and I took the 
microphone and I shoved it up his ass 

1674
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:56,190
and he got so paranoid that I had done 
that,

1675
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,000
that he ran away.
I don't know why.

1676
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:04,470
All I know is I don't know if he had a 
homophobic,

1677
01:21:04,471 --> 01:21:05,304
frightened moment or thought maybe that 
I was going to go further in or maybe 

1678
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:13,200
that he would have farted and I would've
picked it up on the mic.

1679
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:14,843
But in any case,
that is scary when you are out there 

1680
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:19,770
with the people.
Now young girls will just flash me their

1681
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:21,270
boobs and go,
Danny Tanner,

1682
01:21:21,271 --> 01:21:22,104
you know,
like that.

1683
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,333
But uh,
I've had a few things like that happen 

1684
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:27,990
where people have had to,
security has had to throw people out.

1685
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:28,893
You've got all kinds of stuff like that.
That won't happen to you in Irvine at 

1686
01:21:31,471 --> 01:21:32,700
the Improv.
I hope not.

1687
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,370
You got a hell of a standup career 
happening because you have so many.

1688
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:39,000
So you say content and then you have 
jokes you're going to have.

1689
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:42,450
You're going to talk philosophically 
like you do on here about life,

1690
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:43,643
and then you button it with something 
humorous or you feather it throughout 

1691
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:47,210
with jokes.

1692
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,060
Yeah.
Uh,

1693
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:48,913
I mean,
I think we talked about this a little 

1694
01:21:49,491 --> 01:21:49,761
bit,
but,

1695
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:50,510
um,
you know,

1696
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:53,060
there's two ways that you can do this.
So there's the Seinfeld way,

1697
01:21:53,061 --> 01:21:56,720
which is like that perfect tactician 
laid out every pause,

1698
01:21:56,721 --> 01:21:59,150
every inflection point.
I could never do it that way.

1699
01:21:59,151 --> 01:22:00,830
I don't think that's exactly how you do 
it either.

1700
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:01,664
No,
but then there's sort of the garry 

1701
01:22:02,421 --> 01:22:03,320
shandling way,
which was,

1702
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:04,283
you know,
there's that great moment in the 

1703
01:22:04,701 --> 01:22:08,360
documentary comedian where he shows him 
his papers and it looks,

1704
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,710
you know,
Hitler wrote it because it's like,

1705
01:22:09,711 --> 01:22:11,420
so perfect.
And then,

1706
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,333
uh,
you have Gary Shandling who pulls out 

1707
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:16,580
this crumbled piece of paper that's much
closer to what I am.

1708
01:22:16,581 --> 01:22:18,080
I have some ideas.
And I did.

1709
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,183
I was on a beach last week in Florida 
and I wrote out the hour and some of it 

1710
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:25,160
is stuff that I've done through the 
years that I've just updated,

1711
01:22:25,161 --> 01:22:28,970
but it's all based in what I'm doing 
here and I'm trying to just be true.

1712
01:22:28,971 --> 01:22:30,310
I'm just trying to be.

1713
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:31,970
It'd be great.
Yeah.

1714
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,133
And then you're,
then you're hooked and then you then 

1715
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:38,660
welcome until the next 30 years and 
it'll,

1716
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:39,494
it'll,
it'll,

1717
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,810
it'll infiltrate this and might not only
be stand up and you,

1718
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,590
it's an interesting thing to do to be 
able to go,

1719
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:46,424
hey,
I'm going to do Vegas three times this 

1720
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,400
year and,
and uh,

1721
01:22:49,401 --> 01:22:50,234
you know,
and people come to see me and it's kind 

1722
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:52,424
of fun.
And can I get on the jet with you and 

1723
01:22:54,941 --> 01:22:56,030
Mar?
You know what,

1724
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,070
if I,
if I rock it for the next year,

1725
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,830
that'll be my goal.
You saw the picture.

1726
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,020
I saw the picture.
You don't want to be on that.

1727
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:06,100
You don't want to be in that one.
That was a,

1728
01:23:06,101 --> 01:23:07,710
that was a fun trip.
That was a fun,

1729
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:10,210
fun.
Can you guys do that every year?

1730
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:12,130
You and Margaret,
I've never done it with before.

1731
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:14,980
He always has a,
he has eddie vedder do it,

1732
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,223
comes in and we didn't know.
We had him on tape and we had Reggie 

1733
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:24,190
Brown who did his Obama impression that 
he's done on a real time before and then

1734
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:25,024
he always had different people.
He gets different comedians to come out 

1735
01:23:26,861 --> 01:23:27,694
and do it with him and he asked me to do
it because he wanted to have some fun 

1736
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,053
and we've always liked each other.
I mean we've known each other since for 

1737
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,720
23.
We all started together.

1738
01:23:34,721 --> 01:23:35,554
I took Jerry Seinfeld to Disneyland,
Jesus and Garry shandling and George 

1739
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,080
Wallace and it was the opening of 
thunder mountain railroad.

1740
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,450
And I'll leave you with this because 
I've left you with nine other important.

1741
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:52,760
Want to keep going now to uh,
but uh,

1742
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,083
there was a goat with dynamite on.
Have you ever been on Thunder Mountain 

1743
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,361
Railroad?
I know it,

1744
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:00,310
but I'm not exist anymore.

1745
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,330
Oh,
it's very popular.

1746
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,270
So there's a goat with dynamite.
A robot.

1747
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:05,800
Not,
not much of a robot,

1748
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:10,801
but it's trying to exactly where the 
dynamite and you hear it.

1749
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,150
And all I did for 23 years old and 
Jerry's a few months older than me.

1750
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,400
I think I,
I want Jerry.

1751
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,920
Oh my God.
I go with dynamite.

1752
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,740
And Gerry would,
Gerry always did,

1753
01:24:23,741 --> 01:24:26,770
was just lay out the obvious,
oh my gosh,

1754
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:29,030
our glass with a stain,
you know,

1755
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,870
that's not a joke or I'm not him because
he's brilliant business.

1756
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,630
There's nothing to clean glass.
But,

1757
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,360
but he to this day I could say,
oh my God,

1758
01:24:38,361 --> 01:24:39,194
I go with dynamite and he will laugh 
because it's when you know somebody and 

1759
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,710
you just get them,
you know.

1760
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:49,510
And I saw a bunch of comics last night,
so Paul Riser and it was billy crystal's

1761
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:53,110
birthday and it's just nice seeing all 
these people that I.

1762
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:56,530
Yeah.
So magical that time.

1763
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:57,723
Right?
Like you came up in a time that to me 

1764
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:00,940
and for anyone that appreciates comedy,
it's like,

1765
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:02,800
Holy Shit,
all of these guys.

1766
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,050
And then you realize there weren't that 
many.

1767
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,461
You go like,
oh,

1768
01:25:06,461 --> 01:25:07,840
there were thousands of comedians.
No,

1769
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:08,674
there weren't.
There were hundreds and a lot of them 

1770
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:12,880
are gone.
And then there's,

1771
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:15,400
you know,
I'm at that two thirds point,

1772
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:20,401
I'd like to think my middle chapter I,
it means I have to live to 122.

1773
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,600
Well,
with all the medications these days,

1774
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:24,790
I think it's possible anything's 
motorized,

1775
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:28,930
unicycle up my butt,
but no seat that seems excessive,

1776
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:30,490
but whatever,
whatever works for you.

1777
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:33,850
And we lost Stephen Hawking.
Just wanted to end on that.

1778
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,600
You mentioned George Wallace,
George Wallace,

1779
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:39,400
George Wallace,
his hbo special,

1780
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:42,400
which I think maybe he only had one,
which is a real disservice,

1781
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:46,240
although he's had many other specialists
to me might be the funniest half hour.

1782
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:48,820
There was something about him and he was
always.

1783
01:25:48,821 --> 01:25:50,910
A friend of mine always rented Jerry's.
Yeah,

1784
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,320
he's just a funny,
funny guy.

1785
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:54,843
And um,
he would mess with me one time he was 

1786
01:25:58,541 --> 01:25:59,374
opening for Tom Jones a lot on the road 
and I lived in Hollywood on Camino and 

1787
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,594
he went out of town,
but I forgot that he went out of town 

1788
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:10,760
and we were buddies and,
and,

1789
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:12,560
um,
and he said,

1790
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,633
he called me up.
He said,

1791
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:15,680
saget make me chicken.
I said,

1792
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:17,180
okay.
I had no life,

1793
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,043
you know,
I was waiting for the comedy store that 

1794
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,470
night.
Know I was 24 maybe.

1795
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:22,340
Okay.
I'll make you a chicken.

1796
01:26:22,341 --> 01:26:24,320
What do you want to southern fried in an
oven.

1797
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:25,220
Okay,
sure.

1798
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:26,660
Maybe make,
does make me chicken.

1799
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:30,620
I'll be over in a couple hours.
So I make chicken and make a whole bunch

1800
01:26:30,621 --> 01:26:31,454
of chicken is already so put that and 
then he doesn't come over and now I'm 

1801
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:38,834
getting worried.

1802
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,013
William Holden had just died.
And so I'm like scared that George died 

1803
01:26:43,401 --> 01:26:48,401
and his conduct shows you how I have 
grown as a human.

1804
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:54,080
I called his landlord and uh,
I got ahold of a building and he,

1805
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:58,460
George is in Tahoe is nobody can Tom 
Jones.

1806
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:01,790
So I called the hotel and there's a 
George W.

1807
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,481
What did you do?
He said,

1808
01:27:02,481 --> 01:27:05,480
you fucking idiot.
I told you I was opening for Tom Jones.

1809
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,763
Why'd you make me chicken?
I said I'm freezing it and you're going 

1810
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:09,680
to eat it.
Dammit.

1811
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,143
So that's the end of that story.
The George Wallace ever eat your 

1812
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,060
chicken.
No,

1813
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:16,100
I ate it.
It was pretty good.

1814
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,610
On that note,
saget.

1815
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:21,840
I've made chicken sense until I came to 
your house and I saw your.

1816
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,080
The way you were eyeballing the one on 
the left.

1817
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:25,550
You can have an egg.
You can have the chicken.

1818
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,830
Okay.
Can I have an egg?

1819
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,850
Yeah,
you can leave this house with an egg.

1820
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:30,410
I want.
I'm going to give you a farm.

1821
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:33,830
Fresh egg and I happy.
Do I cook it?

1822
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,371
You know,
happy.

1823
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:36,740
That'll make my sister Bob Saget.
Danny Tanner.

1824
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:38,360
He's walking out of my house with a 
farm.

1825
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:41,990
Fresh egg.
But can I eat it?

1826
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,140
Yeah.
This is what I will cook it.

1827
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,730
You know what?
David's the chef around here.

1828
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:50,570
Do you want to literally the best sunny 
side up egg.

1829
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,260
All right.
We are ending this show.

1830
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,133
This really has been a pleasure.
It's so nice when you meet somebody who 

1831
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:57,950
you know,
who you know,

1832
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:58,784
but you don't know,
and then you realize you that you know 

1833
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,980
them.
Something like that.

1834
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:05,981
That's the point I think of what we're 
supposed to do as people.

1835
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,240
We get to do this and we would do this 
at dinner.

1836
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:12,980
This is almost like this,
except we just.

1837
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:17,060
We would move more,
didn't move very much.

1838
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:18,790
I was like,
you know,

1839
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,540
Captain Pike a little bit.
Yeah.

1840
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:21,543
All right.
I suspect we'll do this over dinner 

1841
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:26,060
again and we'll do it here again.
And uh,

1842
01:28:26,061 --> 01:28:26,894
and this is,
I think you've got enough to edit this 

1843
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:30,920
for three years.
This is the longest.

1844
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,690
Sheila,
this is actually my retirement show now.

1845
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,510
How long was this?
About six hours.

1846
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,300
That's fantastic.
Now really this was beyond,

1847
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:41,510
we went into mountain time for more on 
that man.

1848
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:45,140
Bob Saget checkout his special zero to 
60 on Amazon,

1849
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:46,580
and we've got the link right down below.
