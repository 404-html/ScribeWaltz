1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,870
It may sound strange,
but as a liberal,

2
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:07,704
I really do believe in American 
exceptionalism due to our democratic 

3
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:11,634
ideals and personal freedoms in America 
is a unique and special country in the 

4
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,140
world.
I really do believe that.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,273
You may remember back in 2009 when 
President Obama said he didn't really 

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:23,070
believe in American exceptionalism 
saying quote,

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,600
I believe in American exceptionalism 
just as I suspect that the Brits believe

8
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,434
in British exceptionalism and the Greeks
believe in Greek exceptionalism in and 

9
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:33,954
of itself.
There's nothing wrong with Obama's 

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,874
general idea here in which each 
individual country is filled with proud 

11
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,720
people who believe that their country is
unique and special in the world.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,033
Actually,
this idea of fuels people to build a 

13
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,690
better society that they can be 
genuinely proud of.

14
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,400
Then fantastic.
Of course,

15
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:51,234
by the same token,
this nationalism could also push 

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,204
otherwise good people to believe that 
they should have inordinate sway over 

17
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:01,320
the world or influence other nations 
because they're morally superior.

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,680
Over the eight years of Obama's 
presidency,

19
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:05,514
he walked back this statement and did 
actually say that America's 

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,503
exceptionalism was unique for me.
There's an additional reason for 

21
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,034
American exceptionalism,
which goes beyond just our democratic 

22
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:21,210
ideals and our personal freedoms.
Obviously we are the only country in the

23
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,044
world to share those ideas.
It's also the additional piece that 

24
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:25,944
America is a country of immigrants,
a country of people from all over the 

25
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,370
world who came here to make a better 
life for themselves.

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,683
We are a nation built by people whose 
ancestors often came here with nothing 

27
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,454
and who worked hard to build a better 
country and life for their children and 

28
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,624
their children's children.
While we certainly aren't the only 

29
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,880
country to welcome immigrants or to 
build a solid middle class,

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,013
there's no other nation on earth that 
more people from more countries have 

31
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:56,640
come to live and prosper because of the 
pursuit of happiness.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,180
This doesn't mean that everyone can come
here and we can have open borders,

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,700
but it does mean that if you come here 
illegally,

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,030
you'll be given the same chance as a 
natural born citizen.

35
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,463
Even today,
as we live in a politically fractured 

36
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:09,984
society,
and many people will tell you that 

37
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,204
things have never been worse.
The truth is that things have actually 

38
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,960
never been better.
Now,

39
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:16,794
of course,
I don't mean that for every specific 

40
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:18,744
person or every specific job or specific
industry times change and soda people 

41
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,230
and economies,
but as a whole,

42
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,064
America has done an incredible job of 
welcoming so many diverse people having 

43
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:34,200
us all share in the American dream,
while at the same time all being able to

44
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,680
keep traditions and practices from our 
unique cultures.

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,500
As our economy changes over the next few
years,

46
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,520
we the people have a massive job of 
changing along with it.

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,593
In an age where supermarkets will be 
automated and driverless cars will 

48
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,794
replace truck drivers,
it will be more important than ever for 

49
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,334
us to change along with the technology.
The world doesn't stop for anyone or 

50
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,703
anything.
You have to adapt to a changing world 

51
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,000
and in these moments of change,
that's usually where America has been at

52
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,863
its best.
Our system built on the idea that it's 

53
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,604
your job to pursue your happiness is the
reason that more people still want to 

54
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,650
come to America right now than any other
country on earth.

55
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,843
I always find it ironic that so many 
people who rant and rave about how evil 

56
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,450
America is are the same people who 
demand that we let anyone in here.

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,030
Why would anyone want to come to such an
evil,

58
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,510
unfair and oppressive society?
Of course,

59
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,400
this is nonsense and these people know 
it.

60
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,730
There's a reason that people don't leave
America in droves.

61
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,563
Even the celebrities who said they would
leave if trump was elected have somehow 

62
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,164
managed to stay here for the record.
I'm pretty sure that Canada is happy 

63
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,340
that they didn't have to take in most of
those people.

64
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,330
I mentioned all of this because for all 
the goodness here in America,

65
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,320
we obviously still have some work to do.
Every society has worked to do,

66
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:57,070
which is why people peddling utopia are 
always frauds.

67
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,660
In Liars.
In America,

68
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,010
though almost every generation has 
fought to expand rights to other people,

69
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:03,844
not to limit them.
That's how we got women the right to 

70
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,874
vote.
That's how we freed the slaves and 

71
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,614
that's how gay people were allowed to 
marry and that's how whatever will come 

72
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,210
next will arrive.
As for that work that we have to do,

73
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,044
I think a lot of it has to do with how 
we can come together instead of just 

74
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,120
ripping each other apart.

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,630
I'm a firm believer that most of us want
the same things in life.

76
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,030
We want to work a decent job,
eat some good food,

77
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,180
have some sex,
and go on vacation now and again,

78
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,500
most of us aren't racist,
homophobe secretly plotting against each

79
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,380
other and trying to push our way of life
on everyone else.

80
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,790
This is somewhere which no matter where 
your political leanings are,

81
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,950
we can all come together.
Yes,

82
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,130
some of us are from big cities,
some of us are from small towns.

83
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,964
Some of us have had ancestors who 
arrived on the mayflower and some of us 

84
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,350
just arrived yesterday,
but the only way this all works is if we

85
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:01,000
all bend to fit the American ideals of 
freedom and of liberty,

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,330
not if we demand that the system bend to
us.

87
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,700
My guest this week is comedian trae 
crowder.

88
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,800
Trey is known as the liberal redneck.

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,430
Apparently they do exist.
His comedy is a blend of showing liberal

90
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,264
elites that rednecks aren't all 
backwards Hicks and showing rednecks 

91
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,850
that liberals aren't all evil 
socialists.

92
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,340
It's almost as if we should judge people
as individuals,

93
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,020
not as groups.
Where have I heard that before?

94
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,703
You know the middle of this country for 
a long time has been the brunt of jokes 

95
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,654
and the easy way to make fun of anyone 
who thinks differently than the people 

96
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
in New York or Los Angeles.
As someone who has only lived in New 

97
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,053
York or Los Angeles,
I've never subscribed to this way of 

98
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,604
thinking and I've tried not to mock 
people just because they talk 

99
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,130
differently or haven't evolved on some 
social views.

100
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:49,120
The second that I have,
whether you're a Democrat or Republican,

101
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,520
straight or gay,
black or white,

102
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,670
native American or new immigrants,
this country belongs to all of us and it

103
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,220
needs all of us to continue to make it 
better.

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,513
That's the thing with exceptionalism.
It takes an awful lot of work to keep 

105
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,114
up.
Joining me this week is a comedian and 

106
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:12,520
author,
a redneck and liberal cray crowder.

107
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,443
Welcome to the Rubin report.
I've gotten to here in mind a redneck 

108
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,503
and a liberal that throws people a lot.
Do I have to even ask you a question to 

109
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,360
start this thing or do I just hand it to
you there?

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,260
Well,
the,

111
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,080
so what has become my favorite way to 
define that?

112
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:32,370
I was actually was actually said to me 
at one of my comedy shows in Austin,

113
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:33,204
Texas.
I guy from Mississippi who now lives in 

114
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:36,924
Austin.
I fan came up to me and was talking to 

115
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:39,174
me and he was like,
he seemed so genuinely frustrated too 

116
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,194
about like all the,
how he's been stereotyped or whatever 

117
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:47,010
for being a redneck or whatever else.
He's like,

118
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:47,970
man,
I,

119
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,923
you know,
I,

120
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,340
I like to blow shit up,
but I ain't fucking racist.

121
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,423
Eddie seemed like so upset about it.
I was wanting to put my hand on his 

122
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,311
shoulder.
I was like,

123
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,690
I know buddy.
It's all right.

124
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,670
You know what I mean?
But,

125
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,170
but yeah,
basically just,

126
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,700
you know,
I grew up in,

127
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:06,730
I was very stereotypically redneck 
fashion,

128
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,863
uh,
you know,

129
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,270
dirt poor and the middle of nowhere,
Tennessee.

130
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:11,104
And I mean,
it would be redneck by basically any 

131
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,630
standard,
but I've never,

132
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,990
I've never subscribed to any of those 
sort of like a,

133
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,213
you know,
to me regressive ideologies and stuff 

134
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:26,710
that rednecks or stereotypical known for
and I didn't even,

135
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,780
it never even really all that weird to 
me.

136
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,973
Well,
I've known for awhile now that it's 

137
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:31,804
weird,
but I'm saying I never even had to 

138
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,023
really think about it.
That's just how I will make a conscious 

139
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:39,270
decision to be this,
you know,

140
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,200
Weirdo thing.

141
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,050
That's just how it worked out.
It just happens,

142
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,440
which is pretty much how I think,
how it works for everybody.

143
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,610
Um,
what really,

144
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:51,720
if you had to define what a redneck is,
what really is a redneck?

145
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,820
Well,
uh,

146
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,380
a lot of people for some reason assume 
that black,

147
00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:01,580
I'm like opposed to this guy for 
whatever reason.

148
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,110
But I actually have a lot of respect for
him.

149
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,050
But I think Jeff foxworthy defined it 
the best.

150
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,130
It involves the TV on another team.
So not yet.

151
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,270
Obviously you made a whole career out of
defining,

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,090
but he got assets.

153
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,880
I watched a lot of the way he ultimately
defined it was he said it's the glorious

154
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:18,714
absence of sophistication,
which I pretty well agree with and in 

155
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,820
our book that we wrote with my tour 
mates,

156
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:26,250
cory and drew,
we sort of added an addendum to that,

157
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:31,230
which was a not given a damn.
Generally speaking about how people feel

158
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,260
about you and the way you live your life
and whatever.

159
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:37,230
You know what I mean?
I'd do what I do and I liked what I like

160
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:39,360
and I don't give a damn what you think 
about it or not.

161
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,690
That coupled with the aforementioned 
lack of sophistication a is what makes a

162
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:46,650
redneck to me.

163
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,711
Yeah.
So interestingly,

164
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:48,544
it's not really.
Even though I think people will 

165
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:54,070
prescribe political leanings to redness 
in and of itself,

166
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:56,280
it's not really,
it's just the idea

167
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,950
of Sorta I do what I do.
Yeah.

168
00:08:58,951 --> 00:08:59,784
And want to be left alone and you know,
want to have a good time and all that 

169
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:04,740
kind of stuff.
And I honestly,

170
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,790
and I feel so I guess naive or ignorant 
or whatever saying this now,

171
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,624
but I genuinely didn't realize that to 
so many people it had those like 

172
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,940
political connotations or whatever.
Don't get me wrong,

173
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,560
I knew rednecks were stereotyped as 
being,

174
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,020
you know,
dumb or,

175
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,990
you know,
and Brad or racist or whatever.

176
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,824
I knew those things existed,
but I didn't know that to so many 

177
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,470
people.
Like,

178
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,310
part of the definition of the word 
redneck is a regressive,

179
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,534
racist,
homophobe who hates books and loves 

180
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
Jesus now.
You know what I mean?

181
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,620
Like,
that's right.

182
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,350
That's what it means to people.
And like nothing else,

183
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,393
I didn't realize that that existed at 
the level that it does until very 

184
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,290
recently.

185
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,123
Yeah.
And you've done a bunch of videos on 

186
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,714
youtube.
I think untangling some of that stuff 

187
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,210
and showing people.
Actually no,

188
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,820
that's not really all there is to this 
stuff.

189
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,870
But how poor did you grow up because 
you're white,

190
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:01,704
so I assume you get white privileged.
Did you not have a lot of white 

191
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,780
privilege growing up?
Big Whitey.

192
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,930
So I've actually had to get used to 
being white.

193
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,050
Uh,
as I've gotten into the middle class and

194
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,240
stuff in the past few years,
like that's a recent phenomenon for me.

195
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,340
I tell people that sometimes it's true 
and I know it sounds weird to people.

196
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,174
I never felt white growing up.
I don't mean to imply that I felt black 

197
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:25,951
or it's like,
oh,

198
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,420
you know what I mean,
that's not what I'm saying.

199
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,254
What I'm saying is my whole life when 
I've heard about white people and white 

200
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,510
people do,
I've caught a flight,

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,100
you know,
a Connecticut,

202
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,190
like very Yuppie Ish.

203
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,033
Like,
you know,

204
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,230
uh,
the landed gentry,

205
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,093
you know what I mean?
Like that's what I thought of when I 

206
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:45,990
heard of white people and I never,
we were white trash,

207
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,910
which is completely different,
you know what I mean?

208
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:50,920
Like I point out all the time,
I a good example,

209
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,700
I like to use this cops right?
And now don't get me wrong,

210
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,130
they're not shooting rednecks in the 
streets,

211
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:56,964
but it's a well established thing 
culturally that like cops and rednecks 

212
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,220
don't get along.
You know what I mean?

213
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:09,030
Every episode of cops they ever made in 
the ghetto or the trailer park,

214
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,253
you know what I mean?
So like there was definitely that 

215
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,650
feeling of like,
I don't know.

216
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,880
No,
I never felt privileged at all.

217
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:18,714
To answer your question.
I mean that's not the same as saying 

218
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:22,344
that I don't think white privilege like 
exist in a lot of arenas or whatever it 

219
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,520
does,
but I think if you're poor,

220
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,730
it doesn't really matter very much.

221
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,040
The good thing is though,
there's a good thing,

222
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:40,041
but if you manage to become not poor and
you're a white man than hey,

223
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,820
let's just isis.
Yeah.

224
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,800
So now I don't know.
I don't know how much you have,

225
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,870
but you're doing all right now you're on
tour,

226
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,140
you're doing good stuff.
You got some,

227
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,990
some TV things cooking.
Now you've,

228
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,420
you've gotten yourself out of white 
trash that I managed to escape,

229
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,823
which is not easy.
Now you can summer in the Hamptons and 

230
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:05,320
go to Connecticut on that level.
Well it's just at the beginning.

231
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,223
You know,
it's funny about that is mop my whole 

232
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:08,734
life.
I've had this thing where you mentioned 

233
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,760
like the Hamptons.
I've never been,

234
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,540
but like I promise you if I,
if me and you went to the hamptons right

235
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,240
now and we like pull it and we first get
in there and whatever,

236
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,000
I would immediately become very 
uncomfortable and it's,

237
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,390
and it's an uncommon,
it's a discomfort is in a,

238
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:29,200
like a,
I don't belong here kind of way,

239
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,940
but then there's also an element of 
like,

240
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,370
they know they're going to be able to 
tell,

241
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,010
like look at me and like who's who let 
the,

242
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,110
you know,
trailer trash in here,

243
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,840
whatever.

244
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,070
And I know that that's irrational,
but I really do like feel that I have.

245
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,180
Yeah.
So okay.

246
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:50,860
So you grow up white trash,
redneck community in Tennessee.

247
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,233
Give me some of the good stuff about 
that because you've talked about the 

248
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:56,110
good stuff in the values and that kind 
of stuff.

249
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,530
Well,
nature is a big one.

250
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,060
Like it's absolutely beautiful.
They are.

251
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,740
The best part about my home county is 
the,

252
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,840
like Dale Hollow,
like objectively awesome.

253
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,973
Like,
and so if you're in Danny outdoorsy 

254
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:12,160
stuff,
we've got that in spades.

255
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
Uh,
and yeah,

256
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,710
the sense of community.
Everybody knows everybody.

257
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:20,020
There's cons to that too,
obviously.

258
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,170
Obviously there's a lot of good things 
about it,

259
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:27,580
like people actually genuinely care 
about each other for the most part.

260
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,300
And also,
um,

261
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,380
the food.
I'm a huge fan of,

262
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,280
you know what I mean?
My,

263
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,060
my,
uh,

264
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,470
my grandmas,
both of them,

265
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,230
you know,
what most people would call soul food or

266
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,250
whatever I guess,
but just,

267
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,460
you know,
frying everything,

268
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,323
whatever else.

269
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,230
Not good for the arteries,
but good for the soul.

270
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,430
There you go.
Uh,

271
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,170
the music,
I think the south as far as regions go,

272
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:53,630
I think the south has the best music or 
produces the best music in the country,

273
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,010
maybe the world.
And um,

274
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,340
just the way I mentioned earlier a lot,
you know,

275
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,600
people like to have a good time,
you know what I mean?

276
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:06,601
Like people are not a very tightly wound
there.

277
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,580
You know what I mean?
It's a lot more like laid back and uh,

278
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,583
just like relaxed atmosphere and none of
that whole black stereotypical rat race 

279
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,050
stuff that happens.
You don't have any of that.

280
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,450
It's weird because sometimes I like 
neat.

281
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,050
There's a part of me that needs that or 
wants that obviously,

282
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:22,884
or I wouldn't be doing any of this,
but there's also a part of me that 

283
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,800
appreciates that more like pastoral type
thing in my hometown.

284
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,750
Sure.
What,

285
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,663
what about,
what about some of the political stuff 

286
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,770
when you add that to this?
So,

287
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:37,660
so far we got,
we got kind of the good stuff,

288
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,861
uh,
but you know,

289
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,694
the political stuff is where people 
start going out there and they're all 

290
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,500
backwards.
What's weird to me,

291
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,363
and I've talked to like people from 
places like I'm from about this a lot 

292
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,610
and they pretty well agree with it.
Like as a kid growing up,

293
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,493
people were mostly a political.
I'm not saying they were like Democrats 

294
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,740
or anything like that.
It's just like I don't,

295
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,540
they didn't really care.
It was like,

296
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,130
it seemed to be more of an attitude of 
like,

297
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:05,690
ah,
the hell with them all,

298
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,070
you know what I mean?
They're all full of shit.

299
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,220
I don't care about us,
you know?

300
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,054
And I mean,
and that was pretty much it and 

301
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,403
obviously that has changed,
but I've been gone from the town I grew 

302
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,124
up in for 12 years now and obviously a 
lot has changed since I left because 

303
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,003
it's not like that didn't exist,
but I was never aware of it being this 

304
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,844
big,
like curl cultural dividing factor or 

305
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,130
whatever.

306
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,963
Most people just didn't,
just didn't really talk about it or 

307
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,980
whatever as I was growing up,
uh,

308
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:35,300
but,
but then,

309
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,970
um,
my hometown is a good example,

310
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,860
the factory lift and went to Mexico 
after Nafta and all that,

311
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,420
you know,
and that the ripple effects of that were

312
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,254
sort of,
it took awhile for it to get as bad as 

313
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:49,130
it is now.
And I mean it's bad and has been bad for

314
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,870
years,
like over 13,

315
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:55,310
14 percent unemployment or whatever for 
over a decade now.

316
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,390
And that's just made a lot of people,
you know,

317
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,170
angry,
frustrated and upset and whatever else.

318
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,150
And that wasn't really the case when I 
was a kid or not on the level that it is

319
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:08,984
now.
And I think that's really what it's 

320
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,200
about.
They've gotten pissed,

321
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,393
you know,
because they're like way of life has 

322
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:16,544
been altered very negatively.
There's a lot of them and so I think 

323
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:20,744
that's where they've gotten so riled up 
and mad like they are now because I'm 

324
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:29,870
not trying to like they were this 
enlightened group because they weren't.

325
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,460
But when I was living there and growing 
up there just it,

326
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,940
they didn't have this like rage age they
have now.

327
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,940
You know what I mean?
It just wasn't as much of a thing.

328
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,770
It's so.
It's kind of weird to me too,

329
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:43,330
honestly.

330
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,163
Doesn't that say something interesting 
just about economics in general like 

331
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,283
that you grew up around this,
but there was a factory so people were 

332
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:52,060
working,
so even if things weren't perfect,

333
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:52,720
it's,
it's life,

334
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,640
it's life.
Like everybody else has been.

335
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:57,820
The jobs go away and then suddenly it 
actually changes everything.

336
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,960
Yeah.
Because I mean at any time,

337
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,020
obviously you're not unique to salon in 
my hometown,

338
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,190
this is the story I'm most places like 
that,

339
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,110
but so the jobs leave and then.
And then,

340
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:07,944
you know,
the pills come in or the math or 

341
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,194
whatever,
drug use substance abuse goes through 

342
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:13,490
the roof,
sodas,

343
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,000
you know,
crime like theft,

344
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,350
whatever,
things like that.

345
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:19,560
The businesses start shuttering the 
downtown areas like,

346
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,320
you know,
totally dilapidated and whatever else.

347
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,154
And it just brings everybody way down 
and it's just this like cycle of 

348
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,020
horrible.
She hit that,

349
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,380
you know.
And uh,

350
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,270
yeah.
And it really,

351
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,003
you know,
really pisses people off or get them 

352
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,010
going or both or whatever.

353
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,731
Yeah.
All right.

354
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:39,564
So before we go any further,
I feel like I have to get your liberal 

355
00:17:41,671 --> 00:17:42,504
credit too because I know we're going to
talk a little bit about what we both 

356
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,270
feel like it's happening on the left.
And I always say like,

357
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,750
guys,
I'm still a liberal.

358
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,940
I'm gay marriage,
I'm for legalizing marijuana.

359
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm pro choice.
I believe in state education.

360
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,150
Uh,
and,

361
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,983
and the list goes on and on.
I'm against the death penalty and for 

362
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,590
reforming prison system,
all,

363
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,780
all of that stuff.
These are liberal things.

364
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,440
So can you just lay out some liberal 
credits so that 10 minutes from now when

365
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:05,550
we get onto some other stuff,
people go,

366
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,384
wait a minute,
he really liberal Gimme Gimme some 

367
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:08,640
liberal stuff.

368
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,833
Uh,
I agree with literally everything you 

369
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:11,934
just named off.
I agree with all of those sort of a 

370
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,740
gateway.
Liberalism for me was,

371
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,603
uh,
equal rights for gay people because my 

372
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:24,990
uncle is gay and I've found that out 
when I was like eight or nine and a,

373
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,360
which is when I found that what gave and
it was,

374
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,223
you know what I mean?
I didn't even know anything about it 

375
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:29,904
before that.
And as soon as I learned what gay men I 

376
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,100
learned how your uncle,
he's gay.

377
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,061
Oh,
okay.

378
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:33,894
Whatever.
But that I started picking up on things 

379
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,370
before just went over my head that like,
you know,

380
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:42,450
these rednecks or whatever that I was 
grown up around that they were saying or

381
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,180
that the church was saying about gay 
people.

382
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,240
And I immediately didn't like it,
you know what I mean?

383
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,540
And um,
that sort of pushed me in that direction

384
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,374
I think.

385
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,423
And so that's always been a big thing 
for me because I take it a little 

386
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:58,080
personally because of my uncle whom I 
love dearly,

387
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,680
but then everything else you named from 
the prison reform very,

388
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:04,450
very against the war on drugs,
vr.

389
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,623
That's another thing that I feel very 
strongly about because it's also 

390
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,034
personal because my mom is a recovering 
drug addict who also was a drug dealer 

391
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,680
who went to prison.
So like,

392
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,250
I'm all that very personal to me too.
And I completely agree with it.

393
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,040
Uh,
it's like I'm a believer,

394
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,540
obviously it needs to be done the right 
way,

395
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,950
but I'm a believer in universal 
healthcare.

396
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,080
I also am very pro food stamps and 
welfare and things like that.

397
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,943
I've always felt like it would be baldly
hypocritical of me if I wasn't because 

398
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:36,870
like I survived on food stamps as a kid 
and you know what I mean,

399
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,704
like one food stamps,
I don't know what would've happened to 

400
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:39,900
me.

401
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,950
So,
you know,

402
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,033
I,
I feel like I'm living proof that those 

403
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,800
systems can work,
you know what I mean?

404
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,600
And yeah,
they get abused.

405
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,434
But that's just the reality.
I've asked my attitude towards that has 

406
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,870
always been,
but what is the alternative though?

407
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,170
Letting kids go hungry because I'm not 
willing to do that,

408
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,620
so we got to just put up with some of 
the abuses.

409
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,950
That's how I've looked at it.
So,

410
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,380
um,
yeah,

411
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:07,470
all the info.
I think eventually we're going to need a

412
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:08,304
universal basic income because I don't 
think there's going to be enough jobs 

413
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,850
that exist for the amount of people that
we have.

414
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,043
So I think it's just,
just the reality of where the world is 

415
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:20,460
going on and all that stuff is pretty 
liberal.

416
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,070
You're a liberal.
I believe it.

417
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,080
Now,
I believe.

418
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,073
Did you see this story this week about 
Amazon is going to have a supermarket 

419
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,580
with three employees because everything 
else,

420
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,200
you're just going to walk in,
scan your phone,

421
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,260
you take it,
you leave.

422
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,820
They uh,
I saw,

423
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:36,540
uh,
they,

424
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,180
I think they put it together.
It's like a promo video or something for

425
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:41,400
that on Youtube that I saw a couple of 
weeks ago.

426
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,593
Yeah.
You just

427
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,110
literally walk in,
just get whatever you want,

428
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:48,300
throw it in a bag and walk out because 
they've got scanners

429
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,941
or whatever.
Yeah,

430
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,380
I mean in that kind of thing is not 
going away.

431
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:54,040
One of the biggest ones,
I think everybody realizes at this point

432
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,600
how close we're getting to self driving 
vehicles.

433
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,690
I mean that's happening.
There's no doubt that that's happening.

434
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,050
And a truck drivers,
that's like the number one occupation in

435
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,970
something like 37 of the 50 states in 
this country or something like that.

436
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,833
The most popular job as a truck driver,
the minute that they have freight that 

437
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:22,060
can be fully automated reliably and 
safely,

438
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,923
they will and all of that will just go 
away overnight and that's going to 

439
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,990
happen in a lot of industries too and 
I'm saying,

440
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,650
what else are we going to do?
You know what I mean?

441
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,960
So that's just how.
I just think again,

442
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:35,794
that's the reality of it is take 
something like a universal basic income 

443
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,090
or you think that that would be the 
answer more than basically retraining an

444
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:43,924
entire population to either fix 
computers or the robots or the drones 

445
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:49,580
or,
or any of that.

446
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,470
So that may be a bridge too far,
but I,

447
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,440
I,
yeah,

448
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,430
I think so.
Yeah.

449
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,264
So you're not going to take a truck 
driver and have them fixed and groans 

450
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,521
just as.
No,

451
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:59,830
I'm not.
And also I think even if you tried to do

452
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:00,664
that,
no matter how many drop drones there 

453
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,040
are,
I mean if you think about,

454
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,060
let's say like every one robot replaces 
one person in a job capacity,

455
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,920
which is not,
that's not true anymore way,

456
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,851
way more,
but let's.

457
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:13,684
Even if it is that I would think that a 
maintenance person for that robot would 

458
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:23,890
also take care of 30 other robots.
You know what I mean?

459
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:25,720
Like it's not going to be broken down 
all the time.

460
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,913
You understand what I'm saying?
So you can take the one guy that 

461
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:30,070
replaces and he's going to fix robots 
now.

462
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:31,750
Well,
he's not going to just fix the one robot

463
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,240
that took his job,
he's going to fix 40 robots.

464
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,430
So and,
and again,

465
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,940
the reality is one robot replaces 15 
people or whatever.

466
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,130
When you just follow that,
you know,

467
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,330
that logic down,
it just doesn't track for me.

468
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:50,440
Even if you wanted to do that retraining
of people or whatever else,

469
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,110
the numbers just don't add up to me.
But I mean I'm not,

470
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,150
I'm not an economist.
I'm a comedian.

471
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,740
I don't know what the hell I'm talking 
about.

472
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,820
It's pretty good in the scheme of 
economic sense.

473
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:01,654
I understand that.
It's weird to be alive at the time when 

474
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,820
we know robots are going to replace us,
you know,

475
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,380
like where it's not science fiction 
anymore.

476
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:09,640
Now it's like,
Oh yeah,

477
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,563
20 years from now we're all,
when they started to talk show hosts 

478
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,563
Comedians,
we're all going to be replaced by 

479
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:15,100
robots.
Yeah.

480
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,880
And in 20 years er might be list,
you know,

481
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,163
people in San Francisco will be getting 
super pissed at Alabama for having like 

482
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,450
anti robot laws like that.

483
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,283
You know what I mean?
Alabama was going to be discriminating 

484
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:29,344
against a robot.
Americans or whatever will becoming an 

485
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,520
episode of Futurama.
Yeah,

486
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,383
it's,
yeah,

487
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,290
it's wild.
So I want to back up for a second.

488
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,124
So your uncle that you mentioned,
and I've heard you talk about how he 

489
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,000
influenced your sort of awakening to 
this stuff,

490
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,280
so people might find that interesting 
that there,

491
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,180
there was a gay man,
you know,

492
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,840
let's say 15 years ago or so in the 
south that existed.

493
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,320
How is life for him?
I,

494
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,173
I know that sounds sort of ridiculous,
but I think people actually don't 

495
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,720
understand that you're right.
But even before gay marriage,

496
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,730
gay people existed.
Lived lives,

497
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,010
some good,
some bad,

498
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,300
you know,
just like everybody else.

499
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,690
Well,
so when I was a kid,

500
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,310
my uncle lived in Nashville and the 
thing,

501
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,740
another thing a lot of people don't 
realize is that for the most part,

502
00:24:14,741 --> 00:24:16,700
in a lot of ways,
cities are cities,

503
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:17,381
whether it,
you know,

504
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:18,770
Birmingham,
Alabama,

505
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,690
it's still a city,
which means there's still plenty of like

506
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,500
liberal ideals and whatever else there.

507
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,850
And so like he lived in Nashville,
which is totally different,

508
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,773
totally different than Salana,
but he came back a lot and then when I 

509
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:31,514
was in high school from then on,
he did live in salina and now I've 

510
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:38,930
thought before and after,
now that I'm an adult,

511
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,823
that may be,
there's a good possibility that he did 

512
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:45,440
go through a lot of shitty things,
shitty treatment,

513
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,283
whatever else.
But like he didn't tell me about it 

514
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:49,640
because I was a kid and he doesn't,
you know what I mean.

515
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,474
And I had enough bad shit going on.
He didn't want to burden me with it or 

516
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:56,150
whatever.
And that's a very good possibility.

517
00:24:56,151 --> 00:25:00,650
But so far as I'm aware,
he never faced any.

518
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:03,880
Like he definitely never gotten beat up.
He never got like,

519
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,030
you know,
he had a deli,

520
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:05,864
they're in town for awhile or whatever 
else and he never got like a brick 

521
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,470
thrown through the window or nothing 
like that.

522
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,930
And then,
um,

523
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,670
he's not the only gay guy in the town 
either.

524
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:14,810
In fact,
there was a guy,

525
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,350
and I don't know if there's a local 
businessman who is a gay guy.

526
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,790
And when,
um,

527
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,680
when I was in high school,
he used to,

528
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,930
he had a lot of money,
especially for that area.

529
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,823
And so when we were in high school,
he'd come to high school ball games and 

530
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Celina Tennessee with like two little,
like a Cuban boy toys.

531
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,350
Seriously,
there are a lot of Catholic boy,

532
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,040
Tennessee.
I don't know where he got them.

533
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,010
That's what I'm saying.
Nobody did.

534
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,570
But what I mean is like,
I mean,

535
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:42,880
he flaunted it.
Yeah.

536
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,730
And nothing ever happened to him either.
Everybody was just Kinda like,

537
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:48,050
oh,
that's Steve,

538
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,370
you know,
how Steve Is,

539
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,560
you know what I mean?
And that was like what happened with the

540
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:52,940
Cubans that,
well,

541
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,650
you know,
he was done with them.

542
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,633
I went back or whatever he got and then 
it got to a Ukrainian boy toys or 

543
00:25:59,211 --> 00:25:59,930
whatever.
I don't know.

544
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,511
But.
Right,

545
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:01,430
right.
Yeah.

546
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,410
Um,
and that's,

547
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,300
I didn't,
again at the time,

548
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,134
I didn't realize how insane that would 
probably be to a lot of people to know 

549
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,004
that that had happened there and they 
didn't get tarred and feathered or 

550
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:16,280
whatever,
that it was just a thing that people.

551
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:17,160
I mean,
you know,

552
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:18,800
that people were definitely like,
Oh God,

553
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:20,450
here he goes again.
You know what I mean?

554
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,493
But he's in.
That was like the extent of it and 

555
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:28,250
that's still not okay to be disgusted by
gay people obviously,

556
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,084
but like,
it never translated to any kind of like 

557
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,810
violence or like,
you know,

558
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,360
get the hell out of our town types.
I never saw anything like that,

559
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,600
but mostly just don't talk about it,
you know what I mean?

560
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,830
You know,
weird way though.

561
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,310
That actually

562
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,450
is okay.
Right.

563
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:46,284
Because it's like you actually are 
allowed to be disgusted by somebody or 

564
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,060
be racist or b.
You know what I mean?

565
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,410
Like you can be like,
yeah,

566
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,610
we don't like it.
You know,

567
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,444
you shouldn't dislike someone because of
the color of their skin or their 

568
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,204
secretary.
But at the end of the day you're saying 

569
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,000
it's a lot of live and let live people 
there.

570
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,590
So even if they saw it,
they didn't like it.

571
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,770
As long as you're not hurting somebody,
then what are you gonna do?

572
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,530
I can remember once when I was a kid at 
some,

573
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:09,330
like,
like practice or something.

574
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:13,140
Some older kid was giving me shit 
because my uncle was gay or whatever,

575
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:16,920
which wasn't a rare thing and after it's
over some,

576
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,783
this guy who I still like,
he's one of the most outwardly 

577
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:24,230
stereotypical redneck people.
You couldn't imagine that.

578
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:27,840
I mean he is,
he's openly redneck type guy,

579
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:29,700
right?
Like I mean as red as it gets,

580
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:32,400
especially in this place.
And like he came up to me afterwards,

581
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,250
you know,
and it was like,

582
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,200
he was like,
I,

583
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,790
your uncle's good,
my in tray,

584
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,930
you know,
don't let them get whatever.

585
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,630
Like that kind of thing.
And that's what I'm saying.

586
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,240
There was a lot of that too.
Like,

587
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,320
I don't know,
it's way,

588
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:45,870
way more complicated than people 
realize,

589
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,990
like it's not just this but,
but then I meet people,

590
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:49,824
I meet people on the road,
I've got a lot of gay fans and so like 

591
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:53,814
I,
I meet gay people in like Portland or 

592
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:59,190
wherever who grew up in Alabama,
you know what I mean?

593
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,530
And there they just have just horror 
stories,

594
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,640
you know what I mean?
So like,

595
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,160
and I know they're not lying.
I know that's the reality.

596
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,380
So again,
it's complicated,

597
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,810
you know,

598
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,780
so you're telling me your personal 
experience can blanket the entire thing.

599
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,090
I can't believe it.
That's crazy.

600
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,040
My anecdotal experience,
it's not as bad as people think it is,

601
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,840
but there's still a lot of room for 
improvement.

602
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,020
Where does the religion piece get mixed 
in that?

603
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:25,600
Because I think a lot of the sort of the
coast,

604
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:26,434
you know,
the New York la sort of hatred or 

605
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:33,250
mocking of rednecks and southern culture
is because of the religious attachment,

606
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:34,084
particularly Christianity because it's 
the easiest thing to attack all the 

607
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:36,994
time.
How much of that stuff is associated 

608
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:39,790
with religion do you think?

609
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,880
Couple years ago I would've told you 
just about every single bit of it.

610
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,923
I used to,
when people ask me how I became a 

611
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:47,264
liberal redneck or whatever,
I would talk about my uncle like I 

612
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:50,864
already did,
but the effect that that had was I 

613
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:54,404
stopped going to church because of all 
the homophobic shit they were spouting 

614
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,270
or whatever.
And I was like,

615
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,380
well to hell with that,
you know,

616
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:03,530
like why would I take Jesus aside over 
my uncle?

617
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:05,660
You know what I mean?
I never even emailed Jesus,

618
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,200
you know what I mean,
like I'm not going to take his.

619
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,780
So I left the church and that and so 
that's what I always thought.

620
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,123
That's what I always attributed a lot of
that too and I blame the church for a 

621
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:16,844
lot of these attitudes in the past.
I've really been enlightened a lot 

622
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:24,690
myself in the past couple of years with 
the er,

623
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,980
especially the past year being on tour 
and talking to so many people in so many

624
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,940
places and my two tour mates and 
coauthors,

625
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,783
cory and drew,
they grew up heavily in the church and 

626
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:36,560
ultimately left it with checks out.

627
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,950
After talking to them and talking to so 
many other people at shows and stuff.

628
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,730
I don't think it's.
It's that simple.

629
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,270
I think that that has a lot to do with 
it a whole lot to do with it,

630
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,550
but I used to buy.
I used to be like,

631
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:50,380
if there was no.
If we weren't the Bible belt,

632
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,910
if you took all the Jesus out of the 
south,

633
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:54,910
it'd be totally fine.
That's not true.

634
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,803
It's just not because of the economic 
factors and you still have the whole 

635
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,640
historical factors and racial factors 
and all that kind of stuff that wouldn't

636
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:06,130
go away just because you got rid of 
Jesus.

637
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:08,630
But uh,
so I mean it's,

638
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,210
it definitely has a lot to do with it 
though,

639
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:11,044
for sure,
particularly when it comes to gay 

640
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:14,194
rights,
gay people and Muslims and the way they 

641
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:20,830
feel about those two groups I still 
think is mostly Jesus' fault.

642
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
So that's,
that's Jesus right there.

643
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:27,710
Even though Jesus probably would have 
been around a lot of Muslims.

644
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,560
It was the Middle East and uh,

645
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,211
yeah.
Well,

646
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,940
I'm not talking about the actual Jesus.
I'm talking about,

647
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,030
you know,
Jesus the first American.

648
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,620
Right,
right,

649
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,270
right.

650
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,900
Who wrote to Texas on a train with the 
machine gunners saying that Jesus,

651
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,133
speaking of Jesus.
So tell me about your come to Jesus 

652
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,400
moment when you said,
okay,

653
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,780
I am a liberal.
Like when,

654
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,030
so you had your uncle,
you had this sort of awakening,

655
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:49,990
but when were you like,

656
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,590
this is the political stuff that I 
believe in.

657
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,500
Did you have to actually sort of come 
out to people that you knew?

658
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,210
Well,
again,

659
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,550
as I mentioned briefly earlier that like
I never,

660
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,510
I never realized it was weird until 
probably,

661
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,813
I mean probably either late high school 
or college was when I realized how 

662
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,910
different it was.
Like I never thought much about the fact

663
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,790
that I disagreed with certain people 
about certain things,

664
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,800
but the biggest factor was again,
like I said,

665
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:18,360
people just didn't really talk about 
that stuff.

666
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:21,120
So it never really got,
you know,

667
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,420
tossed around for me to realize,
Oh man,

668
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,263
we're on completely different pages.
The first time that I can remember 

669
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:31,440
really thinking that outside of just 
the,

670
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,983
the,
you know,

671
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,893
gay rights thing,
which I just chalked up as a religious 

672
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:36,864
thing.
Not a political thing was in high 

673
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:39,614
school.

674
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,493
In our English class we would have 
debates because we didn't have a debate 

675
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,913
team or debate class or nothing.
We'd have debates like once every other 

676
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:49,200
week and one time in debate class thing 
was teacher was like,

677
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,570
okay,
so it's like 2000,

678
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:53,520
two or three.
Everybody.

679
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,200
Everybody thinks we should not go to 
war.

680
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,480
Everybody thinks we should go to war 
with Iraq,

681
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,050
raise your hand and it's about half the 
students or whatever.

682
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:04,920
And she was like,
okay,

683
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:07,460
everybody thinks that we shouldn't go 
over that.

684
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,310
Right.
Raise your hand.

685
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:11,260
And it was literally just me.
Like I was the only thing again,

686
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:12,600
I threw my hand up without even 
thinking.

687
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:12,961
I was like,
yeah,

688
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:13,794
of course.
But I looked around and I was the only 

689
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:18,630
one and then that other half of the 
crowd where,

690
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,500
you know,
she said,

691
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:20,334
okay,
now if you just don't know or don't 

692
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:22,260
care,
raise your hand.

693
00:32:22,261 --> 00:32:24,000
And that was the other half of the 
class.

694
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:24,871
She was like,
okay,

695
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,550
everybody doesn't care.
You're with trey,

696
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,430
everybody else here on this side or 
whatever.

697
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,400
But

698
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,290
that's a pretty enlightened teacher 
given you the,

699
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,440
all the people that didn't really care,
giving it to the piece,

700
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,293
get these guy instead of the.
Well it ended up just being me against 

701
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,100
all of them,
which I was

702
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,260
fine with.
But um,

703
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,770
but that was probably the first time 
that I sort of had that,

704
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:46,604
as you said,
come to Jesus moment where I realized 

705
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:52,190
that like I wasn't like most of the 
people that I was surrounded by.

706
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,290
Yeah.
When did you get into standup?

707
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,920
So wanted to be a standup since I was 
12.

708
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,983
I'm Chris Rock's bigger and blacker came
out and watched it with my dad and 

709
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,150
that's what I was like,
I want to do that.

710
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,080
But it was never a question of me like 
going to college or not.

711
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,550
Like with my dad,
my grandpa,

712
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:11,271
everybody else.
It's like,

713
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:12,890
you know,
I was going to go to college,

714
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,680
I going to be the first one from my 
family to graduate from college,

715
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,680
whatever else.
Like it was a big thing and so I did and

716
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm glad I did.
I don't regret it at all.

717
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,680
But I focused on that for awhile.
And then by the time I got,

718
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,514
I went to business school and by the 
time I got out I was 24 and that's when 

719
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:30,614
I was like,
okay,

720
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,850
if I'm ever going to do comedy at all,
it needs to be nail.

721
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,730
Uh,
and so that's when I started,

722
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,710
when I was 24,
six and a half years ago.

723
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,140
God,
you're a success because if you were the

724
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:39,974
first family member to go to college and
business school and then you became a 

725
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,540
failed comedian man,
that,

726
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,540
that would be the worst day possible.

727
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,500
Oh,
it's funny.

728
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:51,140
My Dad,
my dad was always cool with it.

729
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,093
My Dad,
because my dad was mostly cool with 

730
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:54,410
everything,
you know what I mean?

731
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,244
But my dad would,
when I'd tell him I wanted to be a 

732
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,400
comedian or be in Showbiz,
whatever,

733
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:00,580
he'd be like,
you know what I mean?

734
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,893
But outside of him though,
every other authority figure in my life 

735
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:09,080
from my grandfather's two guidance 
counselors,

736
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:09,970
teachers,
whatever,

737
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,950
because I always made really good grades
and they would tell me like,

738
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,320
you know,
you can,

739
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:19,970
you have an opportunity to get out of 
here and you can do whatever you want.

740
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,370
You can be a lawyer,
you can be a doctor,

741
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,660
you know,
all this stuff.

742
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,494
And I would,
if I told them I think I want to be a 

743
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,560
comedian,
they'd be like,

744
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,170
no,
no,

745
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,850
not that,
don't do that,

746
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,781
you know,
like,

747
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,260
you're gonna have.
Yeah,

748
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,340
or whatever.
Like,

749
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,173
you got to do this.
That was the universal response to that 

750
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,690
was like,
wow,

751
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,524
he's gonna.
He's gonna waste it all trying to be a 

752
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:47,360
comedian or is what I got a lot of.
But yeah,

753
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,313
it's working out.

754
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,900
Yeah,
it is working.

755
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:50,950
So now you're in La

756
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,280
[inaudible].
How's La Treatment?

757
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,720
Has their lab

758
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,570
for a redneck?
Well,

759
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,650
it's fun for me.
Uh,

760
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,290
I don't mind it,
you know,

761
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,850
I'm,
I'm doing fine with it.

762
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:02,684
But,
uh,

763
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,003
I do.
I think it's weird for people around me 

764
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,093
a lot.
I definitely get a lot of like a 

765
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,240
sideways glances and stuff like that at 
times,

766
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:16,310
like if I got,
I've got two little boys so I've got all

767
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,213
my boys at the park or something and I'm
yelling at them because they're doing 

768
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:22,700
something they shouldn't be doing,
you know what I mean?

769
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:25,180
But I'm yelling at a child and this like
I ain't got damaged.

770
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,680
I mean with like a trucker hat on and 
whatever else.

771
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:29,510
And then I noticed that like,
oh,

772
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:31,360
they stopped doing couple's yoga over 
there,

773
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,273
you know what I mean?
Like this is off putting to people and 

774
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:36,870
just

775
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,100
hearing the southern drawl.

776
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,950
I mean we just don't hear it here.
Forgetting whether you like it or not.

777
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,900
Again,
you just simply don't hear it.

778
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,990
So yes,
I get a lot of like,

779
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,530
you know,
that Kinda thing.

780
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,480
But I mean I think it's funny,
you know,

781
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,710
it's fine.
I don't mind it.

782
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,413
So when I was watching a bunch of your 
youtube videos in the last couple of 

783
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,080
days,
I thought wow,

784
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:58,500
here is a liberal that I agree with on 
so much.

785
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,550
And it's funny,
I told you before,

786
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,150
you know,
um,

787
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,983
I was born in Brooklyn,
I lived my whole life in New York City 

788
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,414
until I moved out to la.
So the only two places I ever lived are 

789
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:06,784
New York and La.
And then I watch your stuff and I find 

790
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:09,354
this,
this Tennessee red neck who's a liberal 

791
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:13,650
who I'm going,
this guy gets what?

792
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,603
Liberalism is a,
what do you sense about the general 

793
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:20,430
state of liberalism because it's become 
a,

794
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,780
like a hot button word that can be used 
I guess a little bit in a positive way,

795
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:27,810
but almost at all levels now.
It's being used in a negative way.

796
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,920
Well,
yeah,

797
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,600
from my allies,
even from my liberal allies,

798
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,530
I think it's starting to.

799
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,540
I think it's to me in a lot of ways,
liberalism has jumped the shark.

800
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:41,983
Like it's just,
I've just went too far with so many 

801
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:45,314
things and uh,
me and you were talking off air earlier 

802
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:51,560
about the fact that like where I'm from,
right?

803
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,693
And we've already kind of touched on it,
but where I'm from and where I've spent 

804
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:56,630
most of my life,
I'm like,

805
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,160
I'm Karl Marx,
man.

806
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,510
I'm like,
I'm as far left as it gets.

807
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,500
They're out here in California.
I'm a,

808
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,630
you know,
a centrist or whatever,

809
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:11,780
probably because that's just how much 
further.

810
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:13,400
And it's true on both sides though,
is the thing.

811
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:14,234
It's like with the tea party and 
whatever else and how it politically 

812
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:19,220
we've been pushed to the polls,
you know,

813
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,503
the opposite extremes.
And it's absolutely true on the left 

814
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:23,744
too.
And I don't really know what has 

815
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:27,854
happened to cause that.
I think it's just like maybe the 

816
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,470
cultural divide between the two and just
like,

817
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,910
you know,
going back and forth and sort of pushing

818
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:35,744
each other.
The distaste that each side has for the 

819
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:44,051
other side just pushes them as far as 
much further away from the opposition is

820
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,480
they can go or something.
There.

821
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:48,530
Again,
I'm just a comedian.

822
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:50,450
I'm pulling that out of my ass.
But like,

823
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,040
that's,
you know what I,

824
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,660
something like that.

825
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,543
I guess we'll look all of our own 
personal experiences are what make the 

826
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,350
reality of it.
Right.

827
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,840
So I mean that's exactly.
I've been talking about for a long time.

828
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,960
I've watched the left go off this way.
I've watched it,

829
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:04,794
right.
Go off this way.

830
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm a firm believer that there's huge 
spot right now for,

831
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,053
for people somewhere in the middle.
It's funny because I have a lot of 

832
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:15,331
libertarians on and I now find much more
in common as a liberal with libertarians

833
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,570
that I do with leftist.
So what do,

834
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,680
what do we do with that as good liberals
that want to bring the left?

835
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,880
Well,
I can't ever get.

836
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,270
My thing is like uh,
economically might not across the board,

837
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:32,030
but in most ways economically,
like libertarianism is not familiar.

838
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,560
There's a lot of the shit that they 
subscribe to that I don't at all.

839
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,710
So you went from being a firm bay,
so you want more of a state,

840
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:42,820
you see more utility for estate and 
taxes.

841
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,383
I think.
I genuinely think that it's necessary 

842
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,560
now,
don't get me wrong.

843
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,660
A lot of bloat,
like,

844
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,030
and it's,
it's at way out of hand and doesn't need

845
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,864
to be reined in some.
I know that it's also a little personal 

846
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:55,474
to me because I said I went to business 
school so I wasn't waiting tables doing 

847
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,943
moonlighting as a comedian.
I worked for the US Department of 

848
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,883
Energy.
That was my day job when I was like 

849
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,460
getting into comedy.
And so,

850
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:10,030
I mean,
I know firsthand about like the bloat of

851
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:10,864
the federal government and the and the 
inefficiencies of our bureaucracy and 

852
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,000
all that and it needs to be cleaned up.

853
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,643
But I think it's necessary though that 
you have a government that sort of 

854
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,960
regulates and polices,
uh,

855
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,220
some of these other systems,
particularly basically my.

856
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:33,010
And I just don't trust rich people to do
what's right for everybody else.

857
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,143
I never have.
And I don't think I ever will because 

858
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,723
that's just human nature.
I think they're going to do a trap for 

859
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,680
them and the people live in their own 
self interest,

860
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,050
not across the board,
but by and large.

861
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:44,884
And so I think we need systems in place 
to sort of keep that from happening if 

862
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:49,220
possible.
Yeah.

863
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,123
Isn't that the catch 22 also though,
because now the government is run by 

864
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:54,510
rich people too and capitalism and all.
Well,

865
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,503
so it's like we either have business 
rich people doing it or political rich 

866
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,240
people and we're,
we're,

867
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,430
we're all kind of caught.
Well,

868
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,273
that's,
that's the thing is I'm a big believer 

869
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:03,760
in that,
you know,

870
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,123
that we live in a plutocracy and that's 
a big problem for me because of 

871
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,130
everything I just said.
But that is the reality of it.

872
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:12,851
I do think,
yes,

873
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:14,830
the rich people run the government or 
whatever and that,

874
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,350
you know,
that's a damn shame.

875
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,433
But like I'm saying philosophically,
I do think there's a definite need for 

876
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:25,430
government.
Um,

877
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,610
I think you have to have it.
But,

878
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:30,430
uh,
but socially though,

879
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,910
and in a lot of other white 
libertarians,

880
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,680
I'm absolutely more in line with them on
like,

881
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,260
I mean,
I,

882
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,630
I'm pro legalization of a really just 
about any drug,

883
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,720
to be honest with you.
And uh,

884
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,330
I'm also pro gun,
uh,

885
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,400
growing up that that's the,
that's the least liberal thing about me,

886
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,234
but it's a,
to me it's a freedom thing and I'd 

887
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,193
actually use a liberal thing,
but it's not a leftist that's the 

888
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:56,710
difference between liberal to you can 
protect yourself.

889
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:58,190
That is a liberal,
right?

890
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,370
I've actually,
I've never bought a gun.

891
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I own 17 guns because I inherited my 
grandfather's arsenal right now.

892
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,643
And so,
but I'm saying in the south where I'm 

893
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:14,701
from that super common and so like,
it's not weird to me.

894
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,740
It's not like dangerous.
Like why would you want to own a gun?

895
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,050
I'm just like,
why wouldn't you want gun?

896
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,463
Like I,
I'm all for background checks and all 

897
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,610
that kind of stuff.
The gun show loopholes and all that need

898
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:27,370
to be closed.
I'm all for all that.

899
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,930
But just generally speaking,
I got no problem with guns and um,

900
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,810
you know,
pro,

901
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,400
I'm very,
I'm a believer in freedom,

902
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,020
real freedom.
You know what I mean?

903
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,530
That's the way I've always looked at a 
gay rights to,

904
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,393
you know what I mean?
Like he thought in the privacy of your 

905
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,081
own home,
bedroom,

906
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,914
whatever else.
Go wild long as you're not hurting 

907
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:45,950
anybody else who gives a shit.

908
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,170
Yeah.
So it's across the board for me.

909
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,490
Yeah,
you're a classical liberal,

910
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:51,060
but I guess for a,
uh,

911
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,240
a tour thing,

912
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,160
classical liberal,
you just dropped the class,

913
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,220
right?
Like,

914
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,600
well.
And also that,

915
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,780
and I mean I'm aware of the distinction 
again philosophically,

916
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,760
but my whole life,
like in the south or in the rural south,

917
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:07,630
especially like a liberal's liberal 
mind,

918
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,683
you know what I mean?
You're either a liberal or you're not 

919
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,370
like classical versus progressive 
liberal,

920
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:15,420
whatever it.
I don't know.

921
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,330
That shit matters where I'm from.
You know what I mean?

922
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:21,660
So like,
I never thought about it in those terms,

923
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,130
but.
But yes,

924
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:23,731
though,
I mean,

925
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:24,564
yeah,
you're right.

926
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,620
It's funny.
I definitely,

927
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:26,690
um,
yeah,

928
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,500
I,
I gotta get my show to,

929
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,733
to Tennessee then because that's what 
I've been trying to do is show people 

930
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:36,010
the difference between real liberalism 
and what and what is happening.

931
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,023
Oh,
they definitely need that in the south 

932
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:39,660
because that's the.
I mean,

933
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,520
right.
If they,

934
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,093
well that's the whole,
that's a big thing in the south for a 

935
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:45,690
long time as people asked,
well,

936
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,460
why did they vote against their self 
interest,

937
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:47,871
you know,
what I mean,

938
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:48,840
or whatever else.
And it's like,

939
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:49,674
well,
because they don't think that you 

940
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:51,990
reflect their self interest,
you know what I mean?

941
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:55,260
And I think arguably a lot of liberal 
policies do,

942
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,350
but all they know about liberals is this
like,

943
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:02,150
you know,
elitist,

944
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,220
a fru,
fru ovary,

945
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,170
overly pc,
like the,

946
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:07,240
you know,
um,

947
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,810
that whole thing is all that they're 
aware of when it comes to liberals and,

948
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,030
and it's like a total nonstarter for 
most of them.

949
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,710
Is that the funny thing about trump and 
people in the south,

950
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:21,780
it's like they took really a New York,
really,

951
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,080
a New York Democrat.
He's a big government.

952
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,640
It's very clear.
He's a big government guy.

953
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:27,200
He's happy to do all these executive 
orders,

954
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:28,034
right?
A rich guy and elitist all of those 

955
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:30,351
things.
Now I get it.

956
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:33,200
He was out of the system.
He was out of the political system.

957
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,920
So he's thought of as an outsider,
but they,

958
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,531
oh,
he's eight.

959
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:36,530
You know,
he's not religious,

960
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:39,530
there's no reason to believe that he 
believes in Christianity.

961
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:40,364
The one time he sweat during the whole 
campaign was that he went to Liberty 

962
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,230
University and I had to repeat the 
Corinthians or whatever.

963
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,240
So it's like,
is that the irony with them?

964
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:48,310
It's like,
Oh yeah,

965
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,510
they love him.
And then

966
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,170
I,
I've actually,

967
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,004
I've thought,
and I've talked a lot about this exact 

968
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:58,380
thing because I in this,
I feel so naive about this now,

969
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:02,310
but like I was genuinely stunned when 
Donald trump actually won.

970
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,173
I knew that there was,
and I shouldn't have been because I'm 

971
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:09,060
from where he won.
If anybody I should have been now.

972
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,250
I was like cautioning people that all 
the time like,

973
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:12,840
look,
there's something real here.

974
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,703
But at the end of the day I didn't think
it would happen and I was shocked and 

975
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:19,350
maybe the biggest reason is,
and I felt this way throughout his whole

976
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,184
campaign.
I was looking around like what is going 

977
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:23,660
on?
Because I,

978
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,300
I,
this is not an assumption or a theory.

979
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:32,301
I promise you I know this to be true.
If could go back in time,

980
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,190
like five,
six years ago,

981
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,213
whenever it was before he first went 
after Obama for being an African Muslim 

982
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:40,524
or whatever.

983
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:45,810
If we could go back to pre that and you 
polled rednecks,

984
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,680
rural working class Americans,
what do you think about Donald Trump?

985
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:51,340
Because Donald Trump's been famous for 
decades.

986
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,910
So what do you think about Donald Trump?
The dude,

987
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,600
it would have been almost universally 
negative.

988
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,523
I promise you.
They would have hated everything up and 

989
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:01,714
they did hate everything about him until
he got into all this political shit and 

990
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,090
started pandering to them that they were
like,

991
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,970
he's a,
he's an,

992
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:08,883
an,
a latest silver spoon up is I asked 

993
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,420
Yankee who thinks he's better than 
everybody and thanks,

994
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,370
he's better and thinks he knows 
everything.

995
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:16,380
And he's like I said,
big city Democrat,

996
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,214
whatever,
like,

997
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,370
you know,
um,

998
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,850
they would have hated everything about 
him.

999
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,570
And so the whole time I was,
you know,

1000
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,890
him throughout his entire rise,
I was looking around like,

1001
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,460
really?
This dude really?

1002
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,593
And what that says to me,
or what I've told myself anyway to make 

1003
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:34,494
sense of it,
is that just goes to show how desperate 

1004
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:42,141
they were for a champion of any kind of 
like they were so desperate for that,

1005
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,340
that even Donald Trump was good enough 
for them to fill that bill.

1006
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:47,990
You know what I mean?

1007
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,810
Do you think that's legit in a way?
Because I,

1008
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:51,630
I get that from a lot of people.
I mean I get mail my,

1009
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,503
my audiences all over the place from,
from far left people to anarchists to 

1010
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,383
everything everywhere.
But I get a lot of that people just 

1011
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:58,880
saying,
you know what,

1012
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,150
I just the system,
it was just,

1013
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:04,190
I've had it.
I just had it.

1014
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,490
You think that's a legit reason to vote 
for someone that you may have nothing in

1015
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:10,040
common with it you may think is a snake 
oil salesman.

1016
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:12,050
Is that sometimes the right way to do 
it?

1017
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,470
Not to me,
no,

1018
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,304
I've never agreed with that.
I've heard a lot of that to have a lot 

1019
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:16,944
of people.
So when I was talking about is a little 

1020
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,284
bit different when you talk about like 
people in like my hometown where you 

1021
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:22,494
know,
they bind Nafta and they blamed the 

1022
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,950
Clintons and whatever else for the 
factory leaving and all this.

1023
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,660
It's more than just,
oh,

1024
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:32,160
he's shaking the system up it.
He was making promises directly to them.

1025
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:32,994
I'm going to bring your job back and 
restore your livelihood and all this 

1026
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:35,784
stuff in that connected with people and 
I don't think they thought he was a 

1027
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:40,740
snake oil salesman or even if deep down 
maybe they did a little bit.

1028
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,590
I think they lied to themselves and say,
and you know,

1029
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,570
deluded themselves into believing he 
wasn't.

1030
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,030
But I've also encountered a lot of 
people who are,

1031
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:49,100
like you just said,
they're like,

1032
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,510
you know,
what will shake things up.

1033
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:53,250
That's what we need this guy.
Something different.

1034
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:55,530
Whenever we nailed this system is 
broken,

1035
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,250
let's mix it up a little bit.
And I've never been on board with that.

1036
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,620
Like the general premise of it.
Yeah.

1037
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:02,460
All right.
Okay.

1038
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,360
I kinda am with you.
But in this iteration,

1039
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:09,240
really like,
this is how you want to manifest that is

1040
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,530
through Donald Trump,
like,

1041
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,693
Nah man,
give me the system for for eight more 

1042
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:14,791
years,
whatever,

1043
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,580
and then let's get a different maverick 
in there.

1044
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,960
Isn't this guy,
you know,

1045
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,420
I've never agreed with that.

1046
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,530
Yeah.
Do you think we just sort of forget that

1047
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:24,364
all of us forgetting what our political 
allegiance is that we all kind of just 

1048
00:47:26,561 --> 00:47:28,870
forget how actually good at here is 
here.

1049
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,700
Not to say that there aren't problems.
Of course,

1050
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,950
yes,
but,

1051
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,750
but that it's pretty damn good

1052
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,763
man.
I've,

1053
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,510
I've actually been trying to work on a 
bit about that for a long time now about

1054
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,853
basically that about things are better 
here now than they've been for almost 

1055
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,560
any group of people you can name ever 
before.

1056
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,660
And that's even true for like,
you know,

1057
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,010
rural white people except things were 
better for them and like,

1058
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,330
you know,
a couple decades ago.

1059
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:03,340
But I'm saying if you go back further 
than that,

1060
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,240
right.
It wasn't so great.

1061
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,730
It was absolutely horrible.
They were sharecroppers,

1062
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:07,743
you know what I mean?
So they had a little window of like 

1063
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:10,120
prosperity,
there were small town,

1064
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:10,954
America was a real thing and 
industrialism and whatever else outside 

1065
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:14,314
of that little window of time though,
this is still better than they've had 

1066
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,130
historically ever before.
And that's true for most people.

1067
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,960
And yes,
people absolutely lose sight of that.

1068
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:27,961
It's also less violent now than it 
historically than we've ever been.

1069
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:32,050
It's ever been before.
And people forget all that too.

1070
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,970
They're like,
yeah,

1071
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,833
that drives me crazy sometimes because I
think people need to maintain that 

1072
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:38,080
perspective.
Like,

1073
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,480
you know,
wow,

1074
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,880
this is not armageddon.
You know what I mean?

1075
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,320
Like shit is crazy.
But like we're still all right,

1076
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,910
you know?

1077
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,570
Yeah.
Well,

1078
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,460
what do you make about the Armageddon 
people?

1079
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,333
Because one of the things I talk about 
here all the time is the free speech 

1080
00:48:52,951 --> 00:48:53,784
situation,
which I think is going to get a lot 

1081
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:55,890
worse.
I mean,

1082
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:56,723
it's very clear that a certain amount of
people now think it's okay to punch 

1083
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:02,490
Nazis or punch anyone you think might be
a Nazi.

1084
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,590
And if someone's speaking at a school 
you don't like,

1085
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:07,440
you can burn down the school.
And all that stuff.

1086
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,633
What do we do?
So what do us as the liberals in this 

1087
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:13,410
situation that are supposed to defend 
free speech,

1088
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,110
what do we do to to come some of these 
people down?

1089
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,330
I've been trying to figure it out.
I don't know that I got there yet.

1090
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,081
Yeah,
I'm not,

1091
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,910
I'm not sure either because anytime I'm 
gonna be honest.

1092
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,893
Anytime that I've tried to like touch on
some of that because I have in some of 

1093
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:26,194
my videos I've tried to say things that 
are in line with what we're talking 

1094
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:34,471
about right now and they never get the 
kind of response that might other videos

1095
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,583
just railing on trump or the writer 
would ever do everything I've ever said 

1096
00:49:38,151 --> 00:49:41,620
in any of my videos I believe and I,
that's my genuine thoughts.

1097
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,640
But anything that's ever been in like 
kind of challenging in that way.

1098
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,930
They're always like,
you know,

1099
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:49,260
I could.
It's almost like I can feel the internet

1100
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:50,290
and being like,
no,

1101
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,181
no.
Let's see.

1102
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:53,650
We don't want to hear all that.
You know what I mean?

1103
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:55,120
Like people just don't want to hear it.
I was.

1104
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,940
So when I thought the left,
he's supposed to be the tolerance side,

1105
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,153
I know the tolerant people and see that 
it's been that way for my people my 

1106
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:05,960
whole life,
meaning,

1107
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:11,010
like for years and years I've been very 
aware of the hypocrisy of liberals who,

1108
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,850
you know,
of horror,

1109
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:20,851
any kind of intolerance and 
discrimination being so openly prejudice

1110
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:22,840
towards people like me.

1111
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,673
Yeah.
And it's always been that way my whole 

1112
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,650
life.
It's been that way.

1113
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,000
And I've always thought that was 
bullshit.

1114
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:29,834
Like,
do you not realize that that is still 

1115
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:35,510
that still intolerant and it's always 
been that way about,

1116
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,580
you know,
poor white trash rednecks,

1117
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,423
whatever else.
But now it's like spreading into this 

1118
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:41,824
psych.
They're intolerant of anybody who 

1119
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:45,890
doesn't agree with them on every single 
thing.

1120
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:46,970
You're now you're,
you know,

1121
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:50,210
you're a Nazi or whatever.
And uh,

1122
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,470
stoking the fires of the Patriarchy and 
all this shit because she,

1123
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,490
I assume you were against punching the 
Nazi,

1124
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,720
right?
I don't want to put words in your mouth.

1125
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:57,603
I'm against it.

1126
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,660
I don't anything.
I take that back.

1127
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,930
I don't give a shit.
You're a Nazi.

1128
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,940
Got Punched.
Like getting punched is fine with me,

1129
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,713
especially if you know,
but I wish it would have just happened 

1130
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:14,490
in a bar somewhere,
just whipped his ass or whatever because

1131
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,610
he probably needs his ass whipped.
Uh,

1132
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,023
but do I think that we need to make it a
thing where we just go around punching 

1133
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:23,910
people that say things we disagree with?
No,

1134
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:25,710
absolutely not.
Even if they're Nazis,

1135
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:26,544
it's like when they sell,
you defended the Ku Klux Klan or 

1136
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:29,574
whatever in a court case once over 
freedom of speech issue and like that's 

1137
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,630
the way it should be.
You know what I mean?

1138
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:34,860
That's fair.
Like,

1139
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,863
yeah,
that to hell with the client they held 

1140
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:41,130
with Nazis.
Obviously we're in Indiana Jones again.

1141
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:44,640
I know it's ridiculous like it,
it has,

1142
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,250
it has to go both ways.

1143
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,320
It's like,
and this is slightly different subject,

1144
00:51:49,321 --> 00:51:52,110
but it's like on the topic of what is 
and is not okay to joke about.

1145
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,320
It's like Trey Parker and Matt Stone set
on South Park.

1146
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,640
They tackled it and they were like,
look,

1147
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,490
either all of it's okay or none of it 
is.

1148
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,650
And that's how I feel about free speech 
in general,

1149
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,950
like you don't have to like the awful 
shit that he's saying,

1150
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:07,920
but this is America and he has the right
to say it.

1151
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:08,843
You know what I mean?
Just like we have the right to say I 

1152
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,944
have the right man because I asked them.
I mean I'd go after a shitty white 

1153
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:17,910
people as that termed them hard all the 
time.

1154
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,980
Uh,
and you know,

1155
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,490
if I didn't have the ability to do that,
I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

1156
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:25,320
I wouldn't have a career.
I just be doing whatever else.

1157
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:26,154
And I'm,
I'm,

1158
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,023
I realized that,
so I'm not going to be hypocritical 

1159
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,120
inside that,
you know,

1160
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,930
only I should have the right to do it 
because I'm right and he's wrong.

1161
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,870
But what I mean like,
and of course I believe that he's wrong,

1162
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,910
but it doesn't matter.
That's not how it works.

1163
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:41,220
You have to apply it,
you know,

1164
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,540
across the board consistently.
It's almost like you have to have ideals

1165
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,240
even when they're hard to have.
Yeah.

1166
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:47,941
Crazy.
Right?

1167
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:48,774
Yeah.
How many years you've been doing 

1168
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,090
standup?
Six and a half.

1169
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,250
Six and a half,
man,

1170
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:55,300
I did 12 years of stand up before you 
got into all this.

1171
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,253
I started doing all this crazy shit and 
I was telling you before how I got to 

1172
00:52:58,371 --> 00:52:59,204
start doing it again now and I've been 
speaking to colleges and stuff and sort 

1173
00:53:01,351 --> 00:53:02,184
of working some standup in because I see
there's such a need for people to say 

1174
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:07,160
some uncomfortable things.
But I'm curious.

1175
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:07,994
In your six and a half years,
have you seen the way language has 

1176
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:10,814
changed?
Was there something that you might've 

1177
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,583
said six years ago that you think now?
Just because everyone's on twitter and 

1178
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,870
snapchat and your whole set and all that
shit?

1179
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:19,820
Yeah.
That you'd be afraid of saying

1180
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,330
it's hard as a comedian and sit here 
inside of that.

1181
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:28,320
I'm afraid of saying anything but um,
but yes,

1182
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,950
like one thing that bothers me is like 
if I'm doing,

1183
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,803
and I,
and I still do a lot of this and I can 

1184
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:36,420
feel people pull back sometimes,
but usually it's so it's okay,

1185
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:39,770
but if I'm doing a bit about something,
uh,

1186
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,270
that shitty people do or believe.
Right.

1187
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,104
And so like in the bit I'm talking about
this hypothetical racist or bigoted or 

1188
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:50,460
whatever,
and like you say,

1189
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,373
you know,
like if it's a homophobic thing and you 

1190
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,630
in the bit I say queer or gay or Faggot 
or whatever,

1191
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,000
but it's not me saying it,
I'm talking about this guy saying it and

1192
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:03,480
then I tear that do apart right after 
that for being shitty.

1193
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,170
But it doesn't matter to a lot of people
just having said the word,

1194
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:08,160
they're like,
Oh God,

1195
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,760
no,
why would you do that?

1196
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,500
It's like you're not listening to me and
I don't like to sugarcoat things and act

1197
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,750
like that's not how those people are.
You know what I mean?

1198
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,050
That's what that hypothetical dude would
say.

1199
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,210
And that's the whole point of this whole
bit or whatever.

1200
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,493
But none of that matters to people.
All that matters is literally just the 

1201
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,820
word,
the buzz words or whatever.

1202
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:29,970
And sometimes it's like buzz ideas or 
whatever.

1203
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,940
You know what I mean?
You're just not allowed to joke about or

1204
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:35,180
talk about no matter what.
Yeah,

1205
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,550
absolutely hate that.

1206
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,820
And that that's the death of comedy 
because need satire.

1207
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:44,710
So you're trying to sat tire something 
to point out hypocrisy or whatever,

1208
00:54:44,711 --> 00:54:45,251
you know,
the,

1209
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:46,580
the Charlie Hebdo people,
people say,

1210
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:50,410
well they were mocking Muhammad,
they were mocking extremists actually.

1211
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,540
And there in lies the rub.
I used to do a bit about,

1212
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,633
uh,
about the transformers before they were 

1213
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:56,890
the movies from the eighties 
transformers,

1214
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:58,420
how they were all different racial 
people.

1215
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,850
And I used to act out a thing,
jazz.

1216
00:55:00,851 --> 00:55:01,684
He was the one black transformative to 
say the n word on onstage and it would 

1217
00:55:04,571 --> 00:55:05,404
always get a huge laugh.
And I remember one time that it got it 

1218
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:10,950
suddenly got a grown from a certain 
amount of the crowd.

1219
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:11,950
And I remember thinking,
Wow,

1220
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:12,784
I'm never going to tell that joke again 
and I have no desire to say then where 

1221
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:18,010
do.
It was just me acting out this fictional

1222
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:18,963
robot,
futuristic robot that doesn't exist but 

1223
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,970
satire and this is

1224
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,883
gotten better for me for sure.
Because most people at my shows in 

1225
00:55:27,321 --> 00:55:29,170
particular,
they sort of know what I'm about,

1226
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,530
know what they're getting into.
But like,

1227
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,510
man,
with this accent,

1228
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,630
you literally can't even say black 
people.

1229
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,380
You know what I mean?
Black people,

1230
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,780
they're just like,
oh Jesus,

1231
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,730
what?
This is about to be terrible.

1232
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:41,564
You know what I mean?
Like people immediately recoil because 

1233
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:44,870
of just the way it sounds.
So I mean,

1234
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:45,704
yes,
I've definitely dealt with that kind of 

1235
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:50,030
thing and one a and one of my first one,
my earliest videos,

1236
00:55:50,031 --> 00:55:53,690
I remember I was acting out,
my great,

1237
00:55:53,691 --> 00:55:56,540
great grandmother know who's dead and I 
said,

1238
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:57,201
you know,
she's dead,

1239
00:55:57,201 --> 00:55:58,034
but if she was still alive,
she wouldn't be comfortable eating 

1240
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:03,380
cornbread next to a colored boy.
Right.

1241
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,220
Because she wouldn't even colored boys 
is cleaning it up,

1242
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,020
you know what I mean?

1243
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,853
That's what she would say,
but it's like closer to it and I still 

1244
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:14,030
got so many messages from people that 
were like,

1245
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,193
I don't,
I don't know if you know this or maybe 

1246
00:56:15,861 --> 00:56:18,820
it's different in Tennessee,
but we don't really say anymore.

1247
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,673
That kind of thing.
It's like,

1248
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,840
oh,
fucking course.

1249
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:23,120
I know that that's the point of the 
joke,

1250
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:27,670
that it's this antiquated out of date 
ideal that she would have,

1251
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:32,290
and I'm making fun of it,
but just the word just calling,

1252
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,950
referring to a black person as colored,
no matter the context,

1253
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,380
set some people off and it's that whole 
attitude.

1254
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:42,470
It's like that is the reason that so 
many people hate liberals

1255
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:46,030
is that kind of thing because it's just 
ridiculous how.

1256
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:50,050
What about the idea that so you,
you make that joke about your great,

1257
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:50,884
great grandpa and that people now look 
at historical figures and try to give 

1258
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:58,930
them the morality of 2017 like I would 
guess.

1259
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,340
I Dunno,
but I would guess your great,

1260
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:01,890
great grandmother probably was a pretty 
decent one.

1261
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:03,850
One and raised some kids and blah,
blah,

1262
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:04,391
blah.
Yes.

1263
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:06,310
Maybe she had.
There were some racial stuff there too,

1264
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:07,144
which decided that,
but that we suddenly give our morality 

1265
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:12,790
of today to everyone else.
That's a really dangerous thing to do,

1266
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:13,170
isn't it?

1267
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,003
Yeah,
without a doubt that that's another 

1268
00:57:14,941 --> 00:57:16,350
thing too,
like um,

1269
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,993
that's a big reason why I try to be a 
little more like understanding or I'm 

1270
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:21,954
not just so immediately like I'll fuck 
you to people on the far right or 

1271
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:29,550
whatever because I've known so many of 
them and loved them.

1272
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,140
You know what I mean?
Like my grandparents,

1273
00:57:31,141 --> 00:57:34,860
both my grandfathers are dead.
If they were here though,

1274
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,680
they probably would have voted for 
Donald Trump.

1275
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:38,514
Right.
I love the shit out of both of my 

1276
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:42,060
grandpas.
I miss them all the time,

1277
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,880
you know what I mean?
And like people just shouldn't be,

1278
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,150
but they were from,
they're from a different time,

1279
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,043
you know what I mean?
Like they weren't bad people but like 

1280
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:53,070
both of them and the n word.
Oh God,

1281
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:57,630
you know what I mean all the time.
But like that was just,

1282
00:57:57,631 --> 00:57:58,464
it was like,
that's just how people talked when they 

1283
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:01,254
were,
when they were growing up over their 

1284
00:58:01,921 --> 00:58:02,400
lives or whatever.

1285
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,900
I remember one time it was just a true 
story,

1286
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,300
and this is,
this is in my book too,

1287
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:07,134
but there was a fight between a white 
kid and a black kid in the town down 

1288
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,393
town,
like the town square of Salon in my 

1289
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,780
hometown when I was in high school,
small town.

1290
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:16,643
Everybody's talking about it because the
white kid got the shit beat out of it 

1291
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,303
and uh,
everybody was talking about it and so I 

1292
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:26,850
was at my grandpa's car lot the next day
and he asked me what was that about,

1293
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,320
what happened?
And I was like,

1294
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:28,921
well,
I think,

1295
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:29,754
uh,
you know,

1296
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,080
I think Jimmy called Jimmy called the n 
word or something,

1297
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,210
something like that.
And My grandpa goes,

1298
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,543
oh,
what the hell do you want him to call 

1299
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:42,270
him Chinese?
It is,

1300
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,090
here's I loved.
Yeah.

1301
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:45,330
Yeah.
And like it was,

1302
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:47,780
he wasn't trying to be funny,
he wasn't trying to,

1303
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,780
you know,
like that,

1304
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:52,980
that was his genuine first thought and 
it's,

1305
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:53,843
he's just a product of his time and 
that's how so and that my grandpa was 

1306
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:57,234
born in 1935.
So when you start talking about people 

1307
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:02,670
in the 18 hundreds or whatever,
yeah,

1308
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:05,910
trying to apply today's standards to 
them is ridiculous.

1309
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,823
You know what I mean?

1310
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,813
I'm curious,
do you ever get it the other way where 

1311
00:59:08,781 --> 00:59:09,614
you'll say something about redneck 
culture and people that are still part 

1312
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:14,860
of that culture will be like,
hey,

1313
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,863
you're making us all look like idiots.
Are you making us all look backwards or 

1314
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:19,064
whatever?

1315
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,500
Um,
I get a of,

1316
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,540
and especially in my hometown,
I get a lot of,

1317
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,050
oh,
he's selling his people out like that.

1318
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:32,051
I'm just like exploiting them for like a
gimmick or whatever,

1319
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:34,340
but it's not a gimmick.
It's,

1320
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,580
it is who I am.
So I don't look at it that way at all.

1321
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,170
Also,
anybody that grew up with me should know

1322
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:40,910
better because as we talked about 
earlier,

1323
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,390
like I've always been this guy that none
of them shouldn't be surprised by this.

1324
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,450
And uh,
but I get a lot of that.

1325
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,284
But now I remember what I said earlier 
about rednecks and not giving a damn 

1326
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,480
what people think.
I don't get much of like,

1327
00:59:53,481 --> 00:59:55,610
you know,
or you shouldn't be making fun of me,

1328
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:56,151
my own,
you know,

1329
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:57,830
or whatever.
Like I'll just get like,

1330
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,100
fuck you,
but not in a like they're not,

1331
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:04,790
not in the wet.

1332
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:06,820
Yes.
I'm a queer to not,

1333
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,160
not in the way that they're offended by 
the redneck jokes.

1334
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:13,220
They're offended by my ideas.
You know what I mean?

1335
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:14,690
Uh,
that's about it.

1336
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,070
I don't really get a lot of like,
oh,

1337
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,320
you're going to solve look by eye 
because they genuinely,

1338
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:21,140
for the most part,
don't give a shit how they look to other

1339
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:21,974
groups of people or whatever.
There's all this really show how 

1340
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:28,250
important comedy is to almost everything
because if you look at,

1341
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,040
at foxworthy and those guys,
he was the redneck comedy tour,

1342
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,110
right?
And that's what it's called,

1343
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,100
blue collar,
blue collar comedy tour.

1344
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,370
Um,
that,

1345
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,500
that was finally an outlet for some of 
these people that we're talking about,

1346
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:40,334
to just have their shit hurt.
And that's just an incredibly powerful 

1347
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:45,081
thing.
Yeah.

1348
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:45,741
I,
I,

1349
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:46,574
I completely agree and totally think 
that comedy is more important now than 

1350
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:50,990
it's been in a long time.

1351
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,560
A weirdly enough,
and I,

1352
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:53,301
I didn't,
uh,

1353
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,134
I didn't check this,
this is just in the middle of another 

1354
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:59,530
interview for a UK magazine and so I'm 
talking to this,

1355
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:03,140
a British reporter and she was talking 
about,

1356
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:06,620
she asked me a question apparently 
Armando Iannucci,

1357
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,454
you know,
that his iep for vape and he made a in 

1358
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:11,990
the loop the movie and before that,
in the UK,

1359
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:14,900
the thick of it,
I'm a huge fan of that guy,

1360
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:18,470
colossal fanny's when my favorite comedy
writers on planet Earth and she just.

1361
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:20,180
And she was like,
did you hear what he said the other day?

1362
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:21,014
And I didn't know,
I guess it was news over there or 

1363
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:23,654
whatever.
And she said that according to her he 

1364
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:27,194
said that he thinks that it's time to 
step away from joking about a lot of 

1365
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:38,090
these things because we need to take it 
seriously and not joke about it.

1366
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,920
And I told her,
I was like,

1367
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:40,754
well,
I still love his work and I'm a huge 

1368
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:44,444
fan,
but I could not possibly disagree more 

1369
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:47,790
strongly with that.
Especially if you're talking about,

1370
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,600
I'm a comedian,
he's a comedy writer,

1371
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,434
you know,
like that's my whole job is to make fun 

1372
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:55,484
of Shit and I think you need comedy in 
times like this because it otherwise 

1373
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:00,584
it's just darkness.
It makes it easier to deal with because 

1374
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:04,300
like I'm,
yeah,

1375
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,133
Oh,
you know,

1376
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,950
people do need to talk about it.
Seriously.

1377
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:12,370
The people like politicians and people 
are actually in the field or whatever.

1378
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,110
They do need to take this shit 
seriously.

1379
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:17,390
They absolutely do because it's very 
serious.

1380
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,300
But I'm a comedian.
I don't need to take it.

1381
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,580
That's not my role.
My role is to take the piss out of it,

1382
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:24,720
to use,
you know,

1383
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,720
his vernacular and like I don't know why
we would stop now.

1384
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,870
For me,
it's more important now than ever it is.

1385
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,670
And again,
if he,

1386
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,350
if he didn't actually say that,
then you know,

1387
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,213
whatever,
what we're going to click and send it 

1388
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:40,170
directly to that.
But according to a British reporter,

1389
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:43,440
that was a quote from him and I was,
I was just kind of floored,

1390
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:44,550
like,
no,

1391
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,630
no,
it's not opposite.

1392
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,910
I've seen a lot of that though.
We're comics,

1393
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:52,260
I mean people that I generally respect 
and like where they've gone off the deep

1394
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:53,520
end where it's like,
no,

1395
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,490
they're not being funny anymore.
They're,

1396
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:59,070
they're just preaching all the time and 
it's like if George Carlin was around,

1397
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,420
and I say this on the show almost every 
week,

1398
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:01,830
like every morning I wake up and I'm 
like,

1399
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,070
fuck,
where the hell is George Carlin?

1400
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,840
And when we need it more than ever,
he would still be being funny about this

1401
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,630
and that.

1402
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:10,110
And that goes to prove your point.
That's what we need.

1403
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,490
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1404
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,570
Well,
we did it.

1405
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,560
We did a New Yorker,
La guy and a redneck.

1406
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,520
We did an hour.
This has been an hour.

1407
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,200
I didn't look down once.
We didn't even stop.

1408
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,230
We said we were going to stop once we 
rolled right through.

1409
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,070
We didn't even start.
Flew by.

1410
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:23,963
It flew by.
I have a feeling we're going to cross 

1411
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,580
paths again.
I think so.

1412
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,380
I hope so.
I hope so too.

1413
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,393
Thanks for having me,
man.

1414
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,160
I shouldn't have been out to la for a 
month.

1415
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:36,360
Jesus.
It'll be a month and a like four or five

1416
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:37,320
more days.
Yeah.

1417
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,183
Well you should.
You probably got to get a spray Tan and 

1418
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,980
have a trainer yet or not eating or 
eating carbs.

1419
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:47,800
Can you get off all the carbs?
All the car,

1420
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:49,460
but all the gluten,
dairy,

1421
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,420
all that.
I'm doing a piss poor job of that.

1422
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,230
That part of being a California and we 
did a man,

1423
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,093
cory and drew.
We came out here and one of the first 

1424
01:03:57,061 --> 01:04:02,061
things we did was shotgun some liquor.
Always just exploded in the mindset.

1425
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:03,621
So yeah.
I'm,

1426
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:05,580
you know,
I'm dipping my toes in the water.

1427
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,130
Small steps.
Yeah.

1428
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:08,281
Alright.
Well it was,

1429
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:09,114
it was a pleasure chatting with users.
All my guys for more on and to find out
