00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:10,090
Joining me today as a contributor for 
Canada's national post known here on the

2
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:12,680
Youtube,
as my name is Josephine,

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,880
Josephine.
Matthias,

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,530
welcome to the Rubin Room.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,740
Thank you for having me.
I'm so excited to be here.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,350
So your real name is Josefina.
My name is Jason.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,890
I know a lot of people don't believe 
that.

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:25,830
I think it's like an alias isn't really 
not that believable.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,530
You say,
my name is Josephine and people are 

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,200
always getting pumped on line.
So they were curious.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,550
Sorry,
that was gonna say.

12
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:38,551
I think they assume it's like bunky show
or something to Joseph until really 

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:38,551
late.

14
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,140
All.
Alright,

15
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:44,141
well I'm,
I'm really super psyched that you're 

16
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,791
here.
We met about a month and a half ago in 

17
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,831
Toronto after Jordan Peterson thing.
We got to chat a little bit and I've 

18
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:51,521
been a fan of what you're doing for 
awhile and I think you're actually one 

19
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:53,270
of the few people on the youtube making 
some sense.

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,200
Whoa.
I feel fresh.

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,440
Okay.
So,

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,450
uh,
let's just do a little bit about your 

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,051
history first and then we're gonna play 
a clip from one of your videos in case 

24
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,050
people haven't seen some of your stuff 
and then we're going to talk about all 

25
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,160
sorts of political stuff because you are
a true political beast.

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,250
So you're originally from Nigeria.
I lived there for what,

27
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:13,890
eight or nine years before he moved to 
Canada.

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,790
So tell me about growing up in Nigeria.

29
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,500
Yeah.
Um,

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I actually don't remember much about 
growing up in Nigeria and my parents 

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,710
kind of a closed me off to what was 
really going on.

32
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:26,320
I lived in a gated community and um,
yeah,

33
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:28,000
I immigrated here when I was nine years 
old.

34
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,180
My Dad actually first went to Canada 
when I was two.

35
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,000
Uh,
he got here on a work visa,

36
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,210
worked his ass off for years,
for about seven years actually.

37
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:39,730
I didn't even know who my dad was for 
seven years.

38
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,710
And then when he got his visa and 
everything,

39
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,230
he brought my family over and yeah,
now I'm in.

40
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,450
I'm in Canada.
I mean a great country.

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,090
Yeah.
So what did your dad do?

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,000
Was able to get a visa to go there.

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah.
My Dad was an accountant and then when 

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,140
he got to Canada he went back to school 
and decided to do nursing inside.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,450
And my mom's a teacher,
so that's,

46
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
that's what they do.
What does your mom teach?

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,090
Uh,
she teaches.

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,120
She taught English in Nigeria and now 
she kind of teaches special ed kids and 

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,270
stuff like that.
So she still loves teaching.

50
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,900
She obviously can't teach a Nigerian 
person can teach English in Canada,

51
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,570
but yeah.
So she still loves teaching,

52
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,550
so I'm glad she's still kind of gets to 
do that.

53
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,990
But yeah.
So my dad's accountant,

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,270
my dad,
my mom's a teacher.

55
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,410
Yeah.
Do your parents tell you anything about 

56
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,990
the political situation or anything at 
the time when you were growing up?

57
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:24,550
Even if you don't have great memories of
it?

58
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,050
Uh,
not necessarily.

59
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:28,150
My parents were not really that 
political.

60
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,570
I think we became more political when we
came to Canada and I mean politics in 

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,220
Nigeria is just,
it's completely corrupt.

62
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,670
There's no such thing as politics.
It's all just money.

63
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:41,671
And um,
it was when I came to Canada is when 

64
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:41,990
they start to get a little bit more 
political and uh,

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't know,
I think religion and strict parents 

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,200
kinda create conservatism in a way.
So they're very,

67
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,000
very conservative.
Uh,

68
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,690
so I grew up about,
um,

69
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,710
around that,
but they didn't really name it as 

70
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:55,710
conservatism.
It was just strict and religious and had

71
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,970
all these rules that basically apply to 
conservatism in the way.

72
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,460
Yeah.
So then you get to Canada,

73
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:05,461
you're not even 10 years old.
What was that like to be in a new 

74
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:06,420
country?
So weird here.

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,000
I think it was 16 degrees outside and I 
was freezing.

76
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,580
So why is it so cold?
And it was people wearing tee shirts.

77
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,300
I did not understand.
Uh,

78
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,060
I remember like driving from the 
airport,

79
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,520
I think it's piercing airport and we all
stopped and was like,

80
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,960
why are we stopping?
And they're like,

81
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,710
oh,
it's a red light.

82
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,520
Like what does that mean?
Don't you just go with us?

83
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,430
Everyone has figured out.
My Dad's like,

84
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,720
there's order here.
I was like,

85
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,860
oh,
okay.

86
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,110
And snow.
Snow is the best one.

87
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:31,570
I think I spent like half an hour just 
like touching it and like,

88
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:36,571
what is this?
And my elementary school teachers or 

89
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:36,571
middle school teachers had to tell me to
get back inside.

90
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,710
But yeah,
it was,

91
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,940
it was really,
it was surreal.

92
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,430
It was a culture shock.
So it was mostly a weather related,

93
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,380
whether an order,
whether an order.

94
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,760
Exactly.
It's basically it,

95
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:48,760
whether in order.
So when you say you grew up in like a in

96
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,370
a religious atmosphere,
what was that like?

97
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,910
My parents were just super religious and
they hoped I'd be also as religious as 

98
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,300
them.
Unfortunately I'm not.

99
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,410
But I think that kinda comes with age 
and also living in a different country.

100
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,340
Nigeria,
it's easier,

101
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,260
easier.
The majority of people are religious.

102
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,640
Um,
but yeah,

103
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,990
they,
they are still a very,

104
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,550
very good Catholic Protestants.
Yeah.

105
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,740
So yeah.
Yeah.

106
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,660
So,
okay.

107
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,000
So now you're in Canada,
you're a kid,

108
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,000
you're making a good life for yourself.
When did you get interested in politics?

109
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,330
Oh,
I got interested in politics a while I'm

110
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,970
taking political science and studying 
political science in school right now.

111
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,030
And um,
I was also president of the debate club,

112
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,360
I was just interested in like this 
scores and discussing things.

113
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:35,380
I was interested in people's ideas and 
different ideas and reasoning,

114
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,220
the reason for things.
Um,

115
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,540
but I also think my political views were
really shaped by me immigrating to 

116
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,630
Canada and we lived in the inner cities.

117
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm not sure if you've ever heard of 
Jane and finch by any chance.

118
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,600
It's Kinda like a south side of Chicago 
lights,

119
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,640
like it's not,
it's obviously not as bad,

120
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,510
but it's an inner city majority black,
um,

121
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,660
you know,
poor neighborhoods.

122
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,690
I lived there for most of my Canadian 
life actually.

123
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:02,170
And then from there I moved to a more 
higher income neighborhood and having to

124
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:07,171
experience that.
So it was really cool kind of seeing 

125
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,170
like the culture there and then get 
another culture shock and move somewhere

126
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,030
else.
So it's like I've experienced,

127
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,120
you know,
Nigeria in the inner city in Canada and 

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,160
then a much more well off neighborhood.
So,

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,140
which would you say is the best out of 
those three?

130
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,790
Nigeria know all of neighborhood.
But yeah,

131
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,791
living in the inner cities really shaped
my views because now when I look back I 

132
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,550
was like,
oh,

133
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,420
that makes sense.

134
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,150
You are a product of your environment.
And a lot of people that,

135
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:36,151
you know,
I think about two slash three of my 

136
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:39,721
friends made it out of there.
The majority of them are pregnant or 

137
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:43,260
single parents now they're in the system
and it's unfortunate and weird to see 

138
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,671
that happen.
And my parents being extremely strict 

139
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:47,680
and they gave me a curfew at like 5:00
PM everyday.

140
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,160
I wasn't allowed to have boyfriends,
which I guess I was young,

141
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,710
I probably shouldn't have,
but they were really,

142
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,660
really strict and I hated them at that 
time.

143
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,040
I didn't understand why they didn't me 
to go out and play

144
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
with people and now I get it because I 
would have ended up like a lot of the 

145
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,100
people that are still there right now.
And then yeah,

146
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:09,101
moving to the much better neighborhood.
I realized that while there is a 

147
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,460
difference,
there is a cultural difference I guess.

148
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,460
But so when I've watched a ton of your 
videos,

149
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,620
I thought,
all right,

150
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,910
I sensed that she basically is a liberal
kind of liberal,

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,570
but I think you have probably some 
conservative leanings perhaps,

152
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:28,571
or at least have an understanding.
I think that's what you're laying out 

153
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,941
here.
You have an understanding of that line 

154
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:30,941
of thinking.
Yeah.

155
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:31,400
You consider yourself a classical 
liberal.

156
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,690
I don't want to push you,
but I'd like to hear you say it but,

157
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,480
but what do you actually consider your 
views to be okay here?

158
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,940
I know everyone says they don't like 
putting labels,

159
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,110
but I absolutely hate labels because 
like I have some conservative ideas.

160
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,540
I have some liberal ideas,
I have some classical liberal ideas.

161
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,520
Um,
I have some progressive ideas,

162
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,300
socialist ideas.
Um,

163
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,750
but I guess I just see a look of things 
from issue to issue,

164
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,720
but I,
um,

165
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,180
you know,
primarily liberal,

166
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:03,170
but I'm fiscally conservative.
So that's kind of where I lean I guess.

167
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,050
So the route I think of,
of your ideas,

168
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,550
he's sort of individualization.
Yeah,

169
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,640
for sure.
Yeah.

170
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,220
You want to throw to a clip?
Yes,

171
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,020
let's do it.
Alright.

172
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,130
Let's get people to know you in your 
natural environment.

173
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,160
West has also been tweeting about the 
lack of freedom of thought in America 

174
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,790
and the backlash about whether blacks 
can be allowed to be Republicans.

175
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,700
Sure is helping prove his point,
but black Americans,

176
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:27,701
contrary to popular belief,
can hold wildly diverse and opposing 

177
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:29,210
opinions and political issues.
Maybe Connie was a republican.

178
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,070
I mean he's ever referred to himself as 
such,

179
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,071
of course,
but he said something about trump that 

180
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:37,250
wasn't severely negative,
so he suddenly the Black Paul Ryan,

181
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,130
but even if he is so what?
In fact,

182
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:45,131
a 2012 study by Vincent Hutchins and 
King Jefferson using data from the 

183
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,331
American national election studies found
that 45 percent of black Americans 

184
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,540
identify as conservatives.
Despite this,

185
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:55,541
however,
the Democratic Party typically receives 

186
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:55,880
85 to 95 percent of the black American 
vote.

187
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,050
The tendency of black Americans to vote 
Democrat allows the to believe that they

188
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,270
have a strong hold on the black American
vote.

189
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,540
In fact,
back in 2016 when Connie was announced 

190
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:07,540
he would run for president in 20,
20,

191
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,370
the Democratic Party's official twitter 
account immediately assumed.

192
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,470
He meant you'd be running for them 
responding.

193
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,390
Welcome to the race,
Mr West.

194
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,320
Glad to have you.
If only the Dems had Ron Kanye in 2016,

195
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,530
better candidate than she who shall not 
be named.

196
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,350
All right.
So I,

197
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,150
I picked that one because I think this 
is a great example of what you do.

198
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:30,151
There's,
there's information and facts and it's 

199
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:30,430
kind of light to and fun and all that 
good stuff.

200
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,450
Now,
first off though,

201
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,630
as a black Canadian yapping about black 
Americans,

202
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,640
that's kind of racist,
wouldn't you say?

203
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,190
Yeah.
I think I've gotten a lot of comments 

204
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,801
when people say like he don't understand
what it's like to be black in America 

205
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:43,801
and it's like,
oh my gosh,

206
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:48,221
I thought I can have those same 
discussions about race relations in 

207
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:48,730
America.
It's just a little scaled down in,

208
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:53,731
in the Canadian context.
And I think a lot of Canadians try to 

209
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:56,551
project,
I guess I American issues on Canadians 

210
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:56,551
as well.
So,

211
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:56,551
um,
but yeah,

212
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:56,551
no,
I,

213
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,200
I do get that criticism,
which is annoying.

214
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,210
We should all be allowed to talk about 
whatever we want.

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
You are a black in America right now?
Yes,

216
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,050
I am.
I know it's awful.

217
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:08,190
I mean by 10 times people are yelling 
the n word at me.

218
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,290
I mean I just,
I feel so unsafe.

219
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,360
Well that's why we create a safe space 
for you.

220
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,190
Thank you.
Thank you.

221
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Okay.
So I won't hook that video though 

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,381
because the numbers that you laid out 
there are actually kind of incredible 

223
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:25,551
and something that we obviously have 
been talking about lately related to 

224
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:28,761
Kanye and candice and the rest of it for
45 percent of black Americans consider 

225
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:34,321
themselves conservative yet at 85 to 95 
percent are voting democrat.

226
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,690
That is a massive disconnect.
So.

227
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,150
So what do you make of that?
Yeah,

228
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,260
I think there's an idea that the 
Democratic Party is the best one for 

229
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,260
black Americans.

230
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,330
It's the one that's going to help black 
Americans.

231
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,930
And although they are conservative in 
the true sense of the word,

232
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,960
they aren't necessarily Republican.
They don't believe in the Republican 

233
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Party.
Um,

234
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,180
but it is,
it is very interesting,

235
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:58,050
I mean no one group or identity bolts 
the same way as black Americans do.

236
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,970
So there is some kind of,
I guess,

237
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:02,670
story that's being told to them that 
this is the way to do it.

238
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,010
This is the way to go.
And I don't think,

239
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:10,011
you know,
the Republican party per se is the way 

240
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:10,011
to go and I don't think the Democratic 
Party,

241
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:10,510
in fact,
I think both parties are just garbage at

242
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,880
this point.
Um,

243
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,940
but yeah,
I think it's a little odd that the 

244
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,610
majority,
95 percent vote one single way,

245
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:19,800
but yet there are still conservative in 
a sense.

246
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,090
Um,
but yeah,

247
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,960
I just think it's,
it's a,

248
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,550
it's a leftover ideas,
like they just need to kind of start to 

249
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,680
refigure things out.

250
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,450
But first we probably have to start 
with,

251
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,540
you know,
changing up the government and changing 

252
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,941
up the party systems and try to find who
to vote for instead of just picking 

253
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:41,271
Democrat or a Republican.
Do you think this was more of a good 

254
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:44,181
sell job by the Democrats are a bad cell
job by the Republicans because when you 

255
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:44,610
look at all this,
the cities,

256
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,880
especially where it's the worst for 
black people,

257
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,680
they're always democrat run cities for 
decade after decade after decade.

258
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:57,180
Yet black people still extremely high 
numbers keep voting Democrat.

259
00:10:57,181 --> 00:11:02,181
So that's obviously a great sell job if 
somebody's doing some serious pr 

260
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:02,181
workload.
Yeah.

261
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:02,181
Oh yeah,
definitely.

262
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:06,951
And um,
I think it's also the Republicans as 

263
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:09,351
well.
I think Black Democrats make it feel 

264
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:13,791
like the Republicans are against the 
black Americans and the Democrats and 

265
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:13,900
the Republicans make it feel like,
you know,

266
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,410
the black Americans are against the 
Republicans.

267
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,410
Like it's just,
I think both sides are not necessarily 

268
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,911
trying to help.
They're just trying to pander to their 

269
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:24,951
own side.
But it is interesting that you've been 

270
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:24,951
voting Democrat for so long and things 
are not getting better.

271
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:25,500
It's like,
oh,

272
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,270
maybe I should start voting a different 
way,

273
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,850
or maybe I should start criticizing the 
Democratic Party.

274
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,450
I think that's actually the biggest 
thing is it's not picking a side.

275
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,130
It's criticizing what they're doing 
wrong.

276
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,010
It's criticizing,
you know,

277
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,770
this didn't work.
Let's try something else.

278
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,020
Instead of just saying we need Democrat.
That's it.

279
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,140
This is what's gonna happen,
but it's clearly not not working.

280
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:48,141
Let's try to figure out what policy 
changes we need instead of trying to 

281
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:48,141
pick like,
you know,

282
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,110
Democrat or Republican.
Sorry,

283
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,360
I keep saying that.
I've never gotten.

284
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:50,880
No,
I'm with you.

285
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm with you.
So I know you're not.

286
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,340
You're not a huge proponent

287
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,220
of the SORTA candice Kanye training in 
general,

288
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,770
but the fact that that conversation is 
happening now,

289
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:03,970
the fact that you made that video,
you view that all as positive,

290
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,690
right?
Oh yeah,

291
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,320
no,
for sure.

292
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:10,321
I think Connie really allowed a lot of 
people to think for a second and try to 

293
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,970
investigate some more information.
Try to figure out what their real.

294
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,090
Why do they hold certain ideas.
I think that was the biggest thing and 

295
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,301
it was really exciting.
It's like scroll through facebook and 

296
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:21,301
see people that are not normally 
engaging in politics now.

297
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Actually,
that might be scary because it's like 

298
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,220
the majority of people are saying don't 
know what they're doing,

299
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:32,221
but yeah,
I'd rather have them involved in some 

300
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:32,221
way.
Exactly.

301
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:32,221
I would rather have them involved.
And the thing is,

302
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,970
I think as much as I,
um,

303
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,710
you know,
dislike is politics.

304
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,711
I do think that it opened a lot of 
people's minds in the sense that it 

305
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:44,011
allowed them to investigate more and 
that's the most important thing because 

306
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:44,011
then you're just stuck in the echo 
chamber.

307
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,340
Connie broke that.
A lot of people,

308
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,700
all they see is,
you know,

309
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,730
beyonce and Chrissy Tiegen and all these
celebrities that are all just talking 

310
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:51,770
about the far left,
you know,

311
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,820
super.
I hate saying social justice for ever 

312
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:56,820
super social justice warrior talking 
points.

313
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,350
So kanye broke that and showed them the 
other side.

314
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,330
Um,
unfortunately I think,

315
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,350
uh,
you know,

316
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,110
because candace is kind of harsh and you
know,

317
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,710
I think it's harder for people to 
connect with her that are already sold 

318
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,221
down the drain of the far left.
And unfortunately we might have to 

319
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:14,221
cuddle them,
fill it,

320
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,520
we'll come on,
come to the other side.

321
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,740
It's okay,
let me explain things to you.

322
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,870
So do you view that as just like a 
personality trait because that's what's 

323
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,681
interesting to me.
Like people used to say to me all the 

324
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:26,681
time,
well,

325
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,640
you know,
if when you have milo on like Milo's 

326
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,110
creating chaos and out of chaos,
hopefully my feeling was if I brought my

327
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,400
low on that out of the chaos that he 
creates,

328
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:37,490
that some people would hear some good 
ideas in a more calm,

329
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:41,520
relaxed way and then they joined me on 
the adventure that I'm on it.

330
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,990
I think there's proof in that pudding.
I think you're kind of a little bit more

331
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,991
like where I think you see the little 
bit of the chaos that candice is 

332
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:50,840
creating and you want people to 
understand the ideas behind them.

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Yeah,
that's,

334
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,150
that's the thing is that,
you know,

335
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,530
when candice says one thing like,
um,

336
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,190
stop the victim mentality for example,
um,

337
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,410
I think a black Americans that are stuck
in like the far left echo chamber just 

338
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:03,410
sees it as like,
excuse me,

339
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,560
like what are you trying to save a 
little blah?

340
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,490
So it's like they need either she 
explains it further,

341
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,050
which obviously she doesn't have to do 
with me,

342
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,940
she can do whatever she wants,
but I think she needs to break it down a

343
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,920
little more because saying get off the 
plantation,

344
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:18,921
the victim hood,
it's harder for people that all they've 

345
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:19,020
ever heard is white privilege,
white people suck,

346
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:24,021
blah blah blah.
It's harder for them to kind of 

347
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:24,021
understand where she's coming from 
because if you do break it down it makes

348
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:26,760
a lot of sense.
But if it's just rolling like that,

349
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,170
then it's harder for them to figure it 
out.

350
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
What they can do.
The I keep pointing here like the 

351
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,550
liberals are these people over here?
Yeah.

352
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,410
So it just seemed to kind of break it 
down and figure

353
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,030
you think maybe you need both.
Like in any movement,

354
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:44,031
like if you just look at the black 
rights movement that Malcolm x was 

355
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:48,410
different than Martin Luther King.
And even the way comedians talk about 

356
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,711
things differently cause we talked about
things differently than Dick Gregory 

357
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,640
than Chappelle and Chris Rock.
We just need people.

358
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,130
People just get affected by it.
Different.

359
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,590
Yeah.
Shock value works,

360
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:57,510
I mean it gets people,
it wakes people up,

361
00:14:57,511 --> 00:15:00,480
it allows them to kind of be more aware 
of what's going on.

362
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:02,430
I totally,
I do think we need both of them.

363
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:03,720
We need people to say,
know,

364
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:04,950
shut up,
you're being annoying.

365
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,470
And we also need people to say here's 
why you're being annoying.

366
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,200
I think we most certainly need both,
but yeah,

367
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,750
I think she,
what she does is she's awesome.

368
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:16,020
She has such a great platform and there 
are also other people that are doing the

369
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:21,021
same thing but in a more kind of calmer.
I'm not saying she's like crazy or 

370
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,690
anything like that.
Um,

371
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,710
yeah,
she's just,

372
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:26,690
she's a tough girl and it's a lot of 
sjws aren't snowflakes.

373
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,650
So I really had any interaction.
I'm not necessarily,

374
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:36,651
I mean I think we've done under,
like we've talked over dms on twitter 

375
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:36,670
before.
Um,

376
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:41,671
and this was after the whole Blair white
debate and that was white guys guys,

377
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:43,200
guys.
Yeah.

378
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,190
Yeah.
Uh,

379
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,250
no.
I was just at reaching out to her and 

380
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,250
asking her like,
Hey,

381
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,250
what's going on?
Like I don't because she was,

382
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,231
I think closing everyone off that were 
criticizing her and I didn't want to 

383
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,140
openly criticize her.
I wanted to go directly to the source,

384
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,140
but we left off on a good note.
So yeah.

385
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,750
All right,
well I'll put it out here.

386
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:05,170
Why don't we have a Jay z Kanye moment 
and you both can come on the show 

387
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,350
sometime and talk it out and going to be
like guys,

388
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,820
guys,
guys.

389
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm a glutton for punishment.
So when I was doing a little research 

390
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,110
and I knew one of the things that I 
thought was most interesting is that.

391
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,360
So you have a twin sister.
Yeah.

392
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,850
And part of your awakening was related 
to a paper that she was writing in 

393
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,460
college.
Right.

394
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,440
So can you tell me about that?
Because it's pretty fascinating.

395
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,130
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure.

396
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,530
Um,
so my sister is not into politics at 

397
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,361
all.
She is studying marketing and she 

398
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:32,361
decided to take,
he was to Ryerson University,

399
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:35,790
one of the biggest far left universities
in Canada.

400
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,120
And um,
he took a sociology course that was her 

401
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,930
fault and it was called how society 
works.

402
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:47,931
I think it was the title of the course 
or is what bothered me because if the 

403
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,260
chorus was feminism studies,
if the course was,

404
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,100
you know,
how women are oppressed and yeah,

405
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,110
sure,
but this is how society works and you 

406
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,991
know,
in your assignment they had to talk 

407
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,321
about some societal issue and discuss it
and analyze it or whatever and she 

408
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,060
wanted to talk about the weight or I 
actually encouraged her.

409
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,100
I like you to talk about the wage gap 
and you know,

410
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,010
how it's falls and you know,
how it's misinterpreted and all of that.

411
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,530
And you were sending her up.
I was setting her up a little.

412
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,020
I wanted to test it out,
but I didn't know it was there.

413
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,550
A professor would respond that way.
Um,

414
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,280
but yeah,
I told her to write about the wage gap.

415
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,440
So she just sounds like a short thesis 
and said like,

416
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:21,810
here's what I want to talk about.
I'm going to use studies,

417
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:22,030
blah,
blah,

418
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:22,860
blah.
Let me know.

419
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:24,590
And the professor,
like,

420
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,460
her response is a meme.
Like,

421
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:31,461
I hope I could.
You guys can like put it up or 

422
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:33,291
something.
It's like the reality is patriarchy do 

423
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,070
not use business sources.
They blame women and it's like period.

424
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:37,890
The reality is patriarchy can do not 
blame women and like,

425
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:38,050
you know

426
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
the screenshot on this,
you can say yes for sure.

427
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,900
Definitely.
Yeah,

428
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,340
I was reading it.
I was like,

429
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:44,240
okay,
this is fake,

430
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:44,690
right?
This is.

431
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,610
And this is definitely fake.
No,

432
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:49,190
she basically shut it down.
She said your premise is completely.

433
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,650
And it was one of the most absurd emails
ever and use only feminist sources.

434
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,920
And in the assignment details,
the list of sources they can't use was 

435
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,270
dictionary.com.
The encyclopedia.

436
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,940
You couldn't use the government of 
Canada website,

437
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,150
you couldn't use statistic Canada,
Statistics Canada.

438
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,250
How,
like how does that even make sense?

439
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,140
How are you going to explain how society
works?

440
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:16,140
And the only source you have is feminist
studies,

441
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,590
as Peterson has mentioned,
there's so many times they're not cited.

442
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,380
It's just within this little group,
the,

443
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,520
these aren't real textbooks.
Uh,

444
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,240
but yeah,
it just,

445
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,560
it blew my mind and I was so excited and
she sat back because I was like,

446
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:30,420
this is exactly what is wrong.

447
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:30,810
So.
Okay,

448
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,540
so your sister gets this response.
What was her response?

449
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,260
Was she like,
Oh,

450
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,060
look what you did to me?
No,

451
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,100
yes,
she was upset at me and she thought I 

452
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,100
was wrong and I have to sit her down and
say,

453
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,290
girl,
let me explain it to you.

454
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,500
Here is what is actually happening.
By the end of that conversation,

455
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,490
she's like,
oh my gosh,

456
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,990
I've been.
Every class I go to,

457
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,960
I've been lied to.
They are lying to me every single day,

458
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,670
and it,
it,

459
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,340
it's,
it's,

460
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,940
it's so messed up and I think it's,
this isn't teaching.

461
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:57,030
This is imposing your political ideas on
students because if it's teaching,

462
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:02,031
you teach it objectively,
you show them the facts and let your 

463
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:02,031
students come up with their own 
conclusions.

464
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:06,620
This is not teaching.
She's trying to tell them how to think 

465
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:06,620
and you know,
I,

466
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,830
I did some research on her actually and 
she's the highest paid woman in her 

467
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,610
person,
in her department.

468
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,350
She makes more money than the male 
counterparts are you talking about?

469
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,920
So I'm sure there's a reason.
Yeah,

470
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:24,921
exactly.
But it's like there's obviously reasons 

471
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:24,921
for it.
She probably works more hours,

472
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:24,921
she's,
you know,

473
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:27,060
doing all these other things and that's 
how you can explain the wage gap.

474
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,330
So it was just interesting to me that 
why like why are you doing this?

475
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:34,050
Why are you lying to your students or 
isn't the point of education for you?

476
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,070
Like,
or essays or assignments like you're 

477
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,070
supposed to come to your own conclusions
by using facts.

478
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,620
We have the facts.
What's wrong with it?

479
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:42,650
She just didn't want those facts.
It,

480
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,850
it blew my mind.
But that was the right.

481
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,240
Well,
they're often not for facts.

482
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah.
Facts that they allege facts.

483
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,850
So what,
what happened with the paper?

484
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,650
She's like,
okay,

485
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,651
this is too much for me.
My sister and she ended up just doing 

486
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,291
some other topic and try to pander to 
what the professor wanted to get a good 

487
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:00,291
mark.

488
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,890
And that is my advice to a lot of 
students is like,

489
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:04,410
just suck it up.
I mean if you are already in this class,

490
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,900
it's not worth getting a bad mark over.
Um,

491
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,280
however.
Sorry.

492
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:12,030
The great thing about it was I got a ton
of messages from students from her class

493
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,240
started to explain all the other things 
that this teacher is engaging and how 

494
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,790
awful it is and not made me happy 
because they said,

495
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,880
you know what,
next week I'm going to speak up and I'm 

496
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:22,880
going to tell her she's wrong.
And I was like,

497
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:22,880
yes,
yes,

498
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,130
but be prepared.
Don't just take you through.

499
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,270
So it's interesting.
So I talk about this when I do college 

500
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,270
speeches.
Yeah.

501
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,010
Two years ago or so,
I used to say what you said about get 

502
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,341
the grade,
like suck it up and get the green 

503
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:39,201
because hopefully you know,
if you want to move to Grad school or 

504
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:39,201
get a good job after or whatever.

505
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:42,980
And I've turned on that really to on 
that because to me it's like we live in 

506
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,440
a time where people can be on youtube 
and expose these things.

507
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:50,640
Share the emails out on social media,
periscope while you're in classes.

508
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:55,641
The teacher is telling you that you're 
an evil white racism videos with my 

509
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:56,680
teachers.
Just the worst thing.

510
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,130
But that's been so empowering for you.
So that's why I'm not for telling kids 

511
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,460
students not to do that,
but I understand the line of thinking.

512
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Yeah.
And I guess it depends on the person or 

513
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,480
is it's still kind of challenge your 
professor while he is,

514
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,590
you know,
just teaching.

515
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,740
I meant more for assignments.
Like if the assignment says explain why 

516
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:16,870
women are oppressed,
like just do it,

517
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,520
that that's it.
Like if you,

518
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,150
you're probably going to fail if you say
women are not oppressed.

519
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,370
Um,
but if the teacher is actually teaching 

520
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,370
then yes please.

521
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,470
That is the best time because you catch 
them at it.

522
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:31,471
And I love watching them squirm.
I love watching them just kind of look 

523
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:31,471
around and it's like,
oh,

524
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,490
there's a black woman asking me to tell 
you know,

525
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:38,491
tell her why she's depressed and my 
white professor please tell me what 

526
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:39,160
rights you have did I don't have in 
Toronto,

527
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,090
Canada.
And it's like,

528
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,110
well,
you know,

529
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,550
there is white privilege.
And it's like,

530
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,150
oh my gosh,
stop.

531
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,340
Do you feel bizarrely empowered because 
of that?

532
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:53,341
Now,
I mean someone who's clear on their 

533
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,991
political thoughts and you don't,
you're not a victim victim or anything 

534
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,230
or he's immigrant status or blah,
blah,

535
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,390
blah.
Do you feel very empowered,

536
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:03,391
like almost like your teachers can't 
push back on you in a weird way because 

537
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,600
they're,
they're caught in their own guilt cycle.

538
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,080
Yeah,
no,

539
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,880
for sure.
And it's also funny because,

540
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:07,840
um,
you know,

541
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,430
I am the,
I am an immigrant,

542
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:10,510
I'm black and I'm a woman.

543
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,510
It's like I just have to be,
I guess most loving and I'm all the 

544
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,510
impressions.
Um,

545
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,240
so it's really difficult for them or 
anything.

546
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Yeah.
I got to limit Stereo Mueller every 

547
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:22,860
oppression there is.
Um,

548
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,140
but yeah,
no,

549
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:23,490
it,
it's,

550
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:26,290
it's,
it's kind of funny to see how they can't

551
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,970
challenge me because a lot of their 
arguments,

552
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:32,971
it is based on lived experiences.
This is what black people face and I'm 

553
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:35,200
talking about the Canadian context.
I think Canadian social racial relations

554
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,560
is a little bit different than the 
states than here in the states.

555
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:38,740
Sorry.
Um,

556
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,870
but yeah,
me being a black woman,

557
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:45,871
it's,
it's very difficult for them that they 

558
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:47,730
can't give me any,
they have to give me a legit argument 

559
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:47,730
because the only argument is,
well,

560
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:47,740
black people feel that way.
I don't.

561
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,470
So what is your argument?
But yeah,

562
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:55,471
I mean in,
in a sense it does kind of make me feel 

563
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:55,471
empowered because it's,
it's funny to watch them squirm.

564
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,730
Do you feel that you've had an undue 
influence in,

565
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,850
I suspect in a positive way on some of 
your classmates because I'm imagining 

566
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,091
they're probably learning as much from 
you in some ways more than they're 

567
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:09,370
learning from some of these professors.
Yeah,

568
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:10,350
for sure.
Um,

569
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:15,370
it's actually funded.
There are some classes I would have 

570
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,180
where a professor will say something 
absurd and like there's a student that I

571
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,700
know knows me from Youtube and he will 
look at me and I'm like,

572
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm not saying anything and then they'll
raise their hand and they'll talk and 

573
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:23,730
they'll want me to chime in and I'm 
like,

574
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,411
I don't want to do this in every class.
I'm not going to be challenging my 

575
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:28,411
professors.
Um,

576
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:28,411
but,
uh,

577
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:33,011
yeah,
I really liked the fact that I've 

578
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,530
encouraged so many students step up and 
actually speak up and say what they 

579
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,770
believe in and um,
yeah,

580
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,300
it's just really,
it's really interesting.

581
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,970
There was a course where one of the 
textbooks,

582
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:41,110
I forgot,
damn it,

583
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,600
this is why school sucks because like 
you forget everything literally,

584
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,620
instantly.
Um,

585
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,700
but one of the students said how it was 
problematic and before we just kind of 

586
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,390
brush it off and then another student 
rose their hand and said,

587
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,080
why is it problematic?
And it looks at me.

588
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,390
I was like,
Oh God.

589
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,190
But yeah,
I really liked that.

590
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,260
I've encouraged people to speak up and 
you know,

591
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,290
state what they believe and do more 
research and not just listen to 

592
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,681
everything your professors saying,
not just listen to anything I'm saying 

593
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:05,681
do more research and investigate and try
to find,

594
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:10,680
you know,
let's get closer to the truth is 

595
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:10,680
basically it.

596
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,480
Do you think students want to be smarter
than this stuff?

597
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,730
They're being spoon fed because I 
definitely do.

598
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:19,731
And when I go to these schools,
I see such a thirst for knowledge and 

599
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:22,310
honesty and facts and an exhaustion with
this nonsense.

600
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:27,311
But if you listen to the way the media 
talks either about millennials or 

601
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:30,971
whatever,
it's like they're the spoiled entitled 

602
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:30,971
generation.
And I'm not saying,

603
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:30,971
I'm not saying that a lot of them 
aren't,

604
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,980
but I genuinely think that,
that most people,

605
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:36,980
especially young people,
they want real answers,

606
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,960
not just like easy dribble.

607
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,910
No,
for sure.

608
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:40,470
And,
um,

609
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,940
I think a lot of this has to do with the
student unions.

610
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,080
And again,
I'm talking,

611
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:46,960
I'm obviously more familiar with the 
Canadian context of this,

612
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,010
um,
but the,

613
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,360
you know,
major schools,

614
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:51,820
University of Toronto,
York University in Ryerson University.

615
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:54,400
I go to University of Toronto,
run by black lives matter,

616
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,460
Ryerson,
black lives matter and feminist,

617
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,240
uh,
a university black lives matter.

618
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:03,241
I mean,
individuals that are part of the black 

619
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,281
lives matter.
Original organizations are the 

620
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,771
presidents,
vice president and all that of the 

621
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:07,771
student union.
And,

622
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:07,771
um,
I was,

623
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:11,551
uh,
president of the debate club for about 

624
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:11,551
three years,
the first three years of my schooling.

625
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:11,551
And I was like,
you know,

626
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,720
what would be really exciting to have a 
debate on racial,

627
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,520
racial issues.
I would love to.

628
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:17,500
I don't care if I'm on this side,
on the other side,

629
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,800
that would be such a good thing because 
all we're ever being bad is faced every 

630
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:22,800
corner.

631
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,430
There's some poster about being black 
and uft,

632
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:29,431
which by the way,
people just realized during the trump 

633
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:29,460
election,
we've been here for three years.

634
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,750
No one complained and all of a sudden 
trump is elected.

635
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:33,400
It's hard to be black.
Come on.

636
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,510
Um,
but yeah,

637
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:39,511
I,
I went to go talk to the school 

638
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:39,511
president and I said I would love to 
have this event.

639
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:40,570
All of that.
They shut me down.

640
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,060
They said anyone that goes in the other 
side,

641
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,960
on the opposite side is,
you know,

642
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,650
trying to question the humanity of black
people,

643
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,750
how dare they try.
And I was sitting there like,

644
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,370
I will be the one,
like,

645
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,810
what are you talking about?
But yeah,

646
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:54,640
they,
they canceled it and shut it down.

647
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,530
It's just so sad.
It was so excited for that.

648
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,560
So it's interesting.
I know you've been pretty critical of 

649
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,560
black lives matter and I want to get 
into that a little bit,

650
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,761
but the moment for me that I realized it
had morphed into something that I no 

651
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:08,590
longer felt was positive because at the 
beginning I did think it was basically a

652
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,610
positive movement or a grassroots 
movement that was making some sense and,

653
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:17,670
and addressing some important issues.
But the moment I realized that it 

654
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,750
jumped,
the shark was in Toronto actually at the

655
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,730
Toronto Pride Parade.
When they stopped the parade,

656
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:26,731
they literally stopped the parade from 
marching to demand that the organizers 

657
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:29,020
of the Gay Pride Parade,
another oppressed group,

658
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,810
uh,
submit to their demands.

659
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:36,811
Whatever their demands were,
that they were gonna focus on these 

660
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:36,811
issues.
And I thought,

661
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:40,591
wow,
what a perfect example of everything 

662
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:41,230
that's wrong with identity politics,
with the oppression,

663
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:42,310
Olympics,
the whole thing.

664
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,220
And then subsequently I saw a lot more

665
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,760
of that style of thinking happening 
throughout black lives matter.

666
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:50,670
But was that moment for you as someone 
that's from Toronto?

667
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:53,520
We met in Toronto,
is that,

668
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,530
was that a seminal moment for you?
For sure.

669
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,540
I mean,
I absolutely hate black lives matter 

670
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,381
Toronto,
I can't say much for many of the other 

671
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:03,381
black lives matter chapters,
but black lives matter.

672
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:08,241
Toronto is extremely toxic and divisive 
and I think it's mainly because we were 

673
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,850
getting so much better in terms of 
racial relations and people were getting

674
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:14,370
along and there wasn't really.
I mean I'm speaking for myself.

675
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,730
There wasn't really that many racism or 
racist acts happening,

676
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,770
but all of a sudden they erupt and they 
say,

677
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,771
you know,
black people feel uncomfortable during 

678
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,691
pride because of the police.
When again happens during the trump 

679
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:30,471
presidency,
it's like all of a sudden you're 

680
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:30,471
starting to feel oppressed and it blew 
my mind.

681
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:32,340
Stopping the pride parade.
I was so confused.

682
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,420
They stopped it for like an hour asking 
for demands that the police be banned 

683
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,180
and it's like being a gay police officer
isn't that?

684
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,620
And oppression.
And then they say,

685
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:42,330
okay,
but you can go without your uniform.

686
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,320
Are you kidding me?
No,

687
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:48,321
that's not the point.
The point is there was a stigma against 

688
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:48,321
being,
you know,

689
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,910
a police officer and gay being gay.
How dare you take that away from them.

690
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,830
And there were a lot of proposals,
by the way,

691
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,740
during the pride parade with officers 
and their uniform.

692
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,150
That's beautiful.
Like,

693
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,190
what are you really going to try to.
Marriage proposals.

694
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,520
Marriage proposals.
Yeah.

695
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:03,540
And I was like,
oh my God,

696
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,400
this is such a great thing.
But no,

697
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:05,630
no,
no.

698
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,490
Now they,
they've actually been banned.

699
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,120
They didn't,
they're not coming to the pride,

700
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:14,310
right?
Think for the next like five years or 

701
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,310
so.
Um,

702
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,030
but that actually was not the reason why
I started to hate blm.

703
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,690
Do you remember the Jordan Peterson free
speech event in Toronto?

704
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,280
Uh,
so he teaches at University of Toronto.

705
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:28,281
My school,
and this is actually when I started 

706
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,130
making videos.
It was because during the,

707
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:34,180
the event he,
this was his first public event after 

708
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,000
making the series of videos and um,
black lives matter was there,

709
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:38,340
you know,
just there are two sides I guess.

710
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,130
And I wasn't really picking aside,
it was also my very first protest.

711
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,830
I was just there to observe.
I was very confused as to why people are

712
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:45,570
yelling at each other.
But what's going on?

713
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,400
Oh,
I should have just got home.

714
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,590
Uh,
yeah.

715
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,430
So I,
I,

716
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,440
you know,
I observed the whole thing and it was 

717
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,881
pretty peaceful.
There are people of color went up there 

718
00:28:58,881 --> 00:28:58,881
and we're saying things like,
you know,

719
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,030
I don't feel oppressed.
This is one of the greatest countries in

720
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:01,470
the world.
Especially Toronto.

721
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,590
Like this is so diverse.
It's everyone loves each.

722
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,420
Everyone's nice to each other.
Um,

723
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,630
you know,
the black lives matter,

724
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:08,680
recalling them coons,
they're calling them sellouts,

725
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,760
they're yelling all these things.
And I immediately knew who the 

726
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,220
aggressors were.
I immediately knew who,

727
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,370
which side I did not want to be on.
I wasn't picking sides,

728
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:18,210
but I was like,
Oh God,

729
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,770
I stayed till the very end til the last 
person left because this was again first

730
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:27,771
protest.
I was like excited and talking to 

731
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:29,751
everyone.
I got home and there are articles that 

732
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:29,751
are posted by the school newspaper by 
Toronto,

733
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,860
Star about black people were,
you know,

734
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,660
called the n word.
They were harassed.

735
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:35,510
Someone brought dogs.
Someone brought up.

736
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,470
I was actually standing next to the 
person with the dogs.

737
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,730
So when apparently brought dogs to chase
off the black,

738
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:45,020
black people complete lies,
and that opened my eyes to like the 

739
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,811
media bias that didn't happen,
not even close to being happening to 

740
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:48,811
happen.

741
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:50,860
So it blew my mind that they would lie 
about that.

742
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,330
And then I personally messaged,
uh,

743
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,040
the leader of black lives matter 
instead,

744
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,110
I'm disappointed girl.
I was.

745
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:56,660
They're like,
what?

746
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:01,661
Why are you doing this?
And then I decided to start making 

747
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,920
videos because I said clearly they're 
getting the wrong information.

748
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:07,921
The school literally things.
Jordan Peterson was this Nazi that came 

749
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:09,580
and said I hate black people and women 
and transgenders and all of that.

750
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,910
So I just thought no one's going to do 
it.

751
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,160
I should do it.
And then I started making videos,

752
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:20,161
which was weird because I had to go to 
school the next day and then deal with 

753
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:20,161
it.

754
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:23,500
These people know what you,
you put your ass on the line and it's 

755
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:23,500
paid off.
Wait.

756
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,221
So did.
When you dim the black lives matter 

757
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:28,221
president,
did she respond to you?

758
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:29,500
Yeah,
she was wanting to me saying,

759
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:31,450
I'm,
I'm going to screenshot this,

760
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,940
uh,
to use against you in the future.

761
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:36,730
Why don't you say it to my face?
I still have it saved because I'm like,

762
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,740
I,
I'm gonna save this for the rest of my 

763
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:41,740
life.
Yeah.

764
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:41,740
The,
the president,

765
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,790
like the cofounder of black lives matter
Toronto said she's gonna I should stay,

766
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,900
stay to her face and she's going to use 
this against me.

767
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,070
The future.
Meanwhile,

768
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:50,860
all I said was I was there.
This was very inappropriate.

769
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,230
Why are you telling lies or making black
people feel like,

770
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,880
you know,
this is what actually happened.

771
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:59,881
You're making students feel like that's 
why students feel like they're being 

772
00:30:59,881 --> 00:30:59,881
oppressed because you're telling them.
Sorry,

773
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:00,130
what?
No,

774
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,280
what do you think these people,
and I don't mean just black lives matter

775
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,720
in this case,
but like this,

776
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,750
this type of person at a university,
whether it's from gender studies or 

777
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,030
whatever it is,
you know,

778
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,080
with all the identity politics stuff,
what do you think they actually want in 

779
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,950
the end?
Like if they were to get what they want,

780
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,030
what is that?

781
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,820
That's what I don't understand is that 
they are obviously fakes because if they

782
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:29,821
truly care about black liberation,
there are policies that you could point 

783
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,570
to that you can probably fix and help 
the black community.

784
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:36,571
And in Canada one of the things was a 
carding and that was actually 

785
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:38,890
immediately carding was gone.
I'm in Toronto,

786
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:43,891
Ontario.
I'm not sure either the province or the 

787
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:43,891
city.
Um,

788
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:43,891
but that's the one thing where I was 
like,

789
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:43,891
okay,
random stops.

790
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:48,781
I think that's something that you should
be stopped and it's done in inner city 

791
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:48,781
neighborhoods and blah,
blah,

792
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:49,300
blah.
Apart from that,

793
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:49,810
it's like,
okay,

794
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:52,030
what else do you want?
They want black professors.

795
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,880
They want to police out of pride that's 
not helping black people.

796
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,310
That's not changing their social 
economic status.

797
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,170
So what do you,
what is your goal?

798
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:01,840
I really don't understand because it's.
You don't care.

799
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,600
I don't want to say I do care.
I want to say like I'm,

800
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,930
I have all the solutions,
but I can tell you what to do.

801
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,330
But they're telling people false 
solutions.

802
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:13,630
They're telling them that we need all 
black professors to teach black people.

803
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,390
But I don't know what their,
what their goal is.

804
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:21,391
I don't know if it's money.
I guess I don't get it or you don't get 

805
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:22,190
it seriously.

806
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:27,310
Alright.
So let's shift to Jordan Peterson a 

807
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:27,950
little bit because you are a student at 
the University of Toronto.

808
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:30,230
That's where he's been teaching for many
years.

809
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:34,100
This whole kerfuffle over transgender 
person.

810
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,350
All his fault that the school is so like
everyone's yelling at each other and 

811
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,440
hate each other.
I blame him.

812
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,220
What's the atmosphere like at the 
school?

813
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,100
Actually he's not teaching there right 
now.

814
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:46,580
We could obviously he's on tour and the 
book and the whole thing,

815
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,610
but how has the atmosphere change then,
do you think it's directly related to 

816
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,840
some of the stuff that he on earth?
I think it has changed because there you

817
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:57,920
can see the groups and when someone has 
a slightly right wing or.

818
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,040
It's funny because the fact that they 
associate individualism and the fact 

819
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,180
that they associate thinking for 
yourself with being right wing,

820
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,560
it's like,
why would you want to do that?

821
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,880
It should not be anyways.
Why wouldn't you want to be right wing?

822
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,440
Right,
exactly.

823
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,140
Exactly,
like what?

824
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,820
Yeah.
Uh,

825
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:18,821
so the,
when you're a little bit more right 

826
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:19,400
wing,
I guess they tend to say that,

827
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:24,401
you know,
you are a Jordan Peterson fan and you 

828
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:25,130
hate transgenders and blah blah blah,
like there's a clear divide you can tell

829
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:26,450
which side people are on.

830
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,070
Um,
but I,

831
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:33,230
yeah,
I think it was bound to happen 

832
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,230
regardless and just again because of the
trump presidency to like,

833
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,130
can we just blame trump for everything?
Yes.

834
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,210
You're in America now in California too.
So that's how I view it as kind of a 

835
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:46,550
necessary evil that he sort of got this 
stuff.

836
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,120
I mean,
again,

837
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:48,440
it goes to what we were talking about 
earlier,

838
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:52,640
like some of these people get these 
issues out there and then hopefully some

839
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:53,840
goodness.
Yeah.

840
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,430
Yeah,
definitely.

841
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:58,730
And um,
I think the other thing is trump allowed

842
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:00,050
people,
like I said earlier,

843
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:05,051
to think for themselves in the sense to 
understand that maybe not everything is 

844
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:09,041
how it seems.
Maybe things that I'm learning is not 

845
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:09,041
exactly how it is and you know,
I,

846
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,180
you know,
I may disagree with his politics because

847
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm a liberal in general.
Um,

848
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,030
but I do think that yeah,
it was bound to happen and trump kind of

849
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:20,270
shook things up and allow a lot more 
people are engaging in politics now,

850
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,150
which is so exciting and also really 
scary at the same time.

851
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,040
Or is it that it,
I mean that's it right there.

852
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:27,470
I think just this morning I tweeted 
something out to that effect.

853
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:28,430
It's like,
wow,

854
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,580
it's incredibly exciting.
It doesn't mean things are going to be 

855
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:33,580
good.
I actually,

856
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,960
uh,
I believe things actually are going to 

857
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,600
get better because there's so many cool 
new young people like yourself out there

858
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:43,601
putting out ideas like I have hope,
but yet doesn't mean that that's how 

859
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:44,690
it's gonna go.
It might go the other way.

860
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,080
But then the other thing is that because
I'm the far left are scared that people 

861
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,430
are starting to do more research you to 
Google things.

862
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,690
Nowadays they've started to,
that's why they want to control google.

863
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:01,370
Exactly.
So now you can't find any information.

864
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:02,580
You can only find there's.
Yeah.

865
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,930
But now they're changing definitions of 
things.

866
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:08,780
So I mean the definition of racism is no
longer individual.

867
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,720
It has to do with power plus privilege.
So in other words,

868
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,180
only white people can be racist towards 
minorities.

869
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:15,980
Minorities cannot be racist towards 
white people.

870
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Um,
they've also taken hold of the student 

871
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,320
unions and Jordan Peterson has talked 
about this a lot.

872
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,070
I'm so sorry,
what was the question that generally was

873
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,760
about Jordan and being a student at 
University of Toronto that.

874
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,450
So just keep going.
Yeah.

875
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,510
I just feel like I'm,
the student unions are just influencing 

876
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,230
a lot of the students and they're 
influencing a lot of the events that are

877
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:37,860
happening.
They,

878
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,050
they claim to speak on behalf of all 
students.

879
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:45,051
So,
and they claim that they're fighting 

880
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:45,051
against racism except they define it a 
different way.

881
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:49,430
I was going to go against someone that 
says we're fighting against racism and 

882
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,010
sexism and every other buzzword that 
they can throw out there,

883
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:51,600
you have to accept it.
Um,

884
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,850
and because they've changed the 
definition of racism,

885
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,490
they've started to have events and there
was a white privileged conference,

886
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:00,300
which I actually did a video on at 
Ryerson University.

887
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:05,301
Yeah.
So that's the way that they're 

888
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:05,301
countering it.
They're countering the facts with just,

889
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:09,861
you know,
all that alternative facts with their 

890
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:09,861
own,
a BS,

891
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,880
feminist studies ideas,
I don't even know,

892
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,680
but that's,
I guess the way they're doing it.

893
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,500
They're trying to influence students 
from schools,

894
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,660
so then when they get out they can 
become more liberal.

895
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,890
So the things that Jordan talks about 
when he talks about the individual and 

896
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,490
when he talks about why the government 
shouldn't be able to talk,

897
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,240
tell you what pronouns do you use,
et Cetera,

898
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:31,241
et cetera.
You see these things as all directly 

899
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:31,580
related to everything else that you've 
been talking about here.

900
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,180
Yeah,
no,

901
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,010
for sure.
And I think it's also about,

902
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,480
um,

903
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,080
sorry I just blanked.
We were at a Jordan event,

904
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:41,090
that's where we met about a month ago in
Toronto.

905
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,640
And was it a white supremacists

906
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,790
man?
I was stoned on my way out.

907
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,180
I mean,
but were you surprised at all when you 

908
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,270
saw what type of girl and an interesting
diverse young.

909
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,690
I think most of them I've been telling 
people it's about 60 slash 40 male to 

910
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,951
female,
but sometimes it's even closer to 50 

911
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:05,951
slash 50.

912
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:05,951
Yeah,
no,

913
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:07,040
I think it's pretty diverse and I've 
gone to several events,

914
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,820
political events,
I guess where I look in the crowd,

915
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:10,270
I'm like,
wow,

916
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,160
there's a lot of minorities here.
There's women here,

917
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:13,600
there's men here,
there's everyone here,

918
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,720
and sorry,
where I where I blanked was the idea 

919
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:18,790
that you can't.
You can't debate something.

920
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:23,791
That's where that was the whole pd.
I'm like ranting here so I can get you 

921
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,980
all excited because I was there so he 
has this effect on people,

922
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,060
but the fact that you can't debate 
certain topic,

923
00:37:31,061 --> 00:37:36,061
the fact that you can debate whether or 
not we should use certain pronouns 

924
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:36,061
because they say,
well,

925
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:37,150
you're questioning my identity.
You're questioning me as a person.

926
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:42,151
My humanity.
They turn it around and make it sound 

927
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:44,311
like you hate that person.
And that's the thing is it's not like I 

928
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:44,311
agree with Peterson or I agree with the,
you know,

929
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:46,150
the students.
I just want to hear both sides.

930
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:47,460
That's all I'm asking for.
Something.

931
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,480
We can all make an informed conclusion,
but they don't want you to hear both 

932
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,221
sides.
They want you to hear their side and 

933
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:56,770
that is the only site you see what 
happened with Lindsay Shepherd as well,

934
00:37:56,771 --> 00:38:01,771
where she played a peterson debates 
where they're all sides and they don't 

935
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,220
want you to hear that.
They only want you to hear their side.

936
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,290
And that's where,
that's one thing I hate the most is just

937
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:06,270
the lack of discussion.

938
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:11,330
Yeah.
So I'm glad you brought up Lindsey 

939
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:11,330
because that also is happening in 
Canada.

940
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,511
That was at Wilfrid laurier university.
Now there's a lawsuit that she's 

941
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:16,890
involved in and I suspect I read some of
the initial brief.

942
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:21,891
I mean,
I think this thing is going to be a 

943
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:21,891
bloodbath diversity,
um,

944
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:24,990
but what does that say is happening in 
Canada in a larger way?

945
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,400
I think you've kind of hit on this a 
little bit,

946
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:27,970
like you guys are almost having like 
this,

947
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:31,980
like trump hangover or something where,
or even the black lives matter thing,

948
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,020
like it didn't start in America as you 
said,

949
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,400
race relations were different in Canada.

950
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,270
I would argue they're still great here.
It doesn't for sure.

951
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,860
Kevin Canadians are just nicer.
Okay.

952
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,180
Just generally you guys,
you know,

953
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:48,940
we've done two shows in Toronto and the 
shows were totally nice and pleasant,

954
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,460
but like we've gone to some other cities
where,

955
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,320
and I find it's usually in the 
progressive cities,

956
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:58,650
so it's been in San Francisco and it's 
been in Seattle and a couple of the 

957
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,650
others where the crowds are the craziest
most rockets,

958
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,220
which is what I like those because they 
kind of,

959
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,680
they need his message.
Toronto,

960
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:08,710
you guys were very pleasant,
very pleasant.

961
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,500
Think we're getting to a point where we 
need his message.

962
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:16,501
I think it's getting a little scary,
especially with a trudeau our prime 

963
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:20,401
minister,
he's kind of going to a lot of the 

964
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,040
social justice warrior and um,
the fact that he's even,

965
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,650
you know,
talking to black lives matter Toronto,

966
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,680
who know the leader,
one of the leaders said she wants to 

967
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:28,680
kill a white man.

968
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,880
She tweeted that she wished she could 
kill all white men and the other one 

969
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,180
actually stole $300,000
from my student union,

970
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,480
stole it and said that she on her last 
day,

971
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:42,481
she filed her overtime and she's filed 
thousands of hours of overtime and said 

972
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:46,960
$300,000
worth of one of our entire budget of our

973
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:49,750
student unions by a third and here's the
best part of it.

974
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,780
She files that.
Obviously there's alerts that go off.

975
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:55,940
You can't take that much money for what 
are your student union president?

976
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,150
$300,000.
Sure.

977
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:00,640
There aren't that many hours in the day,
but here's the thing.

978
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:05,641
She claimed that the majority of those 
hours come from work that she does for 

979
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:06,040
the black community for like black lives
matter.

980
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,460
That doesn't count.
No one is asking you that's not 

981
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,460
affiliated with the school.
No one's asking you.

982
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,420
Whatever you do at home has nothing to 
do with that.

983
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,650
I always.
The school obviously said they wanted 

984
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,521
the money back.
They try to sue her and they started a 

985
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:21,010
whole campaign saying,
my university is anti black,

986
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,530
and then they started to put posters up.
They got gathered,

987
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:28,531
a bunch of people saying that you're 
their only suing her because she's 

988
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:29,190
black.
You stole $300,000.

989
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,970
You took $300,000.
Girl like,

990
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,220
are you because you're a black,
are you kidding me?

991
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,810
Does that not even.
Anyway,

992
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,630
she,
you know,

993
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,340
they vandalized the student union.
They have megaphones starts yelling,

994
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,620
saying anti black racism happened to 
your hands.

995
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,930
And it was just this whole ordeal.
Like it's,

996
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,710
Ugh,
Gosh.

997
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:49,711
Anyways,
what have you found the best arguments 

998
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:49,960
to get people your age to wake up to 
some of this stuff?

999
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,990
Like,
I know obviously they're watching your 

1000
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:54,990
videos,
probably your,

1001
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,280
your prime way of doing it,
but if you found simple arguments,

1002
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:01,630
simple phrases or whatever that you can 
use to get some people out of this.

1003
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,640
Everything can be explained away through
a social economic standpoint.

1004
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,740
A lot of the issues that the black 
community faces because they're poor,

1005
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,920
which is the same issues that poor white
community space as well.

1006
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,140
And,
um,

1007
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,520
I,
I,

1008
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,540
you know,
there examples of black Americans and 

1009
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,730
Black Canadians that do,
do well to do well and uh,

1010
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,580
you have to look at why they're doing 
well.

1011
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,650
Okay.
So they have higher education,

1012
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,210
you know,
there's,

1013
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,250
they're both parents at home.
There were all these different factors 

1014
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:32,250
to look at it and then it's like,
oh,

1015
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,650
so it's not just the color,
my skin,

1016
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,290
it's either choices or I make or the 
area I'm in,

1017
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,650
the surroundings I'm in or the school I 
went to rather than just,

1018
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,390
it's the color of my skin.
Um,

1019
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,540
but I think you just have to break it 
down to that before a lot of people can 

1020
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,160
understand where I'm coming from and why
they think a certain way.

1021
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,090
Um,
it's just,

1022
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,530
it's easy to just to say,
well,

1023
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:53,420
it's because I'm black and I'm not doing
as well.

1024
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,200
It's,
no,

1025
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,290
there's,
there's so many different ways to 

1026
00:41:59,290 --> 00:41:59,290
explain it.

1027
00:41:59,290 --> 00:41:59,290
How do you rub up all the stuff that 
they might say about you?

1028
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,730
Because I have enough friends that are 
black conservatives or,

1029
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,270
or are kind of liberal,
whatever you want to call it,

1030
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,380
that the things that I see good that 
gets said about them all time.

1031
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,150
Every time Larry elder comes and does my
show and I look on twitter,

1032
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,310
the things that.
The things that's the suppose ID 

1033
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:16,310
tolerant people,
right?

1034
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,600
The progressives,
the lefties that they say about this man

1035
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,580
who I know is being authentic.
Well,

1036
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,810
it's ridiculous.
I mean I get a lot of hate comments 

1037
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:25,810
where it's,
you know,

1038
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,690
they'll call me coon.
They say hate myself.

1039
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,370
I want to be white.
All these different things.

1040
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:31,730
It's the one part is like me speaking 
this way or speaking,

1041
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:34,160
I guess I don't want to say proper 
English per se,

1042
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,400
but I'm trying to be white.
I'm trying to be something I'm not and 

1043
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,251
it's like,
why are you fitting people a race in a 

1044
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:44,441
group?
You're just allowing white people just 

1045
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:44,441
to say,
well,

1046
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:46,070
black people are just dumb because it 
means saying we all act the same way and

1047
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,380
we should all think the same way.
That means you can.

1048
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,870
Every black person can be explained with
one statement.

1049
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,970
That's not fair.
It let us all be individuals.

1050
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,971
In fact,
you should be fighting for us to be 

1051
00:42:57,971 --> 00:42:57,971
individuals and have our own ideas.

1052
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:00,260
Why are we trying to form groups?
And then they wonder why,

1053
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,290
why there's all these like white 
supremacist groups forming up because 

1054
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:05,290
you've already.
It's a sites thing.

1055
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,220
You said there's our side and there's 
your side through like,

1056
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:07,730
okay,
sure,

1057
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,800
we'll form a group I guess and go 
against you.

1058
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,090
Um,
but yeah,

1059
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:16,091
I mean I don't,
a lot of the hate comments are just 

1060
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:16,091
useless.
I ignore the epithets,

1061
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:18,830
but I do try to understand a lot of the 
criticism and again,

1062
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,900
it's just not understanding where I'm 
coming from.

1063
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:21,690
It's not,
you know,

1064
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,360
getting their stocks from the right 
place,

1065
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:28,361
the root.com
or onion is not somewhere to get your 

1066
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:29,960
facts right,
but that you compare those.

1067
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,370
But when I,
um,

1068
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,400
you know,
get into a detailed discussion with a 

1069
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,371
lot of them,
then they understand where I'm coming 

1070
00:43:39,371 --> 00:43:39,371
from and it's like there's this light 
that shines.

1071
00:43:39,371 --> 00:43:40,080
And they do that at my school a lot as 
well.

1072
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:41,990
At where someone that absolutely hates 
me,

1073
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,140
I spend a whole day talking to them and 
at the end I call it like it's really 

1074
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,440
awful to use this conversion therapy or 
to say that we're not electrocuting no,

1075
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,040
but by the end of it it's like their 
minds are blown because they just 

1076
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,610
believed everything.
Black lives matter said everything the 

1077
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:00,710
mainstream left media have said,
so it's.

1078
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,570
I think it's just you just got to talk 
to them.

1079
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,760
They don't want to talk.
They're stuck in an echo chamber.

1080
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,040
This

1081
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,210
intersectionality in this combining of 
perceived depressions,

1082
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,440
something that will just sort of crap 
out under its own weight.

1083
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,600
So like for example,
if you're going to keep saying,

1084
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:18,880
well black people should or this 
minority,

1085
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:23,881
whatever that minority is,
should get easier entrance to this or 

1086
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:27,151
access to this or whatever.
What you're actually saying is while 

1087
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:29,791
other people are going to have to be 
punished based on their immutable 

1088
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:29,800
characteristics,
we see this now.

1089
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,460
I mean,
I see a massive happening with the Asian

1090
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:37,140
community right now in America because 
by every metric that we judge success,

1091
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:42,141
they are succeeding at extremely high 
levels because of hard work and 

1092
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:42,810
education and commitment to family.
But if you're going to start saying,

1093
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,820
well,
we're going to have to take less of them

1094
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,560
because we have to take more of other 
people.

1095
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,900
You're actually setting these groups to 
hate each other.

1096
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,080
Yeah.
That is so deep.

1097
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,120
Exactly.
And you're telling one group that they 

1098
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,120
can't do it on their own.
And um,

1099
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,230
there is some studies,
I forgot who it was who wrote it,

1100
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:59,570
but it was called the mismatch theory,
which is,

1101
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:04,571
um,
a lot of the minority students are 

1102
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:04,571
getting thrown in.
Universities are not qualified,

1103
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:05,240
actually turn out worse when they come 
out.

1104
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:10,241
They don't get jobs because they don't 
have the actual skills that they needed 

1105
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:10,241
to get in.
But yeah,

1106
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,260
it creates this kind of tension.
Why would you tell someone that,

1107
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:14,090
you know,
there are more important just because of

1108
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:16,460
the color of your skin.
It's going to piss other people off.

1109
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,240
Um,
it's,

1110
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,650
I don't think that's a way to move 
forward.

1111
00:45:18,651 --> 00:45:20,420
I don't think that's a way to progress,
but yeah,

1112
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,480
and the whole intersectionality thing,
it's,

1113
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:24,620
it's ridiculous.
The Pride Parade,

1114
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,420
I guess in Toronto is an example of 
that.

1115
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:30,650
It's like my issues are more important.
And then obviously the Lgbtq community,

1116
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,680
they all hated that and they were all 
very upset with it because it's like 

1117
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,070
pride is one of the most inclusive 
events in the,

1118
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:42,071
in the city.
Why are you trying to ruin it and say 

1119
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:42,140
this is a black thing.
It's an everybody thing.

1120
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,390
We're,
we're all advocating for everyone here.

1121
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,490
So it's,
it's,

1122
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,230
they're just going to go into ruined 
themselves that they keep adding.

1123
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,200
So speaking of that,
I saw the thing that you did,

1124
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:56,060
you were not happy when they put the 
black and brown stripes into the rainbow

1125
00:45:56,061 --> 00:46:01,061
flag,
which I also thought was completely 

1126
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,981
ridiculous.
The whole point is that this is for 

1127
00:46:02,981 --> 00:46:05,561
everybody.
We're not looking at all your 

1128
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:05,561
differences.

1129
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:05,561
Racist.
Yeah.

1130
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:07,810
But reverse segregation,
I really don't get it.

1131
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,000
The white privilege conference advising 
university,

1132
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,300
that's reversed segregation and I 
actually gave them the benefit of the 

1133
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:15,300
doubt.
I'm like,

1134
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,900
I'm going to ignore the name,
I'm going to actually try to see what 

1135
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,990
they're trying to teach.
And ultimately the end,

1136
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,200
the conclusion of this event was listen 
to people,

1137
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,350
listen to what people are saying.
So anecdotes only listened to people's 

1138
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:28,350
feelings.
So it's like,

1139
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,530
that's not how you form a society.
It's the majority were white women.

1140
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,560
They were just sitting there hearing 
black people tell them,

1141
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,740
just listen to our stories because we 
know and we experience it and you know 

1142
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,550
you have to have a black spaces.
In fact,

1143
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:44,530
there is someone that tweeted during the
event saying,

1144
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,740
I'm a woman just rose her hand to speak 
while white splaining wait for the for 

1145
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,760
later where we have our white corner so 
we can talk about,

1146
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:52,480
you know,
art,

1147
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,990
what is this?
What kind of society are we preparing 

1148
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,410
herself for?
It's literally reversed segregation,

1149
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,450
segregation in the true sense of the 
word.

1150
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,320
And I,
yeah,

1151
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:03,710
I really don't.
What,

1152
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,830
what do you make of the guilty white 
allies?

1153
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,070
Those people,
you know,

1154
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:13,071
when I've had a,
I know you met Bret Weinstein from 

1155
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:13,440
evergreen and heather,
his wife,

1156
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,780
I'm one of the things that fascinated me
most when he was going through the 

1157
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,671
ordeal there was that he said he never 
feared the black students physically or 

1158
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:24,860
the brown students or whatever it was.
The,

1159
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,530
it was the white allies he said that had
this sort of look in their eye,

1160
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:31,420
like they,
the ones that could get violent and I've

1161
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,800
seen that,
that look,

1162
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,090
what do you make of that data?

1163
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,110
He treated because it's hard to.
Because there,

1164
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,740
if you're not black then.
I mean they're trying to explain it.

1165
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:43,570
If you're not black then you don't 
experience it,

1166
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,900
then you don't understand it.
So as a white ally you have to just take

1167
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:48,090
everything,
you know,

1168
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,850
an activist says to you as fat as this 
is what is happening.

1169
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,530
I'm one of the speakers actually,
he did an interview for the Toronto Star

1170
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,150
and they asked him and that was like,
okay,

1171
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:03,151
what?
Where do you see white privilege in 

1172
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:03,151
Toronto?
And he said literally,

1173
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:06,220
I mean I'm paraphrasing,
but he said when you walk into a store,

1174
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,580
black people or black people have to 
think about the fact that people are 

1175
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:11,580
watching them.
Okay,

1176
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:11,580
sure.
I was like,

1177
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:11,680
fine,
whatever.

1178
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,150
But apparently black people have to pay 
for items in one section before they can

1179
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:18,880
move to another section so they don't 
get accused of stealing.

1180
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,310
That's his,
his.

1181
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,170
He got a chance to tell us what white 
privilege is.

1182
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,090
And that was his example of white 
privilege.

1183
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:26,330
Is that happening?
And no,

1184
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,790
I've never.
It's never happened.

1185
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,920
I've worked retail for like the most of 
my life.

1186
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:35,170
What you're going to pay the kids 
section before you go to the men's 

1187
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,340
section.
Like what world is this guy living in my

1188
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:41,341
mind and another one did an article 
where it's how the outdoors is racist 

1189
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:43,220
and how people feel like the,
you know,

1190
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:48,330
skiing and hiking and everything is a 
white space and therefore black people 

1191
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:48,430
don't want to go to it.
And it's like,

1192
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:53,431
who you're saying it,
you were the one that are making these 

1193
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:53,431
claims.
Why are we there?

1194
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,450
It's just more division.
It's more like,

1195
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,230
it just,
it pisses me off.

1196
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,020
Yeah.
You know what?

1197
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,130
Because you're visiting La for a couple 
of days,

1198
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:04,450
I don't have a ton of time,
but maybe we could go on a quick hike 

1199
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:04,450
and see what happens.

1200
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,330
Black woman,
but it just like,

1201
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:12,360
you're obviously don't care about the 
betterments of the black community 

1202
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,080
because he wouldn't be talking about 
these non issues here in the stage.

1203
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,130
You can talk about,
you know,

1204
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,450
uh,
sorry,

1205
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:19,300
how old the education system works.
You can talk about the war on drugs.

1206
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:23,710
You can talk about the prison system,
but yet the amount of people they got to

1207
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,711
protest the Trayvon Martin shooting.
If you can get that many people to 

1208
00:49:28,711 --> 00:49:31,000
protest the war on drugs,
you can probably make a change.

1209
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:36,150
But no,
they're going to focus on police 

1210
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,600
shootings is one of the least things 
that are actually affecting black 

1211
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,841
Americans.
But yet that's what they want to put 

1212
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:42,841
their focus on.

1213
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:43,160
So how much of the root of that is just 
lazy thinking.

1214
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:47,330
Like it's easy to get people genned up 
about a shooting per se,

1215
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,400
and I'm not,
I'm not diminishing that are wrong.

1216
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,270
Obviously it's easier to take all of the
anecdotal stuff.

1217
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,570
The woman at the shopping center who 
this happened to you or that.

1218
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,590
Yeah,
it's always easier to do that than to 

1219
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:04,590
really be like,
let's really look at the prison systems,

1220
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,160
which I would be for looking.
Yeah.

1221
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:11,190
I would be figuring out ways that we can
do better education to minority 

1222
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,250
communities that have been neglected.
All of those things,

1223
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,430
but those things aren't really sexy.
They're not like the things that get 

1224
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:18,430
people out on the streets for more than 
a day.

1225
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,660
It's the other stuff.
So part of this is just human nature,

1226
00:50:20,661 --> 00:50:20,870
right?

1227
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,070
Yeah,
I totally agree.

1228
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:22,780
I mean,
I,

1229
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,950
I can base all my arguments on 
anecdotes,

1230
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,630
but that doesn't like,
that means nothing to me.

1231
00:50:26,631 --> 00:50:31,631
I can say,
oh well this one day I've lived in 

1232
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:31,631
Toronto all my life and I've never 
experienced racism.

1233
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:33,500
I'm not going to use that as facts,
but yeah,

1234
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:38,501
but it's so much easier to do so it's so
much easier to play with the 

1235
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:39,170
heartstrings and say like,
this is what's really happening,

1236
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,440
but it's just,
it's just sad that there are actual 

1237
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,661
policies that can be changed or put in 
place that could actually uplift the 

1238
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:47,240
black community,
but you know,

1239
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:52,241
none of the people that are claimed to 
be the activist care and especially the 

1240
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:53,770
celebrities,
which really annoys me beyond seeing Jay

1241
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:54,810
z,
all they do is talk about,

1242
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:56,010
you know,
black rights and blah blah.

1243
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,070
Why don't you use your billion dollars 
to,

1244
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:03,071
you know,
create some rehabilitation center for 

1245
00:51:03,071 --> 00:51:03,071
people that are getting out of prison.

1246
00:51:03,071 --> 00:51:03,770
Why don't you try to fight for the war 
on drugs?

1247
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:06,260
Like it's all these things where it's,
it's.

1248
00:51:06,261 --> 00:51:06,800
Yeah,
it's,

1249
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:08,480
it's easy just to say,
oh look,

1250
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,560
there's a shooting,
you know,

1251
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,630
this is what black people experience 
every day and you know,

1252
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:12,890
white people are racist.
The end.

1253
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,730
No,
it's,

1254
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,370
there's,
I don't know,

1255
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,420
it's easier for them to just to say,
look at this anecdote and this shooting 

1256
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,901
and that's what's affecting us.
But there's so many other things that 

1257
00:51:22,901 --> 00:51:23,150
could be done.
A little bit of my appearance,

1258
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,220
a university,
New Hampshire when those kids were.

1259
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,010
Oh yeah,
that one woman who,

1260
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:33,011
I don't think it was a student,
I think she was either a mother of a 

1261
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:33,011
student or,
or 10 advisors.

1262
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:34,460
And when she kept saying,
you know,

1263
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,520
these kids pointing to the black kids 
could get shot when they walk out of 

1264
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,421
here.
She's talking about a university of New 

1265
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:43,421
Hampshire.

1266
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:43,421
And it's like,
I actually,

1267
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:48,101
that was one of the only moments where I
didn't know what to say because it's so 

1268
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:50,090
crazy to say that like,
you're not going to be shot and you walk

1269
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:55,091
out of here.
And I think I maybe said something to 

1270
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:55,091
that effect.
But like,

1271
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:56,120
it's like that's really dangerous,
that line of thinking.

1272
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,180
I totally agree.
And I was actually having a headline to 

1273
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:01,670
a comedy club the other day and there's 
this guy on stage.

1274
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:05,450
He was like typical inner city black 
youth or whatever.

1275
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,530
And uh,
he,

1276
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,540
after he had stopped,
he came to sit at my table.

1277
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:10,760
Everyone was gone and he made a comment 
saying,

1278
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,430
wow,
it was really hard to be a black woman 

1279
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:16,430
in this country and this is again,
this is Canada.

1280
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,840
I feel like there's no excuses for 
Canada.

1281
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,740
Like,
get Outta here.

1282
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,480
And they asked him,
okay,

1283
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:20,990
how?

1284
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,100
And he's just like,
I don't know,

1285
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:24,320
it's just,
it's really hard to be a woman in black.

1286
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:24,950
I'm like,
yeah,

1287
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:26,560
I get the whole woman thing because you 
know,

1288
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,000
men are physically bigger and blah blah 
blah.

1289
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:34,130
Um,
but why is it hard for me to be black 

1290
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,130
in,
in Toronto specifically?

1291
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,130
And he was like,
you know,

1292
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,130
cause,
you know,

1293
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,750
it's just white privilege.
I'm like,

1294
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:35,960
no,
no,

1295
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:37,220
no.
Give me two reasons.

1296
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,940
Give me concrete reasons could not come 
up with one because there isn't.

1297
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:43,220
You can't come up with when you have to 
use the anecdotes,

1298
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:44,390
you have to use the,
you know,

1299
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,340
if you walk out the street,
you're going to get shot.

1300
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:51,430
Why?
What are the statistics of people that 

1301
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,430
get shot by police?
Oh seven get shot by police per year.

1302
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,690
And it's not recorded by race and it's 
also doesn't tell us if they're armed or

1303
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,720
unarmed,
seven people and you're telling me 

1304
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:58,720
you're more likely to walk out the door 
as a black person get shot.

1305
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,300
That's not an epidemic.
It's an epidemic.

1306
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,620
The crime in black communities,
that's an epidemic.

1307
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:06,050
But you want to ignore that and just 
talk about the other.

1308
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:11,051
Yeah.
Anecdote that pull at the heartstrings 

1309
00:53:11,051 --> 00:53:12,980
and make people feel guilty and oh,
it's a waste of time.

1310
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:17,981
It's such a waste of time.
But what do your parents think about 

1311
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:17,981
what you're doing?
Well,

1312
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:22,201
they are conservative so they love it.
So what makes you not conservative with.

1313
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:24,230
So if someone was to say you're,
you're conservative.

1314
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:26,460
I watch your videos,
talk about conservatism

1315
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,510
is not that bad,
blah,

1316
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:32,511
blah blah.
Why would you not say you're sort of 

1317
00:53:32,511 --> 00:53:32,880
putting aside the exhaustion of labels.

1318
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:38,060
Okay.
Well I will say I'm fiscally 

1319
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,661
conservative.
So I guess I do believe in like lower 

1320
00:53:40,661 --> 00:53:41,210
taxes in some sense.
I do believe in the free market.

1321
00:53:41,211 --> 00:53:42,120
I do believe in,
you know,

1322
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,940
less regulations,
all that fun stuff.

1323
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:49,360
But at the same time,
I do think that there should be some 

1324
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,610
sort of social safety net and uh,
you know,

1325
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:52,820
living in Canada where there is no,
I'm sorry,

1326
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,010
free health,
not free healthcare,

1327
00:53:55,011 --> 00:53:58,460
universal healthcare and you know,
at the universal education,

1328
00:53:58,461 --> 00:54:03,461
the education system is amazing.
The funding for the education system is 

1329
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:03,461
amazing.
It.

1330
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:06,350
So stuff like that where I think I'm a 
little bit more liberal where I do think

1331
00:54:06,351 --> 00:54:09,230
the government should help in some way,
but it's because I'm used to it.

1332
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:14,231
It's what I grew up with and I haven't 
really seen anything different and it 

1333
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:14,600
works,
works fine.

1334
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,900
So I guess that.
And I'm pro choice.

1335
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:22,901
Um,
so stuff like that where I really do 

1336
00:54:22,901 --> 00:54:23,120
stand firm in my liberal views and ideas
and then,

1337
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,830
yeah,
I'm fiscally conservative.

1338
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,740
Yeah.
Well we're pretty much aligned.

1339
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:31,150
Finally found somebody.
Now we can go out hiking or we can start

1340
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,600
beating people.
Exactly.

1341
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,510
I don't know what we're supposed to be.
Once you find an ally,

1342
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,510
then you start attacking other people.
I think that's how it works.

1343
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,450
Something like that.
Where do you want to go with all this?

1344
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:41,950
I've seen,
I've seen your channel grow,

1345
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:42,960
I think obviously,
you know,

1346
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,840
having you here,
it'll,

1347
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:46,210
it'll help boost your profile a little 
bit.

1348
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,370
You can go into politics.
What are you going to do?

1349
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:52,110
Prime Minister of Canada,
take out that Trudeau guy with his fancy

1350
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,960
socks.
What do you mean?

1351
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,580
Oh Gosh.
Um,

1352
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:00,550
or maybe maybe Peterson will do it,
but you could probably be in his 

1353
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:00,550
cabinet.

1354
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:00,550
Yeah,
definitely.

1355
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:01,190
Sorry.
Well,

1356
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:07,290
I'm enjoying what I'm doing now and I'm 
quite surprised that people even enjoy 

1357
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,391
watching my videos.
It's like it's cool to do something you 

1358
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,440
love and people like it as well.
Like I really am having fun doing it and

1359
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:16,350
I think I would probably go into 
politics later in life.

1360
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:19,530
I mean I am doing political science.
It has to be useful somewhere.

1361
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,410
I've been toying around with law,
but again,

1362
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:24,560
I'm not sure if I really want to be in,
you know,

1363
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,630
the whole.
I don't know if I want to deal with law 

1364
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:29,630
school,
but,

1365
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,590
and I am starting actually a podcast 
with my boyfriend,

1366
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:34,520
which I will be uploading very soon.
Nice.

1367
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,380
Yeah.
Uh,

1368
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:40,650
the way we should tell people,
still find out otherwise your boyfriend 

1369
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,001
is white,
right into it means you could have 

1370
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:45,870
potentially children who look black.
They might look white.

1371
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,280
Look,
a little bit of both.

1372
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,120
You've talked about that a little bit.
It doesn't really matter to you.

1373
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,640
No,
of course not.

1374
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,160
No.
Uh,

1375
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,210
yeah.
My boyfriend being white has been used 

1376
00:55:59,210 --> 00:55:59,210
as like an attack against me saying 
like,

1377
00:55:59,210 --> 00:55:59,210
wow,
look at you.

1378
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:04,100
What did they say?
Sleeping with the devil or something 

1379
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:04,100
like that.
And it's just,

1380
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,760
it seems like a decent fella.
He's a great guy playing Nintendo.

1381
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:07,810
No,
he's a great guy.

1382
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,590
But again,
it's,

1383
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,640
it's the whole idea of why are you 
creating more a divisiveness and then 

1384
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,731
saying you want equality.
Why are you saying a black woman being 

1385
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:17,731
with a white man is bad?
And then say,

1386
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:18,430
wow,
white people are mean to me.

1387
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,130
Like you either want equality or you 
don't.

1388
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,590
You either want individuality or you 
don't pick one.

1389
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:24,870
You can't have both.
You can't.

1390
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,130
I'm sorry.
But yeah.

1391
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:28,390
Um,
yeah,

1392
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:31,510
I'm,
I'm not 100 percent sure where exactly I

1393
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:34,360
will be in the next five years.
I'm having fun with what I'm doing now.

1394
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,210
I work for the National Post,
which I absolutely love.

1395
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,280
Um,
and then I have the podcast coming,

1396
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:42,850
so that's what I'm going to do for now.
And maybe I might get into politics,

1397
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:43,420
but.
Oh,

1398
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:48,540
it's so messy.
The fact that you even are go in that 

1399
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:48,540
far right now.

1400
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,870
You're doing it.
Oh God.

1401
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,300
I hate to tell you.
I can see it now.

1402
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,970
Exciting.
I'll have somebody to support and care.

1403
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,650
You know what you get.
You do something in Canada where you run

1404
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,950
and you become something.
Mayors,

1405
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,840
something you want to do.
I will consider moving all my tickets.

1406
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,170
I will give you,
if you can pull it off,

1407
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,290
it will be a big freaking test.
See what happens.

1408
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,970
Definitely.
You think I do.

1409
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:13,840
Okay.
There are white guy.

1410
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,850
Oh No,
I'm sorry.

1411
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,600
You're done.
You're done.

1412
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:21,601
You're done for it.
You're going to have to start giving me 

1413
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:21,601
like half of your page is because you 
know,

1414
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:21,601
racism and stuff.
Yeah.

1415
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,170
But I think one thing that I would 
actually probably liked to do,

1416
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:28,560
which I probably will not be able to,
but uh,

1417
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,990
to do a lot of work in inner city 
communities because I,

1418
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:37,150
I,
I don't want to say I've lived through 

1419
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:37,150
it,
but I understand what's going on there.

1420
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:37,740
I understand that,
you know,

1421
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,470
there's a high crime understand that in 
some neighborhoods the schools aren't as

1422
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:42,820
good for Canada,
it's a little different.

1423
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:45,730
But I'd like to do some work there where
I can kind of tell them,

1424
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:50,731
hey,
I got out and here's what I did to get 

1425
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:50,731
out.
And you can do it too.

1426
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:51,430
There's so many.
There's opportunities there for you.

1427
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:54,700
Like if you were poor minority child 
right now,

1428
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:58,090
please just try your hardest at school,
get an education.

1429
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:01,150
It's literally one of the greatest 
opportunities that you can have.

1430
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,660
And you're more likely.
I mean,

1431
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:04,810
you're probably not a hundred percent 
grade,

1432
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:07,840
but you're more likely to be successful 
if you get an education.

1433
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:12,841
And that's the one thing a lot of black 
people are lacking is the education 

1434
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:13,480
components.
And um,

1435
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:18,510
you know,
we don't really have like the war on 

1436
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:18,510
drugs and everything,
so it really is weird for me that in the

1437
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,370
inner cities of Toronto where there's 
still this very high crime,

1438
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,450
there's still this tension.

1439
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,680
Um,
but,

1440
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:28,910
you know,
have you ever heard of the Woodson 

1441
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,900
Center by any chance?
It's a nonprofit organization that's 

1442
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,720
located in DC,
but I've been working with them for some

1443
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:33,400
time and they basically do the same 
thing.

1444
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:38,401
They go out to these neighborhoods and 
they help students and they have such a 

1445
00:58:38,401 --> 00:58:41,401
good success rate.
They held them in high school because 

1446
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:43,561
that's the other thing is that a lot of 
black kids are not even graduating high 

1447
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:43,561
school.
Of course they're going to go into crime

1448
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,560
if you're not even graduating high 
school.

1449
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,460
Um,
so yeah,

1450
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:48,730
they work with a lot of students there.
They have rehabilitation centers,

1451
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:49,580
they help,
you know,

1452
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,220
a black,
sorry,

1453
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:52,960
black Americans reintegrate into 
society.

1454
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:56,190
Like it's stuff like that where it's 
these root movements that I really liked

1455
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:57,160
to do.
And I know it's a,

1456
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,400
it's a big dream,
but I think that's where it would 

1457
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,161
probably be happiest is where I can show
people how it's done and help them and 

1458
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,240
hopefully everyone can copy that and 
say,

1459
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,300
Oh,
this is what we're supposed to do and 

1460
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,300
all of that.
But awesome.

1461
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,390
I love it and I have no doubt that 
you're going to do it.

1462
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:18,391
And you guys can follow this future 
member of Canadian parliament on her
