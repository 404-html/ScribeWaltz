1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,040
All right,
we're doing a panel today and joining me

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:12,570
is old,
Grizzled Rubin Report Veteran and author

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:17,490
of heavens on Earth,
Michael Shermer and new returning champ.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,790
I'm giving you a returning champ.
Read before you've even sat down here 

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,790
once author of the new book,
political tribes,

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,960
Amy Chu,
and how are you?

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,430
Great.
Thanks for having me.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,440
Yeah,
well thank you guys for coming in.

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:33,441
And Michael,
you set this up so I'm going to not let 

10
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:35,210
you speak for just a moment.
I know you said up,

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,130
you said the three of us should sit down
and talk about a whole slew of issues,

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,610
but amy,
just so my audience can get to know you 

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:43,610
a little bit since they know a lot about
Michael already.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,930
Just give me a two minute synopsis of 
who you are before we talk about the 

15
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:48,630
book and why.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,200
Okay.
Um,

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,390
well,
I'm a Yale law professor.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,100
Um,
I,

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,260
I'm principally by about foreign policy 
and democracy and ethnic conflict.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,210
Um,
mostly developing countries.

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,160
Um,
and I teach at Yale Law School in 2011.

22
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,250
Something crazy happened to me.
Uh,

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,390
and that is,
I wrote in three months a memoir that I 

24
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,441
thought was going to be really funny and
it was called battle hymn of the tiger 

25
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,960
mother and the world exploded.
I created an international firestorm.

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,540
Everybody hated me.
I got death threats.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,600
It was sort of just at the beginning of 
people going bananas on twitter to 

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,450
exactly.
And I didn't have those tools.

29
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:33,451
I had no social media tools.
I wasn't on facebook and I was just 

30
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,590
caught off guard and I became known as 
the notorious Tiger mother.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,890
And so in some ways this,
um,

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,910
this new book is,
um,

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I,
I got sick of only being known as the 

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,160
tiger moth.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,200
I was on a TV show talking about 
Ukrainian nationalism,

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,970
which I actually,
I know about nationalism,

37
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:53,971
I've written about it.
And afterwards I saw the twitter feed 

38
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,611
and they were like,
why does this woman that's tiger woman 

39
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:56,611
thinks that she can talk about 
nationalism?

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,980
So like I did have a career before he 
goes,

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,340
that's it,
you know,

42
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:05,341
I've lost control of the situation.
So in a way the new book goes back to 

43
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:05,800
what I,
what I actually know a little bit about.

44
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,250
Well,
I just want to go on the record as 

45
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,250
saying that as I am sitting next to the 
tiger mom,

46
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,760
I feel an undue pressure to do this show
correctly.

47
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,190
Normally I can phone it in when I assure
him here,

48
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,220
but I feel a little extra credit.
David Book is actually about my younger 

49
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,000
daughter rebelling.
It's a huge book about.

50
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,140
It's a rebellion but you'd like it 
people.

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,000
The whole book is so wildly 
misunderstood,

52
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,050
but it's.
It's been.

53
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,030
It's been fun.
Yeah.

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
You do want to talk a little bit about 
some tiger mom stuff towards the end 

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,770
because I think there's some interesting
things happening right now that we all 

56
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,820
kind of need a little bit more of that 
perhaps then the outrage machine thought

57
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,750
a couple of years ago,
but Michael,

58
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,751
why did you think that this would be a 
good group to sit down together when he 

59
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,480
sent me that email now?
Well,

60
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:53,481
because the book kind of political 
tribes kind of set me back a little bit 

61
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,841
in the sense that I've kind of had this 
lifelong mission of spreading science 

62
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:56,841
and reasoning,
critical thinking,

63
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,400
and then after I'm reading

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
pinker's book,
the better angels that inspired me to 

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,550
write the moral arc and and kind of go 
into this other direction of spreading,

66
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,530
not just science reasoning,
critical thinking,

67
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:13,531
but liberal democracy,
market capitalism and other social tools

68
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,030
that can be measured in the same way 
that scientific things can be measured.

69
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:24,031
And one of the things that I like about 
Steve's work is that he as a social 

70
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:28,831
scientist tries to tease out what are 
the causal variables that are 

71
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:30,100
influencing people to do this or that,
you know,

72
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,580
can we tilt the incentives to get people
to be less violent by doing this?

73
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,560
Rather than that?
Exactly.

74
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,850
Like any scientist would.
So and so this idea,

75
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,170
and I'd read all this literature about 
spreading democracy is a good thing and 

76
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,280
spreading capitalism is a good thing.
And,

77
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,090
and,
and so,

78
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,270
but as you show him political tribes,
it's not quite as simple as I like to 

79
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,320
think in my head,
if we could just go to all these places 

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,930
around the world and bringing liberal 
democracy,

81
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,700
bring a market,
capitalism freedom and prosperity,

82
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,250
you will prosper.
And it's quite.

83
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,500
We'll have this global community,
which is where I'd like to go.

84
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:10,501
I mean,
at some point we're going to be a 

85
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:10,570
multiplanetary species.
We can't be fighting these little tribal

86
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:12,690
battles on Mars or,
or,

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,750
or,
but actually I think we might end up 

88
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,550
doing that if you're right,
that in fact these tribal tendencies are

89
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,390
pretty deep,

90
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,570
right?
I like these things too.

91
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:25,270
I love democracy and liberalism at 
capital,

92
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,310
these enlightenment principles,
um,

93
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,390
but there's sort of no natural reason 
that they should have ethnically neutral

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,740
implications,
consequences.

95
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,660
So democracy,
you know,

96
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,010
at some day,
you know,

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,720
uh,
if you had a global democracy,

98
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,540
but what,
it makes perfect sense that democracy is

99
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,960
going to empower the majority group,
the one with the bigger numbers.

100
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,260
That's just,
that's just a number that's very 

101
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,260
scientific actually.
Um,

102
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,531
but similarly markets,
this is when I coined the term market 

103
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:55,510
dominant minority in 2003.
Um,

104
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,790
we all started in different places.
So just free market capitalism,

105
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,290
even though it's fair in many ways by 
equal,

106
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,350
you could argue that or we can have a 
huge debate,

107
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,620
but there's no real logical reason that 
at any given point in a given society 

108
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,391
that though that free markets will 
benefit all ethnic or racial or all 

109
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:18,120
class are all religious groups equally.
So once you acknowledge that you,

110
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
like,
you have these transition questions.

111
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,470
So I thought maybe we should then with 
that in mind,

112
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:27,471
start with something that's sort of 
happening right now that might help 

113
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,490
people frame a little bit of what all 
three of our political positions are.

114
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,110
Because you,
I know we've,

115
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,170
I think the first time I had you on you,
at one point you had said you're a 

116
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,621
libertarian.
I think you've also kind of said you're 

117
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:39,630
a classical liberal.
Then you've kind of said enough with the

118
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:44,631
labels altogether.
I consider myself a classical liberal 

119
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:45,160
tee shirt on you.
I've seen you,

120
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,910
I've seen you in the classical liberal 
tee shirt.

121
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,770
That's right.
Of course everyone knows that I consider

122
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:53,010
myself a classical liberal,
but I definitely like a lot of the ideas

123
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:55,680
of libertarianism and I'm always sort of
more drawn to that.

124
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,130
If we were to put a label on just to 
start

125
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,460
before I get into the specific issue,
I'm definitely not a classical liberal 

126
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,990
and um,
I love classical liberals.

127
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,430
But,
um,

128
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,580
I think that one of the things I pointed
out in my book is that a lot of people 

129
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,480
are tribal who don't think they are.
Right?

130
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,990
So if he liberal cosmopolitans 
enlightenment people,

131
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,090
you think of yourself as the opposite of
pride because that was,

132
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,740
came out of the alignment on anti 
religious warfare.

133
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:28,741
And,
but what I'm saying is where we are now 

134
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:28,780
in America or even the world,
these,

135
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,920
it be a liberal.
Cosmopolitan is actually a pretty hard 

136
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,100
trying to get into my.
First of all,

137
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:39,101
you were very judgey tribe and you 
probably met a lot of different kinds of

138
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,990
people to be so cosmopolitan.
Um,

139
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,150
you know,
I was very struck and shamed myself.

140
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:48,140
I'd have a student,
I'm poor white person from the south who

141
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,930
had never been on a plane,
uh,

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,840
and that was actually kind of startling 
because we,

143
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,800
the first question some professor was 
asking,

144
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,010
so I think that I'm,
I like writing about tribalism because 

145
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,590
I'm very aware of its effects,
you know,

146
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,790
I'm the child of immigrant parents,
but I'm very proud of my ethnic 

147
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,110
identity.

148
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,620
Um,
but I also love this idea of America as 

149
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,500
this umbrella,
um,

150
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,410
uh,
uh,

151
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,160
identity,
so that it's a complicated answer,

152
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,840
right?
Because I guess as a real,

153
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,930
you know,
real liberals don't have an account of 

154
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,260
why even have the nation state that's 
how far you want to go down.

155
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,080
Right?
So patriotism and all this stuff.

156
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,540
And My,
presumably that's,

157
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,990
that's,
that's at best a transitional thing for 

158
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:33,990
you,
right?

159
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,790
Well,
that's where I don't go so far.

160
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,170
It depends how far you want to go down 
the road of freedom depending on how you

161
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:43,940
find me a classical liberal ideas.
There is some utility in the state.

162
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,270
We just have to figure out what that is.
And I would want it to be the lightest 

163
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,390
touch possible.
But just to answer it in one,

164
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,830
what I really am as I am somebody that 
loves about America,

165
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:55,390
that it's,
uh,

166
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,410
it's,
and it's very unique that this is a 

167
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,730
country that at once has a very strong 
collective national identity or at least

168
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,970
did we can get to that and secondly 
allows individual subgroup or tribal 

169
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,880
identities to flourish.

170
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,480
Like you can be an Irish American or I'm
Korean American,

171
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,570
um,
or I make classic liberal and possibly 

172
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,710
be very patriotic at the same time.
I think that's a very unique thing about

173
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:22,430
this country and that we're in danger of
losing that kind of magic formula.

174
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:27,431
Possibly.
So I think you just described the 

175
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:27,431
melting pot,
right?

176
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:27,740
I mean,
isn't that the secret sauce?

177
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,070
Well,
I melting pot suggests that everybody 

178
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,801
loses their identity like.
And I think that happened very 

179
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:36,440
successfully with a lot of the northern 
European immigrants,

180
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,440
but we've never really been a great 
melting pot.

181
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,290
Like if you take the African American 
population,

182
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,540
there've been many discrete groups that 
never melted into that pot.

183
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:49,130
So I think part of it is a melting pot.
Some assimilation for sure,

184
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,230
but I think this common identity thing 
can,

185
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,710
can coexist with a lot of different 
kinds of diversity.

186
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,230
Some might be closer to the Canadian 
kind of mosaic thing.

187
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,510
Um,
but I do really believe that you need 

188
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:03,510
this connective tissue telling 
everybody.

189
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,950
So I guess it depends what analogy,
like whether it's melting pot or mosaic 

190
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,681
or,
but we've basically done 

191
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,200
multiculturalism better than pretty much
everybody else.

192
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:12,410
Do you mean

193
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,840
that's where you say,
yeah.

194
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:17,080
So the balance here is how can I 
maintain that,

195
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,180
my,
my local group identity,

196
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:24,181
which is easy to do because I identify 
with people that look like me or live 

197
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,140
near me or whatever.
That's totally natural and still respect

198
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:30,850
others because there's some umbrella.
And there previously when I was younger,

199
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:31,420
I would have thought,
well,

200
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,370
we don't need a government government.
You know,

201
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,400
this can happen just from the bottom up.
I've become a little more cynical about 

202
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,180
human nature being dark,
uh,

203
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:42,670
in tribal,
in the sense that at some point you need

204
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:46,510
some kind of rules to govern,
say the marketplace to a certain extent,

205
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:49,630
at least steer it.
And that's why this,

206
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,410
this cake baking thing is I just go back
and forth.

207
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:54,010
It's like,
yes,

208
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:54,460
yes,
this,

209
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,420
she should be able to bake any cake he 
wants.

210
00:09:56,421 --> 00:10:01,421
We're not in the battle days when people
justified racism and know lunch counters

211
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:08,281
and buses segregated.
And at some point it took the federal 

212
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:11,671
government saying we're sending the 
troops in to set to integrate your 

213
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,470
schools even though they're down there 
in Alabama saying segregation forever.

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,480
At some point sometimes you,
you have to use force to get people at 

215
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,480
least to start

216
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:20,630
to bring them around.
Right.

217
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:25,631
Okay.
So that is the one issue that I wanted 

218
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:25,631
to do up top before we dive into the 
book.

219
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:28,160
So you.
I tweeted out when when the decision was

220
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,580
made that basically my feeling is that 
you have to offer.

221
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,390
We have the civil rights act of 1964.
I don't want to re litigate it.

222
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,110
You have to offer products to every 
person regardless of race,

223
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,610
color,
creed and all of that stuff.

224
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,880
But that if there is a specific artistic
quality to it or a customization to it 

225
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,620
and that happens to go against your 
beliefs that you just don't have to do 

226
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,240
it.
Whether I think that's abhorrent or not,

227
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,710
you just don't.
We wouldn't ask a,

228
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,930
a satanist wouldn't be allowed to walk 
into a Muslim baker and say paint,

229
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,640
you know,
put my helmet on the cake.

230
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,670
No one in their right mind I think would
think that that's the government's job 

231
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:06,980
to force the baker to do that.

232
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,220
There's always do when we teach this and
start spitting out the hypothetical.

233
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,750
That makes complete sense what you said.
But then they say,

234
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,140
I think Justice Kagan might have asked 
how about a makeup artist,

235
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,780
right?
Can a make up artist refused to,

236
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,380
to,
to provide services to,

237
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,360
you know,
to gay people to,

238
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,540
you know.
So once you start pressing what counts 

239
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,811
as being an artist for photography,
photography is a form of art or.

240
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,980
Right?
So that is the

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,560
interesting.
So,

242
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:41,570
right,
so go grocery store bagging right the 

243
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:41,570
most.
So it sort of a mundane task.

244
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,190
We all go to the grocery to buy the 
products that are there and they're,

245
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:45,690
all they have to do is put it in the bag
and walk out if a,

246
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,750
if a grocer,
we're saying we're not going to bag 

247
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,530
groceries,
groceries for black people,

248
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,690
that,
that is actually in violation of the 

249
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:57,690
1964 civil liberties act.
Um,

250
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,910
but the.
But the idea that we would force a 

251
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,610
specific product.
You wouldn't want a,

252
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,660
a Jewish painter.
We shouldn't have to be forced to take 

253
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,371
commissions from a Neo Nazi or they 
tweeted out several other examples on 

254
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,090
this,
but your fear basically where I think we

255
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,440
don't quite see eye to eye is that 
eventually,

256
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,800
if we don't do some of this,
that things will devolve

257
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,000
that.
Is that fair to say?

258
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,950
I don't know.
You might be right that in,

259
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,210
in 2018,
it's not 1964,

260
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,930
so maybe we don't need such draconian 
laws historically when you.

261
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,600
But also we needed those lows to reverse
Jim crow laws,

262
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,220
which don't exist in the battle days.
You needed to send the federal troops 

263
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,870
into this to integrate the schools.
Maybe we don't need to do that now.

264
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Maybe this one baker out of 100 will 
refuse to bake a cake.

265
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,700
But as the,
as the justices pointed out,

266
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,320
okay,
we're gonna protect,

267
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:55,321
this guy's really just expressions.
But if it turns out that every other 

268
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,450
baker refusing to bake cakes for blacks 
and gays and so on,

269
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,280
then that we,
that we can't let that happen.

270
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,600
That may never happen.
Yeah.

271
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,710
What do you make of that?
Part of the decision that struck me is 

272
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,840
like a really,
like kind of slimy way out of this.

273
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,620
Like,
well,

274
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,950
you're the law professor.
You know why they did that.

275
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,980
I think,
you know,

276
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,390
it is,
as everybody says,

277
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:19,391
it's an extremely narrow holding.
It's like a pundit just said that this 

278
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:23,231
particular commission was displaying 
hostility to religion in a way that 

279
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:23,480
couldn't make them impartial.
So,

280
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,940
um,
I think that will be another decision.

281
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:28,160
I mean it's,
in a way it's just kind of kicked down,

282
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,250
right?
It just seemed like it had no teeth in 

283
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,250
that regard.
Was like,

284
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,250
why didn't you make.
Yeah.

285
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,160
I don't think it was an unreasonable 
holding,

286
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,070
but I do think they,
they just avoided the question.

287
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,300
Um,
you know,

288
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,050
what I,
I,

289
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
I think is what worries me right now is 
the constitution was supposed to be the 

290
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,061
vaccine that sort of what protected 
against political tribalism and I know 

291
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,001
we're going to get to that,
but what I see that's kind of dangerous 

292
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:53,990
and dismaying and the twitter feed right
now is that,

293
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,470
um,
it's like tribalism as attacking of the 

294
00:13:59,470 --> 00:13:59,470
constitution to,
you know,

295
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,070
it's not just something that we disagree
with,

296
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,800
but it's like there's a lot of 
demonization of the other side.

297
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,240
Look,
there are,

298
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,690
if you teach the law school,
and I'm not a con law professor,

299
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,080
that's not my area.
I teach contracts and you know,

300
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,840
international business transactions.
But one thing you know is there are hard

301
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:17,510
cases and this is a hard case,
right?

302
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:22,511
You will have print multiple principals 
are different rights clashing or weird 

303
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:26,741
facts.
And what would I think is almost more 

304
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,500
scary is you see people on the two sides
right now.

305
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:32,501
It's like if you think that a baker 
should be allowed to refuse to bake a 

306
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,760
cake celebrating gay marriage,
then you're a bigot and homophobe.

307
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,090
Right,
right,

308
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,250
right.
But on the other side there,

309
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,050
no.
You know the it,

310
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,460
it's like you're on the other side.
If you are take the other view,

311
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:51,461
then you are declaring jihad on Judeo 
Christian values and this is the is so 

312
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:54,160
ratched up and it's not good.

313
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,440
I think the main takeaway is spend less 
time on twitter.

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
People are normal.
Well that that actually is part of it 

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,350
because if you talk to average people,
not not average.

316
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:10,351
People don't even like that phrase.
If you talked to the neighbor and 

317
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:11,830
everyone else in real life,
they don't behave the way they behave on

318
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:16,831
twitter.
It seemingly has taken a hold of our 

319
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,520
entire national discourse.
So let me ask you this then,

320
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,710
because I do think most of these things 
become local.

321
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,010
If there was a baker that did not want 
to to bake a cake for a for Chinese 

322
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:34,981
people or a whatever it is,
how would you feel is the right thing to

323
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:35,290
do?

324
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,160
Well,
that's just a personal thing.

325
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:40,190
I would just go to a different bakery,
but that's what I wanted to.

326
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:45,191
I wanted to make it personal.
That's even saying that doesn't mean 

327
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:45,680
that I would,
um,

328
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,150
disrespect somebody else that did it.
It's really just my approach to life,

329
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,900
you know,
like,

330
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:55,901
well,
I really wouldn't want that wedding 

331
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:55,901
cake.

332
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:57,280
What is it that the only way really to 
respect freedom,

333
00:15:57,281 --> 00:16:02,281
I mean the freedoms that we have here is
in your decision to either do something 

334
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:06,211
or not do something or,
or go to a business or not go to a 

335
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:06,211
business or whatever.
I was like,

336
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:10,050
the only real way to broadly protect 
freedom is that it's Kinda Shitty,

337
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,030
right?
It doesn't,

338
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,490
it doesn't feel great

339
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,760
and it could be,
we don't need the laws now because we 

340
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,161
have social media.
People shun that Baker on social media 

341
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:24,320
or,
and not go to that store or if that's 

342
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,320
what you want,
you do give them your,

343
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,330
your business is that the market sort of
sorts it out.

344
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,740
That mismatch your point about the civil
rights and needing force initially,

345
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,350
like where do you get there?
How do we get these?

346
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,420
We didn't end slavery by by market 
forces.

347
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,470
We took a walk and sometimes you allow a
lots of people to do this.

348
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,590
Can you get an regressive norm change?
It depends on what you think about human

349
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,940
nature.
I think I'm similar to you.

350
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:53,120
I believe my journal going back,
I mean,

351
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,640
well I would.
I always say I'm a world weary optimist 

352
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:00,800
that it's the only way that I could do 
this the way that I do it,

353
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,170
but I look,
I,

354
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,550
I just don't think.
I'm not calling for reversing,

355
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,250
but just to be very clear,
I'm not saying we should be litigated or

356
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:12,251
reverse the civil rights act,
but the idea that we need that in 2018 

357
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:17,231
so that people aren't opening up white 
only businesses or anti gay businesses 

358
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:21,251
or bowling alleys that aren't for trans 
people are giving you a couple other 

359
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:21,251
good ones here.
You know what I mean?

360
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,100
Roller Skating rinks.

361
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,430
It's interesting.
Going to the political situation.

362
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:32,460
There are,
there are some differences in America 

363
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,880
today because I studied American 
history.

364
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:38,881
That's kind of what I've been looking at
for the last hundred years and because 

365
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:40,390
of these big demographic changes that 
we're having now,

366
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,460
so-called what with whites about to on 
the verge of no longer being a majority 

367
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,010
in this country,
that's about 15 years.

368
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,270
The numbers from 20,
44 to 2050.

369
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,370
And then there are debates about whether
that's the big had happened,

370
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,590
but most people can see that even in 
Texas,

371
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,580
in California,
it's already happened.

372
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,880
And um,
again,

373
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:01,050
the study's kind of show,
I mean,

374
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,870
this is going to sound terrible,
but for most of this country's history,

375
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,470
it was dominated economically,
politically,

376
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:12,471
and culturally by a white majority.
And the result of that is lots of bad 

377
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:17,631
things could happen,
but there's also a little room for 

378
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,821
generosity and it's a little right now 
with this demographic change about to 

379
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,330
happen.

380
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,450
Um,
what I write in the book is that every 

381
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:26,450
group feels threatened.
This is,

382
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,501
you know,
it's not just the minorities felt 

383
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:30,501
threatened,
Whitesfeld threatened,

384
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:30,501
um,
Latinos,

385
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,780
Asians feel threatened,
you know,

386
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,020
with the me too movement.
Men feel threatened,

387
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,990
women feel threatened,
straighten it.

388
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,150
So,
and it's when people felt threatened 

389
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,490
that they retreat into tribalism and get
more US versus them.

390
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,370
So on this Baker thing,
you know,

391
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,860
you just never know,
like we're,

392
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:50,861
we're at a funny moment right now with 
are candidates running on like white 

393
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:55,790
nationalist platforms in a way that 
wasn't like in the last 50 years or 

394
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:55,790
openly at least.

395
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:55,930
Right?
So,

396
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,460
okay.
So,

397
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,050
so granting you that.
I guess what I would say then is that if

398
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:06,051
that's all true and we maybe are about 
to get much more tribal and start seeing

399
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:11,151
more outward racism and the rest of it,
that perhaps even if we allowed those 

400
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,130
businesses to exist,
that your answer is still the right one.

401
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,340
The answer of use social media,
use your influence,

402
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:22,341
use your dollars.
Don't live in a state or a town that is 

403
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:26,091
supporting these things like that.
The experiment should still go on with 

404
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:27,900
the least amount of government.
But I get why this is.

405
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:28,350
So

406
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,230
for example,
when you brought that up in the book 

407
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,230
about everybody feels personally as an 
atheist,

408
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,830
I'm always amazed when he's born again,
Christians go,

409
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,470
we are a persecuted minority in this 
country.

410
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,280
It's like,
are you kidding me?

411
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:44,281
Nine out of 10 of you were around me.
You're the person that we really feel 

412
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,920
that you are.
Well,

413
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,130
I live in La.
It's not so bad.

414
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,060
But when I travel it's like,
okay,

415
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,670
well I am really in the minority here,
but two,

416
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,970
two quick things on sometimes the need 
for government for us,

417
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,210
like the burning of widows in India.
That was ended by the British 

418
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,730
colonialists that said you're going to 
stop doing this or else.

419
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,530
And they said,
but you have to respect our culture.

420
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,610
And they said,
all right,

421
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,320
here's our culture.
If you burn women,

422
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:16,321
we build gallows and paying you.
So you go ahead and build your funeral 

423
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:20,821
pyres and we're going to build our 
gallows and we can respect each other's 

424
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:20,821
goals.

425
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,880
And that put an end to it.
And then in Papa New Guinea,

426
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:24,370
jared diamond tells this story about,
you know,

427
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,050
rates of violence A.
I mean,

428
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:30,550
it was like a hundreds of times more 
than the natural background,

429
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,120
but rates of violence even in the 
sixties and no one liked the violence,

430
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,700
but it was just the result of these 
little local tribes.

431
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:40,420
And finally the overall government,
when they got some power,

432
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:40,990
they said,
all right,

433
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,860
no more violence if you kill somebody at
a vengeance or whatever.

434
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:49,861
He took your pig and so whatever.
We're gonna put you in jail and we're 

435
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:50,550
gonna lock you up and that's it.
And,

436
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:51,240
and,
but,

437
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,100
but most people were happy about this.
Jared said,

438
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,960
it was like,
thank God somebody came in,

439
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,450
the parent came in and said,
stop fighting.

440
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,360
Right?
And I guess I would say we don't live in

441
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:03,600
Papa New Guinea and you don't live in 
British colonial India.

442
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,300
Maybe more of a local example would be 
in sports,

443
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,430
like insightly.
My sport,

444
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,180
most cyclists don't want a dope,
but there's an escalating like the game 

445
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,961
theory escalation thing where if you 
think everybody else's dope and you got 

446
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,860
to do it and what they really want is 
somebody on top say,

447
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,130
okay,
no more doping and we're going to test 

448
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,130
because they don't really want a dope,
but they feel they have to dope.

449
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,830
So you need some kind of structure.
So stop cheating stuff,

450
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,030
kill Ya.
We don't want to cheat,

451
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:36,031
but you know,
but so you've got to tilt the incentive 

452
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:36,031
somehow,
and I hate to say it,

453
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:38,560
but sometimes that has to come from the 
top down a little bit.

454
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,230
It's,
it's very interesting.

455
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:46,231
So right.
Your book is called political tribes 

456
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:46,231
now.
As you know,

457
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:47,470
I'm a.
I'm a believer in the individual.

458
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:52,471
I think that the individual is the 
answer to stop bigotry and prejudice and

459
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:56,530
all of those things because you won't 
look at someone as the member of a group

460
00:21:56,531 --> 00:22:01,531
and you owe black people think this or 
Muslim people think or gay people think 

461
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:04,801
this.
If you look at the individual will wait 

462
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,680
until you know what they think.
So sell me on the value of tribes.

463
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,460
Actually,
I'm just,

464
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,190
the reality of

465
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,410
tribes grabbed reality.
I'm closer to it.

466
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:16,411
You think?
I think we all need a big dose of 

467
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:18,050
individuals in this country right now.
I teach on the college campus and I,

468
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,340
you know,
uh,

469
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:20,860
that's what we're supposed to be famous 
for.

470
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,520
White America is a bunch of Mavericks,
but all,

471
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,640
you know,
I don't think these things are 

472
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:29,640
inconsistent.
I do say that human beings,

473
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,391
and this is not a me saying it first,
but human beings are just biologically 

474
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:36,050
tribal.
We need to belong to groups.

475
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,450
Um,
there are very,

476
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,960
very few hermits.
There can be individualistic,

477
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,620
but there are not hermits,
even monks to orders,

478
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,700
they compete with each other.

479
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Right?
So there's very few sort of jd 

480
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:50,720
salinger's at the end in the forest,
many of those.

481
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:50,860
Right?
Right.

482
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:52,840
I bet that if there were a retreat for 
those people,

483
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:57,700
they probably really get along and 
tribalism doesn't have to be bad.

484
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:01,390
And in fact it can be consistent with a 
lot of individualism in sports.

485
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,800
You were saying like,
you know how,

486
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,920
but that's a great example.
Can you imagine somebody telling you to 

487
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,711
get stopped liking your favorite team?
But I'm the and family it can be very 

488
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,791
tribal of what I'm writing about now is 
when tribalism takes over our political 

489
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:21,661
system and that is what is really 
dangerous because a feature of the kind 

490
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:25,861
of problems I'm talking about is you 
just want to stick to your side no 

491
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:28,300
matter what.
You actually take pleasure in seeing the

492
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,400
other side.
Failure to sticking it to them.

493
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:33,220
And by the way,
I experienced this all the time,

494
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,210
right?
Um,

495
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:38,320
if somebody hurts you,
it's just human nature.

496
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,730
Um,
but we are,

497
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,010
we have massive problems in this country
right now.

498
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:47,040
And as both of you have talked about,
we're at a point where we just can't 

499
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,470
talk to each other.
You know,

500
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:52,040
Americans can't talk to each other 
anytime anything happens,

501
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,920
whether it's a shooting or anything 
like,

502
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,470
um,
the,

503
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,810
the,
the case,

504
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,380
um,
I think even worse than I'm not,

505
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,120
you know,
you could say it's all Steve Pinker.

506
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,620
It makes a great case.
And I'm not saying that we're worse than

507
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,730
in every way in terms of violence,
but in terms of tribalism in the 

508
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,240
political sphere,
I think this is an unusual moment.

509
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,300
And partly that is,
I think because of the demographic 

510
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,300
change,
it's very dislocating.

511
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,170
Um,
and,

512
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,220
and so I anyway,
no will not to bring everything back to 

513
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,170
social media,
but I'm still partly convinced that it's

514
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,300
not just,
I accept the changing demographics and I

515
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,300
trumpism and all of those things.

516
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,630
But I still think,
and I see this as I'm on tour with 

517
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,291
Jordan Peterson now and I'm getting back
into stand up in a meeting people 

518
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:38,291
across,
you know,

519
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:42,280
from all the diversity that the left 
loves but across a true diverse set of 

520
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,961
ideas to who they want answers.
And we're just not hearing from these 

521
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:46,961
people.
I mean,

522
00:24:46,961 --> 00:24:51,050
there's a reason that the things that 
we're all doing are working.

523
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,240
It's because we're fighting the forces 
of that.

524
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,390
So for that reason,
I'm an optimist and you know,

525
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:59,630
when I had you on the first time,
which seems like 18 lifetimes ago,

526
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,880
and we were talking about the moral arc.
I mean,

527
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,980
that really was what you were selling me
that thing.

528
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:08,981
I mean it's,
it's very similar to the pink or idea 

529
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:09,920
that things are bending in a good way.
It's just harder to see it now perhaps.

530
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,060
Well,
and also because we set our standards 

531
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,771
higher so that people say students in 
the sixties would be outraged by the 

532
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,140
Vietnam War.
Now they're outraged by Halloween 

533
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,140
costumes

534
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,500
and that's actually good because it 
shows you where were the smaller thing 

535
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:25,500
that we're obsessed,
right?

536
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,050
It's awesome.
There's a correction.

537
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:32,051
I think that went too far.
I think that's a good example of 

538
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,430
suggesting that what you are calling the
market.

539
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,050
I think we're seeing a correction right 
now,

540
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,310
um,
that whatever people think about the 

541
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,310
2016 election,
many,

542
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,641
many,
many people including elites were 

543
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,351
shocked and such.
There's a lot of new thinking and even 

544
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,280
from the Halloween costume thing now,
I think it's,

545
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,390
I,
I feel,

546
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,990
I feel that there's a little bit you 
can't tell immediately you're still 

547
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,250
going to see the controversies,
but I think there's a shift.

548
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,630
Well,
I think that's what's interesting 

549
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,370
because it seems to me that some of us 
in this intellectual darkweb or whatever

550
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:08,510
you want to call us at this point,
we saw this for the last couple of years

551
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:10,040
of Matt's what drew people doesn't 
match.

552
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,230
That's the confirmation for me that 
there is something bigger

553
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,280
growing here in identity politics thing 
is a problem because it feeds into the 

554
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,720
tribes,
your chapters,

555
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,540
a chapter on the trump phenomenon going 
through nascar and world wrestling,

556
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,230
entertainment and,
and,

557
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,240
and it's like,
I never really thought of those as 

558
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,240
tribes,
but of course they are.

559
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,630
Yeah.
And I contrasted that and I can't 

560
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:35,630
believe I didn't get in trouble,
you know,

561
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:35,930
I teach at a very liberal school.
I just wait,

562
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:37,970
you're on the Rubin report is going to 
happen.

563
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,310
Well,
about the occupy movement,

564
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,650
which,
you know,

565
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,290
uh,
and again,

566
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:46,050
I supported a lot of my students.
I love my students.

567
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,580
I have to say I am,
I am,

568
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,090
I am an independent.
Um,

569
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,290
and a lot of them are doing great things
for justice.

570
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,400
So I even think,
you know,

571
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,370
social justice warrior is again too big 
a term,

572
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,660
you know,
I think that's also the label,

573
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,720
but occupy is a movement that I say was 
a movement ostensibly to help the poor 

574
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:07,590
that included no members of the poor.
It was vastly up at an elite group,

575
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:09,590
highly educated,
all these postgrads.

576
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,620
Um,
and then,

577
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:11,730
and yes,
then I say,

578
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,250
you know,
actually a lot of the progressive elites

579
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,200
don't,
aren't aware.

580
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,200
In fact a lot of the working class white
working class or any working class are 

581
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,831
actually very suspicious of a lot of the
activists that are supposedly trying to 

582
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:24,831
help them.
So that was an irony.

583
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:27,540
And then I talk about so many of the 
poorer,

584
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,780
including minorities belonging to the 
Prosperity Gospel,

585
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,210
the irony there,
praying for money,

586
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,870
they want money,
they're not trying to occupy.

587
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,900
So.
So yeah,

588
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:41,901
that's part of the thing that a lot of 
thesis that a lot of elites in this 

589
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,440
country wanting to do well actually just
aren't,

590
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,500
are,
are very blind to the group identities 

591
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,480
and tribal dynamics that matter most to,
to just people on the ground.

592
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,270
So to that point

593
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:57,310
was trump's greatest coup here that he 
was able to take the white working class

594
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:59,050
mainly,
but,

595
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,810
but other groups do and break them out 
of their tribalism or even if you,

596
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,510
even the Christian conservatives who 
voted for him at record numbers,

597
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:10,511
I think,
and still his support with them is 

598
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:10,511
through like 90 percent or something 
crazy that it.

599
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:13,340
They didn't vote for him for tribal 
reasons because he's actually not one of

600
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:13,760
them.
Right.

601
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:15,260
He was a rich New Yorker,

602
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,840
so it wasn't.
Yeah.

603
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,420
I think that he has done a into job.
Well,

604
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:25,421
I think he's done a brilliant job 
portraying himself as a member of their 

605
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,380
cultural tribe,
cultural tribe as,

606
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,870
as working white working class 
Americans.

607
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,950
And I don't think it's all a show 
because a lot of group identification is

608
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:36,080
aesthetic.
It's an aesthetic.

609
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:41,081
It's a matter of style and values.
And in terms of the way that president 

610
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:45,280
trump dresses and stuffs themself on 
Mcdonald's compared to what,

611
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,640
you know,
not Vegan,

612
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,620
it just looked donald and steaks and the
suits,

613
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:54,650
the world,
the NASCAR and worldwide wrestling.

614
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,080
Are these things that are right about 
these or not?

615
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,750
I got,
there was a negative review that said,

616
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,280
oh,
this fringe phenomenon.

617
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,520
And I showed the numbers.
These are NASA phenomenon,

618
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,730
these are the Prosperity Gospel.
These are millions and millions of 

619
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,530
trump's in the hall of fame were all 
arrested.

620
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,770
And so in my circles,
you know,

621
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,280
every time he said something sexist or 
racist,

622
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,650
everyone was like,
now he's gonna be out of the office.

623
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,570
Nope.
And that,

624
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:24,890
the point is that people,
actually,

625
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,120
a lot of Americans actually identify 
with the way he talks and says something

626
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:32,660
wrong or maybe lies and gets in trouble 
than he's called out,

627
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,560
that they should,
like,

628
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,900
this happens to me all the time.
That's how they feel.

629
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,010
They don't feel like.
So.

630
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,190
So I think that he,
he has established a,

631
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,320
a,
a cultural tribal connection even 

632
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,320
though.
Yes,

633
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,640
he's is.
And that goes to the other thing.

634
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,780
I think a lot of elites,
um,

635
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,340
I've been doing some research into this.
The socialists include a lot of people 

636
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,110
who attend our top universities.
Um,

637
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,860
there are a lot of,
um,

638
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,540
working class Americans have,
whether they're Latino or African 

639
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,350
American white who actually,
um,

640
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,060
would love to hit it,
make it big,

641
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,160
would love to enrich,
to have a big building and have a nice 

642
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,761
car.
So there's a lot of irony in end in who 

643
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:15,790
was championing what and it's actually 
very,

644
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,870
very fascinating.

645
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,420
Yeah.
So it's just tribalism,

646
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,670
tribalism of a different sort.
I suppose.

647
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:25,671
So it's like all these rappers years ago
were rapping about trump because they 

648
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:29,210
liked all of the gold and the blaming 
and the branding and all

649
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,200
that's tapped into lots of different 
strands.

650
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:34,080
Of course there was a racial thing that 
he was able to tap into to,

651
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,460
but there was a lot of stuff there.

652
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,510
Wait,
I want to just slightly jump back to 

653
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,131
this,
to this liberal tribe that thinks that 

654
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,651
it's not a try because that seems to be 
the group that I'm sort of most 

655
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,470
personally frustrated with.
I go after you get a lot.

656
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,740
Well,
I guess so that probably has a lot to do

657
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:49,760
with it.
I'm not denying it,

658
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,740
but just accusing you of being in a 
tribe and they're not in a tribe,

659
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:57,741
but that's not true.
So I guess that's what's driving me 

660
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:57,790
crazy about this is that they constantly
are telling you,

661
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:02,791
you know,
that I'm totally talking about the New 

662
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:03,080
York Times elite sort of.
I lived on the upper west for 15 years,

663
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,360
so I like a lot of these people 
personally,

664
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:10,361
individually of course,
but that set of people that think that 

665
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:14,591
everyone else is this thing and that 
they are actually the ones who have 

666
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,700
saucy while drinking the New York Times.

667
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,420
I,
I really do think that all of us are 

668
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,080
tribal and that is definitely a tribe a.
and it's even by like,

669
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:31,130
if you take like anthropological or 
social scientists definitions,

670
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,340
you know,
in terms of what you eat and your values

671
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:38,960
and your self perception and you know,
people vacation all the same places.

672
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,900
Um,
no,

673
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,290
it's,
it's,

674
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,290
it's definitely a tribe.
And you know,

675
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,100
I,
and I'm,

676
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,280
a lot of them are.
My friends are in that tribe and it's 

677
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,651
very,
it just because it's one thing I say is 

678
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:54,050
a lot of progressivism is actually,
it could also be doing great things,

679
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:58,370
but it is also really fun.
It's an identity formation,

680
00:31:58,371 --> 00:31:59,000
you know,
people go,

681
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,410
like,
occupy was a very,

682
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,540
um,
it gave them some solidarity.

683
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,690
It was a fun feeling of them.
A lot of the marches.

684
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,820
I think people are going to get a lot of
the politics while,

685
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,700
because they keep measuring the size of 
the crowds everywhere,

686
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,620
the size of the protest.
And I think that's,

687
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,810
I don't know,
I think people have to watch out because

688
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,820
that's,
I think if you just look at the size of 

689
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:19,820
the crowd,
you're like,

690
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,030
oh my gosh,
I see what the is going.

691
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,490
But maybe those are areas where the 
whole.

692
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,250
I don't know.

693
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,170
So,
so when you were reading Amy's book as 

694
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,680
someone that's sort of tracked moral 
progress through time,

695
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,080
um,
do you think there is a right amount of 

696
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,551
tribalism that allows us to be the best 
we can is as people in society?

697
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,090
Well,
I your epilogue talks about how to break

698
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,480
through some of that,
which I liked because there's a lot of 

699
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,661
social psych there.
How can we quit thinking of each other 

700
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:51,790
in that way?
But the other bigger issue on the spread

701
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:56,410
of market capitalism say that you 
identified these a market,

702
00:32:56,411 --> 00:33:01,411
dominant minorities.
I had no idea this was happening in 

703
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:01,800
Vietnam and I just binge watched Ken 
Burns's,

704
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,600
you know,
18 hours of the Vietnam war and I,

705
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,650
I don't remember anything about the 10 
percent of the population over 90 

706
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:10,570
percent of the

707
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,920
companies.
As relates to your point about this is 

708
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,000
something funny.
I keep getting in trouble for every book

709
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:20,470
that I've written about the taboo for 
reasons that I think are silly.

710
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I don't think they should be terribly.
So I coined this term of 2003 a market 

711
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,520
dominant minorities and it refers to 
small,

712
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,630
usually ethnic minorities like the three
percent Chinese in Indonesia.

713
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,400
Just three percent ethnic Chinese who 
control 70 percent of the economy.

714
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Now what I wrote that I think the 
instant us liberal progressive 

715
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:41,720
responses.
Wait,

716
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,170
how could she say that?
It's like she's got to be stereotyping.

717
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,120
She's,
but I just documented it

718
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,270
even though it can also be argued that 
that's a positive stereotype because 

719
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,270
it's through work and education and all 
sorts of questions.

720
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,360
So comfortable with any group,
acid make generalizations.

721
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:57,170
Um,
and I was saying,

722
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:02,171
look,
if we're going to ever solve these 

723
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:02,171
problems.
So it also,

724
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:03,770
when I even say whites in South Africa 
about 14 percent controlling,

725
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,900
you know,
80 percent of the best land.

726
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,590
So even the reasons for being a market 
dominant minority can vary.

727
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,190
Sometimes it can be a history of 
colonialism or apartheid.

728
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,410
So,
so nobody celebrating it necessarily,

729
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:20,411
although groups like the Chinese or the 
Indians or the Lebanese are harder to 

730
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:21,110
explain because they were non 
colonizers.

731
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,110
So yes,
this is a phenomenon that fits,

732
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,220
um,
it's,

733
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:25,820
it,
it's,

734
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,290
it coexists in a complicated way with 
these enlightenment forces.

735
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,830
Um,
because you want would be nice if,

736
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,860
if,
if markets just just benefited all 

737
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,010
ethnic ethnicities,
Ito.

738
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,260
But what,
what does this tell you about how we 

739
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,260
treat victimhood?
Really?

740
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,750
So the example I can use,
we do,

741
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,940
and you just mentioned this about the 
three percent Chinese.

742
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,240
It's like when,
I'm sure you guys saw this a couple 

743
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,390
months ago when this documentary came 
out about Apu from the simpsons.

744
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,900
Yes.
And I saw night 90 percent of what I saw

745
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:56,650
online.
And again,

746
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:59,140
it's just what you're reading online was
actually no,

747
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,570
he was a good character.
He's beloved by everybody.

748
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:03,610
He's actually the hardest working guy in
the town.

749
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,820
He's one of homer's good friends.
They did an episode on on immigration 

750
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:08,820
because of him,
you know,

751
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,600
he's a Vegan at all.
All of these wonderful things.

752
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Indian Americans I think are the number 
one socioeconomic group in the country 

753
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,290
are pretty damn close to it.
I think their average median incomes,

754
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,300
six figures or it's a great measure of 
success in all of these things.

755
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,350
And yet I saw this sliver of the people 
that I'm frustrated with,

756
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,750
this sort of elite,
lefty,

757
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,980
whatever you want to call them,
progressive's demanding that this victim

758
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:36,790
hood should exist.
And that to me is the root of.

759
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,010
So much of our

760
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,310
tribal problems are about forgetting 
your successes.

761
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,920
Yeah.
I,

762
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,690
I,
um,

763
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,260
well,
first of all,

764
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,640
I just,
again,

765
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,070
just personally I understand where the 
people are coming from,

766
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:49,190
but personally I,
I,

767
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,570
I,
I just don't like the victim put thing.

768
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,600
I think it's also psychologically very 
difficult waiting and you get this 

769
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,290
oppression Olympics where you're,
you know,

770
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,620
your who can be lower,
you have more problems.

771
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,330
Um,
but on this,

772
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,360
without getting,
because I have had a lot of south Asian 

773
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,120
friends say that they were very upset 
about it.

774
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:14,121
To my surprise,
I try to understand and I wonder if 

775
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:15,600
there's a big generational thing,
which is partly,

776
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,270
it feels bad,
but it partly what makes America great.

777
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,980
Um,
you know,

778
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,750
my dad,
when I was young,

779
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,080
my dad was immigrant and get a Chinese 
accent and I would see him being what 

780
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,650
you might call discriminated against 
somebody,

781
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,370
like whatever.

782
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,880
And I would feel so bad.
I'd be like this eight year old kid and 

783
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,720
just feels so shameful and so angry and 
think my dad didn't even notice,

784
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:41,721
you know?
And then later had mentioned to my dad 

785
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:41,721
and he's like,
this is such a great country.

786
00:36:41,721 --> 00:36:42,110
She's thinking,
I came from,

787
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,830
I came from and I'm going to rise and,
and,

788
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,810
and,
and he just made it the American dream.

789
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,320
But,
um,

790
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,600
so I,
I often in,

791
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,690
you know,
as an older person now I see very 

792
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:56,690
generationally,
I think I,

793
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,740
I bet if you asked an older generation 
of,

794
00:36:58,741 --> 00:36:59,550
uh,
of,

795
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,580
of South Asia,
it's about that I wonder if you might 

796
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,441
not get a difference,
whereas you get the children or 

797
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,620
grandchildren of those immigrants and 
they're in a very different mentality,

798
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,250
educated in our campuses,
much worse than you know.

799
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:11,950
Uh,
so that's,

800
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:17,010
that's really what you're talking about 
when you talk about the Halloween 

801
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,010
costumes,
right?

802
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,800
That the arc here has meant so much that
you can actually put aside all of the 

803
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:23,910
successes and then to just be upset by a
cartoon character.

804
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,560
So this is,
again,

805
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:26,850
it's a net good.

806
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,650
I think it's important to that good,
but,

807
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:33,651
but it's fine tuning younger people's 
intuitions to go toward smaller and 

808
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:35,950
smaller,
uh,

809
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,510
assaults on their ego or dignity or 
whatever that they then elevate into 

810
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,580
these massive,
like this is the equivalent of slavery,

811
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,000
rapey and the environment is the 
equivalent of rape or whatever,

812
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,870
you know,
it's just elevating the,

813
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,550
these words in things that they can get 
worked up about because we do have a,

814
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,730
a moral module or network or whatever in
our brain that we get worked up over 

815
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,270
things and whether,
if it's the Vietnam war,

816
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,160
okay,
but now it's the Halloween costume,

817
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,740
but it's the same emotions that are 
still being driven.

818
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,140
And that's another problem with these 
tribalism,

819
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:07,400
you know,

820
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,580
maybe the moral arc.
Maybe again,

821
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,040
I'm an optimist too.
Um,

822
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,930
and I think something is changing after 
2016.

823
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,570
I have many.
I quote this guy,

824
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:19,390
Giovanni,
extremely progressive student,

825
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,190
um,
Latin American parents from Mexico lived

826
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:29,191
in a trailer park and he saying,
I think we went to bar week stop on this

827
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,270
Halloween costume.
The line he uses is that crying wolf too

828
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:35,050
much.
Right?

829
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,570
So that when you get serious and um,
so,

830
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,460
so I actually think there's some 
correction,

831
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,450
not everybody,
right?

832
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,390
There's still things that um,
are just,

833
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,620
just a waste of time,
you know,

834
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,570
we have serious,
serious problems and um,

835
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,070
but,
uh,

836
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,610
but I think there is some sense even 
even among this group saying,

837
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,850
you know,
maybe this is not the best thing to 

838
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:56,850
focus on.

839
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,910
Well,
what do you guys make of the fact that 

840
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,530
this seems to be global right now?
That I know that because of technology,

841
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:02,890
that this movement,
whatever,

842
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:07,891
whatever's happening here now where so 
many people are waking up to the 

843
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:07,990
overcorrection or whatever you want to 
call it,

844
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,260
that the amount of email that I get from
people that are seeing this in India is 

845
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,130
what I'm getting from people that are 
seeing this in Canada.

846
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:20,131
That,
that tells you something really 

847
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,700
interesting happening despite the 
differences in the political histories.

848
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:22,420
And,
and,

849
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,980
uh,
you know,

850
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,560
the political establishment of those.

851
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,080
It could be a selective focus because of
social media and realtime covering of 

852
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:37,401
these incidences.
I do wonder to what extent the problem 

853
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:41,811
really exists on college campuses of the
this campus craziness like Chapman 

854
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,720
University where I'm at,
I'd never seen anything like this and,

855
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:45,670
and,
and,

856
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,480
and most of the time when I travel and 
give talks at colleges,

857
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:53,481
you never see anything.
It's just people just students are 

858
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:55,790
hunkered down doing their thing.
I got to bring you to University of New 

859
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,050
Hampshire next time,
changed your opinion on that pretty 

860
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,050
quick.
They shaking or something that's made,

861
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,300
but it could be that the minority,
it's a minority,

862
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,030
but they're loud and they're instantly 
covered now.

863
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,740
So it seems like Tucker Carlson in his 
weekly campus craziness.

864
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,100
It's like if I walked on campus,
I wanted to see riots going,

865
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,520
well,
no,

866
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:19,521
you don't hardly ever see anything.
So there's this idea of pluralistic 

867
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,200
ignorance or the spiral of silence where
a minority can take over.

868
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,850
Toxic ideology can take over a country 
like Germany in the 19 thirties were 

869
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,140
probably.
Most Germans were not on board with 

870
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,511
Hitler's program,
but they thought everybody else was and 

871
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,601
there's punishment for descent.
So you get the spread of these toxic 

872
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:38,601
ideas.
When actually most people,

873
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:43,461
like most college students,
will it privately say I'm against binge 

874
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:43,461
drinking,
I don't want to do it,

875
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,450
but,
but they,

876
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,770
but they think but,
but I know all my friends are into it so

877
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:51,771
I do it,
but everyone says that that's what I'm 

878
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:54,591
more concerned about.
So I want to know about your experience 

879
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:54,591
on college campuses

880
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:55,800
because I find when I go there and I'm 
usually invited by,

881
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:58,260
it's usually libertarian groups are 
saying in a center,

882
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:03,261
right or something.
Right now it's College Republicans and 

883
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:03,261
I,
as I always say,

884
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:06,471
I would gladly do it if the Democrats 
would invite me and I'll get the same 

885
00:41:06,471 --> 00:41:06,471
exact speech.
Um,

886
00:41:06,471 --> 00:41:11,450
but what I find is that even for 
Libertarians who basically just want to 

887
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,391
live and let live,
they're finding they're afraid to say 

888
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:17,211
what they think.
So it's not that all of the kids are 

889
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:20,660
screaming and doing violence,
but I'm more concerned about that 

890
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,150
secondary set of students that at 
college is afraid to say what they think

891
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:29,151
because you're not going to get out and 
suddenly start telling the world that 

892
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:29,151
you think.

893
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:29,740
This is a great irony though,
because for the Libertarians,

894
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:31,580
the,
I think you need strong leadership.

895
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:32,680
Yeah,
no,

896
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:34,960
they were doing could do a hell of a lot
better in that department.

897
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,140
Like even for the campus.
I think somebody,

898
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,320
you know,
like I,

899
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:41,850
um,
I,

900
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,730
I so agree with you Michael.
I think that it's,

901
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,290
um,
this is a positive thing.

902
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,240
I think.
And again it's both sides,

903
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,020
you know,
um,

904
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,140
and it's,
it's the loudest voices and then there's

905
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:56,880
a lot of bullying and shaming and I've 
talked to so many students one on one or

906
00:41:56,881 --> 00:42:01,881
even like even in my own classroom I'm,
I'm pretty well known for having one of 

907
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:03,090
the most diverse,
actually maybe the most diverse class,

908
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,730
but not just ethnically and racially,
although that too,

909
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,480
but I had 15 members of the federalist 
society,

910
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,510
you know,
in addition to 15 members of the black 

911
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:14,510
students association and Non Muslim 
Americans.

912
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,380
And admittedly it wasn't constitutional 
law.

913
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,180
It was,
it was a class that was a little bit,

914
00:42:18,181 --> 00:42:23,181
not as charged now,
but I still talk about democracy and an 

915
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:23,181
ethnic conflict and all these issues.

916
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:25,440
The 2016 election.
But I set the rules,

917
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,070
you know,
like,

918
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,380
you know,
I just said these are the rules for this

919
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:33,381
class and you there's,
there was a wait list so don't come if 

920
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,591
you can't do this.
But if somebody for this particular 

921
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:36,591
conversation,
I know it's going to be difficult,

922
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:41,301
but if somebody says something and they 
don't quite use the vocabulary that you 

923
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:44,340
would use or they say something that 
maybe offense you for this,

924
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:45,840
just this class,
I'll say,

925
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,910
can you just not assume worst motives?
Just assume that they just.

926
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:52,530
Can we just add,
I,

927
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,870
I can have success with it now.
It's not easy.

928
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,440
And I've seen like,
you know,

929
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,030
even our dean said these are free speech
norms.

930
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,930
You can protest,
anybody can protest,

931
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,240
but you can't.
They have to be allowed to speak.

932
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,270
So I think leadership,
I think there's been a lot of cowardice

933
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,600
for this.
So you're selling me on in this instance

934
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:11,700
on a ton of top down version of this 
that you think it has.

935
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,850
I basically,
especially at a college campus,

936
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:16,580
I do agree with it because you can't,
for lack of a better phrase,

937
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,650
you can't have the inmates running the 
asylum.

938
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,680
These kids are supposed to learn there 
and there have to learn by people that 

939
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:23,840
are smarter than them.
So in this case,

940
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:25,360
I am okay with some top down.

941
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,420
Yeah.
I,

942
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:27,830
I think,
um,

943
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,110
have you had any pushback against that 
though?

944
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:32,470
Because I'd imagine that's got to be 
hard pill to swallow.

945
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,520
Not the Dean our Dean has.
Yes.

946
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,210
And if they're always hard cases,
they're hard cases and um,

947
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,030
uh,
uh,

948
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,520
I've do,
you know,

949
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,060
yeah,
I get in trouble all the time,

950
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:46,070
but,
but I not terrible trouble,

951
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:51,100
you know,
I think maybe it's because I'm a 

952
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,800
minority woman to uh,
not everybody is going to be

953
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,090
you using identity politics against a 
very clever.

954
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,740
I don't even get used it.
I just like,

955
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,570
you know,
um,

956
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,820
and I definitely know what it feels like
to be an outsider of your first 

957
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:02,820
question.
You know,

958
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:02,930
I'm,
I'm,

959
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:08,070
I,
I've always had a lot of classical 

960
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:08,170
liberals try to speak for me.
So,

961
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:08,980
uh,
so I,

962
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,920
I really kind of get it.
Um,

963
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,150
but,
uh,

964
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,150
yeah.
Anyway,

965
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,090
well you identify as a minority woman,
don't you?

966
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,980
I've been feeling that more and more.
Yeah.

967
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,820
So,
um,

968
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,870
the other thing about reading your book 
though was how,

969
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,360
um,
our state department did not seem to get

970
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,060
these,
these tribal conflicts in Vietnam,

971
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,770
Afghanistan,
Iraq,

972
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,530
does no one call a professor at Yale and
go,

973
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,800
hey,
we're thinking about this is our 

974
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:39,800
strategy.
What do you think?

975
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:39,800
So when,
when I was reading that,

976
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,780
I kept thinking of,
do you remember during the 2008 

977
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,741
election,
so Obama running the first time during 

978
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:49,050
the primaries there having the debate,
the democratic debate,

979
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:54,051
and Joe Biden was still running at the 
time and they're all talking about Iraq 

980
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:54,051
and Joe Biden goes,
you know what,

981
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:58,701
actually,
Iraq should be split into three 

982
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:01,401
countries because there should be a 
Sunni country and a Shia country and a 

983
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:02,280
Kurdish country.
And because this,

984
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,710
this tribal stuff has been going on way 
before us,

985
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,450
way before the bread from the Ottomans 
and blah,

986
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:06,750
blah,
blah.

987
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,240
And people thought he was completely 
bananas.

988
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:11,480
Now I think there's probably plenty of 
other reasons I think he's been at it,

989
00:45:11,481 --> 00:45:16,481
but putting that aside,
he was getting to the heart of what you 

990
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:16,481
were saying.

991
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:19,910
Yeah.
And I don't know if that was the right 

992
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:19,910
solution,
but yes,

993
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:19,910
absolutely.
And you know,

994
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,781
this is interesting.
This half the book is about our foreign 

995
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:25,050
policy fiascos and how it's our us 
blindness to these.

996
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:25,890
Again,
these,

997
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,920
these,
the force of identities that we barely 

998
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,720
know anything about Sunni Shias current 
kind of the same or,

999
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,530
or Afghanistan,
Pashtuns,

1000
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,060
Uzbeks,
whatever,

1001
00:45:36,061 --> 00:45:36,630
you know,
um,

1002
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,130
Vietnam,
Chinese,

1003
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,390
Vietnamese,
Korean,

1004
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,130
all the same.
Um,

1005
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,550
and it's amazing.
It is something that I have not gotten 

1006
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,870
in trouble for this because it's a lot 
of very critical chapter saying that our

1007
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,830
greatest foreign policy disaster stem 
from this one thing,

1008
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,970
our failure to see that,
that there,

1009
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,850
there's this,
this,

1010
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,960
these tribal identities that um,
uh,

1011
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,220
we imagined that democracy will just 
smooth and away,

1012
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,510
but just have some elections and 
everything will just kind of melt away 

1013
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,210
or markets.
And what I show is that democracy under 

1014
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,330
a lot of circumstances actually 
catalyzes those group conflicts.

1015
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,140
It gets worse.

1016
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,130
Are there moments though that for 
whatever reason,

1017
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:21,131
either because of war or famine or 
something else that actually we can get 

1018
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:22,370
past those things.
So like for example,

1019
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,170
things actually were going pretty well 
in Iraq after they had their elections,

1020
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,750
um,
you know,

1021
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,820
at,
toward the end of the George W Bush for 

1022
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,311
getting,
whether we should have gotten in there 

1023
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:37,451
or anything like that,
but they were actually having free and 

1024
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:39,881
fair elections.
It sounded like he was getting a little 

1025
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:40,040
more secularized then we left and okay,
so be it.

1026
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,270
But then things got reversed,
but we actually built out of the chaos.

1027
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:46,310
We started doing something good and now,
now,

1028
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:46,870
yeah,
I,

1029
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,920
I tell a slightly more detailed story 
than that slight disagreement.

1030
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:55,921
I think we are really messed up the 
democracy bit when we first got in 

1031
00:46:55,921 --> 00:47:00,841
there.
And I think actually most of the key 

1032
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:00,841
players say that now,
you know,

1033
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:01,140
like secretary of state,
Condoleezza Rice said,

1034
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:06,150
you know,
we should've paid more attention to the 

1035
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,150
tribal structures.
Um,

1036
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,220
and worked with that.
What you're getting at is I write about 

1037
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,960
a success case and this is the 2007 
search.

1038
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,990
Again,
putting aside politics that's gotten so 

1039
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:15,990
polarized,
but most Americans,

1040
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,700
they even know about it,
know that we put it in more troops.

1041
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:23,850
What they don't know is that it was a 
180 degree change in our foreign policy.

1042
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:29,250
The people in charge said,
let's pay attention to the groups now 

1043
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:29,980
let's go talk to some sheets,
and she used to,

1044
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,990
and by the way,
they educated their troops like here's 

1045
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:34,990
the difference between them.
Here's what they were,

1046
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,250
here's what they eat,
your their ceremonies,

1047
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,730
and they really turned it around it and 
I document all the numbers within at a 

1048
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,860
point when things were so bad,
they brought sectarian violence down.

1049
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,350
They brought suicide bombing casualties 
down,

1050
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:52,560
and then yes,
at that point us lost its political 

1051
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:52,560
wealth.
We've left

1052
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,910
politics really just straight up mess it
up,

1053
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:56,290
right?
Because things were getting better.

1054
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,250
They had real life

1055
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,290
is it shows that if we do,
again,

1056
00:47:59,291 --> 00:48:02,500
the weird optimist in me,
I think that we have done so many things

1057
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:07,530
in our foreign policy so foolishly that 
we can really do so much better.

1058
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,290
We just have to pay a little bit of 
attention to these groups,

1059
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,560
which are what people raised it,
it,

1060
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:15,280
that that's the first thing they hear 
about.

1061
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,720
Um,
and by the way,

1062
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:19,450
the reason for this is something also I 
think positive.

1063
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,730
Well,
why are we so blind to it?

1064
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:24,070
Because I contrast us to the British,
the British,

1065
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,360
and they're divided in rule.
Um,

1066
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:31,470
they were incredibly group conscious.
They had these huge documents detailing 

1067
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,880
all the different caste differences and 
they used it to divide.

1068
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,530
I mean,
they,

1069
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:35,050
they,
you know,

1070
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,390
that's not what we should do the 
opposite,

1071
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,480
but I think it has to do with our own 
extraordinary success with assimilation.

1072
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,970
You know,
we have an,

1073
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:50,010
of course,
not every group but more than any other 

1074
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,010
country we,
you know,

1075
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,960
the idea is if Irish people and Italians
and Hungarians and Polish can all become

1076
00:48:56,171 --> 00:49:01,171
Americans within one generation,
let's have some election because 

1077
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,830
Sudanese and she isn't currently and 
it's,

1078
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:04,420
it's other countries are not like us.

1079
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,090
Yeah.
So if,

1080
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,180
let's say,
if there is a movement building right 

1081
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,580
now and some of these enlightenment 
values are coming back,

1082
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:12,990
there is,
there is.

1083
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,190
I'm with Ya.
All right,

1084
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:16,380
so let's say there is a movement 
building.

1085
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,650
What do we have to do as people that are
part of it or want to build something 

1086
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:26,331
good to avoid the negative parts of 
tribalism that will inherently come 

1087
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:27,390
along with it.

1088
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,990
Well read,
read Amy's.

1089
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,750
It ends positively about,
here's some of the things we could do.

1090
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,960
I mean just,
I call this the Indu who effect from 

1091
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,160
that Jack Nicholson's film about Schmidt
where he told us he adopts a child 

1092
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,430
watching late night TV.
You know,

1093
00:49:43,431 --> 00:49:48,431
if you give $15 a month,
this will help little Enugu and they 

1094
00:49:48,431 --> 00:49:49,550
show a picture of indiegogo.
Now,

1095
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,920
as we know from studies that if you show
a picture of 10,000

1096
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,780
starving kids in Kenya,
people give a dollar.

1097
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,990
If you show a little indigo,
you're willing to give you 100 times 

1098
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,470
more than that,
so it's tricking the brain into thinking

1099
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:05,471
little Hindu who is an honorary member 
of my tribe and so that kind of we know 

1100
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:07,820
how to do that from fundraising and so 
on.

1101
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:12,821
That has to be applied.
I think politically that you know you 

1102
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:13,190
have to identify with these people.
As you pointed out.

1103
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:18,191
You know actually when you actually know
a gay person or a black person or a Jew 

1104
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:18,710
or somebody like this,
that's not your normal tribe.

1105
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,020
That does break down those tribal 
barriers.

1106
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,950
Your colleague Paul Bloom and his book 
against empathy points out that the dark

1107
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:26,000
side of empathy.
If we're,

1108
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,400
if we're super cooperative

1109
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,400
and supportive of our tribe,
that makes us even more wary of other 

1110
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:39,041
tribes because they can be a threat to 
our people that we liked so much and so 

1111
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,600
we have to break through that.
Acknowledged the tribalism,

1112
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:46,601
but also counter.
It comes back to your favorite work 

1113
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:49,580
individually because those studies that 
are really positive at the end show that

1114
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:54,581
if you can pull people out of their 
groups and by the way not just dumped 

1115
00:50:54,581 --> 00:50:56,900
them altogether to more hating of each 
other,

1116
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,560
but if you can interact with another 
person as an individual,

1117
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:05,590
which of course is the whole hard part,
it's astounding how much progress you 

1118
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:10,301
can make.
The best example I like is the 

1119
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:10,520
integration of them,
US military in the 19 fifties,

1120
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,850
everybody was against it.
So it was like 80 percent and this can't

1121
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:18,851
work.
And afterwards they found that the 

1122
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:21,101
integrated troops were as,
or more effective than the all white 

1123
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:21,101
troops.

1124
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:23,720
And then they interviewed everybody and 
it was just kind of your point.

1125
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:24,830
They were like,
you know,

1126
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,400
if you're in a foxhole,
you,

1127
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:31,490
if you miss your family and the same way
you have to put your life in somebody 

1128
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,961
else's hand,
you don't care what their accent is or 

1129
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:35,090
you don't care what the color of their 
skin is.

1130
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,130
And that was like an actually an 
incredible,

1131
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,680
uh,
cross pollinating moment.

1132
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:44,770
Alright,
so let's shift a little bit here for 

1133
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:44,770
the,
for the last little bit here.

1134
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:48,250
So I want to talk about some tiger moms 
stuff because I do think that partly 

1135
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,290
what I'm seeing right now is I'm on tour
with Jordan Peterson,

1136
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:56,291
is not that he's Tiger Dad,
but he's filling a role of something 

1137
00:51:56,451 --> 00:52:01,451
like that.
So it's not necessarily as outright 

1138
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,160
aggressive as say tiger mom would be,
um,

1139
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,060
but he's fit.
He's filling some role there.

1140
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,060
Do you think that's sort of fair to say?
So funny that you said that because 

1141
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,060
obviously it's an incredibly polarizing 
figure,

1142
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,160
but when I watched a few things and read
a few chips,

1143
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,970
that's what it reminded me of.
You don't,

1144
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,190
it's kind of,
you know,

1145
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:20,750
one of the things I said in target mom 
was assume strength rather than weakness

1146
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:22,010
in your children.
Um,

1147
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,290
and I got a lot of trouble for saying 
that,

1148
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,860
but what's the pushback on a statement 
like that?

1149
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:30,260
Like a,
Oh gosh,

1150
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,110
you know,
all these mental health issues that I've

1151
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:36,740
gotten a lot of trouble with Jeff.
It's a first of all,

1152
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,960
um,
what is tiger parenting?

1153
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,420
Right?
I mean,

1154
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:44,430
and it is really true that a lot of 
Asian Americans have parents that are 

1155
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:48,881
too stifling and too strict on both 
sides and they make their children 

1156
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:50,000
miserable and people have committed.

1157
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,530
So I mean,
it's trust.

1158
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,560
It's a parenting is one of those things 
that affects everybody because not 

1159
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,610
everybody has a child,
but everybody had a parent.

1160
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,870
So it's always personal.
But I think there is something,

1161
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,130
um,
because I,

1162
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:04,970
you know,
I was,

1163
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,830
I didn't understand why I was in the 
middle of this firestorm either.

1164
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,180
Um,
and it's,

1165
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,490
it's interesting because you're in this 
moment,

1166
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,030
you're experiencing it and people would 
ask me at the time and at the time I had

1167
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:20,480
no idea at the time I was just trying to
defend myself.

1168
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:23,120
I was stumped.
Somebody told me to stop apologizing,

1169
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,800
you know,
that I just kept saying I didn't,

1170
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:29,801
I was supposed to.
It's just a memoir and you're 

1171
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:29,801
misunderstanding.
And finally I just decided to own it.

1172
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:30,300
Okay.
I,

1173
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,080
it is just a memoir that's true,
but I'm a proud strict mom and then 

1174
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,080
things got a little bit better.

1175
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,520
But I think somebody,
one person said,

1176
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:39,030
you know,
amy,

1177
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:44,031
I think that if the book had been about 
like a strict Italian mom or strict 

1178
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:45,000
Romanian bomb,
nobody would have cared.

1179
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:50,450
It was at that moment that I hit fear of
parenting and fear of China at the exact

1180
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:53,720
same moment because that was when all 
these,

1181
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,990
those test scores came out and the US 
this great superpowers,

1182
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,170
like at number 30,
eight,

1183
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,280
China,
Singapore,

1184
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,420
and they were all like one,
two,

1185
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:01,230
three,
and it was going to,

1186
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,810
they're going to eat our lunch.
Um,

1187
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,950
and,
and I think also

1188
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,420
Greek tiger mom would have been more 
okay.

1189
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,410
It's,
but going to your point,

1190
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:13,070
I think it did fill.
People said it touched a nerve.

1191
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,640
It's often where there's something 
missing already.

1192
00:54:16,641 --> 00:54:18,680
Like people need something.
There's a vacuum,

1193
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,110
something's off,
the pendulum has swung too far.

1194
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,670
Um,
and then you,

1195
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,220
this random thing comes in,
fills a void.

1196
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:28,310
So I think it could be a slightly 
similar phenomenon.

1197
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:34,060
A quit apologizing in a way that's what 
Jordan is saying on some level.

1198
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:36,250
Quit apologizing.
Just be who you are,

1199
00:54:36,251 --> 00:54:39,340
set the rules and have goals.
And don't apologize for it.

1200
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,500
And there's a lot of people going,
yeah,

1201
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:42,520
okay,
I'm going to,

1202
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,830
I'm going to be successful and I'm not 
gonna apologize for it.

1203
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,730
Yeah,
that's right.

1204
00:54:45,731 --> 00:54:50,731
You shouldn't have to do that.
What do we do about that set of people 

1205
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:54,121
though?
That is just looking to take everybody 

1206
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:55,390
down because I that that's part of the 
overcorrection crew,

1207
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,600
but they're not going to just go one.
They don't want to.

1208
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:03,601
Restorative justice.
Social justice is not restorative 

1209
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,120
justice.
It's the Old Testament.

1210
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,880
Retributive justice lives must be 
destroyed.

1211
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,260
You know,
you have to go down and grovel and then 

1212
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:12,820
we're going to destroy you.
Yeah.

1213
00:55:12,821 --> 00:55:17,821
Well that's why our friend people goes 
and he calls it a this he calls this 

1214
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,240
social justice thing or this idea of a 
secular religion.

1215
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:19,750
Yeah,
it is.

1216
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,300
That's what I believe it is.
Yeah,

1217
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,660
that's right.
Original sin,

1218
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,010
your,
your white male,

1219
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:26,110
whatever.
And there is no.

1220
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,990
There is no restorative justice.
You just have to be destroyed.

1221
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,140
So what can we do?
It's,

1222
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,510
it's a hard solution.
Push back and just say,

1223
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:35,140
no,
I'm not gonna.

1224
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:36,670
I'm not gonna apologize.
Uh,

1225
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:42,080
you know,
if I do something wrong I will 

1226
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,471
apologize,
but I'm not gonna apologize for 

1227
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:43,471
something I didn't do or who I am.
I'm a white male.

1228
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:47,970
I,
why should I apologize for that very 

1229
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,521
quickly.
When you made the decision not to 

1230
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:50,530
apologize anymore to stand up for 
yourself,

1231
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:55,531
how quickly did it all kind of stopped?
Because I think that's what a lot of 

1232
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:55,720
people that are watching this are 
wondering.

1233
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:00,740
They're afraid to say anything because 
they don't want to just get caught in 

1234
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,000
that meat grinder.
So I want to show them instances of,

1235
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,650
because every one of us that has stood 
up and said,

1236
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,070
we're here,
we're not just going to bow to you.

1237
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,070
We've made it eventually.
I'm not

1238
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:16,070
a huge fan of this.
I'm not exactly sure what these 

1239
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:16,070
apologies accomplish.
I think in a way I,

1240
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:16,620
again,
I,

1241
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,900
I,
I see things through a tribal leds,

1242
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,040
right?
I think that's like a,

1243
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,410
like a,
it's a victory.

1244
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,250
It's a point.
It's like,

1245
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,500
trophy,
I got an apology.

1246
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:25,030
I'm going to extract this.
Um,

1247
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,770
it,
um,

1248
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,390
it was more of myself to,
um,

1249
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,490
uh,
to,

1250
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,130
to just kind of say,
wait a second,

1251
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,950
I've made a lot of mistakes if you 
actually read the book,

1252
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,960
who realize it's about my younger 
daughter rebelling and it's funny and 

1253
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,210
there whatever,
unreliable narrators,

1254
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:42,220
but you want.
I'm actually pretty proud.

1255
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,460
I'm pretty proud.
Standby everything.

1256
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,370
And um,
yeah,

1257
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,470
I,
I think it's hugely empowered,

1258
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,320
hugely empowering psychologically.
Um,

1259
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,680
but you know,
to play devil's advocate on the bigger 

1260
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:58,680
picture,
I think we all need to elevate ourselves

1261
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,790
because I'm sort of in a different camp 
than you guys.

1262
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:04,240
Like I'm looking at the country inn 
where and as the optimist,

1263
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:06,330
I feel like we all.
And I,

1264
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,340
that's why I admired Michael so much.
Like it's hard to recognize yourself as 

1265
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:16,060
being somebody that's being tribal or 
whatever the US versus them always.

1266
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,390
And what I have noticed because this 
happened to me is one bad thing happens 

1267
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,160
to you because we've all had this some 
just terrible attack,

1268
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,620
very cruel thing,
incredibly unfair.

1269
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,100
And it's human nature.
I get so angry at the other side,

1270
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,170
right?
And rightfully so.

1271
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:36,550
I think the warning I would have is how 
many people do put in the them category.

1272
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,390
I think we should all narrow that,
make it smaller,

1273
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:45,420
you know,
because there are these big labels and 

1274
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:45,420
people do it on all sides and I even do 
it.

1275
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,831
I just get so mad at this massive pool 
of people that I think of as my enemies 

1276
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,700
because something horrible just happened
to me,

1277
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,470
you know,
it was something incredibly insulting or

1278
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,290
this terrible stuff that I get on 
twitter.

1279
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,510
I mean,
we all get the hate.

1280
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,560
Um,
and it's so easy just to hate back I 

1281
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:03,560
think.
I think that's the hard thing.

1282
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,450
So actually I think he narrowed the 
enemy.

1283
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:05,840
Yeah,
for sure.

1284
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:10,841
I mean,
if you listen to conservative talk 

1285
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:10,841
radio,
oh my gosh,

1286
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:10,880
it's just so polarized.
I mean,

1287
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,050
every other word is,
you know,

1288
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,370
the liberals,
the left,

1289
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:15,180
the Lib,
tards yards,

1290
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,070
uh,
you know,

1291
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:19,390
the New York slimes,
the Washington composed,

1292
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,320
that's pretty quickly.
My wife calls him the screamer.

1293
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:27,320
She's Germany's,
are these people in the radio screaming?

1294
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:28,700
It's like,
that's what gets ratings.

1295
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:31,700
Apparently they're just as bad as the 
people on the left.

1296
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,330
India,
we,

1297
00:58:32,331 --> 00:58:33,710
yeah,
we have to stop doing this,

1298
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:39,100
that the principle of charity just be 
charitable to the person you're talking 

1299
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,440
to.
You don't assume you know,

1300
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,380
because they slipped up and used this 
word instead of that word.

1301
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,280
Therefore they're Hitler.
No more reductive ad hilarity.

1302
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,800
You have to stop that.

1303
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:53,980
So do you think it's possible to wrap 
this up on a nice boat and use a little 

1304
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,221
of our optimism here and a little of you
or moral arc here that the exhaustion 

1305
00:58:57,561 --> 00:59:02,561
with all of this,
enough of these conversations that 

1306
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:03,290
actually clearly are breaking into the 
mainstream at the moment and all of that

1307
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:08,590
will lead to a sort of political 
realignment where it seems to me that I 

1308
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:13,691
would argue at this point we basically 
needed trump even though I didn't vote 

1309
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:16,931
for him,
we needed him for this now for years of 

1310
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:19,151
just upheaval and fertile ground and 
ideas and people realigning their 

1311
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,810
thinking and strange alliances and all 
that.

1312
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,350
But that what we can get.
We don't need another trump after.

1313
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:27,200
I don't think if,
if everything actually goes okay,

1314
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,830
we will actually be okay with something 
decent again,

1315
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:34,130
but we needed the thing to be shook up 
before we could get there.

1316
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,740
Yeah.
I'm an optimist for the say I,

1317
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:37,670
I think,
um,

1318
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,070
and it's very hard to say people are so 
angry.

1319
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:45,071
So there was,
it's also possible that it's completely 

1320
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:45,071
the other way.
For sure.

1321
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:45,080
Yeah.
You know,

1322
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,130
it's funny.
I'm also,

1323
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:51,131
we started with the masterpiece cake 
thing and I said I'm not a college 

1324
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:51,131
professor,
but I,

1325
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:53,510
I've been giving talks a lot of places.
And the question is,

1326
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,980
is there another,
is there a model?

1327
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:00,010
Is there a country that you've studied 
that could be the model for us to get 

1328
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,420
out of our political tribalism?
And actually this is actually could even

1329
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:03,740
get me in trouble because it's.
No,

1330
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,780
no,
but I just say we're the model.

1331
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,680
We are the bottle we.
And it's not that we're per,

1332
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,860
oh my gosh,
you know,

1333
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,950
we have made so many mistakes that we're
in a very bad moment in many ways,

1334
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,500
but we have the apparatus,
we have something special.

1335
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,630
This thing of that I call the super good
context,

1336
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,760
um,
our constitution,

1337
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,970
of course we have repeatedly failed to 
live up to those ideals,

1338
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:31,150
but the ideals are there and this is an 
ethnically and religiously neutral 

1339
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,950
document.
Again,

1340
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:37,180
not the way it's played out in reality 
is always the,

1341
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:39,350
our ideals have always exceeded our 
reality.

1342
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:45,110
So it's an aspirational country.
It's an aspirational document and this 

1343
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,110
is why we come full circle,
you know,

1344
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,360
I think we're worthy.
Enlightenment experiment.

1345
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,980
Yeah.
I never thought,

1346
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:54,040
and this is where maybe I was not 
somebody that you remember in the late 

1347
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,420
nineties when the Berlin Wall came down,
it was like,

1348
01:00:56,421 --> 01:01:01,421
we're going to be one world,
maybe Saudi Arabia and Turkey will join 

1349
01:01:01,421 --> 01:01:01,640
the EU.
That navy,

1350
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:04,850
the United States will join the EU.
I was always like,

1351
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:09,970
never too big.
So I'm still a little bit of a tribalist

1352
01:01:11,031 --> 01:01:14,840
I think that I think the world at this 
point is too big a unit.

1353
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,110
Yeah.

1354
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:18,050
Well you use figuring out that for 
countries that are in Europe.

1355
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:18,540
So.
Right about.

1356
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:23,750
Yeah.
But I'm really glad that that'll be a 

1357
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,750
good place to wrap this,
um,

1358
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:28,590
that you mentioned he's aspirational 
documents because as you guys can see 

1359
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:28,590
through our window,
right in there in our control room,

1360
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,460
we've got an American flag in there,
but also what you can see,

1361
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:32,450
maybe you can see it.
Amy's,

1362
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:36,770
I just got these two huge print giant 
print of the declaration of independence

1363
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:40,550
and a giant print of the constitution 
that I was given at a,

1364
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:42,770
at a speaking thing that I did for three
turning point.

1365
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,160
And yes,
we haven't always lived up to those 

1366
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:48,160
things,
but if we could get back to that,

1367
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,720
that's why I care about these things.
I'm always tweeting about these things 

1368
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:52,720
and when I'm in D,
c,

1369
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,240
I go and I take pictures of all these 
things and put up,

1370
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,890
oh,
this is what Thomas Jefferson said,

1371
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:58,340
that they've given us the blueprint.
It doesn't mean that they were perfect.

1372
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,590
It doesn't mean that we've always done 
it right.

1373
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,930
But this idea that someone do it better 
than us for as bad as it may seem,

1374
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,980
we're not killing each other in the 
streets right now.

1375
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,670
Yes,
there is.

1376
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,510
They're unjust murder.
Yes.

1377
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,250
Is there just this or that,
but it's still pretty damn good.

1378
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,900
If we were going to bring it home 
schermer well,

1379
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,010
I mentioned being a multiplanetary 
species when we call an Eis Mars

1380
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,700
and we're going to do it.
You know what?

1381
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,250
We got to set up some kind of 
government,

1382
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:24,950
some kind of economic system.
What?

1383
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,720
What documents would you bring?
Yeah,

1384
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:32,721
the declaration of independence and the 
constitution that that would be the 

1385
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:35,931
place to start.
Maybe they'll tweak it and experiment 

1386
01:02:35,931 --> 01:02:36,450
and then it'll get a little bit better 
or worse,

1387
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,370
and then we can look at that as an 
experiment and go,

1388
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:39,810
okay,
here's what we should do here,

1389
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:45,530
but that also,
that perspective also gives us that 

1390
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,200
Sagan esque Pale blue dot look back at 
the earth and go,

1391
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:51,470
oh,
there are no borders from Mars is just 

1392
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:52,710
this blue dot and maybe that'll change 
our perspective.

1393
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:55,620
A little bit about the tribal nature of 
our species.

1394
01:02:55,970 --> 01:03:00,970
That's actually a great idea.
Maybe my new argument when people are 

1395
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:00,970
telling me how horrible America is,
it's like,

1396
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,630
you know what,
if we were on a Mars tomorrow,

1397
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,700
we're going somewhere tomorrow.
You got a better document that to start 

1398
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,470
us off with and I'm pretty sure nobody 
would have something better.

1399
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,220
No,
you know,

1400
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,050
they probably wouldn't know what to say,
but that would be.

1401
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:17,310
That'd be great.
I know you could do something to finish 

1402
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,241
this up strong.
That will bring us into the future and 

1403
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:19,241
into outer space and all that.
Well guys,

1404
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:20,090
this has been,
I mean this hour.

1405
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,050
You by.
This has been a pleasure.

1406
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:26,290
I am A.
I am demanding that you come back for a 

1407
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:27,980
one on one and shermer.
I'll do this one more time.

1408
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,860
It's been a pleasure guys,
and we're going to link to a Michael and

1409
01:03:32,861 --> 01:03:36,230
amy's websites and books and all that 
good stuff right now below.
