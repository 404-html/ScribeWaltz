1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,170
All right,
I'm very excited today.

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,600
We are at political and we have a packed
room.

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:07,434
I don't even have to make that up.
We actually have the standing room only 

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,930
room at politico and I am here with 
Michael Steele.

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,740
He is the former head of the Republican 
party.

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,150
Can I say that?
Is that the official.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,550
You were the head of the Republican 
National Committee,

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,900
but republic.
Yeah,

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,260
head of the party.
The guy with the biggest target on this.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,360
Yeah,
exactly.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,720
He's also the former lieutenant governor
of Maryland.

12
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,160
And Are you still currently MSNBC?
I am

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,453
the generalists over to MSNBC.
So a one of a very small group of 

14
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:39,560
conservative voices.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,900
Did they let you guys over there?
Who Do we have to come in the back?

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,460
We get to come and get.
I get to come in and,

17
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,340
and folks are very nice.
It's really good.

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,400
I get water and uh,
uh,

19
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:55,970
every once in awhile I get to say hi to 
people.

20
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:56,650
So it's good.

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,750
Yeah.
Wait,

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,440
who else are the Conservatives over 
there?

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,940
I'm uh,
Joe Scarborough.

24
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,640
Um,
and uh,

25
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,923
me.

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,590
Yeah.
All right,

27
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:10,401
good.
Very good.

28
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:11,480
Very good.
Okay.

29
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,610
So there's a ton I want to talk to you 
about including Cable News,

30
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:16,520
so we'll save some for later.
So let's just start first because,

31
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,240
uh,
you are a Republican now according to my

32
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:22,720
notes they gave me here you are black,
is that correct today?

33
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,910
Yes.
Well,

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,651
you know,
I worked,

35
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,770
I've been working on the Tan and I've 
gotten really good at it,

36
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,630
so yeah,
yeah.

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,860
All right,
so a black Republican,

38
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,170
that was the head of the party.
I know,

39
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,960
I imagine they exist.
Explain that to me.

40
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,950
It's called history.
Uh,

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,793
and,
and a lot of folks really don't 

42
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:45,051
appreciate the very unique history 
between Republican,

43
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,450
the Republican Party and the black 
community.

44
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,780
It is our political home,
uh,

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,230
it is where we first emerged in this 
country politically,

46
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,940
uh,
and certainly,

47
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,691
uh,
you know,

48
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:58,524
Lincoln and the abolitionist and,
and in fact the party was born out of a 

49
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,990
fight between abolitionists and wigs,
uh,

50
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,290
over the issue of slavery.
And um,

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,350
the.
Thankfully the abolitionists one and the

52
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,060
Republican Party was essentially formed 
Frederick Douglass,

53
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:20,040
a notable African American,
a slave and free.

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,820
A man was very much a part of helping to
build this party.

55
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:27,690
So we've got this very unique history 
and as a young,

56
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,150
a young kid of 17,
uh,

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,910
looking at getting involved politically 
for the first time,

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,160
I was like,
you know,

59
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:36,840
my mom who was a Roosevelt Democrat,
you know,

60
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,160
my,
my family,

61
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,020
very,
very much democrats.

62
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,854
And,
um,

63
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,420
my mother raised me to say,
hey,

64
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,290
you know,
go out there and discover and,

65
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,124
and decide for yourself.
Don't let our party affiliation of what 

66
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,660
we're doing and fluency just because 
we're Democrats.

67
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:52,494
And your onset a Democrat and your 
grandmother's Democrat and your 

68
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,520
grandfather,
Democrat,

69
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,031
and,
uh,

70
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,830
your cousins are Democrats.
No,

71
00:02:58,831 --> 00:02:59,664
no pressure

72
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,980
out at night did the study.
And I,

73
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:05,950
I realized,
well,

74
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,420
this is our home.
This is the political home for the party

75
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,600
of Ronald Reagan was running for 
president in [inaudible] 76.

76
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:14,090
At that time.
It was my first election to vote in.

77
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,463
And he sounded a lot like my mom in 
terms of how my mother talked to me 

78
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,390
about me.
You know,

79
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:23,360
as a young man,
I'm in this country,

80
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,410
uh,
and,

81
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,360
you know,
having opportunities,

82
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:28,880
taking advantages of opportunities so 
connected,

83
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,980
it resonated.
And uh,

84
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,270
you know,
went and told mom,

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,901
hey,
you know,

86
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,760
I registered as a Republican and she 
looked at me.

87
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,331
She said,
Lord,

88
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:35,980
what's the watch?

89
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,200
Do that.
That's all been good.

90
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,730
Yeah.
So that's a lot of the history,

91
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:43,730
but I think I'm going to guess that a 
lot of the people here would say,

92
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:46,230
well,
this doesn't seem to be the party.

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,950
No,
but it's not.

94
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,140
Well,
and I hate playing identity politics.

95
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,701
Yeah,
I don't,

96
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,440
I don't want to get into that because 
that's,

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,760
that's a slippery slope on so many 
levels for both parties who've,

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,290
who've really screwed up,
uh,

99
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,950
our politics with identity politics.
But,

100
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,813
and we can have that discussion,
but I think there is a legitimacy to 

101
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,240
the,
to the point that we have,

102
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,650
I think failed over the last 50 years to
appreciate that history.

103
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:15,484
And I started with a history because to 
me it is an important place to start 

104
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,280
because it,
it,

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,260
you,
then you then follow that into,

106
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,560
uh,
the fight that would later come on,

107
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,394
civil rights and the Republican leaders 
who themselves conservatives at that 

108
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,110
time,
I'm like their,

109
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,780
their forefathers politically.
Uh,

110
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,250
the abolitionists were,
we're stewards of this ideal,

111
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,200
uh,
in the Senate in the house.

112
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,520
Um,
and Johnson,

113
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,354
Lyndon Johnson knew that and yet a 
political decision was made for Kras 

114
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,430
political gain.
And,

115
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,680
and that was to,
um,

116
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,543
that national politics,
the idea of controlling the presidency 

117
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:02,251
or winning elections for Congress meant 
more than other things.

118
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,510
Uh,
and uh,

119
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,000
we walked away,
we walked away from the black community,

120
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,480
uh,
and,

121
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,750
and I think we are still paying the 
price for that.

122
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,683
Yeah.
So I think that's a good setup for the 

123
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:14,570
first part here,
which,

124
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,404
what does being a Republican in Twenty 
15 in America right now with our system 

125
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,260
is so screwed up,
so wacky.

126
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,800
I feel like people don't even know what 
that meant to you.

127
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,030
They've lost meaning because it's all 
gotten con conflated into,

128
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,890
uh,
other labels.

129
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,970
And,
and so,

130
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:32,804
you know,
where this tea party as conservative or 

131
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:39,320
is this,
and I just make the case that at the end

132
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,000
of the day,
uh,

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,690
there there's a thread of value or of 
values or principles,

134
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,560
ideals that you ascribe to a,
whether it is,

135
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,394
um,
your view on the role of government in 

136
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,690
the lives of the American people.
Um,

137
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,733
historically Republicans have not been 
antigovernment they been for limited 

138
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,784
government.
They think government is the legitimate 

139
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,213
as a legitimate entity.
It has a legitimate purpose though 

140
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,700
unlimited purpose.
Um,

141
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,450
whether that thread,
uh,

142
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,284
uh,
or idea centers around how you view the 

143
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,370
culture,
in other words that,

144
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,443
you know,
morality and concerns for the unborn or 

145
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:22,880
whatever the issues may be that that's a
part of that narrative.

146
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,650
So there,
there are broader,

147
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,650
they're broader strokes that have been 
used,

148
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,530
uh,
or,

149
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,280
or sort of stripped down,
uh,

150
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,090
in a way that gets us into this crass 
political discussion about,

151
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,820
I'm right,
you're wrong on an issue.

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,050
And that,
that's never,

153
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,110
that's never really the goal.
And I think the,

154
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,840
I kind of sum it up this way,
that I,

155
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,674
I look at the Party and I certainly saw 
this as a county chairman and as 

156
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:53,120
national chairman and a state chairman 
that even in a state like Maryland,

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,060
I had western Maryland,
which was very conservative.

158
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,560
I had where I lived in Prince George's 
in the beltway area,

159
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,380
which was very liberal.
You had southern Maryland,

160
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,470
which was conservative,
but trending purple,

161
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,790
you had,
you know,

162
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,070
so you had this,
these different dynamics,

163
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,963
and you have to kind of lead in that.
You've got to govern in that and you 

164
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:18,500
realize that politics is really about 
the art of the possible is not about the

165
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:22,640
art of the angry or scoring points or 
gaining advantage.

166
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,540
It really is about how do I take all of 
these disparate parts,

167
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,750
uh,
and different viewpoints and,

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,673
and figuring out how to effect a 
positive change or policy of positive 

169
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,440
change on a set of,
you know,

170
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,293
uh,
ideas and that that's gotten lost today 

171
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,664
in his heart.
And you've seen this play out right now 

172
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,210
in the GLP,
um,

173
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,113
this,
this internet icn struggle over 

174
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
identity,
who we are,

175
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,690
what we believe and why we value that.

176
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,030
Yeah.
So to the,

177
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,150
to the point of,
of what the party actually stands for,

178
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,283
I'm always amazed by the fact that if 
you take to like hot button issues that 

179
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,180
are,
that are clearly democrat pocket issues,

180
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:05,500
gay rights and legalizing marijuana,
those are Democrat issues.

181
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:05,940
They,
they,

182
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,671
there for,
you know,

183
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:09,730
basically for legalizing weed basically 
for gay rights.

184
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,390
But it seems to me a true Republican 
that would want small government.

185
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,224
Well,
you wouldn't care what someone does in 

186
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,054
their bedroom,
whether it's having sex with someone of 

187
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,290
the same sex or uh,
whether smoking weed,

188
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,420
right?
Shouldn't that be a republican issue?

189
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,400
Well,
I,

190
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I would argue that it probably wants was
that remember that the gop also has,

191
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,680
as a part of its roots,
a libertarian threat,

192
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:35,350
a very strong libertarian thread.
Um,

193
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,184
I've always been amused that those who,
who would argue about the limited role 

194
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:45,751
of government on one issue but then 
argue for the expansion of government on

195
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:46,580
another.
Yeah,

196
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,231
right.
So that,

197
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:48,400
that's so,
so,

198
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,273
so that

199
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,560
being authentically consistent for me is
very important.

200
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,220
It's like when people ask me about my 
views on life and,

201
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,200
and I tell them,
I say,

202
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,100
well,
I'm prolife,

203
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm very much pro life in a lot of has 
to come from how I was raised.

204
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,050
It comes from my faith tradition and how
I've been taught and,

205
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,770
and come to believe in value life.
So when it comes to the death penalty,

206
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,750
I'm against it and I always get,
well,

207
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,310
how can you be against the death 
penalty?

208
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,720
Well,
because I'm prolife,

209
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,903
you know,
so you've got to be consistent from 

210
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:21,660
beginning to the end and that's not what
we see happening.

211
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,213
Can you think of a politician off the 
top of your head that's consistent 

212
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:25,960
actually,
that really is,

213
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,950
is governing off a real set of.
I can't take anybody.

214
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,910
I mean,
can you think anyone?

215
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,260
Can any of you think of anyone?

216
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,400
Anyone that's governing?
Oh No.

217
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,433
Because they're not allowed to.
They're not allowed to do it because 

218
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:37,920
the,
the,

219
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,753
the,
the tensions inside both caucus of 

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,020
Cockeye are,
um,

221
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,090
are,
are such the Latin coming back is,

222
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,951
is,
is,

223
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,360
um,
is so,

224
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,740
so intense,
uh,

225
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,890
that.
Look,

226
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I grew up in DC and so the nation's 
capital has been in my backyard forever.

227
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,143
And so I remember Washington when it was
fun to be in Washington and you could 

228
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,130
go.
When I was a kid,

229
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,500
I used to go sit on the capital steps,
11:00

230
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,000
when I was in high school with my 
buddies,

231
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:11,550
we'd grab a liter of coke and

232
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,310
bag of chips.
The Soda,

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,600
the Soda.
I'm just seeing what is your guide?

234
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:18,411
Yes,
yes,

235
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:19,490
yes,
yes.

236
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,093
See,
I threw in liter of coke because I used 

237
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,360
to say I used to grab some coke and a 
bag of chips.

238
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,321
I'm like,
no,

239
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,280
soda.
Okay.

240
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,330
Okay.
Just so I got.

241
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,383
We would sit there,
but we would sit on the steps or you 

242
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:31,990
hang out with him,

243
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,350
Capitol police and so,
and you see members coming back and they

244
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,184
taught.
You go to restaurants in town and you 

245
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,700
could see a table where,
you know,

246
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,980
a conservative or a Democrat or 
Republican,

247
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:45,340
they weren't conservative liberal,
that was a republican and Democrat would

248
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,460
be off talking policy or just shooting 
the breeze.

249
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,590
You don't see that now.
They don't,

250
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,480
they don't mix,
they don't talk,

251
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:56,590
they don't integrate.
They don't want to be a part of this.

252
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,920
They don't bring their families here.
They go back to the districts which they

253
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:00,754
should do.
But there's this disconnect and the 

254
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,770
consequence of that is what we see now 
there,

255
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,600
there is no reason for me to work with 
you.

256
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,434
I remember when I was chairman and we 
were doing a getting ready for the 2010 

257
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:12,731
election.
Your course,

258
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:13,564
you're going out and you're meeting 
candidates and you're sort of 

259
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:15,634
interviewing them to see who you want to
line up and support and who you and not 

260
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,790
so much.

261
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,060
And um,
I met this one candidate and we got into

262
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,320
a nice conversation,
you know,

263
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,620
solid rock,
rip conservative and he's coming.

264
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:28,900
He is fire and brimstone ready to come 
to Washington.

265
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,090
And so we were talking and I said 
something about what will,

266
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,250
you know when you get to DC,
you know,

267
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,170
because at that time the dems were still
in charge and said,

268
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,243
you know,
one of the real interesting challenges 

269
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,253
is going to be working with,
with the leadership on the other side 

270
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,060
and working with Democrats.
Oh,

271
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,230
I'm not doing that.
I said,

272
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:46,450
excuse me doing that.
I said,

273
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,900
why are you coming to Washington?
He said,

274
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm coming into work with Democrats.
That's the attitude.

275
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,050
That's double down with

276
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,900
a 10.
That's it.

277
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,740
That's it.
It's a lot of things.

278
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,070
It's not just tea party.
A lot of people put a lot of pressure on

279
00:11:59,071 --> 00:11:59,904
tea party and,
and the tea party came into being on my 

280
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:06,120
watch.
So I know very well what was the,

281
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,373
the essence of that in that time.
But what people don't recognize is that 

282
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,840
movement such as it is,
that energy started way before 2009.

283
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,033
This goes back to 2004.
This goes back to 2002 big government 

284
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:23,580
republicanism.
The spending on the war,

285
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,730
the Terry Shy vo case.
Remember the Terry Shive.

286
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,830
Okay.
When the republic is called the Senate,

287
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,664
back into session two to pass a bill to 
prevent this family from the making 

288
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,880
decision about this poor woman who was 
in a coma.

289
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,733
Well again,
these are the people that want 

290
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:40,610
government.
So on the one hand you say,

291
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:43,460
you know,
government should be out of the way,

292
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,840
but then the other you're going to call 
Congress into session to pass

293
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,940
bill to tell someone what they can't do 
in this instance.

294
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,253
That's,
that's the conundrum that the parties 

295
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:53,670
put itself.

296
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,590
So who do you like out of this group?
You know,

297
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,700
I met you a couple of weeks ago that the
in the spin room at the gop debate and I

298
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,563
was able to ask Scott Walker a question 
and I asked him about campaign finance 

299
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,240
and I got to tell you sometimes you look
at someone and you go,

300
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,520
this guy is dumb.
I mean he,

301
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,000
he struck me as dumb.
He,

302
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,980
he just,
I could,

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,380
I could just see it.
You know what I mean?

304
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:14,760
Like,
I could just look at him and see,

305
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,603
this is not a bright guy now.
You don't have to comment on that 

306
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,480
specifically,
but not dumb.

307
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,520
He's won a lot of elections.
He wanted more than any of those guys.

308
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,620
But what do you think of the general,
the general crop?

309
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,310
I think the general crop overall is a 
very strong group of individuals.

310
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,470
Um,
you look at the governors,

311
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,920
the governors that are in the race,
uh,

312
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,750
or were in the race.
Uh,

313
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,510
you look at the senators.
I'm Carly Fiorina,

314
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,520
very successful businesswoman.
Carly,

315
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,440
a Ben Carson,
very successful a neurosurgeon.

316
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,270
So it's a,
it's a diverse group.

317
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,660
It is the most diverse field we put up 
ever.

318
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,230
I'm not just in terms of a woman and 
African American,

319
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,064
all that,
but just in terms of background and 

320
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,770
experience,
the depth of it.

321
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:08,420
I mean,
George Jeb Bush was a very successful,

322
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,920
did a good job as governor and in 
Florida,

323
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,773
uh,
elected strongly two times a John 

324
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,990
Casick.
Same thing in Ohio.

325
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,810
I went through hell in the first term.
Um,

326
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,250
and weather that storm.

327
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,373
What did you make a case answer to?
The to the gay marriage question in the 

328
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:25,150
first year,
that was,

329
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,260
I thought it was a beautiful thing for 
me that was an option inauthentically

330
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,910
Republican response.
That's the,

331
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,600
that and Jeb Bush,
when he talked about,

332
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,803
uh,
immigration again and authentically 

333
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:38,644
Republican response because at the end 
of the day what Jeff was saying and he 

334
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,500
used the language that people could 
understand.

335
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,660
He didn't come at it and policy and 
political ease.

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,340
He used the word love,
which to me and to a whole lot of people

337
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,174
was a recognition of people behind the 
policy that while you can sit back and 

338
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,050
talk all the smack about,
you know,

339
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:03,230
we're going to build walls and we're 
going to electrify the marina and do all

340
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:05,840
this crap.
At the end of the day,

341
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,020
there are people behind that and if you 
don't appreciate that,

342
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,840
then you don't have a good policy.
It's not,

343
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,703
it's not a smart policy.
And I think that that was something my 

344
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,213
takeaway in his discussion,
which I thought was a very humble and a 

345
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:26,090
very personal way to talk about 
immigration.

346
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,930
No one ever talked about it on either 
side in those terms and,

347
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,803
and I thought he did well by that.
So in a way you kind of want to combine 

348
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:36,404
these guys.
If you could combine a couple of the 

349
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,130
issues.
Candida.

350
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,230
Yeah,
I mean,

351
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,103
well we're doing pretty good on the 
Frankenstein part without the 

352
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,820
combination.
I think.

353
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,590
No,
I think that they're in a real sense.

354
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,424
You're right.
I mean,

355
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,650
what I'm looking for at the end of the 
day,

356
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,150
I like John Casick.
I like Jeb.

357
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,790
I mean I like a lot of these guys,
but what I'm looking for,

358
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,650
and I've said this from the very 
beginning of the cycle,

359
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,484
I'm looking for someone who's prepared 
to sacrifice their race for the 

360
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:05,360
presidency.
That's what it's going to take.

361
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,790
In other words,
and Jeb got close.

362
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,624
He used the words when he said,
I'm willing to lose the primary to win 

363
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:16,070
the general,
but really sit there and go,

364
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:17,150
you know what,
America,

365
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,720
this is it.
Let's just cut the crap.

366
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,110
You want too much and we can't deliver.

367
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,500
That's how the conversation starts 
because it gets you into spending.

368
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,940
It gets you into programs that gets you 
into the size of government,

369
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:32,774
that gets you into policy.
It gets you into everything that you 

370
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:35,914
know.
We are our own worst enemies as 

371
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,490
Americans because we.
What did we say folks?

372
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:44,491
We say cut spending last government.
Why want more in my paycheck?

373
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,353
And then in the next sentence,
why don't you put more money in that 

374
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,440
program?
Why aren't you spending more on this?

375
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,720
Why aren't you giving to this cause over
here?

376
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,673
What do you want?
So the question for me is always boiled 

377
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,450
down very simply,
and you know the model,

378
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,284
your,
you did a little economics in school 

379
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,240
right now.
Well you know,

380
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,210
you know the whole idea of guns and 
butter,

381
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,860
right?
And it was always you.

382
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,620
You can either have guns or you can have
butter.

383
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,420
Well I think there's a different model 
where you can actually have both,

384
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,080
but the only way you get to have both is
by prioritizing.

385
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,590
Because in any given moment,
at any given time,

386
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,500
something is going to be the priority.
So that's what we focus on.

387
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,334
Let's address that.
So that means we're going to spend a 

388
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:26,134
little bit less on guns today and more 
on butter because we need to put people 

389
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,394
back to work.
We need to make sure that a hospital 

390
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,750
stay open.
We may need to make sure that,

391
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,640
oh gee,
that bridge is falling down.

392
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:37,830
We need to fix it.
Right?

393
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,190
That's the priority.
So we put a little bit more into that at

394
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,050
another time.
The priorities may shift.

395
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,273
Okay?
Whether it's something that happens 

396
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:47,074
overseas,
isis gets stoop more than they already 

397
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:52,920
are,
whatever you've got to deal with that,

398
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,290
then we maybe we spend a little bit 
less.

399
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,123
We reprioritize and we don't do that.
The second thing is government gets out 

400
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,950
and says,
look,

401
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,630
we're going to impose these restrictions
were going to make you do this and we're

402
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,020
gonna give you all this stuff.
All right,

403
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,340
fine.
I'm happy with that.

404
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,030
Great.
Right?

405
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,500
People like stuff.
People like stuff.

406
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,620
Yeah,
but no one ever goes back to see or find

407
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:21,510
out how the stuff is working and whether
or not the program that you've designed,

408
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,540
no child left behind actually works for 
teachers in the classroom or whether you

409
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,700
know the,
the institution that you've created,

410
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,713
our social safety net in all of its 
various forms actually meets the needs 

411
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,170
of the people who supposed to be 
treated.

412
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,340
I thinking right now the va,
so again,

413
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,730
making government accountable for all of
that is important,

414
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,923
but also the role that we play in that 
process is equally important because 

415
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,604
what's happened now is our politicians,
you're telling them every different 

416
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,060
thing and so if you come at this way,
you come at this way,

417
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,170
you come at this way,
what happens?

418
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,870
They just stand still and they do 
nothing and then they don't.

419
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,733
They're not governed by a basic set of 
principles that you talked about 

420
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,490
earlier.
So they are going every week,

421
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,324
so they're going every which way and 
they're given everybody anything and 

422
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:10,090
they're just sitting back on what asks 
what you want and I'm done.

423
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,450
That's not what we want.
Ultimately,

424
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,390
we are actually looking for someone to 
take the risk,

425
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,253
which is the bottom line point.
Are you prepared to take the risk to do 

426
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,740
the job?
So when I was lieutenant governor,

427
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,980
my approach to being lieutenant 
governor,

428
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:25,814
it was only have four years to do this 
job because the other four aren't 

429
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,860
guaranteed and they weren't because I 
didn't win the election,

430
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,400
but I walked out having reformed a 
minority business enterprise,

431
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,310
got charter school law passed in the 
state,

432
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,393
um,
and worked on a number of initiatives 

433
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,470
including the death penalty that the 
governor asked me to work on.

434
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,430
Um,
and I felt that we had done the job that

435
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:54,840
people have sent us to do a.
Now the politics took over in that case.

436
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,640
And that's the risk,
you know,

437
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,700
the governor of Maryland,
that then my buddy Bob Ehrlich got fired

438
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:02,520
with a 62 percent job approval on 
election day.

439
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,530
Um,
but you know,

440
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:05,364
people hate it.
Republicans in 2006 because of the war 

441
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,750
and a lot of other things.
So,

442
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,320
but you do the job,
you can't think about the next election.

443
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,243
And right now our politicians are more 
concerned about being primary or losing 

444
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,280
an election and they don't do the job.
So that's really where I want to go with

445
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,114
this.
But do you want the 30 seconds to do 

446
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,730
trump or should we just tell we get to 
trump.

447
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:24,750
All right.
Thirty seconds go.

448
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,130
What do you make of this thing?
Trump is an enigma wrapped in a question

449
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:29,964
mark wrapped in.

450
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,530
I mean,
he's a lot in a wig.

451
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,581
The Wig.
Yeah,

452
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,200
he's,
he's all these things.

453
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500
He's all these things that have upset 
the status quo of American politics.

454
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,923
Everybody is.
Everybody wants to run a conventional 

455
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,344
campaign except trump.
He's running an unconventional path 

456
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,033
campaign.
Everybody else was running a 

457
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:52,654
conventional campaign in an 
unconventional time and they don't know 

458
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,304
how to do.
We'll deal with it or what to do with 

459
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,910
it.
And he is,

460
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,070
you know,
whether or not he gets the nomination.

461
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:04,960
All of that remains to be seen.
Folks.

462
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,120
We're a long way from the first vote.
Being cast

463
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,330
over a year away from the election does 
not know,

464
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,240
but we're actually only three months 
away from the first primary caucus votes

465
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,074
and that's where,
that's where the real rubber begins to 

466
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,194
meet the road.
That's what voters actually have to go 

467
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,414
into a caucus room like this or in a 
voting booth and actually think about 

468
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:27,630
who are they're going to give this next 
charge,

469
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,190
two to be the president.
Um,

470
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,183
and I think that dynamic as you get 
through this third debate on the fourth 

471
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:37,230
debate in December and then into 
January,

472
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,064
we'll begin to settle.
But trump has changed the way we do 

473
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:42,960
this.
And I think that's good.

474
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,250
I appreciate it.
You know,

475
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,890
I talked to people all across the 
country.

476
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,950
They don't like what he said about 
Mexicans.

477
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,020
They don't like the way he talks about 
women.

478
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,210
They don't like a lot about trump,
but you know,

479
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,860
every sentence that starts like that,
the next word is.

480
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:03,090
But I don't like what he said.
But yeah,

481
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,220
I don't appreciate that.
But,

482
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,460
and I keep telling folks in DC as long 
as they're saying,

483
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:12,030
but then anything can happen.
Anything can happen.

484
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,990
So is that the interesting thing about,
about both parties right now,

485
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,870
because trump and Bernie to me are 
hitting on the same thing,

486
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,180
which is that the system is broke.
I mean,

487
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:22,070
in the first debate,
trump basically said,

488
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:22,521
he said,
yeah,

489
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:23,354
I gave Hillary a lot of money and she 
showed up at my wedding because that's 

490
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:27,430
how politicians operate.
Right?

491
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,350
And Greg,
he's telling the truth on that side.

492
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,240
So you have the capitalist,
right?

493
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:35,630
The poster child for capitalism and the 
poster child for socialism.

494
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,510
And those are the two that are getting 
taken away.

495
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,580
So what?
So what do you make it?

496
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:39,710
Oh,
there's your ticket next year.

497
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:43,730
That's not set that sanders versus trump
2016.

498
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,850
I want to be at that part.
I'm going to have myself a gin and tonic

499
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,193
and popcorn.
Can you imagine that to be really like 

500
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,120
in the debate if it was the two of them?
Because.

501
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,400
Because Bernie's people you unfiltered 
trump's off his rocker.

502
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:02,151
I mean,
it will be something,

503
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:02,541
right?
No,

504
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,374
wait a minute.
So why is Bernie unfiltered and trump 

505
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,100
office rock?
Because Bernie,

506
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,000
because he is a politician.
Why?

507
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,790
Why can't Bernie,
why can't trump be unfiltered to.

508
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,271
Well,
no,

509
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:13,730
trump is unfiltered,
but there's nothing beneath the filter.

510
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,733
That's it.
The tell that to all the people are 

511
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:19,710
following them.
I've been trying to tell,

512
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,733
but they're not listening.

513
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,790
Making the more important point that 
folks keep missing.

514
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,590
It's that I'm not.

515
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,850
Bring it.
Bring that attitude.

516
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:34,680
It's that attitude

517
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,513
that's pissing everybody off.
You think you know better than the 

518
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:39,630
person who's following him

519
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,310
and that's,
that's just not,

520
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,713
that's just not right.
You've got to respect best where our 

521
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:49,100
politics has gotten to.
We've stopped respecting the fact that I

522
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:53,030
can follow you because I actually like 
what you're saying even though you think

523
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,440
he's full of shit.
Excuse me.

524
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,633
So,
um,

525
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,880
but,
but,

526
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,010
but that's.
But that's.

527
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,670
But that's,
that's the American process.

528
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,140
So to do that,
you don't get to judge it.

529
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,013
I'm waiting.
If you don't judge it out loud because 

530
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,000
then I may hit.
You should have.

531
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,340
Fair enough.
So I'm saying so I'm with you on that.

532
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,240
But to me,
trump,

533
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,530
this isn't a real candidacy that I just 
don't think.

534
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:16,520
So.
Why do you say that?

535
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,500
We'll revisit this.
No,

536
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,970
no,
no,

537
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,130
he is filed the paperwork.
He's disclosed his income.

538
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,860
He's got a campaign organization.
Trust me.

539
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:25,820
This brother's got a camp

540
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,720
paint organization in a number of states
that people don't even know.

541
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:31,900
He's got a campaign organization in.
He's doing the things.

542
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,880
Look,
you know what was a telling moment?

543
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:35,380
I don't know if.
How many of you caught it?

544
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,720
Remember when he wrote out his economic 
plan?

545
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,720
What did you notice about what he did?
Anybody trump tower.

546
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,070
It's everything's that comm tower.
He had no cards.

547
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,840
Yes.
He was not read off the top of his head.

548
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,380
He read off of prepared text.
Trump is in this thing the right way.

549
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,913
Everything he's done up to now has 
gotten your attention and now he's 

550
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,670
rolling out a little policy on this.
A little policy I'm telling you.

551
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,623
Watch it because the attitude of the 
folks in Washington about his campaign 

552
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,520
is the thing that keeps him in the 
camera.

553
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,360
Hey,
I get it.

554
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,150
I mean,
I do get.

555
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,730
I know you hate hearing that,
but it's true.

556
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,151
All right,
so.

557
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:20,984
Well I can.
I can hear something and being 

558
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,000
yesterday.
Yeah,

559
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,833
look,
Huffington Post says they're not going 

560
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,820
to write about him in the politics and,
right,

561
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:28,610
that gets,
that gets the base,

562
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,391
the base angle,
right?

563
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,240
So that was the longest 30 seconds I 
know.

564
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:31,820
Trope,
right?

565
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,653
So let's just talk about the system of 
politics because you're an insider and 

566
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:36,224
an outsider.
So when you were the chairman of the 

567
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,480
Republican Party,
how much of the job,

568
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,314
how much of your day to day was just 
about money because that's what this is 

569
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,810
really all about.
So let's be clear,

570
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,600
be clear.
Um,

571
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,720
the role of any party chairman,
Democrat,

572
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:56,530
Republican counties,
state national is two things.

573
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,990
They only have two things.
Raise money and win elections.

574
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,630
If you don't do that,
you're not doing your job.

575
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,920
So your day is made up of doing those 
two things.

576
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,800
That is 80 percent of your day.
And,

577
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,673
and,
and on a good day where you will spend 

578
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,160
anywhere from two to four hours dialing 
for dollars,

579
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,520
which they're very few of us like doing 
because it's just tough to raise.

580
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,231
I look,
I'm calling,

581
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,230
I'm asking you for $38,000.
Okay.

582
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,840
There's a lot of presumption in that 
conversation.

583
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:32,770
Right.
All right.

584
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,903
And,
and because that's the maximum you can 

585
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:35,810
give.

586
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,160
Did they give you a list?
I mean,

587
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:37,880
right when you get.
Oh,

588
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,050
we get their first day.
They're like,

589
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:40,630
here's the list you get,
get on the phone.

590
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:43,280
I got,
I was elected on a Friday and

591
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
that Monday I went up to New York and 
did a town hall on healthcare and the 

592
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:51,420
economy.
And uh,

593
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:56,421
that Tuesday I was at my desk officially
for the first time at the desk and I did

594
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,660
a three and a half hours with the calls 
for,

595
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,710
for donors.
Then what I did was,

596
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:02,544
it was the idea was I needed to 
introduce myself to these folks because 

597
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,430
I'm the new kid on the block.
And um,

598
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,220
you know,
for some of them I was a little bit more

599
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:16,221
of a shock than they anticipated and uh,
and so it was more introduction,

600
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,001
but then,
yeah,

601
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,670
you kind of roll into.
And I actually had a donut cussed me out

602
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,230
and said,
you know,

603
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,064
I'm so sick of the party.
Every time I hear from you people is 

604
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,390
when you call asking for money,
I'm not giving you another damn dime,

605
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,260
Dah,
da Da.

606
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,093
And I let him vent.
His brother went on for like 20 minutes 

607
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,360
and I let him,
I let him talk.

608
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,223
And then I said,
well actually I wasn't calling to ask 

609
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:36,894
for money.
I was just calling to introduce myself 

610
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,670
and you wouldn't have said no to the 
money.

611
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,310
He wasn't given any money.
So,

612
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,350
but,
but this was the point.

613
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:49,920
And this is another important lesson,
how I think you do this,

614
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:50,754
right?
So I listened to this man because here 

615
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,610
is a longtime donor,
uh,

616
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:56,444
an activist in the party supporter who 
is now ticked off at its leadership at 

617
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,200
the political operations and wants no 
part of it.

618
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,940
So I told him,
I said,

619
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:06,691
well look,
I'll tell you,

620
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm putting together a business plan,
which is what I did.

621
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:10,410
I put together a business.
I'm a business guy.

622
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:11,244
So I've put together a business plan for
the Party and said we've got to raise 

623
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:15,690
money and how are we going to spend it?

624
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,340
These are things that are priorities.
And I got that together,

625
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,500
uh,
over a period of time,

626
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,350
but I told him I was doing it.
I also told,

627
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:28,080
laid out to him what I wanted to do,
what my vision was,

628
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:28,620
and I told him,
look,

629
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,330
I don't want your money.
I said,

630
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,164
you wait and see if I do the job to your
satisfaction and if you feel like 

631
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,324
giving,
give us,

632
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,193
give us a check.
Two weeks later you sent the check for 

633
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,090
the maximum amount because.
Because,

634
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:44,160
and he told me in his note,
he said,

635
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,970
you listened to me,
you took the time to listen to me.

636
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,890
And so I thought about that.
And that is a big difference.

637
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:53,724
Listening to people goes so goes so far.
And so the money piece is a big part of 

638
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,360
now.
I believe money is property.

639
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,740
I just generally do.

640
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,400
That's my philosophical view.
Like any,

641
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,513
anything else I own,
I should be free to do with it as I 

642
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,450
wish.
I'm not.

643
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:12,720
Doesn't say there shouldn't be 
limitations I suited in.

644
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,040
This is great.
Now you'll love this.

645
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:19,340
So the RNC had a lawsuit and that I took
over when I became chairman to,

646
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,213
to basically peel back on mccain fine 
goal because Mccain Feingold took away 

647
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,490
from the parties the ability to raise 
the money.

648
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,633
Right.
And they created this system that we 

649
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:33,174
have.
And of course there was a companion 

650
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,550
lawsuit.
Guess what?

651
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:38,210
It was put more money in now.
No.

652
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,090
What was the companion lawsuit?
Anyone Supreme Court rejected my lawsuit

653
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,740
and picked up citizens united.
Right,

654
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,320
right,
right.

655
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,300
So,
so citizens united was the,

656
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,243
it was the case.
They decided to take over the one that 

657
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:56,731
will be given the money,
allow donors to give untold sums as they

658
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:57,574
used to to the state parties,
to the national parties and the state 

659
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:01,204
parties.

660
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,523
And they decided to go down this road 
where you could set up these five slash 

661
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,703
27,
which we're now living through is a 

662
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,830
nightmare.
So I want to get to that in just a sec.

663
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:12,250
But I think everyone wants to know how 
much does the money,

664
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,110
how much influence does it actually get 
you?

665
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:17,860
So someone writes a $38,000
check or someone writes the shrimp.

666
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,060
Yeah,
I mean really what,

667
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,670
what,
what are you running?

668
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,210
Get?
Well with the part,

669
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:24,460
again,
separating the party from the candidate.

670
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,940
When you write a check to the R and C,
we going to take care of you.

671
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,070
All right?
Because that's what we do.

672
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,660
That's what we're supposed to do.
And what does that mean?

673
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,530
When you call up and want to talk to the
chairman?

674
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,370
You get to talk to the chairman.
Um,

675
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,880
when you,
now you don't bring issues to me because

676
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,660
we're political.

677
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,970
We're not policy.
So you can.

678
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:43,804
And some do.
I mean I've got buckets of ideas that 

679
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:48,580
people say,
hey,

680
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,020
I think we should do this.
That's fine,

681
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,700
but that's a separate way to operate.
That's,

682
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,810
that's all political.
You know,

683
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:56,340
it,
it's,

684
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,490
it's what it is.
I,

685
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:58,420
you know,
we wine,

686
00:30:58,421 --> 00:30:59,254
you dine you,
we take you out and we do big 

687
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,910
fundraisers,
we do small fundraisers,

688
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:06,310
we're in your home,
all of that part of that.

689
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:09,580
And of course the access you get.
So when you have conviction,

690
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,530
guess what?
You're going to be taken care of because

691
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:13,420
you're a major donor to the party.
Yeah.

692
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,180
You're going to be invited to the suite.
You're going to get a chance to meet the

693
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:17,950
candidates fan.
Then you know the nominees,

694
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:20,650
family and all of that stuff.
That's what we do.

695
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,603
There's nothing wrong with that.
We've been doing that since the days of 

696
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,170
Jefferson and Washington and all those 
guys.

697
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,790
All right,
so that's not unusual.

698
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,373
What's changed now is this dynamic where
you have organizations that can be 

699
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:37,430
created that extensively don't talk to 
the candidate.

700
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:38,860
Right.
Which we know is complete bullshit,

701
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:39,650
right?
Of course.

702
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,930
Yeah.
You know,

703
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,300
you know everybody,
you know,

704
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,163
my,
my,

705
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,240
my former chief of staff is now the head
of my Super Pac.

706
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,290
You don't think I'm talking to this guy 
at some point.

707
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,770
All right?
So we'll,

708
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,643
we'll,
we'll go with the lie will go with the 

709
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,520
fiction that it doesn't happen.
But what,

710
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,060
what it does do is,
and I'm,

711
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,870
and I'm,
I have to be honest with everyone.

712
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:02,704
I'm still evolving in a way on this 
subject because of how I view money 

713
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,570
generally.
Um,

714
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,770
but money in politics and I see what it 
is doing is making it harder.

715
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:14,764
It,
it is becoming more of a distraction at 

716
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:20,500
the end of the day,
whether you're a Rupert Murdoch or um,

717
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,393
you know,
some other big liberal or conservative 

718
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,370
donor,
you get one vote,

719
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,610
you get one vote,
you know,

720
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,720
you don't get,
you know,

721
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,593
38,000
votes because you wrote a check for 

722
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,650
$30,000
so you get one vote,

723
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:36,484
but now you can put a lot of money to 
put a lot of ads on Fox or CNN or MSNBC 

724
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,320
that influence a lot of other people,
you know.

725
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,730
Okay.
So let's talk about that.

726
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,493
Do you,
are you really influenced by political 

727
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,470
ads anyway?
Do you,

728
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,623
if you saw an ad tearing him down,
if he was a candidate for office and 

729
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,270
saying that,
you know,

730
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,260
he hates puppies,
do you,

731
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,483
do you really,
do you really walk away from that 

732
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,950
thinking he hates puppies.
I,

733
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:06,920
I really do.
My grandmother didn't work and she goes,

734
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,450
that's my point.
I mean,

735
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,350
I'm not saying it doesn't work,
but what,

736
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,590
what I'm saying?
And,

737
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,610
and Willie Horton,
by the way,

738
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:15,620
it was originally a Democrat and their 
primary,

739
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:17,130
so we won't,
we won't have that whole,

740
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,700
that's a whole nother discussion.
I thought they'd like to put that on our

741
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:20,590
doorstep.
But let's,

742
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,790
let's go to the origins of the Willie 
Horton ad.

743
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,250
Um,
but the,

744
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,460
but you're right,
it works.

745
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,420
So what does that say about us?
What does that say about you,

746
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:33,254
the consumer?

747
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:33,910
I mean,
I,

748
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,580
I just don't.
I guess my point is this is the ying and

749
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,414
the Yang.
So the political class takes advantage 

750
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,054
of it as much as they can because they 
know a negative ad is going to work no 

751
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:47,270
matter how much you protest against it,
no matter how much you hate it,

752
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,340
you're going to sit there like this.
Wow.

753
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,960
Did you say,
did you see that?

754
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,794
And now today you're going to tweet 
about it and you're gonna you're gonna 

755
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,780
send it out.
So they know that they play to that.

756
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,460
Um,
and,

757
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:00,830
and that's part of that part of the 
problem.

758
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,723
And the money does that.
What I tried to do as chairman and we 

759
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:08,660
were moderately successful in the last 
cycle in 2012,

760
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,553
but we set it up in my term in 20 2009 
and 10 was I saw down the road that 

761
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,514
money was going to be an issue,
particularly after the Supreme Court 

762
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:20,300
rejected my case and took citizens 
united.

763
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,133
So we wanted to design a system so that 
you could actually participate without 

764
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:27,020
necessarily having to have a lot of 
money.

765
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,930
And we saw that with Newt Gingrich,
Rick Santorum,

766
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:30,764
and a number of candidates in the 2012 
cycle who didn't have Mitt Romney's 

767
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,453
bankroll.
But because of the way the system was 

768
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:37,424
designed,
they had time to get their idea out 

769
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:40,724
there and those ideas began to resonate 
and that's when the money came to them 

770
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,463
after the fact.
So there is this dynamic that that you 

771
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:51,680
can play around with right now.
And as I will argue and agree with you,

772
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,514
it's distorted and there needs to be a 
reassessment of how we use money in 

773
00:34:58,101 --> 00:34:59,080
politics.
And,

774
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:04,090
and right now I think it's,
it's used poorly because it's just way,

775
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:06,530
way too much of it.
So last question about,

776
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,393
about money.
Do you think both parties treated the 

777
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:10,070
same?

778
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,220
I think there's a sense,
and this may be just there.

779
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,420
Yeah,
that you know,

780
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,550
that the Koch brothers run the 
Republican Party.

781
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:20,870
There's more of these evil Mr Burns guys
that are running the party more than say

782
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:21,671
the Democrats.
I,

783
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:25,430
I'm a firm believer that it's equal.
How much money did Hollywood,

784
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,264
how much money did the unions,
how much money did individual wealthy 

785
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:33,020
donors give Barack Obama into Rock 
Obama?

786
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,423
Who as a US senator was up on the Senate
floor beating the hell out of 

787
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:41,880
Republicans over campaign finance 
reform,

788
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,180
talking all this smack about,
oh yeah,

789
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:47,430
you know,
take the public money until he got a big

790
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:50,280
ass check.
And then all of a sudden when it was,

791
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,300
when it came time to make that decision,
what did his campaign decided to do?

792
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,600
They didn't take public money in 2008 
like Mccain did.

793
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,370
What did they do?
The suit,

794
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:00,960
they took all the Super Pac money.

795
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,460
They,
even though they weren't super pacs,

796
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,410
they took all that money out of 
Hollywood.

797
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,390
They took all that money off of Wall 
Street.

798
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,343
So don't talk to me about money in 
republican politics and I'm not talking 

799
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:13,110
about money and the political system 
that's,

800
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,810
that's the reality,
because both sides love it.

801
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,800
Both sides suck at that teeth every 
single day,

802
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,400
politically and maybe otherwise.
And that,

803
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,530
that is,
that's the reality that we're now having

804
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:29,940
to live with.
So,

805
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,640
you know,
talk about big money.

806
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:37,641
It's just now manifesting itself in a 
different form because for 40 years with

807
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:40,830
the unions and Hollywood,
we're backing Democrats.

808
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,840
Republicans weren't,
I mean,

809
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:45,330
we didn't have,
we didn't have all these big players the

810
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:46,164
way we do now.
We didn't have the Koch brothers back 

811
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:48,371
in,
in,

812
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:49,204
in,
in Ronald Reagan's Day or in the 19 

813
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:54,630
seventies.
So the dynamic has changed a little bit.

814
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,730
Um,
was actually changed a lot.

815
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,953
But the thread,
the meme is the same and that is money 

816
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,124
still plays a role in politics.
The question that we need to ask 

817
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:05,214
ourselves again in,
in setting up our scales of priorities 

818
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,830
is how do we prioritize,
prioritize its role,

819
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,780
because if you're going to go to a 
public,

820
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,610
uh,
public financing system,

821
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,983
then you need to account for races that 
are in markets like this market here in 

822
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:21,954
la that is damned expensive versus a 
market in Utah or a market in southwest 

823
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,730
corner of South Carolina.
Is this an example of where Obama really

824
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:33,564
has dropped the ball?
Because even just yesterday he went to 

825
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,590
Oregon where the shooting was a couple 
days ago.

826
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,140
And do you guys know where he went?
Right after that?

827
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,540
He went to a fundraiser.
This is,

828
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,490
I mean,
think about that.

829
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,590
He was almost after every national 
tragedy goes to a fundraising.

830
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,453
I don't know who scheduling this guy.
This is a second term president with 

831
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:54,090
only a year left.
Who after this horrific tragedy,

832
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,983
I don't know who's raised in one,
who's raised the money for I guess for 

833
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:57,684
the party,
right?

834
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,450
Hi.
Debbie says they're broke.

835
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:01,284
So I don't know.
Isn't that the most emblematic thing of 

836
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:05,604
what's going on here?
That even a two term president on his 

837
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:10,260
way out goes to a tragedy and then at 
the end of the day,

838
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,380
his day was spent raising money and not 
even for himself.

839
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,091
Yeah,
I mean,

840
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:15,924
I think,
I think that is something that really 

841
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,780
sticks in the craw of a lot of people 
and I can tell you,

842
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,614
is as many conservatives and 
libertarians are as annoyed about that 

843
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:29,490
as are liberals and progressives.
And so it is,

844
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:30,324
it is an American phenomenon that we 
invest so much of our politics and 

845
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:38,650
having money to do politics.

846
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,833
Um,
when you look at the way politics is 

847
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:46,051
executed around the globe that come 
anywhere near what we spend,

848
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,780
uh,
to,

849
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,673
to elect someone to office.
You think about how much money a 

850
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:54,100
candidate running for.
I was with the candidate,

851
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,990
uh,
yesterday in New Hampshire.

852
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,370
I'm looking at a congressional race.
Ask them how much it's going to run,

853
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,593
how much it's gonna,
cost them in New Hampshire for 

854
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,473
$2,000,000
in New Hampshire in New Hampshire for a 

855
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,210
job that pays $170,000
a year.

856
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:11,643
When I ran for the US Senate in 2006,
my race was the most expensive race in 

857
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:19,500
the state of Maryland up to that point,
uh,

858
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,980
for the,
for federal office.

859
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,040
And I raised $10,000,000
for the US Senate races today for 2000,

860
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,920
uh,
16.

861
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,113
Uh,
that race is now about a 15 to 

862
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,540
$20,000,000
race.

863
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,120
Why?
Why?

864
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,570
And no one stops to ask the question to 
answer the question,

865
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,790
why,
why is it that expensive?

866
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,820
Doesn't it?
They're right it.

867
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,760
And they need to continue to ask it 
because you know,

868
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,410
it,
it is having a,

869
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:52,300
I think,
a very downward,

870
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,500
a depressive effect on our politics.
Um,

871
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,081
it,
it,

872
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:59,800
it,
it brings out the cynicism and all of us

873
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:00,963
because you just see a very small group 
of people who are getting to play and 

874
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,663
you're the one paying the taxes.
You're the one trying to make it from 

875
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,860
paycheck to paycheck.
You're the one who's trying to deal with

876
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:16,510
all this crap that spews out of state 
capitals and in federal government.

877
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,913
Um,
and you just feel that your access is 

878
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:20,824
somehow limited and cut off and no 
American should feel that way in my 

879
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,710
view.
All right?

880
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,790
Enough,
enough about money,

881
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,900
money.
It's important.

882
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,800
It's important,
but,

883
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,360
and we can talk about it forever.
It's important.

884
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,200
It is important,
but it's,

885
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:35,260
it's one of those things I don't you 
tell me how you get it out of the game.

886
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,420
How do you get out of the game at this 
point?

887
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:40,360
Because under the current rules,
under the current rules,

888
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:45,361
because as long as you've got to 
citizens united a out there where you,

889
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:48,010
you,
you and you can get together and decided

890
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:52,690
we were going to form a PAC and it may 
not be for candidate a or candidate b.

891
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,643
You just want to form a PAC and you just
want to play and you're going to go to 

892
00:40:56,201 --> 00:40:57,034
the rest of the university.
You can now raise untold millions of 

893
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,440
dollars and we don't need to know who 
any one of you are.

894
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,803
You can stroke a check for $10,000,000
right now and your name will never show 

895
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:13,240
up on any report in Washington.
Do we really want that system?

896
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,010
I believe very,
again,

897
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:18,490
going back to my and we can move on,
going back to my central argument,

898
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:22,060
money his property so I can do with my 
property whatever I want,

899
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:22,270
right?

900
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,580
So if I want to write your campaign,
a $10,000,000

901
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:25,450
check,
all right,

902
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,000
I should be allowed to do it.
But here's the caveat.

903
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:30,340
Here's the catch.
The day I ride it,

904
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,560
the next morning,
the next hour,

905
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:37,550
the next it is fully disclosed period.
My name,

906
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,530
what I do,
the amount,

907
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,663
the nature of my business so that 
everyone in the universe knows who's 

908
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:46,790
giving to you,
and then that puts the onus on you,

909
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,743
the politician,
because if you want to be associated 

910
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,390
with my money and all that comes with 
it,

911
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,430
guess what?
You'll take it.

912
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,110
But if you don't,
guess what you want and that will have a

913
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:00,944
chilling effect because right now,
if you don't know that I'm doing 

914
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:09,131
something that you know harms the 
environment or otherwise is a negative,

915
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,780
for example,
no one in the universe will ever know it

916
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,730
except you.
When you write the check,

917
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,440
when you get it,

918
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,273
the check,
I'm pretty sure that politicians like 

919
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:20,980
the plausible deniability,
of course they do.

920
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:21,791
So.
All right,

921
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,650
so moving away from money.
So I want to talk about foreign policy a

922
00:42:23,651 --> 00:42:26,830
little bit because to me it should be a 
republican.

923
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:30,320
This should be a goto republican issue 
and we're in a freaking mess right now.

924
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:32,770
I mean I don't,
I don't think the American public really

925
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:36,660
realizes what public initiatives that 
they're stronger,

926
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,523
you know,
the executive branch sets the foreign 

927
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:39,710
policy.
So why is this of.

928
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,593
Sure.
But the idea that Republicans are 

929
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:44,950
stronger and foreign policy and we have 
such a meltdown,

930
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:46,690
right?
And we gave that up a while ago.

931
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,273
Clearly we gave that.
We gave that position up a while ago 

932
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:53,710
when we started making some,
some,

933
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,800
some really boneheaded decisions about 
how we engage boneheaded,

934
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,940
right?
So I mean it was just,

935
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:01,320
it's just

936
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,490
bad policy.
You don't,

937
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:04,620
you don't do nation building.
No,

938
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,483
no super power.
Since time began has been successful at 

939
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:10,680
nation building.
It always,

940
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:11,514
it always collapses.
At some point it falls down around your 

941
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:14,290
feet.

942
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,900
So where do you fall down on everything 
that's going on in the Middle East?

943
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:18,220
We tried to nation build,
right?

944
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,860
We know we went to the wrong war for the
wrong reasons.

945
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,150
Is that fair to say?
But you also mentioned,

946
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,140
um,
and now because of that Iraq,

947
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:28,500
but especially Syria,
they're not functioning states in,

948
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:29,334
in any way that we define a state.
You look at it in two parts and the 

949
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:33,360
first one,

950
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,350
we all know the history,
we all know how we got here.

951
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,150
All right?
So that's,

952
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,013
that's stipulated.
We all know how we got here and I think 

953
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,344
generally everyone and including a 
candidates now running for president on 

954
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:49,670
the gop side,
some begrudgingly,

955
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:50,504
some less.
So admit that we've got here the wrong 

956
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:53,661
way.
All right?

957
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,740
So we're in a bad space for the wrong 
reasons.

958
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:03,200
Alright?
So now the tests of this time,

959
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,530
um,
is how do we go forward and how do we,

960
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:15,340
what do we learn from the mistake?
And then how do we not make it again,

961
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,263
but more importantly,
how do we position the United States 

962
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,220
visa vi,
uh,

963
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,340
are our allies like Israel and Saudi 
Arabia.

964
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,863
Uh,
who you represent a to two opposing 

965
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,460
problems for,
for the U,

966
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:36,294
s,
m,

967
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,530
a,
and our enemies like Iran,

968
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,693
um,
which I really don't want to use that 

969
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,850
term because that's a little strong,
you know,

970
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,450
that's a little strong because it's not,
I don't think it's there,

971
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,160
you know,
I don't think so

972
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,040
that kind of give them $150 million,
I don't think it's that

973
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,380
kind of relationship.
Um,

974
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,351
and,
and,

975
00:44:57,351 --> 00:44:58,184
and the strategic relationship which we 
need to have with Russia and China who 

976
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:04,410
are big players in the Middle East,
but so are the French,

977
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,590
the Brits.
So

978
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,500
where does that leave us as a,
as a nation?

979
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:12,540
Because it seems to me we go in,
we try something,

980
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:15,840
we always screw it up and now we leave 
and we see what that does.

981
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,330
I mean it's a real mess there and we 
created it.

982
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,164
So I feel like there's,
there's a guilt sort of associated with 

983
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,090
the Americans.
We feel like we have to do something and

984
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,460
yet we know,
no matter what we do,

985
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,900
we somehow make it worse.
And now Russia is jumping in and,

986
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,813
and reassess.

987
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,391
And,
and I,

988
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:30,871
you know,
I,

989
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:32,670
you know,
we can argue the point,

990
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:33,504
but I think there are enough examples of
either hesitation by this 

991
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,590
administration,
the Obama Administration,

992
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,630
a reticence,
uh,

993
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:47,631
or even just a lack of unawareness,
which they even alluded to just recently

994
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,790
about,
uh,

995
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:51,683
the maneuvers of Russia when you have 
State Department officials off the 

996
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,690
record saying,
we didn't see this coming due.

997
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,560
That's why you're there.
You're supposed to see this coming.

998
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,290
But,

999
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,200
or they call them jv called.

1000
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,430
Let me tell you what I think this goes 
back to.

1001
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:12,431
This goes back to a,
believe it or not to the 19 seventies in

1002
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:14,220
my view,
um,

1003
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,240
when the church committee,
uh,

1004
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,570
and the Carter administration sort of 
came to this community,

1005
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,600
a conclusion that our intelligence 
organizations were somehow bad.

1006
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:26,780
Now they,
you know,

1007
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,430
CIA and all those guys.
Yeah,

1008
00:46:28,431 --> 00:46:31,550
they had their fingers in some crazy 
pots and doing some crazy things.

1009
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,400
We got that.
But I think what we,

1010
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:37,130
what we are,
what we have seen over time,

1011
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:39,620
whether it's Iran Contra,
whether it is a,

1012
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,720
what we're seeing right now,
uh,

1013
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,750
in,
uh,

1014
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,740
in the Middle East,
um,

1015
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:45,823
is a lack of intelligence on the ground,
a lack of ability to actually know what 

1016
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:51,704
the hell is going on.
And I don't just mean know who the bad 

1017
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:57,950
players are,
but know what,

1018
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,330
nook and cranny they're in.

1019
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:04,460
No know what their favorite cafe is,
know what their favorite coffee or Latte

1020
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:05,294
is.
No,

1021
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,153
know who their kids.
I mean just that level of detail that 

1022
00:47:09,051 --> 00:47:09,884
was so much a part of the Cold War in 
terms of how the US and Russia sort of 

1023
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,103
worked off of each other and knew what 
was going on and they were so effective 

1024
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:21,650
at it that they created a effectively a 
stalemate.

1025
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,250
Yeah.
So who's fault is that?

1026
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,260
That we don't have that?
Oh,

1027
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,190
I think it's.
I think it's,

1028
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:26,024
I think it's a combination of,
of political leadership that sort of 

1029
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:32,560
overreacted to bad things that,
that,

1030
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,810
you know,
some of these institutions get into.

1031
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:35,644
And,
and,

1032
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,390
and do,
you know,

1033
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:40,450
government is about overreaction.
It's about reaction.

1034
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,130
It's not,
it's not a proactive entity,

1035
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,380
they just don't,
you think they sit around and say,

1036
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,303
so listen,
how do we actually solve a problem 

1037
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:47,500
before it starts?

1038
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,320
That's just not,
that's not what they do.

1039
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,180
So,
you know,

1040
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,770
a new town happens,
a columbine happens,

1041
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,420
um,
you know,

1042
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,333
a,
a,

1043
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,980
a Freddie gray happens.
These things happen.

1044
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:03,814
And then the government wants to come.
We're now we're going to come here and 

1045
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,230
we're going to fix this for you.
Don't worry,

1046
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:09,064
we got this now actually now just step 
out and I'll just let the people on the 

1047
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:14,330
ground deal with it.
So there's,

1048
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,250
there's a little bit of that where they 
overreact and they overreact in a way in

1049
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:20,260
which they actually wind up making it 
worse.

1050
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,573
And in the process of overreacting,
they begin to penalize the players in a 

1051
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:29,140
way that prevents them from doing 
anything constructive later on.

1052
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,270
Because now we're going to cut your 
funding for this.

1053
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,830
We're going to bring you in for all 
these here.

1054
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,590
If they just did day to day,
week to week,

1055
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:40,240
month to month oversight,
they have committees called oversight.

1056
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:43,720
Do they meet?
Do they actually do oversight?

1057
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:48,190
Whose oversight?
If you're doing this on an ongoing basis

1058
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,720
and you're sort of,
you're supporting and guiding those,

1059
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,583
those intelligence organizations.
A lot of the stuff that we've gotten 

1060
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:59,080
ourselves into over the last 15,
20 years,

1061
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,973
some of that could have been avoided 
because we would have had the 

1062
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:04,300
intelligence to know.
I mean,

1063
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,680
look at,
look at it this way.

1064
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:06,963
You know,
how many times have we seen in the 

1065
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:12,610
political process when you don't have to
count right on something or you,

1066
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,970
you've misidentified something or you 
missed brand,

1067
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,580
that's okay.
There are no consequences from that.

1068
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,593
Alright,
so the speaker didn't get that vote 

1069
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,590
because the whip didn't count it.
Right,

1070
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:24,610
okay,
we got that.

1071
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,310
But when you're out in the field,
when you're,

1072
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,340
when you're in a situation like Bengazi 
for example,

1073
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,940
where you have cables from,
from the people in the field saying,

1074
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:34,774
we need the support and the folks in 
Washington want to have a meeting about 

1075
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,090
it.

1076
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,220
That's where the things began to break 
down,

1077
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,610
and so there's this idea of having an 
ongoing,

1078
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,533
uh,
accountable oversight process in which 

1079
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:51,490
you are,
you are in the moment,

1080
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:56,290
real time with what's going on,
I think begins to alleviate the pressure

1081
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,930
on the executive branch and even the 
Congress,

1082
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,660
uh,
to put itself in a position where,

1083
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,673
you know,
we're talking about sending in troops 

1084
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:04,960
and,
you know,

1085
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,270
ratcheting up all this spending on,
on,

1086
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,123
you know,
in reaction to something that someone 

1087
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:11,310
else has done.
Um,

1088
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,380
I think that's a step.
Not always playing catch up.

1089
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,810
I think we're playing catch up and it's 
more complicated.

1090
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:19,120
I know and there's a lot more to it,
but it's,

1091
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,020
you know,
I tell you,

1092
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:20,854
I've,
I've learned over the years in 

1093
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,890
Washington and certain watching some of 
these guys,

1094
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,500
it's always the simple stuff.
You know,

1095
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,334
it,
it's this,

1096
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,183
the things that you don't think are 
important or the things that you just 

1097
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:31,730
kind of got,
well,

1098
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,350
why are we,
why would we do that?

1099
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,400
That's the thing you should do to avoid 
a bigger problem later on.

1100
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,740
One thing that's become like my main 
thing,

1101
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,583
you,
you were sitting on the panel on real 

1102
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:48,671
time with Bill Maher when Sam Harris who
was on with Ben Affleck,

1103
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,640
I'm assuming most of you guys are 
probably familiar with what happened,

1104
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:53,474
but basically that was so much fun.
I mean you saw to me what became a 

1105
00:50:57,381 --> 00:51:01,730
seminal moment and a split in the,
in the liberals between the progressives

1106
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,640
and what I consider the true liberals,
which is where I fall,

1107
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,713
but basically,
but basically a Sam Harris said a few 

1108
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:11,510
things about the difference between 
Islam.

1109
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,133
Harris was making a,
an intellectual argument based in 

1110
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,833
research based deal poles.
He was quoting tools and things like 

1111
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:22,550
that.
So that,

1112
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,360
that's.
So that's the jump off point.

1113
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,450
Um,
ben was making,

1114
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,010
um,
a,

1115
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,620
a progressive argument,
uh,

1116
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:32,483
that again,
going back to the point I was making 

1117
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:35,514
before about people and how those pupils
and all those numbers actually 

1118
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:45,660
translated into people.
So when you start talking about people,

1119
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:49,260
then you're talking about attitudes and 
perceptions and all of that.

1120
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,990
And it was a very interesting dynamic.
I thought.

1121
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:54,843
So for the people that didn't see it,
basically Sam quoted a couple poles and 

1122
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,560
then immediately been athletic.
He screamed,

1123
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:00,790
that's gross,
that's racist,

1124
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:01,624
that's racist.
And then that changes the dynamic the 

1125
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,490
next day.
Every media outlet in the question was,

1126
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,613
you know,
Ben Affleck Calls Bill Maher and Sam 

1127
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:10,783
Harris Racist.
Suddenly the onus was on them to prove 

1128
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,200
that they weren't racist.
So for you,

1129
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,930
I assume when someone throws around,
you know,

1130
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,530
racist,
you're a bigot,

1131
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,240
I assume you don't take those things 
lightly.

1132
00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:21,220
What was it like to be sitting there in 
the midst of that?

1133
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,290
Especially because.
Because you weren't even.

1134
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,360
You guys weren't even supposed to be 
involved in the conversation,

1135
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:26,100
right?

1136
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,933
That was,
that was,

1137
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,070
that was the bill and Sam moment.
Yeah.

1138
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,310
And I saw Ben Lean in and I went,
all hell,

1139
00:52:33,311 --> 00:52:34,144
here we go.
And then he started and I've learned 

1140
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:41,860
over these years that when two liberals 
are going at it,

1141
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:46,861
there's no need for the conservative to 
opine or contribute in any way.

1142
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,020
And just like,
Yo,

1143
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,730
you guys work that out,
let me know.

1144
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:59,560
But what is your takeaway from my 
takeaway from it was,

1145
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,690
I understand what I,
when I did speak,

1146
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:02,524
what I was trying when I try to get on 
the table was you're both right and 

1147
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:07,384
you're both reflecting exactly what's 
going on in the broader population that 

1148
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,020
we,
we see these,

1149
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,820
these numbers that reflect some,
some events or what's going on.

1150
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:24,110
Um,
we look at extreme actions by an extreme

1151
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:25,384
group of and we pejoratively projected 
over everybody in that particular class 

1152
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:31,920
of people.

1153
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,753
So you had this dynamic even though you 
asked that Sam wasn't really doing the 

1154
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:37,880
right,
right,

1155
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,280
that the know and Sam was not doing that
and that sandwiches,

1156
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,800
you know,
just looking at these are the numbers,

1157
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:46,410
this is what this is reflecting,
this is what people are saying,

1158
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:47,910
these are,
this is what the poll says.

1159
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,890
Um,
but this is again,

1160
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:54,390
a speaks to the dynamic of our politics.
Have we immediately go to the personal.

1161
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:57,030
It became,
it became intensely personal.

1162
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,820
When you label the charge and you throw 
out the charge,

1163
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:02,460
you're racist,
or you even infer that,

1164
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,310
that that's an intensely personal 
moment.

1165
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,680
I'm in that conversation in which,
when it comes my way,

1166
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,030
all bets are off because it's,
you're asking me now,

1167
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,650
this is one on one a look.
I've been called an uncle Tom.

1168
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:18,570
I've had oreo cookies thrown at me.
I've,

1169
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,710
I've gone through this.

1170
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:24,710
I know what this,
this ugliness in politics is about,

1171
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,880
and even more broadly,
um,

1172
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,860
and so I thought Sam did,
did very well,

1173
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,880
uh,
to hold a,

1174
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,500
to hold it and keep it from moving into 
the intensely personal.

1175
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:42,501
But Ben was intensely personal and 
that's because he cared passionately.

1176
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:46,230
And I think it's speaks to you can have 
that passion,

1177
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,640
but you need to know where the limits 
are.

1178
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:48,923
You need to know where the limits are in
the conversation and you need to know 

1179
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:55,640
how to conduct that passion in a way 
that your point is,

1180
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,460
it's not lost because it is still an I 
thought he made a valid point.

1181
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:00,294
And we're so because we don't want to 
project this pejorative view about a 

1182
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:06,060
race of people,
about a class of people,

1183
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:07,800
about any individual,
uh,

1184
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:08,634
in a way.
And you certainly don't want to use the 

1185
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:11,454
test sticks.

1186
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,513
And numbers to do that,
I take great exception to the fact that 

1187
00:55:15,601 --> 00:55:17,820
whenever anyone starts talking about 
poverty,

1188
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:18,654
why do you immediately jumped to black?
Why is the image that pops in your head 

1189
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:23,304
when someone mentions poverty in this 
country is the image of a black person 

1190
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,150
when there's.
When you,

1191
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,040
when you talk about crime in this 
country,

1192
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,960
the criminal element,
you know,

1193
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,300
crime is,
why do you jump to my community?

1194
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,030
Yeah.
We saw recently a,

1195
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,310
even on the welfare question,
um,

1196
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,770
some members of Congress get into 
trouble because they were inferring that

1197
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,730
the folk,
you know,

1198
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,550
you know,
we're gonna solve welfare by,

1199
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:49,110
you know,
working in the black.

1200
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,260
Do you know the majority of people in 
welfare in this country are white?

1201
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,940
Have you been to Appalachia?
Seriously,

1202
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,040
because that,
those people are hurting

1203
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,023
[inaudible].

1204
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,610
They don't live in an urban inner city.

1205
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,170
Why?
Why?

1206
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,033
Why is their pain and their suffering 
and their poverty less important for 

1207
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:10,954
focus and emphasis,
particularly when they're part of the 

1208
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:15,760
majority.
So that's sort of the danger.

1209
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:16,594
That's the danger.
That's the danger when you start 

1210
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,383
pejorative sizing and start speaking 
about a group of people in a in which 

1211
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,963
you clearly don't know what you're 
talking about because you're not 

1212
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:27,994
reflecting what's really going on.
I live in one of the wealthiest black 

1213
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:32,044
county,
the wealthiest black county in the 

1214
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:35,110
country,
period.

1215
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,213
So when you start talking about poverty,
that's a whole different conversation 

1216
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,340
when you come to where I live.
So you can't paint that.

1217
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:46,870
You can't use that brush the same way 
you use it when you're talking about the

1218
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:47,704
folks somewhere.
So that's the problem people get into 

1219
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:52,860
when they start doing,
doing that,

1220
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:54,370
that sort of,
you know,

1221
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:58,000
stereotype conversation about white 
folks,

1222
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,350
black folks,
poor folks,

1223
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,120
rich folks.

1224
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,840
All right,
well they,

1225
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,673
they gave me the rafting here.
So last thing I'm putting you on the 

1226
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:03,424
spot.
Why don't you jump back into politics 

1227
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:05,943
because I've sat here with you and 
exactly the reverse of what I saw with 

1228
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,060
Scott Walker.
Really,

1229
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:10,894
I mean,
I know you believe in what you're 

1230
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,300
saying.
I may not agree with you on everything,

1231
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,840
but you get the system and I'll get back
in.

1232
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,550
I,
you know,

1233
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,383
I,
I like where I am right now because I 

1234
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,394
get to get up every day and have a nice 
cup of coffee and asked myself who 

1235
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:32,281
should I piss off today and I don't have
to have a meeting after I knew that.

1236
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,120
So I,
you know,

1237
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,180
I kinda liked the space.
I love the national dialogue.

1238
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:43,050
I want to be a part of the national 
dialogue as you are a.

1239
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,780
and I think that that's,
that's a good space right now is as long

1240
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:49,150
as I'm able to do it,
I appreciate MSNBC,

1241
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:53,460
forgiving this conservative voice and 
opportunity to kind of come out and say,

1242
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:54,910
you know,
with my buddy Chris Matthews.

1243
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:55,421
Okay,
Chris,

1244
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:56,510
hold on just a second.
Can I,

1245
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,830
can I talk now?
Can I get it?

1246
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,553
So,
but I'm speeding as much as it appears 

1247
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:05,800
when he's yelling that I love hardball.
It's a great show.

1248
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:06,634
It's a great political discussion and 
that is a very smart guy and is very 

1249
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:10,294
smart,
intelligent conversation and we need a 

1250
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:13,510
lot more of that in our politics.
Well,

1251
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:15,620
I hope you guys appreciate what I think 
is.

1252
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,613
Thank you.
