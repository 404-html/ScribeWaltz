1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,940
Joining me today is a New Zealand born 
author,

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:11,960
speaker and founder and head mistress of
Mckayla community school,

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,100
a free school established in London all 
the way back in 2014.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,740
Catherine verbal saying welcome to the 
Rubin report.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,770
Hi.
Hi.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,450
I'm very happy to have you here.
Thank you for having me.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,630
I've heard a rumor that you sometimes 
play my videos in your classrooms.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,610
Well,
I don't know about the classrooms,

9
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:34,430
but among staff,
among staff in the school,

10
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,160
somewhere in this school,
in this school definitely,

11
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,680
um,
were already fans.

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,530
Thank you.
Thank you.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,370
Far too controversial to play in the 
classroom.

14
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,230
Yeah,
I think so.

15
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,064
I think so.
There's so much I want to talk to you 

16
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:45,950
about,
about education,

17
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:47,300
your,
your personal,

18
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,540
sort of political evolution,
all the things that you've been through.

19
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,374
So I always like finding out a little 
bit about somebody's history at the top 

20
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:59,030
and you come from a long line of 
teachers and some interesting background

21
00:00:59,031 --> 00:00:59,330
stuff.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,290
So tell me a little bit about Catherine.
Well,

23
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,930
I'm coming and my parents.
My father is Indian guy.

24
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:08,270
Nice.
Nine mom is and Black Jamaican.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,090
I say that because the whole race thing 
is important,

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,850
you know,
a bizarrely because these days,

27
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,684
you know,
people are so much more interested in 

28
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:19,510
who said it as opposed to what is being 
said and uh,

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,353
you know,
somewhat some random person set up a 

30
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:22,484
wikipedia page for me and there was this
kind of major argument going on between 

31
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,610
my detractors and,
and the people who support me.

32
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,590
People that support me wanted the truth 
to be there.

33
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,040
The people who didn't like me wanted it 
to,

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,273
wanted me to be Indian rather than black
because black was kind of a bigger 

35
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:39,680
victim.
And to discredit me,

36
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:42,020
they needed me to push me up the victim 
pole,

37
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,854
you know.
So my head hard following the 

38
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:45,464
oppression,
Olympics,

39
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,120
the whole operation of it.

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,750
Yeah.
No,

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,250
exactly.
And so,

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,360
uh,
you know,

43
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,950
my,
my mother was a nurse,

44
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:56,150
my father taught at university and,
and came from,

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,890
you know,
dirt poverty in Ghana,

46
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:58,724
but is one of those extraordinary people
who made something of himself through 

47
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,020
hard work.
And um,

48
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,020
I was born in New Zealand and then I 
grew up in Canada and then I've now been

49
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:06,854
in London for nearly 30 years and uh,
I went to Oxford University and I've 

50
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,350
been a teacher ever since and I was a 
very left wing teacher,

51
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,543
a very typical teacher in that way.
And I used to write a blog which was 

52
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,214
called to ms dot would love based on the
book and films to Sir with Love Sidney 

53
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,100
Poitier was in the film.
And um,

54
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,203
I wrote this blog a few times a week.
I'd go home and write about how little 

55
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,580
johnny had his money stolen and that 
kind of thing.

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,130
Things that made me really upset about 
the education system.

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,323
And let's pause for a second before you 
get to get to the point where you sort 

58
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,104
of woke up and got in trouble and they 
don't have people fighting on your 

59
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,530
wikipedia page.
So what,

60
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,364
what sort of education did you have that
pushed you towards leftism or was it 

61
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:51,014
just,
just how it was Kinda like where did 

62
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,760
those ideas come from?
Did that,

63
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:58,490
did that come from?
Did that come from family?

64
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,240
Was it meeting my family?
You know?

65
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,040
Um,
it's really interesting because I think,

66
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,874
um,
ethnic minorities really are small c 

67
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,070
conservative naturally,
but because,

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,013
uh,
the black vote normally goes to the 

69
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:12,160
left,
uh,

70
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,160
my family was no different from a 
typical fam,

71
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,020
you know,
ethnic family in that sense.

72
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,850
And so I was brought up in a,
in a,

73
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:19,960
in a left wing household.

74
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,063
Why do you think they generally vote 
small c conservative or why do they 

75
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,770
internally either think it or have been 
taught to think?

76
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,040
I think they come from small c 
conservative.

77
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,730
I'm a background.
So when I say that,

78
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,550
just the belief in and pulling yourself 
up from your own booze,

79
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,150
but your own bootstraps,
um,

80
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,243
hard work will get you somewhere.
A personal responsibility being stoical 

81
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:44,554
when things are difficult,
but the kind of thing that makes people 

82
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,430
successful.
Yeah,

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,490
exactly.
And I think minorities,

84
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,990
especially the ones who've been 
immigrants,

85
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:53,824
moved somewhere new.
They believe in giving their children a 

86
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:58,120
better life and in working hard in order
to be able to do so.

87
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,103
So it fits with them now.
So you come from a small seed 

88
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,710
conservative family,
but kind of voting left.

89
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,060
Yes.
And then that's right.

90
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,263
I'm a teacher so everyone I know is on 
the left and I don't speak to any 

91
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,980
conservative people because that's how 
it is.

92
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,960
There's this big divide and nobody ever 
speaks to each other.

93
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,990
I didn't know any conservative people or
the way conservative people thought.

94
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,213
And then I was writing this blog and 
that's where I started meeting 

95
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:27,190
conservative people and I say,
meet on my blog.

96
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,024
So twitter didn't exist in those days.
People would have discussions on the 

97
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:35,371
blog comment section and uh,
all these left wingers would come on and

98
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,874
um,
start attacking me and telling me how 

99
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:38,764
awful I was with the stories that I was 
writing and how can I judge the 

100
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,240
education system as I was judging it.
And uh,

101
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,530
all these conservatives would come on 
and defend me and I'd be saying,

102
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,311
the left wingers,
no,

103
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:47,560
no,
no.

104
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,393
I want to.
Well,

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
you know,
I'm with you.

106
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,490
I'm a good person.
And they'd say,

107
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,020
no,
you're a right winger.

108
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,591
And I'd say,
well,

109
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,080
of course I'm not on the right,
of course I'm not conservative,

110
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,250
I'm a good person.

111
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,463
So how could I possibly be conservative?
And the Conservatives would come on and 

112
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,970
say,
I think you'll find that you are.

113
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,360
And over years of me writing and me 
insisting that I was on the left,

114
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,770
I came to realize that I wasn't,
that my instincts,

115
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,020
the things that I valued,
the values,

116
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,030
it was the,
it,

117
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,160
those basic values of personal 
responsibility and,

118
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:21,561
and,
and,

119
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,370
and,
and perseverance and,

120
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,380
and,
and being happy with competition and all

121
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,240
that kind of stuff.
Um,

122
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,640
I,
I liked and then I realized like,

123
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,570
I came to realize slowly and,
and then I met a few people.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,433
So like I met you would be interested 
because you're always interested in 

125
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:40,120
meeting people who don't think like you.
I met this guy.

126
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:40,954
So there was this guy used to come onto 
my blog called a British national party 

127
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:46,810
member.
So he was,

128
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,003
he was,
this is,

129
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,930
I mean,
people call it the fascist party,

130
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:53,260
you know,
and in the day they had a lot more power

131
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,250
than they do nowadays.

132
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,473
And um,
so he was part of the BNP and I would 

133
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,454
let him come on my blog,
so all of these kinds of lefties were 

134
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,300
outraged.
How can you let them come on your blog?

135
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:06,070
You need to ban him.
But I always thought just commenting,

136
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,053
commenting,
he would comment and get into 

137
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:08,684
discussions sometimes in the and 
sometimes with other people and some of 

138
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,790
the left wingers would refuse to talk to
him at all,

139
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,970
you know,
and they get really angry with me that I

140
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,770
should just say you're not allowed to be
on here.

141
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,190
And you know,
he was on there for ages,

142
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:23,750
this is over years.
And then,

143
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,620
um,
and then I said,

144
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,454
you know,
it'd be really interesting to meet you 

145
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,390
because you're very different from 
anybody I know.

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,110
And so I met this guy and you know,
I mean,

147
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:34,820
he was a racist,
you know,

148
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,541
I mean,
he was,

149
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,100
you know,
the things that he believed about,

150
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,020
black people and so on.

151
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,400
He was a racist.
But you know,

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,030
what I always say is some of my best 
friends are racist,

153
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,440
you know,
avenueq ,

154
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,391
you know,
the,

155
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:47,510
the musical with,
you know,

156
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:50,930
everyone's a little bit racist and 
people are racist on different levels.

157
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:52,490
You know,
sometimes you're really racist,

158
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,470
sometimes you just a little bit racist.
Anyway,

159
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,810
I met with him,
he was wearing a suit.

160
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,530
Is Young white guy wearing a suit and 
nice shoes.

161
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,240
And,
and he went and he took me for lunch.

162
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:05,060
He paid for lunch.
So the racist took you for lunch.

163
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,500
That's right.
That's right.

164
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,420
That's what so interesting about life.
Right.

165
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,810
And um,
so we went for lunch and he was hobbling

166
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,150
along and I said,
you know,

167
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,480
you were right.
And he said,

168
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,314
ah,
you know,

169
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,453
the thing is I bought this suit and,
and these shoes because I was meeting 

170
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,054
with you and you know,
you went to Oxford University and I 

171
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,360
figured I've got to get dressed up,
you know,

172
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,503
but the,
the shoes are new and they're really 

173
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,400
hurting my feet.

174
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,410
And I thought,
isn't that interesting?

175
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:33,380
Here's this racist who was taking me for
lunch,

176
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,070
who's wearing new shoes that he's bought
because I've been to Oxford,

177
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:37,904
you know,
and that's what's so interesting about 

178
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:43,280
life is that it's not as easy as some of
the left put people,

179
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,061
you know,
you're a racist,

180
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,410
you're not a racist,
you're a good person,

181
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,430
you're a bad person,
you're this,

182
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,503
it's not like that.
There's a whole variety of different 

183
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,130
ways of seeing people and learning from 
people.

184
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,293
And um,
was he able to learn from you after 

185
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,330
that?
Well,

186
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,400
we met a second time and you know,
I mean,

187
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,370
when I say he was,
I mean,

188
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,213
like he was telling me about how that 
morning he'd been to see his girlfriend 

189
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:09,270
and they have a toddler and he'd gone to
see her and see the,

190
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,550
the,
the baby.

191
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,503
She wouldn't let him hold the baby 
because she knew that he was coming to 

192
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:14,714
see me and she said,
you're going to contaminate him because 

193
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,173
you're going to.

194
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,110
Exactly.
Exactly.

195
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,900
Exactly.
Um,

196
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,553
but,
you know,

197
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,590
he was a good guy in so many other ways.
And that's what,

198
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,950
that's what's interesting about life is 
what I'd say.

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,470
Um,
is that uh,

200
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,000
nobody's perfect and people change their
mind,

201
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,834
you know,
I think about my parents who lived in 

202
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,620
the same house for 46 years in Toronto 
and um,

203
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,740
there was a man called Mr.
Snow who lived opposite them and when he

204
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,090
moved,
when they moved into the area,

205
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,990
it was all white and he was outraged 
because he was a racist and he thought,

206
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,700
no way,
I don't want these people living there.

207
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,373
And over the years,
over the 46 years they got to know each 

208
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,720
other and they became friends.
And in the end Mr Snow's wife,

209
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,531
you know,
she,

210
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:05,250
she got cancer and she died and Mr Snow,
uh,

211
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,760
I had to depend on my parents for a 
whole lot of help and,

212
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,100
and my parents loved Mr.
Snow and Mr Snell loved them.

213
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,690
Um,
you know,

214
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,730
things can change,
people can change.

215
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,370
And when Mr Snow died,
my parents moved house because the,

216
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,770
the,
the community they lived in had had died

217
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,000
with Mr.
Snow.

218
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,210
And this was a man who was so racist.
He didn't want them to live there.

219
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,770
You know,

220
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,110
isn't it personally powerful too?
I mean,

221
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,944
I can feel it when you're saying that 
when you can accept some people for all 

222
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,174
their flaws,
that it actually allows you to figure 

223
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,910
out how to grow instead of just othering
them forever.

224
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:41,744
Even,
even if they might do that to a whole 

225
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,360
set of people for awful reasons.

226
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,471
Yeah.
Well,

227
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,620
and they can change people change their 
minds.

228
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,454
You know,
I have this quote in my office from 

229
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,440
Muhammad Ali that says,
um,

230
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,740
you know,
if a man at 40 still thinks the same way

231
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,110
as when he was 20,
then he's lost 20 years of his life,

232
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,730
you know.
Um,

233
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,530
and,
and thank God we can change.

234
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,300
I mean,
when I think about how I used to think,

235
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,740
you know,
and how I think now,

236
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,830
um,
well that's what life's all about.

237
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,351
Right?
So,

238
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:08,184
okay.
So let's back up to some of those ideas 

239
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,130
because.
So you were,

240
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,260
you were a lefty and then you started 
teaching in inner city schools.

241
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,443
That's when you started waking up and 
that's what sort of forced you to force 

242
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,683
you or led you to write the blog.
What were some of the ideas that you 

243
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,270
were seeing specifically that you 
realize,

244
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:26,190
wow,
this is not working in these schools?

245
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:26,811
Yeah.
Yeah.

246
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:27,644
So,
so one of the big things that I used to 

247
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:30,794
think before going into teaching and 
everyone used to just accept was that a 

248
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,370
black kids failed at school because 
white teachers are racist.

249
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,340
The system is racist,
the white teachers are racist.

250
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,630
And that's why black kids are failing.

251
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,203
Well,
teachers go into teaching for racist 

252
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,440
purposes than anything.

253
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,140
Well,
this is what's so crazy.

254
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,660
I was thinking,
but I've met hundreds,

255
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,673
thousands of teachers,
not one of them has ever said to me I'm 

256
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,410
a racist and I want to stop black kids 
from,

257
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,620
from succeeding.
In fact,

258
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,570
they are killing themselves,
you know,

259
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,543
working all hours,
giving everything that they can to the 

260
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:02,930
job.
Um,

261
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,460
and I started to question the kinds of 
things that the,

262
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,040
the normal,
the normal way of seeing things was a w,

263
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,120
what I was being told.
And it wasn't just that,

264
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:13,954
you know,
in which we might get into later about 

265
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,850
teaching methods and about,
um,

266
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,550
a discipline.
And so on the consent,

267
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,403
we're going to send the whole second 
half is going to be on your solution 

268
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,140
right now.
We're just with the restroom,

269
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,380
right,

270
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,230
right.
Okay.

271
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,110
So yeah,
I started to question all of that.

272
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,033
And um,
I went there was this a black 

273
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,770
achievement,
a kind of conference that used to happen

274
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:35,604
once a year,
which was about improving black 

275
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,720
achievement and how,
what do we do raising black achievement.

276
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,240
And uh,
there was uh,

277
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,330
uh,
labor,

278
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,120
uh,
so that's our left a political policy,

279
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,570
black,
a woman MP.

280
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,523
So one of our politicians who used to 
run this thing and I went along and I 

281
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,320
took one of the white teachers who I 
worked with and he was older than me.

282
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,154
He's retired now and he'd been doing 
this for 25 years and I've given 

283
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,024
everything to the job.
And I took him along and these people 

284
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:07,570
were standing up on stage essentially 
saying that white teachers were racist.

285
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,823
And I was so embarrassed.
I was so humiliated that I had taken 

286
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:13,924
this man giving up his Saturday to go 
and sit and be told that he's a racist 

287
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,920
when he had given everything to these 
black boys.

288
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,570
So we worked in this boy's school and it
was mainly black boys in this school and

289
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,880
um,
and I,

290
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,300
I was just,
I was mortified.

291
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm so gradually I started change my 
mind on these sorts of things and then I

292
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:37,450
started to see that it has to do with 
our expectations of kids.

293
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,600
It had to do with our,
um,

294
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,703
our expectations of parents.
It had to do with the kinds of values 

295
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,390
that we were giving them.
So if we were saying to them,

296
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,800
poor you,
you're a victim,

297
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,180
life is so difficult.
You're black,

298
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:52,680
you'll never be able to get anywhere.
Then it's quite hard for the black inner

299
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:54,040
city boy to go,
oh,

300
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,700
well,
you know,

301
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,590
actually it's about working hard.
It's about,

302
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,080
we always say at school,
even when it's difficult,

303
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,720
especially when it's difficult,
you do what's right,

304
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,570
right.
And as opposed to saying it's difficult,

305
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:08,200
I can't do it right.
Except before Mckayla,

306
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,213
that,
that business of even when it's 

307
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,590
difficult,
especially when it's difficult,

308
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,030
that,
that value,

309
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,571
that,
that,

310
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,760
that,
that business of believing in hard work,

311
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,860
I didn't see it so much.
Um,

312
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,320
and,
and we would give kids excuses.

313
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,410
We give kids excuses to fail and um,
I wouldn't do it in my classroom and uh,

314
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,323
the kids behave for me and the kids 
learned with me and of course I'm not 

315
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,800
the only teacher was doing that.
There are teachers all over the place in

316
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,450
their own classrooms.
We're doing that.

317
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,640
Uh,
what I,

318
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,873
what I wanted.
What did the administration think of 

319
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,640
you?
Because it sounds like,

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,511
you know,
Oh,

321
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,400
we've got you.
And obviously as you said,

322
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:45,710
you weren't the only one,
but we've got people pushing against the

323
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:46,544
very.
Because that's the fabric of what these 

324
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,600
schools eventually become,
that it's not,

325
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,613
it's not on them,
it's on the system that is ruined these 

326
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,060
people before they've even begun.
Yeah,

327
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,120
yeah.
They're poor.

328
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,253
I mean,
I don't suppose people realize what I 

329
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,050
was saying.
You know,

330
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean,
you're talking to kids privately,

331
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:05,580
you do your own thing and if kids are 
behaving for you and you're getting good

332
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:08,310
results and then the principal loves 
you,

333
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:09,600
you know,
uh,

334
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,160
it just works and people don't know why 
I'm,

335
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,350
and I'm not even sure I realized why,
you know,

336
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,000
you just,
you,

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,790
you build up an experience over years 
and you know,

338
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,670
what works with the kids and how you get
them on board and how you show them that

339
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,504
you're in charge and,
and then you teach them properly and 

340
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:24,300
they love you for it

341
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,343
and realize that your political 
evolution was happening at the exact 

342
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:31,480
same time because it was sort of very 
personal in the classroom.

343
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:35,290
But then that you were evolving would 
have been in another sense.

344
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,963
Uh,

345
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,850
because I think that's how it is for a 
lot of people.

346
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,020
When people come up to me on the street 
or email me,

347
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:41,561
they're saying,
you know,

348
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:42,394
something's happening at work.
I'm dealing with this and now it's 

349
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:47,380
starting to make me think differently 
about politics.

350
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:50,050
Or I used to always vote Democrat,
but you know,

351
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,800
something happened.
And my family,

352
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:52,040
we got

353
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,873
into conversation and now I'm starting 
to think something else is a little bit 

354
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:56,270
different.
Well that was the blog.

355
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,253
So it was the conservatives on my blog 
that I was realizing I'm agreeing with 

356
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,170
you and I'm not agreeing with the left 
wingers on the blog.

357
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,190
And it was then that I just thought,
well,

358
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:12,191
maybe I am just a conservative.
So I accepted it and then,

359
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,610
you know,
accepted the idea of being conservative.

360
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,750
And then in 2010 I voted conservative,
which was a major deal for me.

361
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,810
Um,
and it was funny because,

362
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,930
you know,
after I did that,

363
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:27,650
I remember this is after I ended up in 
the press and so on,

364
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:30,920
I was speaking to a friend of mine and I
said to her and she's Indian,

365
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,720
and I said to her,
you know,

366
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,183
able obviously you've seen me in the 
press and everything and how I voted 

367
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:36,260
conservative.

368
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,771
And she said,
well,

369
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,270
you know,
I have something to tell you capital.

370
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,080
I voted conservative too.
And that's the thing.

371
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:44,120
People are doing this in the candidate 
to it.

372
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,954
It's so crazy.
So I voted conservative in May 2010 and 

373
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:52,730
then in October 2010 I was invited to go
to the Conservative Party conference to,

374
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,330
to give a speech and that's like a 
convention.

375
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,310
You guys have conventions here.
And um,

376
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,103
I was a teacher.
I never really took much notice of 

377
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,260
political things.
I mean,

378
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,220
I,
I can,

379
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,200
I was a bit naive and a bit stupid to be
honest.

380
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,340
And um,
anyway,

381
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,070
I went along and I gave this speech 
which,

382
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,920
uh,
the audience really liked and um,

383
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,060
and then I ended up all over the press.
So this is the speech really.

384
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,690
That changed everything.
That changed my life.

385
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:19,970
Yeah,
for the worst at the time.

386
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,804
I mean,
I think now I can look back and say it 

387
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:25,070
was for,
for the better in many ways or at least.

388
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,950
Yeah.
I mean I'm,

389
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,370
every cloud has a silver lining and my 
silver lining has been,

390
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,520
has been a good one because I've made it
into a silver lining,

391
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,580
but I could have been destroyed by it 
quite easily.

392
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,530
I mean,
in the end I ended up without a job.

393
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,610
I was told that I would never get a job 
in state education ever again.

394
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,820
Lay out some of the things that you 
talked about in the speech.

395
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,120
So I talked about black kids failing and
that I talked about,

396
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,493
um,
I talked about that's not expecting 

397
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,123
enough of kids and how we are constantly
making excuses for them and how we 

398
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:05,870
labeled them with things like anger 
management or a,

399
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,160
you know,
a dyslexia or,

400
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:08,994
or,
or all these kinds of labels that we 

401
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:11,051
give the kids.
Oh,

402
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:13,050
he can't possibly be behave.
He's,

403
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,370
he's got issues.
That's what we always say they have,

404
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,673
they have particular needs and uh,
we have to meet their needs as opposed 

405
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,270
to just expecting them to behave.

406
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,240
Um,
everybody has different needs.

407
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,610
Nobody,
we can't expect anything of them.

408
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,920
And that's just the norm.
It's the norm.

409
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,110
So I,
I talked about all of this.

410
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:32,944
I talked about competition and how it 
was needed in schools that kids need to 

411
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:38,440
feel as if they're competing against 
somebody else and so on.

412
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,513
They need to feel like they're being 
inspired to work hard as opposed to 

413
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,760
being indulged and constantly let.
Off the hook because while it's not your

414
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,550
fault,
your parents are divorced,

415
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:54,270
it's not your fault because you live on 
an estate and your black and your mom is

416
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,850
a single mom and you can't possibly do 
your homework.

417
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,050
I mean,
I don't understand it,

418
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,033
you know,
like,

419
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,690
and,
and that was because over the years,

420
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,441
you know,
I've visited,

421
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:03,600
I'd worked for a summer once in South 
Africa.

422
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,793
I've been to see schools in China and 
Brazil and India and all of these 

423
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,114
countries where the kids were far poorer
and yet they were walking five miles 

424
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,180
getting to school and working really 
hard.

425
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,130
So why was it that those kids could do 
it?

426
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,260
And apparently our kids couldn't do it,
you know,

427
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,400
so that was why I questioned it and I 
said all of this stuff at the conference

428
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,234
and the Conservatives liked what I said 
because nobody ever says this sort of 

429
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,640
thing.
And then as I say,

430
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,900
it was out of a job and then I thought,
what do I do?

431
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,600
How does that happen?
So you give this speech,

432
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,450
you're fired the next day.
I resigned in the end,

433
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,970
but it was just untenable,
like the press I was,

434
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,193
I was everywhere.
It was like one of those Hollywood 

435
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:42,474
films.
I couldn't go outside my door because 

436
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,590
they were oppressed,
waiting outside to talk to me.

437
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,830
Like I said,
our responsibilities of thing.

438
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,810
Go get her.
This is what's so crazy.

439
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,970
All I said was ultimately I was saying 
that the education system was broken and

440
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,050
people wouldn't have that.

441
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,630
And the thing is I do feel it's like the
emperor's new clothes,

442
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,520
which is that,
um,

443
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,490
everybody knows that there's a problem 
with the education system,

444
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,740
but nobody's willing to say it.
Uh,

445
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,723
and I,
I got hundreds if not thousands of 

446
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,350
emails from teachers all over the 
country saying,

447
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,590
thank God someone said something.
Thank you for saying something.

448
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,543
I won't tell you my name.
I can't tell you my name because I'll 

449
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:22,020
lose my job because they're all 
terrified.

450
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,280
Right.
So,

451
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,530
so yeah.
So I,

452
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,364
um,
I then thought about the private sector 

453
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,290
for a bit,
but then I thought,

454
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,670
I love working with disadvantaged kids.
I love working in the inner city.

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,040
This is what I do.
This is what I know,

456
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,510
a knock,
I'm not giving up,

457
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,570
so we had just,
you've had charter schools,

458
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,730
uh,
in America for a long time.

459
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,530
We,
it was only in 2010.

460
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,920
The free schools,
which are charter schools started in,

461
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,510
you know,
there was the possibility of setting one

462
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:51,710
up.
So I decided to set up my own school and

463
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,110
I got a group of people together and 
then we started trying to set it up.

464
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,520
Now this was not easy because I had a 
lot of people who hated me.

465
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,700
Uh,
I mean I still have a lot of people know

466
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,623
me.
I said I do think the number's probably 

467
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:07,050
reduced or at least they've just left me
alone.

468
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,430
Actually,
I don't know if the numbers reduced.

469
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,264
I think they just leave me alone.
I think at some point they see that you 

470
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,210
keep going,
that's it.

471
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,090
Keep becoming successful.
And then they'll always find someone new

472
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,650
to feed them into scare.
But it's like they,

473
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,140
you know what I mean?
Like at some point they're like,

474
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,170
wow,
we haven't got her yet.

475
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,230
That's it.
And then they run out.

476
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:23,064
They're not into hard work really.
So they kind of are like possibly an 

477
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,390
easier target.
Yeah,

478
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:27,900
I,
it is.

479
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,920
I am a more,
it's harder now because I'm,

480
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,490
because I have the school and it's 
really hard.

481
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,900
Although they do try,
you know,

482
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,160
when we were trying to set up the 
school,

483
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:39,600
I was used to say,
gosh,

484
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,630
it's like we're like making nuclear 
bombs.

485
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,010
I mean,
what we're doing is setting up a school.

486
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,500
I mean we would,
we would,

487
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:49,420
um,
we would have parents evenings.

488
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,700
So first of all I'd be out in the street
handing out flyers,

489
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,480
a running into hairdressers and saying,
does anybody have any children who might

490
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,280
want to go to the secondary school?
And you know,

491
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:58,960
women will be coming out of their hair 
dryers saying,

492
00:20:58,961 --> 00:20:59,800
okay,
I'll have one,

493
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,310
I'll have one going into churches and 
mosques and temples and all sorts.

494
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,443
And then we would have a parent's 
evening once we had it in the pub and 

495
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:11,410
all these parents were driving.
Our detractors are outside picketing.

496
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,030
They've got posters that saying Tory 
teacher,

497
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,680
um,
all sorts of insults.

498
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:18,514
The screaming obscenities at me calling 
me names and we have to hire a bouncer 

499
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,550
because we were so worried about the 
possible violence.

500
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,473
Um,
and then when I was talking to the 

501
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,740
parent,
these should parents finding out about a

502
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:30,760
school,
that's it.

503
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,860
And they're all poor parents from the 
inner city,

504
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:33,694
right?
So you've got all these black mom's 

505
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,940
black,
single mums sitting there trying to find

506
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,670
out about this new school and all these 
white middle class people.

507
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:42,010
And when we say middle class we mean 
people with money.

508
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:44,110
You guys can use it as a working.
You are,

509
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:47,530
when we say middle class you,
you guys say middle class.

510
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:48,364
We mean working class.
When I say middle class I mean well off 

511
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,670
people.
So these white,

512
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,200
you know,
well educated,

513
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:57,170
well off people are,
have infiltrated on,

514
00:21:57,171 --> 00:22:00,010
are sitting amongst all of these inner 
city people,

515
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,113
uh,
who are wanting to find out about the 

516
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,750
school.
And when I'm talking they're standing up

517
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:05,584
and shouting abuse deliberately because 
they're trying to disrupt kinda like 

518
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,550
when you do stuff and like the shaking 
pennies.

519
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,583
We're going to talk about that because I
know you had a little criticism of the 

520
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:15,900
way I dealt with one of the issues that 
are related to education.

521
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,240
We'll we'll get to that,
but yeah.

522
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,074
So,
but let's just focus on that for a 

523
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,754
second.
What do you think it is about the 

524
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:23,390
intentions of those people?
I try not to judge people's intentions.

525
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:25,220
I try to judge their actions,
but bees,

526
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,413
these working class,
and I know you're not into identity 

527
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,380
politics,
but they happened to be white,

528
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,214
which you're illustrating here that 
they're the ones that are attacking the 

529
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,870
black mothers that are trying to take 
care of their kids.

530
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,070
What is it that these people.
What do you think they really think?

531
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,263
Why do you think they really are so 
invested in keeping everything the way 

532
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,390
it was?
They'll domain.

533
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,380
They'll say that they're for helping 
these people all the time.

534
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:50,870
Then they'll look at a system that does 
not help these people.

535
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,390
Then someone comes in and says,
I'm going to help these people.

536
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,840
There's a track record of doing it and 
they hate you and them.

537
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,610
Yeah,
yeah,

538
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,443
yeah,
they do.

539
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,370
Um,
and so just so I'm clear,

540
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,990
these are white,
well off people,

541
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,010
right?
These are people who are,

542
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,993
who have everything.
Some of them have been privately 

543
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,400
educated,
right?

544
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,463
I think it's because they believe in 
making people equal that the state 

545
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:11,554
should make people equal as opposed to 
giving people equality of opportunity 

546
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,170
because I'm all about giving people 
equality of opportunity.

547
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,063
I want to make it so that schools are so
good that everybody has an equal chance 

548
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,690
of making something of themselves and 
changing their stores.

549
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:26,720
Right?
That's what I want to do.

550
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,790
They don't like that.
They want these people to continue being

551
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,190
not,
not being successful.

552
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,050
And then they as kind of these,
these white knights in shining armor can

553
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:41,560
come down and the state can provide you 
with money and,

554
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,330
and,
and a free apartment and,

555
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,230
and all sorts of things.

556
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,420
And then they can sit at parties and 
feel very good about themselves because,

557
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,261
well,
you know,

558
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:53,060
I vote on the left and I'm a very good 
person to run if it works.

559
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,173
But this is.
So they're not interested in whether or 

560
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,170
not it works.
They're interested in feeling good about

561
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,740
themselves and their,
they genuinely believe that the state is

562
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:04,400
going to make things better for these 
people and free schools,

563
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,620
charter schools,
while they are state schools,

564
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,170
um,
the breakup,

565
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,560
the education system,
right?

566
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,394
So the unions aren't as powerful anymore
and they very much believe in the power 

567
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,684
of the unions and they want them to have
their collective bargaining and if too 

568
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,460
many schools break out of the system and
break up the system than it,

569
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,363
it devalues that power of the unions.
So I think that they convinced 

570
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,390
themselves that what they're doing is 
right.

571
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,223
Even though there are all these poor 
moms wanting to find out about another 

572
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,150
option for their child and they're 
desperate.

573
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,470
I mean,
when I say desperate,

574
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,150
I've had mothers crying,
you know,

575
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,153
in front of me crying saying,
I don't want my child to get knifed I 

576
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:48,254
don't want.
I want my child to have a decent 

577
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,790
education so that maybe you'll have a 
chance to get to university.

578
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,890
I just want him to be safe.
Right?

579
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,500
And,
and then people are.

580
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,390
And then what they'll do is they'll deny
that,

581
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:00,710
that,
that that's the case,

582
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:02,780
that there are schools where children 
aren't safe,

583
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,670
they'll deny,
they just,

584
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,110
they just lie.
Just bold face lies about,

585
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,003
about the system.
So what other kind of pushback did you 

586
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,240
get as you were creating the school?
Like what,

587
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,690
what is it like to you?
Okay,

588
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,260
you fill out some paperwork I assume and
now you try it,

589
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,113
you talk to some people and maybe you 
talked to some teachers that are 

590
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,260
likeminded administrators and things,
but what's that light to go on?

591
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,460
I got to find a building.
I got to find funding.

592
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,230
That's right.
So it's a total nightmare.

593
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,810
Total nightmare.
I mean,

594
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,653
really,
whenever any group comes to me and says 

595
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,860
we want to set up a school,
I always say,

596
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:37,880
okay,
well dig deep,

597
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,823
right?
Because you're going to have to get 

598
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,200
every bit of energy you've got to be 
able to push through on.

599
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,600
This mean it took us three years.
Um,

600
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,250
and it took us three years to find a 
building.

601
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,570
There was so many people against us.
Um,

602
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,753
and as you were saying earlier,
I just kept going and I mean I kind of 

603
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:52,274
had to keep going because otherwise I 
wasn't gonna be able to do the job that 

604
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:58,130
I love,
so I had to and eventually we found this

605
00:25:58,131 --> 00:25:59,030
building.
I mean,

606
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,000
so first you apply,
you have to go for interviews,

607
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,233
panel interviews and Blah Blah,
and then you get approved and then 

608
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:07,370
you're looking for a building and oh,
it's just a nightmare.

609
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,413
But,
um,

610
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,270
eventually we got this building,
uh,

611
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,800
which,
you know isn't the greatest building and

612
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:13,940
when I say it's not great,
you know,

613
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,890
there's no grass there,
no trees,

614
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,903
there's no carpet for the staff.
There's just the old car park which is 

615
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:22,250
used as a playground for the kids,
which is tiny,

616
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,690
you know,
it isn't ideal,

617
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,763
but I always say it's the people inside 
the building that matter and we've made 

618
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,840
a real go of it.
And um,

619
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:30,961
and,
you know,

620
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:31,820
it's,
it's great,

621
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,331
it's,
it's,

622
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:33,121
it's,
and,

623
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:35,480
and what is great and everybody really 
is great.

624
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,280
And this is where,
you know,

625
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,880
I,
I,

626
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,180
I'm reading,
you know,

627
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,070
I feel really optimistic is that we have
five,

628
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,003
10 teachers from all over the world that
come and visit the school every single 

629
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,870
day,
mainly from the UK,

630
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:50,760
but we get Americans,
Canadians,

631
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:52,050
Australians,
New Zealanders,

632
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,093
I mean,
and they come because they've heard 

633
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:54,864
about us through social media and they 
want to see what we do and then we get 

634
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:58,524
loads of letters from teachers,
from principals who say I taken these 

635
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:05,290
ideas and put them in my school and it's
really helped and it,

636
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,410
and it's made things better for our 
kids.

637
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,590
So I feel like we're not just having 
impact in our school,

638
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:11,990
on our kids,
but on,

639
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,560
on kids all over the world,
you know.

640
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,633
Alright.
So let's really focus on what you've 

641
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:19,290
done with them.
Kayla's school that you started in 2014.

642
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,183
There was a lot in,
in the research that I was doing about 

643
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,370
discipline really before you even get to
education.

644
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:30,450
So you guys do a bootcamp before you get
to teach them anything.

645
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,313
You're actually teaching them some 
things that purely about discipline and 

646
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,780
sort of how to live,
how to behave.

647
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,623
Yeah,
and that's because we believe you 

648
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,940
haven't taught them how to behave.
Then you can't give them a detention for

649
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:42,774
it because they don't know how.
And the reason why they don't know how 

650
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,460
is because we know that elsewhere,
they haven't necessarily been taught.

651
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,290
They haven't necessarily learned that at
home.

652
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,450
They certainly want to learn it at other
schools.

653
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,523
Um,
and that's because our expectations are 

654
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,800
really high.
And so we teach them.

655
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,630
We have silence in the car doors for 
instance.

656
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,460
So that's something people come and they
say,

657
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,533
why do you have to be so extreme?
I'll tell you why you had to be so 

658
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:06,810
extreme because otherwise you've got 
kids fighting in the corridors,

659
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,030
bashing each other's heads against the 
wall.

660
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,103
Some schools where teachers are scared 
to walk through the corridors because 

661
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,790
it's such mayhem.
You have silence.

662
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,830
Everybody just moves really quickly to 
their lessons.

663
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,350
You've got changeover that takes maybe a
minute and a half.

664
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,870
Children aren't losing loads of time 
from their lessons.

665
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,750
I always say 59 minutes out of every 60 
minutes in the lesson,

666
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,450
you've got it at Mckayla and we're 
trying to catch them up,

667
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,433
you know,
a lot of our kids come to us for the 

668
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,220
reading age of a five year old,
six year old when they are 11 years old.

669
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,060
In fact,
I mean,

670
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:33,894
some of them aren't like that.
Some of them are oxbridge material and 

671
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,164
we'll go to Oxford or Cambridge and some
of them need real help so that they 

672
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:40,644
don't leave school illiterate and 
innumerate 20 percent of the kids in a 

673
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,620
Britain leaves school illiterate and 
innumerate right?

674
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,140
Twenty percent one out of five kids now.
And that's functionally.

675
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,000
So it looks like they can read,
but they can't really read.

676
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,370
And this is happening across the 
country.

677
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,293
Um,
and it's become normal to expect that 

678
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,840
now none of our kids going to be in that
position because,

679
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,330
uh,
we teach them so.

680
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,643
And we teach them in an environment 
where the children are able to respect 

681
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:11,730
their teachers.
They loved their teachers.

682
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:14,550
They thank them for their lessons.
At the end of their lessons,

683
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,490
they say good morning and good afternoon
and so on,

684
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,980
and things that you would never imagine,
you know,

685
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:20,814
inner city kids,
you,

686
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,500
you,
you,

687
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,010
you know,
if you have an idea in your head of what

688
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,740
Nancy kids are like,
you imagine the boys walking with their,

689
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,190
with the trousers down here in that box 
kind of way and,

690
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,243
and,
and girls dressing in a way that isn't 

691
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:32,910
appropriate at our school.

692
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,120
None of that exists.
So you do have a dress code,

693
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:36,781
right?
Well,

694
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:39,060
they have a uniform uniform and that's 
normal in Britain.

695
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:39,894
Everybody has a uniform,
but the thing we actually stick to the 

696
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,650
uniform.
So you go elsewhere there,

697
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,090
the ties it down,
the shirts around and talked.

698
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,630
They look like a mess.
They walk like a gangster.

699
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,940
I'm always saying to the kids if they 
start,

700
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,340
if they ever start bumping like that,
I say you look like a gangster.

701
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,260
You need to start that right?
Um,

702
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,140
and they get it.
They say,

703
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,401
yeah,
yeah,

704
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:57,771
Miss,
yeah,

705
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:58,391
yeah,
I get it.

706
00:29:58,391 --> 00:29:59,224
I get it.
And then they stopped doing it because 

707
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:02,140
we talk about getting to the best 
universities,

708
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,123
we want you to get the Ivy League 
universities to get to Russell Group 

709
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:07,060
universities in Britain,
and we want you to have,

710
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,820
you know,
you aim for the moon,

711
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,910
you'll land amongst the stars.

712
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,080
That's where we think,
right?

713
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
And so they're all really ambitious and 
they're all working hard.

714
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,430
Why anyone would be against this as a 
concept.

715
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,600
I don't know.
So when you hear pushback against that,

716
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,434
I guess it's that people think it's 
presumptuous or something to imply that 

717
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:27,544
their parents can't do it.
Even if often the parents are failing 

718
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,183
or,
or the parents just have to work too 

719
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:35,170
hard and they don't have time to do the 
things that you're doing.

720
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:38,170
And I think when people think there's a 
racial element to that.

721
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,510
So if you,
if you even address that,

722
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,810
I actually think they have a problem 
with it itself.

723
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,060
They don't like the idea of us being in 
authority.

724
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,110
They don't like.
They think being an authority means that

725
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:52,750
we must be Nazis.
I've been called not a Nazi many a time,

726
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:53,584
which is a bit ironic when you think 
that what the Nazis would have done to 

727
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:56,494
somebody like me,
but exactly so and they don't like the 

728
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:06,730
idea of us being in authority and us 
being in charge.

729
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,300
So um,
one we're really key on discipline,

730
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,134
but two,
we want the discipline so that we can 

731
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:13,564
teach them properly.
And this is where you referring to what 

732
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,773
you said,
I was watching you at the Oxford Union 

733
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,400
and you'd said how about how kids need 
to be taught properly?

734
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:22,234
And I was and you'd said they need to be
taught critical thinking and take me to 

735
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:29,140
task the.
Yeah,

736
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:30,370
yeah.
The thing is,

737
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,960
is that you can't teach critical 
thinking,

738
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,860
right?
People are critical in their thinking or

739
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:43,060
independently minded or inquisitive when
they know lots about something.

740
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,770
And it's only by knowing lots.
It's like the 10,000

741
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:48,610
hour thing.
You know,

742
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:50,140
you got Malcolm Gladwell,
you got,

743
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,280
you know,
Steve Jobs,

744
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:54,010
you got the Beatles,
you spend a lot of time doing something.

745
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,220
You will get really good at it and then 
you'll be able to break the rules,

746
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,320
but if you're trying to break the rules 
right,

747
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,090
right away,
when you don't know anything,

748
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,560
then you end up with kids.

749
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,513
And this is the,
the public don't realize just how bad 

750
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:08,830
things are,
where kids don't know where Paris is,

751
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,873
you know,
kids don't know in Britain who Winston 

752
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,340
Churchill is,
you know,

753
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,313
they genuinely have no idea and that's 
because nobody's taught them because 

754
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,873
people are anti knowledge.
So the grandfather to like the whole 

755
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:22,720
knowledge movement is,
is,

756
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:23,471
uh,
ed Hirsch,

757
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:24,304
and he's an American.
His most recent book is why knowledge 

758
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:26,854
matters,
which I would encourage all of your 

759
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,430
viewers to read.
Um,

760
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,360
you know,
education is the most important thing in

761
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,260
any country,
right?

762
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,460
And,
uh,

763
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,353
and that's one of the reasons I'm so 
pleased to be talking to you because 

764
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,940
people need to realize,
you know,

765
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,621
you,
you,

766
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:44,780
you can have all your arguments about 
free speech and about,

767
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,040
about,
I don't know,

768
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,903
guns and about whatever it is you want.
But if the schools are not teaching 

769
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:54,950
children properly,
then that is the end of any country,

770
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,740
right?

771
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,740
And I'm desperately trying to shout as 
much as I can the Dell people to that we

772
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,460
need to do something and we are doing 
something.

773
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,480
I mean,
we're doing something.

774
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,010
And other people that were not the only 
ones,

775
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:07,844
you know,
there are other people who were doing 

776
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,920
things.
We named Mckayla,

777
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,320
Mckayla after a woman who died of 
cancer,

778
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:13,154
who I used to work with and uh,
she and her own classroom used to do 

779
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:16,994
exactly this and there are teachers all 
over America and all over Britain doing 

780
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,780
this in their own classrooms.
We need,

781
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,250
we need it to be more than that.
We need entire school districts.

782
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,290
You know,
we need people to get this point.

783
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,780
And when you said about teaching 
critical thinking,

784
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,260
it's a romantic view that comes from 
Rousseau.

785
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,510
Uh,
so 18th century philosopher,

786
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:40,790
Rousseau and he said,
you know,

787
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,360
a man is born free,
but everywhere and chains.

788
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,920
This whole idea of,
um,

789
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,960
of,
uh,

790
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,240
you education makes you less free.
This is what the,

791
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,650
the,
the progressive thing.

792
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,350
And actually it selfcontrol brings you 
freedom,

793
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,360
right?
It's counterintuitive,

794
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,440
but actually order and structure make 
you free.

795
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,540
They allow you to pursue all those 
avenues of knowledge basically.

796
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,190
Exactly.
Have sort of center.

797
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,880
Exactly.
If you learn lots about something,

798
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,940
then you're able to apply that knowledge
in different ways.

799
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,890
So I mean,
as an example,

800
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,510
um,
you know,

801
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,353
if,
if you take a math question that a 

802
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:24,650
primary school kid might be given,
uh,

803
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,633
you know,
John has eight cents at the end of the 

804
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,393
day,
it's one quarter of what he had at the 

805
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,164
beginning of the day.
How much money did he spend during the 

806
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,190
day?
Now I think I can do it,

807
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,170
and I think you can too,
and I think you can do it,

808
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,004
is because you've got short term memory 
and long term memory and you've got a 

809
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:47,150
whole bunch of math facts in your 
longterm memory that you're able to draw

810
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:47,300
out.

811
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,130
You're able to go quarter.
No,

812
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:49,964
there's four of those in a hole.
And then you're able to go four times 

813
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,680
eight because I know my four times 
tables and I can take it to 32.

814
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,793
And then I can do subtraction,
so I can take it to 24 right now if 

815
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,200
you're seven years old.
However,

816
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,990
if you have to hold all those facts in 
your working memory,

817
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,100
working memory,
can't do it.

818
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,660
You have got to drill and practice those
timetable facts,

819
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,503
for instance,
and put them into your longterm memory 

820
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,993
and put those fractions into your 
longterm memory so that when somebody 

821
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:18,500
gives you something more complex,
you can go Bam,

822
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,580
Bam,
Bam,

823
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,710
bring it out and then you've got the 
answer.

824
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,740
Sadly,
what happens is people say,

825
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:26,330
no,
what we need to do is teach them complex

826
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:29,360
problem solving.
Let's give them that first.

827
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,710
You got to break it down.

828
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,230
What are the bits underneath that you've
got to build up from?

829
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,590
And that stuff is a bit boring because 
it's boring and isn't very romantic.

830
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,610
This bag was talking about Rizzo.
So Russo,

831
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,720
this idea with you,
you,

832
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,430
you,
you bring it out of the child,

833
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
right?
So they have this phrase which says,

834
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,290
you know,
the mind is not a vessel to be filled,

835
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,303
but a spark to be ignited.
And it all sounds really exciting and 

836
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,114
thrilling,
right?

837
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,500
And that's the thing,
it's so seductive it,

838
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,503
it pulls everybody in,
but the reality is that actually what 

839
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,300
you need is a whole lot of facts in 
your,

840
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,490
in your memory there that you can then 
go boom,

841
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:06,510
boom,
boom and apply.

842
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,493
Now,
that doesn't mean that you're just a 

843
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,890
parrot and you just end up learning a 
whole load of facts,

844
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,230
which you then can just regurgitate.

845
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,303
You need to apply them and you need to 
give children the chance to apply them 

846
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,094
and have a class discussion and we do 
paired work and selling often in more 

847
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:22,770
progressive places.
They'll do group work,

848
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,860
they'll put five kids,
four kids around the table,

849
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,783
and they do group work and then what 
happens is the teacher moves amongst 

850
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:33,360
them as a facilitator of learning as 
opposed to the teacher who's driving the

851
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,920
bus.
I always say the teacher needs to sit in

852
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,250
the bus and drive and the kids get on 
the bus with you and go.

853
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,630
The more progressive way your.
They're just keeping them on task.

854
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:44,100
You do that.
Let me come and see you.

855
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:44,934
You do that,
but they learn very much and then they 

856
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:51,180
don't succeed and then we say it's 
because they were black.

857
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:52,014
It's because they were poor.
What we need to do is give them welfare 

858
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,780
and then there'll be okay because that 
will make them equal and my point is no.

859
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,703
Fix the education system,
give them an education and then they'll 

860
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,710
make themselves equal.

861
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,030
Gosh,
this reminds me of.

862
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,030
So I mentioned that I'm not that good at
math and I remember the day,

863
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:08,920
I haven't thought about this in probably
15,

864
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:09,390
20,
I don't know,

865
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,223
maybe literally maybe 20 years.
I remember being in sixth or seventh 

866
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,564
grade and we were doing division for the
first time and I remember the teacher 

867
00:37:17,141 --> 00:37:17,974
gave us a.
We had a quiz or something and I was 

868
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:22,600
able to do it in my head and I saw they 
had,

869
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,970
you know,
the equation and I just wrote the answer

870
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,193
and she gave me a fair.
I failed or I got a zero or something 

871
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:31,270
even though I had all the answers right.
She said you didn't show your work.

872
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,700
And I,
and I remember seeing her,

873
00:37:33,701 --> 00:37:35,650
but I got all the answers right,
and she said,

874
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:36,020
no,
no,

875
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,390
I need to see how you do you work now.

876
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,223
I didn't know how to do it that way,
but somehow I was able to do it in my 

877
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,674
head and I remember thinking that if 
that was all necessary to show the work 

878
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,690
that at some point I would get to a 
place where I would have to do it.

879
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,810
But somehow I had figured out my little 
trick first.

880
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:57,100
But because of the way she kinda just 
failed me for it,

881
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,750
he completely turned me off.
Man,

882
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,330
I literally haven't done that in 
probably 20 years or something.

883
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,320
That's a total sidebar all together,
but I guess it just goes to show that we

884
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:07,120
all,
we all kind of learn differently and you

885
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:07,954
need teachers that can kind of embrace 
the way you do it a little bit rather 

886
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:13,960
than just jam it down your throat.

887
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,510
Yeah.
Well you,

888
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:16,340
you,
you,

889
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,120
which is probably a little bit of the 
progressive thing that you don't like in

890
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:20,640
a way.

891
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,530
Yeah.
What I would say is,

892
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,580
you remember that particular incident 
and think that's all it was,

893
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,850
but I guarantee you that had you been 
taught properly in the classroom,

894
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,010
uh,
you would have known her methods.

895
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,113
You would have known what to write down.
You didn't know what to write down 

896
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:37,480
because there was too much chaos in the 
classroom.

897
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,553
You weren't listening,
you were busy talking to your friend 

898
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,313
because she let you talk because she 
didn't have high enough standards of 

899
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,340
behavior.
That sounds brilliant.

900
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,160
Yeah.
Well,

901
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,050
and that's it because this is just 
standard.

902
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,910
This is just what happens in all 
classrooms.

903
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,250
And then people think,
you know,

904
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,550
it's mean to make kids behave.
And after awhile,

905
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,453
the thing is,
is that remember there's more of them 

906
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,850
than there is of us,
right?

907
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,940
So we're not actually making them do 
anything they want to behave.

908
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,670
We're just creating an environment where
they're able to do it.

909
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,500
That's all I'm now there's,
there's the,

910
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,503
there's the 10 percent,
there's the 10 percent on the outskirts 

911
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,500
that the detentions and so,
and keep them in line,

912
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,590
right?
Um,

913
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,980
but the vast majority,
you need that tipping point,

914
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,760
the vast majority buy in to what we do 
and if you come visit our school,

915
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,280
the kids will say to you,
yeah,

916
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,950
it's super strict and yeah,
we get the tensions,

917
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,813
but you know what,
I get a great education and that's what 

918
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:33,694
I want because I want the opportunity to
be able to change my stars and if you 

919
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,464
believe that,
if you believe in equality of 

920
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:40,564
opportunity,
which sadly I think too many people in 

921
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:46,780
education don't believe in equality of 
opportunity and if you do,

922
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,853
then you want to provide an environment 
where they're going to be able to do 

923
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,510
that and um,
and,

924
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,650
and that's what we do and,
and I,

925
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,493
and I really hope those teachers would 
come and visit us that they're able to 

926
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,340
take from that and,
and,

927
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:00,820
and,
and do something in their schools.

928
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,010
Yeah.
Well first off,

929
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:02,844
I told you before we started,
I'm going to be in the UK with Jordan 

930
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,680
Peterson for a couple of stops.
So I will do everything I can to stop by

931
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:10,170
and maybe I can get Jordan to swing by.
Oh Wow.

932
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:12,120
Yeah,
his daughter is Mckayla by the way.

933
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:12,954
So there's a deep,
powerful thing happened is even 

934
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,760
powerful.
Um,

935
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,843
what about the type of kids you,
you've mentioned that there's some 

936
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:21,760
diversity in the type of kids that are 
coming in.

937
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,594
How do you guys decide who actually can,
can cut it and who can afford it and 

938
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:28,321
other,
you know,

939
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:29,031
all of that?
Well,

940
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:33,120
it's not just who comes to us,
it's the local council that kind of send

941
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:34,940
kids to us.
Uh,

942
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,823
so they decide who goes into a lottery 
and people apply and then they get 

943
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,800
picked out of a hat literally,
and then,

944
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,560
and then they come on.

945
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,950
Some of the people,
you know,

946
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,100
some of the kids had,
ended up with us,

947
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,670
didn't even necessarily want to be with 
us.

948
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,180
Uh,
they just end up being pushed towards us

949
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,950
because that's the way the system goes.
I mean,

950
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,360
frankly,
I don't even understand the system,

951
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,760
but we had a bunch of kids.
We've got a hundred and 20 kids in every

952
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,593
year,
so it's a pure lottery to get to the 

953
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:01,740
school basically,
if they don't win the lottery,

954
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:02,574
so to speak,
they're just going into the public 

955
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,660
school because at that point most likely
the parents can't afford private school.

956
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:07,220
Right?

957
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,611
Yeah,
yeah.

958
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:08,444
No,
definitely the parents can afford a 

959
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:09,980
private school,
but there's no,

960
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,810
I mean,
you talk about it as if we're different.

961
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:16,250
I mean like we're just another school.
There's loads of schools like us in that

962
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,140
sense around.
Um,

963
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,410
I mean we are a free school,
but uh,

964
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,360
yeah,
it doesn't,

965
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,990
it's not like we're the free school and 
then there's the local public school,

966
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:29,540
there's loads,
there's lots of schools and um,

967
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,060
and parents will choose us if they want 
to.

968
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,100
Um,
and as I say,

969
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:35,820
sometimes we end up with,
with,

970
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,693
with kids because the system is such 
that you have to choose your top five 

971
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,290
schools and you know,
you've chosen us fifth,

972
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:45,580
you probably don't want to be with us,
but in the name of fairness as,

973
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,473
as it always goes,
the people who have chosen as fifth has 

974
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,030
just as much of a chance getting in at 
the,

975
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,960
got very American there and did it well 
because I grew up in Canada.

976
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,300
So it kinda changes.
Um,

977
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,603
but yeah,
so people who don't want to come to us 

978
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,250
come to us and people who do really want
to come to us,

979
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:04,250
come to us and look,
you know,

980
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:07,670
I call myself the dragon lady and I say,
you know what,

981
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,420
I'm not going to change and if you're 
happy to put up with me,

982
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,670
these are the rules and this is what we 
do.

983
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,680
So if we hear your phone or if we see 
your phone,

984
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:18,500
we'll take it and we will keep it for up
to 16 weeks.

985
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,540
And that's the way that it is.
Um,

986
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,670
you know,
these smartphones are killing kids.

987
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,970
I wanted to get there.
Yeah.

988
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,240
What do you make of that?
Because it's an,

989
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,340
it's a disaster and in 20 years people 
get to know,

990
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,301
you know,
when I say it now,

991
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:29,871
people say,
Oh,

992
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:30,740
you're being extreme.

993
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:31,940
You know,
some schools,

994
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,890
they actually have these phones out in 
lessons.

995
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,840
Uh,
lots of schools.

996
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,210
They had them out in car doors and in 
the yard and so on.

997
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,193
We have the band completely and I'm even
trying to get parents to take them away 

998
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,550
at home.
We know we sell brick phone,

999
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:45,384
so that phone that you can't access the 
Internet so that we try and encourage 

1000
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,420
parents to give them that.
You want to keep in touch with your kid.

1001
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:51,410
Fine,
I understand.

1002
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,470
But you don't need to give them a 
smartphone that,

1003
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,520
that access to the Internet,
you know,

1004
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:57,320
Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates,

1005
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,183
all of those big guys in it.
They don't give their children phones 

1006
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,080
until they're 15.
They keep them away.

1007
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:07,550
When Steve Jobs in 2010 and the ipad 
came out and he was interviewed and they

1008
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:07,901
said,
well,

1009
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:09,140
what did you think about?
What does,

1010
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,730
what do your kids think about the ipad?

1011
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,511
And he said,
I don't know,

1012
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:13,880
I wouldn't give my kids the IPAD.
He,

1013
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,860
they,
they protect their children.

1014
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,783
Meanwhile,
our parents had no idea they're saving 

1015
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:22,250
up for months.
The give the kids this Christmas present

1016
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,120
and it's,
it's,

1017
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,953
it's like giving them heroin.
I say it's like playing Russian 

1018
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:26,540
roulette,
you know,

1019
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,603
um,
who you give anybody access to your 

1020
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:31,460
child on this phone,
right?

1021
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,550
Weirdo out there,
knows who your child lives,

1022
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:35,680
knows where,
how they go to school,

1023
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,850
knows where they go to school,
knows who their friends are.

1024
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,020
They get,
I mean,

1025
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,270
I don't understand.
Well,

1026
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,493
the reason why people do this is because
they don't know and they don't think 

1027
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:48,500
about the dangers of not just with 
random people,

1028
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,980
but also lovely girls who get involved 
with the bad boys at school.

1029
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,263
Um,
bad boys who might be criminals 

1030
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:56,340
elsewhere,
etc.

1031
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,910
And they quite liked them and they 
wouldn't otherwise know them,

1032
00:43:58,911 --> 00:43:59,960
but oh,
you,

1033
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:01,460
maybe he's going to add me on snapchat.

1034
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,710
Whew.
You know,

1035
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,520
And this is the kind of,
it's terrible.

1036
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,453
What about just for attention spans,
because I would imagine you're dealing 

1037
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:09,920
with a lot of that from young people 
right now.

1038
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,960
Massive snapchat,
as you just said.

1039
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,340
Exactly.
So you know,

1040
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:14,930
before when they used to watch,
you know,

1041
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:15,764
dallas and dynasty and so on,
at least there was a narrative arc that 

1042
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,973
went like this and it told a story and 
then something bad happened and then it 

1043
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,200
gets resolved and so on.
That doesn't happen anymore.

1044
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,620
You got like 22nd.
I went to the hairdresser's look at this

1045
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:30,050
man's bolthead who ended the little 
ditty.

1046
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,520
That's what they're watching,
right?

1047
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:33,960
It's,
it's,

1048
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,793
it's terrible.
So smartphones are a huge problem for 

1049
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,970
the inner city and,
but the biggest problem I would say,

1050
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:39,804
our progressive teaching methods that 
have infiltrated our schools and sadly 

1051
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:46,770
this kind of an idea that you're drawing
something out of the child as opposed to

1052
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,604
putting something in and the way in 
which over the last 50 years we have 

1053
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,510
turned away from knowledge as being 
really important.

1054
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,160
This hits,
of course,

1055
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,680
the most vulnerable.
So working class kids,

1056
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,531
uh,
in,

1057
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,480
in,
in our country,

1058
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:01,314
you know,
that tends to be a black thing in this 

1059
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,540
country,
in our country,

1060
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:03,981
you know,
in,

1061
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:04,814
in britain it'll be black kids,
but it'll also be white working class 

1062
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:07,884
kids will be a variety of different kids
who get hit by this because if you are 

1063
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,920
from a richer background,
your parents,

1064
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,720
you know,
you sit around the dinner table at night

1065
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:16,554
and you have dinner and you talk about 
the politics of the day and you learn 

1066
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:20,244
about different countries and science 
and all sorts of things just through 

1067
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,230
talking to your parents,
onto your parents,

1068
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:26,880
friends and your uncle and your aunt and
so on.

1069
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,230
With kids whose parents are not well 
educated,

1070
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,213
they don't get that at home.
So they're depending entirely on the 

1071
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:37,710
school to give them what they need to be
able to succeed.

1072
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,800
And sadly,
because schools are convinced about this

1073
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:44,580
idea of this romance around,
I'm thinking critically and,

1074
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,380
and,
and that's not to say we don't want them

1075
00:45:46,381 --> 00:45:47,610
thinking critically.
We do,

1076
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,990
but you need to give them lots of stuff 
to get them to that.

1077
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,300
So when I said that at oxford union 
about teaching critical thinking,

1078
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,310
it's not that you don't believe in 
critical thinking,

1079
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:59,160
of course it's that you really,
that's not,

1080
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,020
that's not something to teach.
At least at first,

1081
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:02,854
it's that you have to give them all the 
breath of knowledge first and then they 

1082
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:09,250
will learn how to critically think about
overplays issues.

1083
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:11,170
Fair enough.
I like criticism,

1084
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,730
I appreciate it.
And it's,

1085
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,223
it's something that we're just,
you having to fight all over the place 

1086
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,863
and,
and it's that idea of giving them that 

1087
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:22,860
equality of opportunity,
see it,

1088
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,520
which is what I call I keep coming back 
to because I'm.

1089
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,840
Have you seen any instances where this 
doesn't work?

1090
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,220
I mean have there been kids that come 
through and just for whatever reason,

1091
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,350
this,
this concept that,

1092
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,770
that you've built that you're instilling
in all these other students,

1093
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:40,604
it just does not work for them either 
because of something about them or the 

1094
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:44,260
family or.
Okay.

1095
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,510
So I've had to exclude a few children 
for knives,

1096
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,373
you know that.
But it's something in the inner city 

1097
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:48,941
that's a problem.
You know,

1098
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:50,470
when we talk about in the city,
you know,

1099
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,480
we've got kids showing up,
you know,

1100
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:55,060
young men showing up on bikes with 
masks,

1101
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:57,340
carrying knives,
waiting to meet some of our kids,

1102
00:46:57,341 --> 00:46:58,120
you know,
this,

1103
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,953
this is the inner city.
So there are some of those issues that 

1104
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:03,910
can take over,
you know,

1105
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:04,930
but,
um,

1106
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:06,340
but that doesn't mean that it hasn't 
worked.

1107
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,233
It always works.
The kids always learn more than they've 

1108
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:12,460
ever learned anywhere else.
The kids always are stunned by their own

1109
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:14,940
intelligence and what is possible.
Um,

1110
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,680
because we show that to them and it's 
um,

1111
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,070
you know,
and what kind of breaks my heart is that

1112
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,420
even those who are conservative,
so you have a,

1113
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,220
I watch all your programs and you have 
all these great people to come on,

1114
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,690
but nobody ever talks about education.

1115
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,380
You,
larry,

1116
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,390
for instance,
who I love and I think he's brilliant.

1117
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,740
He talks about all these things play in 
the black community and he has all these

1118
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:35,574
stats that he always comes out with.
And there's that thing where he takes 

1119
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:38,164
you apart,
you know,

1120
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,550
normally real moments,
but what,

1121
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,430
but what he doesn't do,
he talks about absent fathers,

1122
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,080
talks about crime,
talks about drugs and so on,

1123
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:51,080
but they never talk about education.
And the thing is education.

1124
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,840
That's what black people's fault,
right?

1125
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,683
That isn't that the state and the state 
needs to be held to account for this 

1126
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,383
because we spend in britain 80 billion 
pounds a year on the state education 

1127
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:06,800
system and yet we are failing all of our
kids.

1128
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,130
And that isn't right.
We,

1129
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,930
we and larry elder and all of these 
people who talk,

1130
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,970
they need to be able to say,
no,

1131
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:14,600
wait a minute.

1132
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,630
There's something going wrong at a verY 
low level because you can,

1133
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,850
you can talk all you want about personal
responsibility.

1134
00:48:19,851 --> 00:48:20,684
But if you haven't got an education,
it's very hard to make anything of your 

1135
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:24,910
life.
So is the problem then that in,

1136
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,640
at least in the american context,
the answer always is throw more money at

1137
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:31,130
it.
So it's not the real answer,

1138
00:48:31,131 --> 00:48:34,010
which obviously we've spent 45 minutes 
talking about,

1139
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,590
which is why and how you have to clean 
up these schools.

1140
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:37,603
But the easy answer is always throw more
money at it if they just need more 

1141
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:40,191
money,
you know,

1142
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,971
you always hear these things,
will,

1143
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:42,680
they don't have enough pencils and they 
don't have enough,

1144
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,120
uh,
you know,

1145
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:48,260
other supplies and notebooks and things 
and people don't take the next step,

1146
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:50,070
which would be the critical thinking 
step up.

1147
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,910
It's not about money.
You can throw money at anything.

1148
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,031
Yeah.
Yeah.

1149
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:55,010
The irony is they all go on about 
critical thinking.

1150
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:56,740
They're not doing any critical thinking,
you know,

1151
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:58,130
if only they would.
But,

1152
00:48:58,131 --> 00:48:59,090
um,
I,

1153
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,650
I wish you luck.
I mean,

1154
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,061
the,
the,

1155
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:04,340
the left really refused.
They refused to recognize there's even a

1156
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,660
problem.
Uh,

1157
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,820
the right will recognize that there's a 
problem,

1158
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,863
but they don't talk about it.
So that's What I'm saying about the 

1159
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,414
people who you interview and so on.
I just wish more people would say 

1160
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,090
actually the solution is in education 
because it really is,

1161
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,410
uh,
the,

1162
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,210
the,
the black community for instance.

1163
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,490
Um,
you know,

1164
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,980
would,
would transform if they were given a,

1165
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,410
the opportunity to have a great 
education.

1166
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,540
Um,
and,

1167
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,820
and that's not to say that all the 
things that larry elder talks about,

1168
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:33,470
about absent fathers and so on,
on a problem,

1169
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,473
I mean they are absolutely a but it's 
really important to call them out on it 

1170
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,340
and it's really important to cold out.

1171
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,560
You see,
and this is where I would disagree,

1172
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:44,030
you know,
I consider myself a conservative and the

1173
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:44,864
black conservative,
but I would disagree with some of the 

1174
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:48,980
black conservatives out there who 
refused to recognIze racism as a problem

1175
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:49,641
at all.
You know,

1176
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:51,830
they kind of just dismiss it.
And I would say no,

1177
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,753
it is a big problem.
and the reason it's a big problem is 

1178
00:49:54,321 --> 00:49:57,770
because the left in so many ways are 
racist.

1179
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:58,963
you know,
when they want to own us and they want 

1180
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,064
to tell us how we can vote and they want
to tell us how we can think that is 

1181
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:04,454
racism.
And when they refuse to recognize what 

1182
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:08,930
works in education,
that's going to help poor kids,

1183
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:11,840
black kids,
white working class kids in britain when

1184
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:14,150
they refuse to look at that.
Well that's racist.

1185
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:15,950
And I'd say it's racist against the 
white working class.

1186
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:16,783
The way the white working class or 
spoken about in britain is the way that 

1187
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:19,784
sometimes black car,
the black communities have spoken about 

1188
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,184
in America,
which is like there's some kind of 

1189
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:25,490
different like they're aliens.
Oh well,

1190
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:26,720
you know,
that's just the way they are.

1191
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:27,763
No,
that's not the way they are actually if 

1192
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:29,294
you give them the opportunity,
but you will want to sit around dinner 

1193
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:32,534
parties and talk about how kind you are 
and how great you are because your 

1194
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,180
virtue signaling and voting on the left,
you know.

1195
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,040
Um,
and I just wish,

1196
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:40,874
I suppose that there were more 
conservatives who were speaking out 

1197
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,200
about this and saying something.

1198
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,383
Yeah.
I guess there's a weird reflex for them 

1199
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:51,060
where they've been called racist for so 
long.

1200
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,010
Even though often they are minorities 
where they don't want.

1201
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:55,844
I see this.
I definitely see this where they don't 

1202
00:50:57,531 --> 00:51:00,020
want to use the same tactic.
So what you just said,

1203
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:02,420
right there is such a flip on the way we
think of racism.

1204
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,760
I tend to agree with that line of 
thinking.

1205
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:09,620
Obviously the people that are screaming 
about racism or all the time now are the

1206
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:11,750
people who are racist,
who are racist.

1207
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:12,623
They really are,
and I don't say don't say that lightly 

1208
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:16,010
because I don't like calling people 
faces,

1209
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,240
but they're the ones who are deManding 
exact look at everyone based on race and

1210
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:22,610
sexuality and the rest of this have to 
call it out,

1211
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:27,611
but I think there's a hesitancy from at 
least from sort of where I sit because I

1212
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,060
don't want to become what they became.
But I know,

1213
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,040
I know you're right at the,
at the core of this

1214
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:34,993
look,
I understand you don't want to say 

1215
00:51:35,731 --> 00:51:37,800
everything is racist,
but when there is real racism,

1216
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,753
you need to plan it out and you know,
the fact is that the fact is that if we 

1217
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:46,524
don't call it out,
all of these kids are going to keep 

1218
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,170
failing,
right?

1219
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,403
Uh,
what we don't realize is that all of 

1220
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:53,550
these kids are going through school and 
are being taught,

1221
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,633
uh,
to make sure that they're going off and 

1222
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:58,160
voting on the left.
That's how it is like that,

1223
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,660
that is the,
that that's how everyone thinks,

1224
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,560
like it's so standard in the education 
system to,

1225
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,483
to think on the left that the few 
conservative teaches that there are out 

1226
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:11,520
there,
they're quiet,

1227
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,650
they never say anything because they're 
terrified,

1228
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,850
right?
Um,

1229
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,950
there is no balance of ford.
Um,

1230
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,580
and,
and,

1231
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:20,460
and that's really scary.
I think,

1232
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,650
uh,
a and for the future of,

1233
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,250
of,
of,

1234
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,650
of,
of our countries,

1235
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,200
we,
we need people to talk to each other,

1236
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,740
the stuff that you're always talking 
about,

1237
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:32,790
about talking to each other and sharing 
ideas and thinking about how the other,

1238
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,760
the other side things.
Um,

1239
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,490
and,
and I worry that,

1240
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,350
uh,
we don't,

1241
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,730
we don't do enough of that.
We,

1242
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,010
we,
we don't do enough of at school,

1243
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:44,844
that's for sure.
And then those kids turn into adults 

1244
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:48,040
eventually,
don't they and them.

1245
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,580
And then we just,
you know,

1246
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,353
and then they're really pissed at the 
system that they believe is failed them 

1247
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,730
and then they just perpetuate that 
through the next generation two and then

1248
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,570
eventually that's unsustainable actually
because then you have enough people that

1249
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:04,730
are turning against the system that's 
failed them.

1250
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,390
It's bEcause no one stood up and did 
what you're doing.

1251
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:09,224
But it's interesting because this is 
where a good old american classical 

1252
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,700
liberal,
and I know you guys,

1253
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:14,534
at least in the uk have a better 
understanding of what classical 

1254
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:18,830
liberalism I think that we do here.
We talked about this a little bit before

1255
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:21,890
that these words aren't getting muddled 
and mangled and all that,

1256
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,980
but this is a place where to me,
where the government should be

1257
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,813
involved.
I'm all for using tax dollars to do the 

1258
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,730
things you're talking about where some I
think.

1259
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:35,770
I think there are plenty of people that 
are american conservatives at least that

1260
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,910
want to just cut funding from all of 
these things and endlessly cut funding.

1261
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,833
AS I said,
I'm not for throwing money at them just 

1262
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,400
because that's just the easy answer.
But yeah.

1263
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,234
Let's figure out how do we,
why is it we use money to empower these 

1264
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:51,420
teachers?
And that sounds like that's exactly what

1265
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:52,680
you're doing.
Well,

1266
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,693
exactly.
It's the power of bad ideas at the 

1267
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:58,140
moment that over the last 50 years,
you know,

1268
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,460
60,
70 years ago,

1269
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,270
the schools that were out there,
but we're more like our school now.

1270
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,183
It's just that things have changed so 
radically where knowledge has been 

1271
00:54:07,771 --> 00:54:10,290
sidelined a,
it's all about skills.

1272
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,660
People talk about skills and drawing it 
out of the child,

1273
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:13,440
like I was saying.

1274
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,390
And um,
we've,

1275
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,430
we've lost,
um,

1276
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,870
we've lost the purpose of education and 
we've lost,

1277
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,823
you know,
the ideas that we have about 

1278
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,673
perseverance even when it's difficult,
especially when it's difficult personal 

1279
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:30,240
responsibility,
you know,

1280
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,760
if you didn't bring in your homework,
then you are responsible for that.

1281
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,650
Whereas elsewhere they'll say,
oh,

1282
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,560
well it's not your fault.
You come from a difficult family.

1283
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,870
Difficult background.
we're going to give you an excuse.

1284
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,933
And if you're constantly being given 
those excuses and if later on getting 

1285
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:46,860
into university,
there are quotas and if you're likely to

1286
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:49,970
get in because you're black or your 
union there,

1287
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,530
there's,
there,

1288
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,060
there are things that allow you,
oh,

1289
00:54:52,061 --> 00:54:53,400
I tick that box,
I tick that box,

1290
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,800
I'm going to be able to get,
get in with a lower score,

1291
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,890
then you start setting those stanDards 
for yourself.

1292
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,120
Right?
And then we don't,

1293
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:00,954
we all eventually degrade the whole 
system because if you let someone in at 

1294
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:04,674
a lower level and then also let them get
a job at a lower level or get into grad 

1295
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,630
school at a lower level of the job,
at a lower level.

1296
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,441
Everything else.
Well,

1297
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:13,320
that whatever you've created as a 
professional is,

1298
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,290
is a degraded version of whatever that 
supposed to be.

1299
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,280
That's right.
That's right.

1300
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,190
And um,
and that is what's happening,

1301
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,130
sadly,
uh,

1302
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,053
there's a whole campaign at the moment 
in britain for this to happen with 

1303
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,030
oxford and cambridge university,
uh,

1304
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,960
to,
to essentially allow kids.

1305
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:31,800
I mean,
it's just,

1306
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,970
it's,
it's,

1307
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,833
it's really sad.
And what the reason why is because they 

1308
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:35,971
say,
hey,

1309
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:36,804
look,
there aren't that many black kids at 

1310
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:40,140
oxford and cambridge,
we need to fix this.

1311
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,430
We do,
I agree.

1312
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,590
we need to fix it.
So we need to fix the education system.

1313
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,424
We need to fix our schools and make sure
that they're given the equality of 

1314
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,094
opportunity.
Not that day that I spent at oxford was 

1315
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,304
such an absolute joy talking to so many 
kids just in the streets and just 

1316
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,620
everybody was so like excited to learn 
and obviously they were sympathetic to a

1317
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,900
lot of the things that I talk about and,
and all that.

1318
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:01,883
I'm curious.
So I get it sort of on the sciences and 

1319
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:05,904
math and that you really want to teach 
them the facts on this stuff on things 

1320
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:10,920
like history.
Yeah.

1321
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,260
A lot of the facts in history.
There are facts in history,

1322
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:14,094
but I.
But I wonder now these days where it 

1323
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,074
seems like young people are kind of into
socialism or young people are kind of 

1324
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:21,450
into communism or marxism,
the rest of it,

1325
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,250
uh,
have you found that teaching history has

1326
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:27,940
become oddly say,
oddly political?

1327
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:28,271
I mean,
it,

1328
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:30,640
of course it is political,
but oddly politicized,

1329
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,550
so like hitler for instance,
has taught to death,

1330
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,230
um,
but,

1331
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,360
uh,
say the,

1332
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,223
the trustees of communism and so on are 
not taught so much or even then so 

1333
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:45,330
rarely is,
is,

1334
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,550
is,
is so little is taught full stop because

1335
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:49,384
they're not being taught properly in the
classroom because you are facilitating 

1336
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:54,010
learning and kids are just teaching 
themselves.

1337
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,580
I mean that I can't stress how much of 
that is actually going on.

1338
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,710
Um,
so yes,

1339
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:04,630
things are politicized and um,
children are not able to access the kind

1340
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:06,550
of education that they were able to 
access before.

1341
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:07,384
And it's hard because I'll say that and 
then people will just deny that that's 

1342
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:11,840
what's going on.
Um,

1343
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:12,903
but you can see by if you talk to 
university kids at university and asked 

1344
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:18,940
them what do they know about the world 
and so on,

1345
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,433
what do they think they'll tell you?
And you'll see how much they've been 

1346
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:24,550
taught,
what they've been taught at school.

1347
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,553
Uh,
so a few of them have an understanding 

1348
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,040
of communism and what it is.
Um,

1349
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,740
and that's because they're not learning 
it properly at school.

1350
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,440
Um,
school is

1351
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,501
sadly,
it's,

1352
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:39,570
um,
it's,

1353
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:44,180
I wish that there was more diversity of 
thought amongst teachers.

1354
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:45,343
So one of the reasons why we watch a lot
of you the ruben report is because I 

1355
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,410
want my staff to try and think outside 
the box.

1356
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,363
What I always say is I can predict 
everything that you think about every 

1357
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:55,424
issue out there.
So if I know that you definitely voted 

1358
00:57:57,951 --> 00:58:01,760
remain as opposed to brexit with regard 
to the european union for us,

1359
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,690
or if I know for sure that you would 
vote for corbyn,

1360
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,720
the leader of the labor party in britain
or if I know I'm,

1361
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,680
you know,
what you would have to say about a whole

1362
00:58:12,681 --> 00:58:15,290
variety of different things.
Even whaT newspaper you read,

1363
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,890
if I can make all these predictions,
there's something wrong with me.

1364
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,290
I'm conservative on some issues,
but I'm,

1365
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,220
I'm anti guns for instance.
I'm pro choice and pro gay marriage,

1366
00:58:25,221 --> 00:58:26,054
those sorts of things that I'm very much
on the left on these other things that 

1367
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:29,810
I'm more conservative about,
you know?

1368
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:30,843
Um,
and that's because I'm a thinking 

1369
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:32,430
person.
Yeah.

1370
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,390
Yeah.
Classical liberal.

1371
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:34,224
Yeah.
I suppose in many ways that one might 

1372
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:36,800
say that,
um,

1373
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,090
you know,
I'm,

1374
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,330
yeah,
the point is I just want people to think

1375
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:43,590
outside the box,
right.

1376
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:44,424
And I wish teachers would and that there
was more diversity of thought and there 

1377
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:47,334
is some diversity of thought,
but they have to keep quiet because 

1378
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:52,680
they're terrified of making sure that 
you get the right teachers.

1379
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,150
Well,
in a waY it's,

1380
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,120
it's self selecting.
So when they apply,

1381
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,600
um,
it,

1382
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,503
there are already people who were,
who were somewhat thinking outside the 

1383
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,600
box,
um,

1384
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,000
and then they,
um,

1385
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,213
and then they come and I think being at 
the school also changes their minds 

1386
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,610
about things.
They start to think differently,

1387
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,830
uh,
because they're seeing what's possible.

1388
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,933
Uh,
people can't imagine what's possible 

1389
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:18,600
with inner city kids until they come to 
our school.

1390
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,643
I have visitors,
teachers were visitors there nearly 

1391
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,913
tears saying,
I can't believe that these kids are so 

1392
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:24,740
nice.
Um,

1393
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,053
so that's,
that's what we're tryIng to do when the 

1394
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,780
point the point and it happens here,
you know,

1395
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,830
I've been to see a,
so I said ed hirsch,

1396
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:32,664
you know,
some of the schools where they use his 

1397
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:36,740
materials and they place knowledge at 
the heart of their curriculum.

1398
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,680
I've seen some of those schools in the 
bronx and in,

1399
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:40,730
um,
in,

1400
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:45,200
in various but queens and so on and uh,
and they're doing a great job too.

1401
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,050
Um,
I just wish more of it was happening and

1402
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:48,884
that we could,
we could get a bigger platform to talk 

1403
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,080
about it because it's just so important.
Um,

1404
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:59,690
but people don't,
people don't get that.

1405
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,620
They don't get that stuff.

1406
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,460
You think.
so I do.

1407
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,750
I think that's why these types of things
are working.

1408
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,180
That's why you're half a world away,
you know,

1409
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,000
thousands of miles away and you've shown
this,

1410
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:10,863
the conversations that we're having here
to your staff and the amount of people 

1411
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,410
that are showing up to these live events
now,

1412
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,220
the amount of people that are 
downloading these podcasts and all that,

1413
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,320
it's starting to happen.

1414
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,543
Well,
I hope so.

1415
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,100
I hope so.
I mean,

1416
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,300
uh,
there's,

1417
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,200
there's so much to Be had,
you know,

1418
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:29,270
I've known tens of thousands of kids.
People often say,

1419
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:34,100
why do I do what I do because I've known
tens of thousands of kids who could have

1420
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:35,600
been so much more,
right,

1421
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:39,890
who could have been in a position to 
change their stars and they weren't able

1422
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:40,724
to because the state is spending so much
money on their education and isn't able 

1423
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:47,340
to provide them with a decent education.
Um,

1424
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,680
and that's really sad.

1425
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,800
Yeah.
I wanT you to offer.

1426
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:52,634
So I know that I have a lot of young 
people obviously that listened to this 

1427
01:00:54,671 --> 01:00:56,060
show,
high school,

1428
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:57,830
sometimes junior high school,
but college,

1429
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:58,664
whatever else,
just for the general young person out 

1430
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:01,034
there that's watching this,
that's in a school that's not doing 

1431
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:07,460
these things,
that's trying to figure out how to learn

1432
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:10,850
and think critically and get a good wide
breath of knowledge.

1433
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,240
But the situation that they're in is not
everything you've offered here.

1434
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:17,600
what would you say to them to just start
doing it for themselves?

1435
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,870
You got to take personal responsibility 
so you can't be a victim.

1436
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,100
Um,
you know,

1437
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:26,150
the whole victimhood thing is just 
stoked all the time in schools and uh,

1438
01:01:26,151 --> 01:01:28,970
and indulged,
you got to think it doesn't matter where

1439
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:32,450
I am a great,
I haven't had the best luck,

1440
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,010
right?
I would have loved to been able to go to

1441
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:35,660
that local private school,
but you know what,

1442
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:36,943
so what I'm going to,
I'm going to sit down and I'm going to 

1443
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,494
work and I'm going to work really hard 
and I'm going to go to the library and 

1444
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,450
I'm going to find the books and I'm 
going to teach myself if necessary.

1445
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,700
And I've known kids like this who have 
done this,

1446
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:49,010
um,
I've known colleagues of mine and people

1447
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:49,910
who I've known,
they just,

1448
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,073
they,
they make it their business to teach 

1449
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,174
themselves what they need to know and 
they need to know that knowledge is at 

1450
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:56,030
the heart of it.

1451
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,240
You need to know lots of stuff and then 
you can manipulate that stuff.

1452
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,373
Um,
and then you can be intelligent with 

1453
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:02,360
that stuff,
right?

1454
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,150
Um,
you can do it.

1455
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,910
You can.
The thing is is that it's rare that a 15

1456
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:10,490
year old takes it upon themselves to do 
it.

1457
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,900
They are,
by definition,

1458
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:12,734
they're exceptional.
Most kids need somebody to guide them 

1459
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,960
and if their parents aren't doing it,
then I think the school certainly can do

1460
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,420
it.
Whether or not the school should,

1461
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:22,920
there are people will say,
well that's not fair.

1462
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:24,990
School shouldn't have to do that.
The parents should do that.

1463
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,250
And it's true.
And you know,

1464
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:27,750
what if,
if,

1465
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,180
if welfare we're not as generous as it 
is.

1466
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,014
And so on.
The parents probably would have more 

1467
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:37,080
agency and self determination about 
themselves and the incredible catch 22,

1468
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,183
they would take more responsibility and 
they would do something and sadly the 

1469
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:43,350
state hits them in both ways,
right?

1470
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,393
Because it gives them the heroine of 
welfare and then it suppresses them by 

1471
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,100
not giving them a decent education.
Uh,

1472
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,780
and then they Sit around and they talk,
oh,

1473
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:52,321
and they say,
oh,

1474
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:53,154
I'm a really good person because I 
believe in giving people loads of 

1475
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:56,790
welfare and in having terrible 
education.

1476
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,980
I mean,
how,

1477
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,840
you know,
you punch somebody on one side,

1478
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:03,690
then you punch them on the other side.
How on earth are they meant to succeed?

1479
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:04,800
Right?
um,

1480
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,530
and the thing is we spend a lot of money
in tax to,

1481
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,930
to have a state and I'm a classical 
liberal,

1482
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:14,490
so I believe in a small state,
but we do have a state,

1483
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,550
let's use it for what we can for the 
good,

1484
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,090
but we're not doing that.
Um,

1485
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,810
and,
and that's what's,

1486
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:24,390
that's what's really scary.
And um,

1487
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,810
we,
we need a soul believing in this idea of

1488
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:28,644
equality,
of opportunity and that a teaching 

1489
01:03:32,701 --> 01:03:34,890
children's self control will make them 
free.

1490
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,140
Um,
and,

1491
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,700
and,
and having,

1492
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:39,534
uh,
an ordered environment where children 

1493
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:41,544
can learn will enable them to learn lots
of stuff so that they can then be 

1494
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:47,394
motivated to do something with their 
lives because they will make themselves 

1495
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:52,410
free,
um,

1496
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,370
by,
by grabbing that opportunity and,

1497
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,010
and,
and,

1498
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:56,843
and it's that agency.
It's that sense of self determination 

1499
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,190
that the conservatives,
people on the right,

1500
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,053
right leaning tend to believe in more as
opposed to mummy state coming in and 

1501
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:09,720
looking after it for a un taking care of
you,

1502
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,570
because if that's what you aspire to,
then what's the point of living,

1503
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,940
right?
Um,

1504
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,920
but you know,
you have to teach dead white men,

1505
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,873
right?
like one of the big problems we have Is 

1506
01:04:20,221 --> 01:04:24,300
that they don't want to teach dead white
men because they're dead white men.

1507
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,500
And that's a problem,
right?

1508
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:26,700
So they only want to teach.

1509
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,700
Recently we had this situation where I'm
in manchester.

1510
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:33,780
These students painted over a mural of 
kipling.

1511
01:04:33,781 --> 01:04:34,614
So rudyard kipling's poem was up there 
and they painted it over and put maya 

1512
01:04:37,521 --> 01:04:41,250
angelou's poem by maya angelou.
Now I'm a great fan of maya angelou.

1513
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:42,960
I think she's brilliant.
Um,

1514
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,363
but one of the reasons why she's a great
writer is because she read a lot of 

1515
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:47,990
kipling and she read a lot of 
shakespeare.

1516
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,210
In fact,
she said of shakespeare that she thought

1517
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,044
when she first read him that he must 
have been a black woman because he 

1518
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:54,624
wouldn't know he,
he had to be a black woman to have 

1519
01:04:56,701 --> 01:04:58,830
understood the plight of black women.
Right?

1520
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,110
Because he speaks to the human 
condition,

1521
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,003
right?
But he's a dead white male or we don't 

1522
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:04,860
want to teach him.
Oh,

1523
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,300
kipling.
He was a racist.

1524
01:05:06,301 --> 01:05:08,190
We don't want to teach him,
but at our school,

1525
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,360
we've got them reciting,
you know,

1526
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,760
the poem,
if you can keep your head when all about

1527
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:15,070
you are losing theirs and blaming it on 
you,

1528
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:15,870
you know.

1529
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,620
Uh,
but at the end of it,

1530
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,880
at the end of it,
it says,

1531
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,670
uh,
the earth is yours and everything that's

1532
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:22,630
in it.
And what's more,

1533
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:25,600
you'll be a man,
my son and that you'll be a man,

1534
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:26,890
my son.
But what about the women?

1535
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,260
How,
how can you not be recognizing the women

1536
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,383
on,
in a day and age where men can be women 

1537
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:35,340
and women can be met and we can't allow 
this poem.

1538
01:05:35,341 --> 01:05:35,620
I,
well,

1539
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,740
he's obviously speaking to me too,
but there's outrage.

1540
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:39,131
Oh no,
no,

1541
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,570
no,
he's only mentioned men,

1542
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:41,600
right?
Um,

1543
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,320
it's the most beautiful poem.
Our children learn it off by heart,

1544
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,183
right?
But children elsewhere will never have 

1545
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:47,464
access to kipling.
Now everyone needs has to be taught 

1546
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:50,464
about talk taught shakespeare.
Got to by law you have to be taught 

1547
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:53,494
shakespeare.
But the fact is we indulge in 

1548
01:05:56,091 --> 01:05:56,924
shakespeare,
we love shakespeare because shakespeare 

1549
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:00,910
is so beautiful and extraordinary.

1550
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,580
And just because he's a dead white guy.
Well,

1551
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,830
does that mean that he didn't write 
beautifully?

1552
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:06,700
You know,
they're,

1553
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,560
they're just some beautiful.
I mean,

1554
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,513
you know,
love is not love which alters when it 

1555
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:11,194
alteration,
finds or bends with the remover to 

1556
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:14,290
remove it's old.
so beautiful.

1557
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,840
And you want the children to be able to 
access this.

1558
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,000
and we teach them other poems like 
invictus,

1559
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:19,834
which means an unstoppable.
And one was one of mandela's favorite 

1560
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:23,490
poems.
Um,

1561
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:24,990
and you know,
east,

1562
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,580
they say at the end,
I am the master of my fate.

1563
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:28,503
I am the captain of my soul.
And all of our kids put their hands on 

1564
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:32,680
here when they say I am the master of my
fate.

1565
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:33,514
And there's nearly 200 kids in the lunch
whole olis belting this out and loving 

1566
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:39,280
it because they are the masters of their
fate.

1567
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:40,323
Um,
and it's teaching the kids that and 

1568
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,710
inspiring them to make a difference with
their lives.

1569
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,020
Whatever their color as opposed to 
saying,

1570
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:47,973
oh,
well there's racism and sexism in the 

1571
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:49,894
world,
therefore you're never going to be able 

1572
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:51,710
to succeed.
Um,

1573
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,800
because I,
you just give up and don't worry because

1574
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,420
there's welfare,
so you can always just,

1575
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,030
you know,
you can just take the welfare instead of

1576
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,620
instead of making something of your 
life,

1577
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,150
you know,
and um,

1578
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:02,463
that is what it is to kill a man when 
you kill his self determination and you 

1579
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:06,394
kill his,
his agency and you kill his motivation 

1580
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,920
to do something with his life that is to
kill a man.

1581
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,200
And that is what the left is doing.
And,

1582
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,920
and I say that's about,
that is racism.

1583
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,440
I do,
and we should say it out loud,

1584
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:21,423
but we never do.
The conservatives never called it and 

1585
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:25,660
they should call it what it is.
Um,

1586
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,370
and you know,
well,

1587
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,890
what can you do?
You just gotta keep going,

1588
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:30,724
right?

1589
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,420
What a beautiful ending.
That's ending right there.

1590
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,493
We're going to clip that one and do 
something with that because that was 

1591
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:38,800
just part of it.
Well that this is what it's all about.

1592
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,233
Everything that I'm trying to do here.
You're talking about the roots and the 

1593
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:44,284
foundation of all of that and you're 
doing it and I promise you I will make 

1594
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:49,670
it to the school when I'm in the uk for 
great.

1595
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:54,870
Can I do to give a little talk?
Maybe we can do something like.

1596
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,733
This was really a pleasure.
Thank you so much and thanks to douglas 

1597
01:07:58,961 --> 01:07:59,794

so we were least by Douglas Murray
