1
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,590
Alright,
we are back.

2
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:33,591
I jokingly said that we were going to 
crash the Internet and I'm pretty sure 

3
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,090
we crashed youtube literally out of 
every live stream we have ever done.

4
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,430
We have never had an issue.
I don't know what happened there.

5
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:43,431
I have conferred with these two fine men
and we're not willing to completely go 

6
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:47,931
down the conspiracy theory yet.
We're going to have to just recap what 

7
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:48,240
happened in 10 minutes,
I believe.

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,870
Well,
first off,

9
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,240
Ben Shapiro to my left,
ironically,

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,910
Jordan Peterson to my right.
Uh,

11
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,720
I believe that we are fully right now in
an idea revolution.

12
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,280
We talked about this for about 10 
minutes.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,490
We'll try to recap a little bit of what 
we started with and then gets a similar 

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:04,490
all new stuff.
Uh,

15
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,480
as I've said to the guys,
they're welcome to talk directly to each

16
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,280
other.
If they have questions for me,

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,080
we can add.
There are no rules here,

18
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,970
there are never rules in your,
but truly today,

19
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,300
there are no rules.
Uh,

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,510
and I,
I think that these guys are in the thick

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,080
of something just tremendously important
right now in relevant.

22
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,300
And that's why they're blowing up the 
way that they are.

23
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:24,060
Okay.
Let's try to do some of that again.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
Although you guys were both quite 
eloquent the 10 minutes ago.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm idea revolution.
Do you believe that we are in an idea 

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,080
revolution right now?

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,380
Well,
this is what I think's happening,

28
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,530
I think,
and I think this accounts for the 

29
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,490
attractiveness of the content that I've 
put on Youtube.

30
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:46,491
So when Nisha darkness the death of God 
about 150 years ago and his,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,130
he made three predictions,
he said people will be,

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,990
as a consequence,
our culture will shape to the roots will

33
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,200
become nihilistic or totalitarian in 
response,

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,490
or we'll invent our own values.
Okay?

35
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,600
Those were.
Those were his three possibilities.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,840
And then,
and then of course we became not listed.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,850
Can Totalitarian,
totalitarian through the 20th century 

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,720
and many tens of millions of people died
as a consequence,

39
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,880
which Nietzsche also foretold 
specifically.

40
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:19,881
He said that 100 million people would 
die because of the rise of communist 

41
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:19,881
ideas.
He said that in willpower.

42
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,780
So then he predicted that while we would
have to invent our own values,

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,670
but then the psychoanalysts came along 
and they said,

44
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,350
well wait a second,
you can't.

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,220
You can't create your own values because
you're not mastering your own house.

46
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:35,310
There are forces operating inside of you
that are autonomous.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,970
And for Freud,
those were primarily biological forces,

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,130
but young took that a step further and 
he said,

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,160
well wait a minute.
Biology is a lot more sophisticated and 

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,010
complex than you think,
and there are symbolic forces at work.

51
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,650
He thought of the archetypes has images 
of the instincts,

52
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,830
for example,
but the instincts were a lot more 

53
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,541
sophisticated than people thought.
So it's not just an instinct to 

54
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,991
aggression.
Let's say there's an instinct to 

55
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,930
operating properly that you walk up 
hierarchies,

56
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,050
human hierarchies of competence.
It'd be something like that.

57
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,480
And that's.
That's an archetype of the ideal.

58
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,540
In some sense,
you thought the gods didn't disappear.

59
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,490
They went inside,
they went into the psyche,

60
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:17,491
and so he dove down as far as he could 
dive to find out what those eternal 

61
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,270
images were and to bring them back up to
the surface.

62
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,660
And that's what I've been continuing,
I would say in my lectures saying,

63
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,310
look,
there's,

64
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
there are elements to the ancient story 
that are not only they're deeply correct

65
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:35,191
and you cannot live and you live in hell
unless you know them.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
It's something like that.
And that's the case.

67
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,940
So.
And I think that's,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm hoping that's what is happening is 
that people are starting to understand 

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,961
that people,
people's lives do have a transcendent 

70
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:52,771
purpose.
That's the most appropriate way of 

71
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:55,261
looking at life.
That our brains are in fact evolved to 

72
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:55,690
reveal that purpose to us.
Which I also believe.

73
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,440
I think the neuro neurological evidence 
in that regard is quite clear.

74
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,500
I believe that.
And so I hope.

75
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,090
I'm hoping that what,
what we're.

76
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,750
We're at the end of postmodern despair.
That's what I'm hoping.

77
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,010
Yeah.

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,080
So to me,
what you're giving there is sort of a 

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,181
realist version of religion.
You're saying these stories are needed 

80
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:18,890
for a very real way.
I suspect you basically agree with.

81
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,570
Well,
what's what's fascinating about this is 

82
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:24,570
a,
I mean Jordan,

83
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,720
maybe closer to aristotle and Plato,
but I think that we almost have a 

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,770
platonic verses,
Aristotelian argument going on here 

85
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,920
because it seems like what you're 
talking about is the idea that if we dig

86
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:35,160
down deep enough into our biology's and 
into our neural networks,

87
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:40,161
what we find is a common set of shared 
values that if you refuse to acknowledge

88
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:43,190
then leads to grave on happiness.
And what I'm.

89
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm almost feeling level right and when 
I'm coming from,

90
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:50,121
it's almost a platonic idea,
which is that the mind of man reflects 

91
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:50,121
the mind of God to the extent that you 
can.

92
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:54,530
That not only is,
is I would argue that that extra 

93
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,110
revelation is necessary,
but even if you don't use revelation,

94
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,260
that using your capacity to reason,
you can find a purpose in something 

95
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:00,260
about.

96
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,150
But we ended up at the same place.
Which is the set of values that if you 

97
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,150
actually,
uh,

98
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,930
if you,
if you stray away from this common set 

99
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:08,930
of values,
and I'm talking like the most root level

100
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,930
values,
personal responsibility,

101
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:14,931
free will.
It's your job to be responsible for 

102
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:15,420
members of your family.
It's your job to make good decisions and

103
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,690
responsible decisions and not to blame 
the society around you for failures that

104
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:23,691
you are yourself responsible for.
You can't surpass your own innate 

105
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,720
capacity in,
in,

106
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,560
in terms of you can't expect society to 
make up for your lack of innate capacity

107
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:33,561
in certain areas.
You just have to make the most of what 

108
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:33,561
you have in front of you.
You and I agree on values,

109
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,890
but I think that the source of the 
values,

110
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:37,050
there's going to be a slight 
disagreement on I think.

111
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,690
I think it's okay.
It's a,

112
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,870
it's a.
it's a profound place for disagreement 

113
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,380
because,
and I don't understand how to mediate it

114
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:47,950
exactly because I'm not willing to 
dispense with the metaphysical.

115
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,160
No.
When I did my biblical lectures last 

116
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,080
year,
I called him a psycho psychological 

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,080
approach.
The biblical stories,

118
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,381
right?
Because I wanted to push a secular 

119
00:05:58,381 --> 00:05:58,381
interpretation of scientific

120
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:00,630
interpretation by the stories is just 
not to interrupt.

121
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:03,890
I think that that's supremely useful to 
people specifically because I mean,

122
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,720
despite the fact that I come from a 
religious background,

123
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm trying to make arguments that are 
not religious in orientation.

124
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,070
I never cite to the Bible when I talk 
about values,

125
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,640
for example,
I never site revelation.

126
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,470
It's valuable to me because I think that
that's a good source of the values and I

127
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,330
think that it's an irrelevant source of 
the values,

128
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,270
but it is not the only way to achieve 
those values.

129
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,380
I've never suggested,
for example,

130
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,381
that atheists can be moral or that you 
can be an agnostic and not believe in 

131
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:30,610
Judeo Christian systems.
Revelation and comes to the same exact 

132
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,761
set of values that we're talking about 
now is also a simpler argument to make 

133
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,010
because you constrain the number of 
necessary.

134
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,060
Very exactly.

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,400
But having said that,
I'm not willing to dispense with the 

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,981
metaphysical and I think like,
I think it's an I'm like stretching the 

137
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:48,350
edges of my cognitive ability when I'm 
talking about this sort of thing because

138
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:50,790
I'm in realms that I don't understand 
that it's,

139
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,740
that I just getting vague pictures.
Um,

140
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,360
but I think it's as if there's a,
there's a revelation,

141
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,420
a revelation from evolution that matches
the revelation from above.

142
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,590
The two things come together and,
and I don't under,

143
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,080
I don't understand how that can be 
possible.

144
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,040
I think it has something to do with the 
fundamental nature of consciousness,

145
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,830
which is something we seriously do not 
understand.

146
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,190
And so I can see you can make a straight
biological case for the evolution of 

147
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,571
archetypes.
But I don't think that the biological 

148
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,230
explanation exhausts the archetype.
There's more to it and it,

149
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,350
and what I've learned to and delving 
into these religious stories but also 

150
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,230
into religious experience is that it's 
bottomless.

151
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,590
Like there is a point where as you dig 
into the architectural,

152
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,050
everything turns into one thing.
Biological,

153
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,460
spiritual,
transcendent.

154
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,220
It's all one thing from the top to the 
bottom.

155
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,490
And I think people get intimations of 
that when they have profound 

156
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,100
experiences,
experiences that are generated by music,

157
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,130
for example,
if I love or by sex or there's a variety

158
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:57,131
of ways that they can be.
Anytime you have an experience of 

159
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,070
meaning in your life.
And I can also see that.

160
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,920
And I believe this to be the case is 
that you are,

161
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,330
you're neurologically adapted to a 
universe where meaning is the highest 

162
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:09,650
instinct.
And I mean that technically is that when

163
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:14,651
you're sitting in a situation where 
what's happening around you is 

164
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:15,710
meaningful,
what your nervous system is signaling to

165
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:20,711
you is that you occupy the optimal 
position in the dynamic territory that 

166
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:21,410
you currently inhabit.

167
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,680
And that's,
and that sense of meaning is it's not 

168
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:26,680
just cortical,
it's,

169
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,780
it's way deeper than merely cortical.
And so that's a very exciting.

170
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,140
That's a very exciting discovery.
I would say that I think that because 

171
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,330
again,
in a place where we agree is that 

172
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:39,330
meaning is uncovered.
It's not some,

173
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,780
it's discovered.
It's not something that you're making up

174
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,920
yourself.
And that's why I think it's revealed.

175
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,260
Exactly.
And because we're like happiness.

176
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,330
Exactly.
And I think that one of the reasons 

177
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,031
that,
that the message that we're putting out 

178
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,031
there is,
is making people happier.

179
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,320
Actually,
even though we're both pessimist by 

180
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,320
nature,
I would think a,

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,320
is that what

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,100
we're basically saying is that in this 
land of chaos where you could be 

183
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,400
wandering around with no meaning there 
is a meaning and if you search for it,

184
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,460
you'll find it,
but you have to be open to the concept 

185
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,460
that there is a meaning to be 
discovered.

186
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,540
And if you shut yourself off from that 
by just saying there's no meaning to be 

187
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,331
discovered,
meaning as to be made up by you and you 

188
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:14,340
can just do what you want to have.
A phenomenal thing is just,

189
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,540
it's just something that you 
experienced,

190
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,040
but it's not really real.
That,

191
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,260
that kind of stuff is,
is,

192
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,920
uh,
I think disquieting to people.

193
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:24,780
And so there's something that quiets the
soul that says you have purpose.

194
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,240
And if you don't have purpose,
then maybe it's because you're searching

195
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,670
in the wrong place for that purpose.
That's a possibility.

196
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,800
That's really interesting things that 
you said there because it's like I know 

197
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,960
you guys pretty well at this point and 
this crew of people that were sort of in

198
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,640
when,
when we're off camera,

199
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:42,600
we're actually talking about the exact 
same things like we are live.

200
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,990
Whether this camera was on right now are
off like we're living this thing all the

201
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:50,991
time.
I think I can speak from my own 

202
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,671
experience in this regard.
It's made me a better person and I will 

203
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:53,430
and I'm still striving to be about a 
more authentic,

204
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:54,930
a more honest.
I'm constantly.

205
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,931
I mean I sit in this chair when it's 
over there and look at the person over 

206
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,841
here every week and I actually here and 
I listen and I sit across great minds 

207
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,500
and I go,
wow,

208
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:09,501
I have to reevaluate some of the things 
that I think and sometimes it's because 

209
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,350
I disagree with someone or you know,
and I'm like,

210
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:11,910
they really don't know what they're 
talking about,

211
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,670
but often it's hopefully that I'm 
hearing somebody say some great.

212
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,600
This is what's really interesting.
And I think what's,

213
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,230
what's great about conversations like 
this one is when.

214
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah,
if I have Jordan on my facebook live and

215
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:27,201
I asked him questions or he'll have me 
on his youtube and he's asking 

216
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:27,201
questions,
what we're all really in the business of

217
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:31,611
all of us who are occupying the space is
asking questions or treated as weird 

218
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:32,280
because we're asking the questions.
Right?

219
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,020
If you're actually listening to the 
answers.

220
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,400
Exactly.
Because I always think,

221
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:35,810
well,
you know,

222
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,220
you might have something to tell me.
That's my rule number 11.

223
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:43,221
By the way,
I assume that the person you're 

224
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:43,221
listening to might know something you 
don't,

225
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:43,290
right?
Because then you can,

226
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,320
they can tell you about to you and if 
you learn it then you don't have to run 

227
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,360
face first into a brick wall.
It's really helped.

228
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,380
And then it and from Jewish tradition 
that's deeply embedded in Jewish 

229
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,380
tradition that the wise man is the man 
who learns from every man around him.

230
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,420
And so this idea is,
is,

231
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,290
is what unifies this really disparate 
stream of people.

232
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,230
The three of us people like Sam Harris,
people like Joe Rogan.

233
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,320
I mean like you look at me and Joe Rogan
and what we have in right?

234
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,930
We like asking questions and we will 
actually look like you might be 

235
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:09,930
different species.
Right,

236
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,700
right,
right.

237
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,570
Well,
that's how I found the same thing when I

238
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,460
was on Jocko willink podcast.
It's like,

239
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,000
you know,
we're,

240
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,270
we're very different people,
but that's what's in common is that 

241
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,871
we're able to have a conversation.
We're actually able to have a 

242
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:23,871
conversation and,
and that we're aiming.

243
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:26,100
I think we're,
we're all aiming at making things better

244
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:31,101
rather than worse,
which is also a very important thing to 

245
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:31,530
massively.
One of the things that makes that happen

246
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,850
is the fact that we are,
as you say,

247
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,530
talking about first principles all the 
time.

248
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,690
When people talk at the top of the 
iceberg,

249
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,930
then it's impossible for them to even 
see sometimes that they're actually 

250
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,501
standing on two different icebergs 
rather than they're not seeing the 

251
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:45,501
commonalities of,
of,

252
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,870
and they're not seeing what's different.
Like if I,

253
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,470
if I argue first principles with 
somebody,

254
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,650
then you can see how those first 
principles manifest in political 

255
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:54,650
differences.
The business that I'm in.

256
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,090
Um,
but if you're just arguing about a 

257
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,571
certain political policy without 
examining anything that goes underneath 

258
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:03,421
there,
then you just ended up clubbing each 

259
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,311
other and not even understanding what 
the other person's saying because you 

260
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:05,830
don't understand the set of values that 
deriving those political principles.

261
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:10,030
Part of the problem that we have right 
now in our culture is trying to diagnose

262
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,430
the level at which the discussion should
be taking place.

263
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,670
And I think the reason that this is a 
tumultuous time is because it actually 

264
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,820
is a time for discussion of first 
principles and it's,

265
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,230
it's that first principles are virtually
at the level of theology.

266
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,920
Because first principles are the things 
that you assume and then move forward.

267
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,360
It's like,
well,

268
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:31,330
what should we assume while the dignity 
of the human soul,

269
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,540
but start with that.
You can't treat yourself properly 

270
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:36,880
without assuming that you can't have a 
relationship with another person.

271
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,390
You can't stabilize your family.
You can't have a functional society.

272
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,330
So what does it mean for the human soul 
have dignity?

273
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,570
Well,
the part of the idea is that you're 

274
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,390
participating in creation itself and you
do that with your actions.

275
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:54,391
And your language and you get to decide 
whether you're tilting the world a bit 

276
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:58,050
more towards heaven or a bit more 
towards hell and that's actually what 

277
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,891
you're doing.
So that's a place where the literal and 

278
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:02,350
metaphorical truth come together and 
people are very,

279
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,100
they're terrified of that idea as they 
should be because it's a massive 

280
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,611
responsibility.
It's a massive realization of 

281
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:15,661
responsibility to understand that all 
the decisions that you make during the 

282
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,500
day,
our decisions between Hell and heaven 

283
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,960
essentially.
But I think there is no truer way of 

284
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:21,960
saying that.

285
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,700
So as you guys have both sort of hit the
level that you're at.

286
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:28,701
And I was at the turning point thing 
with you a couple of weeks ago and you 

287
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:29,340
literally came out.
It was like the rolling stones came out.

288
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,200
I mean people.
People were going bananas.

289
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,350
I talked about all my political 
differences with them that we've 

290
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,110
discussed about being pro choice and for
gay marriage.

291
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:38,600
Although they are basically okay with 
that and,

292
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,400
and being pro pot and all that.
And I got a standing ovation.

293
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,030
We did our thing and in Clemson and the 
line for you after,

294
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,890
it was longer than the line for me and I
told you this,

295
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:47,550
but I was like,
man,

296
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:50,190
that makes me want to be better.
I have to.

297
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,930
I wasn't jealous of you.
I was like,

298
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,850
man,
he's doing something great and I have to

299
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:58,851
be better.
So my question for you is this was all 

300
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:02,241
meant to be right.
I mean without going too religious or 

301
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,241
metaphysical,
but the Internet has now allowed all of 

302
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:08,781
the people that were watching television
and seeing pop culture and going 

303
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,100
something is really wrong here.
Something is missing.

304
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,130
The Internet has sort of forced us 
together.

305
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:16,500
I mean that's this,
this growing group is because we're.

306
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,850
It's not because we're all looking for 
it.

307
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,240
It's because we're being forced 
together.

308
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,510
Well,
it's really funny is the way that 

309
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,140
everybody is introduced to our work is,
is the same way,

310
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,850
but it's the way that you wouldn't 
expect.

311
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:31,851
So most people,
I think Jordan originally saw you in a 

312
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:33,090
confrontation with somebody over Trans 
Gender Pronouns.

313
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Right?
And that's how most people began to 

314
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,300
engage and then suddenly you are getting
500,000

315
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,540
views on discussions of biblical stories
from Genesis,

316
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,500
which yeah,
I mean,

317
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,490
let's be frank if,
if,

318
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,890
if the first thing never happens,
those things at 5,000

319
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,460
views,
right?

320
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,320
Then the same thing is true for me,
right?

321
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:51,321
The way that I originally kind of drew 
public attention was because I was on 

322
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,250
piers Morgan's show,
I shall act him on his show.

323
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,820
And so all of a sudden people were now 
listening to hour long lectures about,

324
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,100
about,
you know,

325
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,480
my,
my ideas on philosophy and principles of

326
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,210
the founding fathers.
They came for the scandal and stayed for

327
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,170
the content.
And that's,

328
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:08,171
and that's,
I think the advantage that it takes a 

329
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:08,600
particular skill set for everyone in 
this space to be able to do that.

330
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,910
But that's,
that's the beauty of the,

331
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:15,911
of the youtube moment and over the 
Internet moment is that people are 

332
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:19,001
engaging in the news level.
If you just watch any cable news 

333
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:19,001
channel,
the new cycle is about 30 seconds long.

334
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,200
Then the repeat the headlines again.
Uh,

335
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,980
and so that's the level at which we 
consume,

336
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,130
but if you see every sees the flash 
point for you or the flash point for me 

337
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,581
or the flashpoint for Sam with Ben 
Affleck and one of the flash point for 

338
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:30,581
you with number many of them for you.

339
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:34,170
And then they and then they want more 
and it's the introduction of the,

340
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,190
it's basically the gateway drug.
Like there's a 32nd video that's the 

341
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,651
gateway drug to these hour long lectures
about deeper principles and people and 

342
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:46,181
the reason that the.
And the question is why those 

343
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:46,780
flashpoints flash.
And I think the because what makes those

344
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:51,781
different,
what makes it that people want to see 

345
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:51,781
that and then they go,
okay,

346
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:54,311
now I want to see the rest of their 
content and start streaming tons of 

347
00:15:54,311 --> 00:15:55,720
videos from these folks.
Kathy Newman video is a good example.

348
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,390
So let's get to that in one second.
I want,

349
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,390
I just want to lead that is,
is just that I think it's incongruent.

350
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,790
They see something different and if you 
notice a difference in the society on 

351
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,840
any level,
then you are automatically a pariah and 

352
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,361
an outlier and we all know deep down 
that there are distinctions and 

353
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:13,670
differences to be made logically 
between.

354
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm not even talking about groups of 
people ethnically,

355
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,630
you know,
for some odd reason.

356
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,750
I'm talking about just logical 
distinctions between modes of thought 

357
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,200
and logical distinctions between,
uh,

358
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,720
between certain policies.
And if you,

359
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:29,721
if you are willing to draw distinctions 
instead of just saying that we have to 

360
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:29,721
exist in this morass of identity 
politics,

361
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,840
that's a,
it's a flash in the darkness and people 

362
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:34,840
gravitate toward the light

363
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,660
partly because the problem with the 
problem with rel relativism,

364
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,780
let's say,
let's say that that did produce a 

365
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:43,780
radical state of equality.
Well,

366
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,461
the problem with that is that there's no
up and the problem with there being no 

367
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:48,470
opposite,
there's no hope.

368
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,830
And the problem with that is that people
actually live on hope.

369
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,860
Yes.
So if you flatten out the value 

370
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,291
structure so that there is no 
qualitative differentiation between 

371
00:16:59,291 --> 00:16:59,291
things,
then there's nothing to do.

372
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,910
So that's just not helpful.
And so then you can tell people,

373
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:03,680
look,
make no mistake about it,

374
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,510
there is down.
That's hell,

375
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,480
that's Auschwitz.
That's the gulags like that's down,

376
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,790
that exists,
that exists in your own family.

377
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,090
You can create that with no problem.
And because there's a down like that,

378
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,700
there's also an APP and that APP is 
worth aiming at.

379
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,640
Even though it differentiates people as 
they climb towards it.

380
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,290
It's still,
without that,

381
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,320
you can't have the purpose in your life 
that gives it meaning and nobility in 

382
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,480
the face of suffering.
Well that's a no,

383
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,480
that's interesting because that's why I 
sort of think it's almost like we're all

384
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,500
Frankenstein's monster in a weird way.
If the.

385
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,780
If the mainstream media had been dealing
honestly with the issues of the day,

386
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:41,781
whatever they are,
identity politics are postmodernism or 

387
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:43,620
just the general political discussion,
then I don't think people would react to

388
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:46,140
you guys the way that they do because 
they didn't do their job.

389
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:47,850
But really quickly,
[inaudible] you hit these.

390
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,790
So your more I think were three moments 
and you already hit them.

391
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,560
But just for people that are,
that aren't falling,

392
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:57,561
all this you on piers Morgan basically 
bashing him endlessly with facts over 

393
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:03,561
feelings about guns was one where it was
like this guy from the Internet just 

394
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,620
beat this CNN per person.
How did that happen?

395
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,170
And then I think the one that changed me
more than anything else,

396
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:13,170
everyone knows this already with Sam 
Harris on real time with,

397
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,420
with athletic,
and they got into this stuff about,

398
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,280
about the difference between Muslims and
Islam.

399
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,610
I didn't even know who sam was.
I see this mild mannered neuroscientists

400
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,100
in a nice suit commonly talking about 
Pew statistics.

401
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,600
Next thing you know,
he's gross and racist.

402
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,870
But,
but this is a good segue to yours 

403
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,611
because I think yours is the third one 
and the way that this is just two or 

404
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:31,611
three weeks ago,
uh,

405
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,920
you were on with Kathy Newman on it's 
Canada channel for UK,

406
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,210
UK channel for sorry.
And there is,

407
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,220
I mean,
everyone that's watching this has 

408
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,230
probably seen this already.
If you haven't,

409
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,610
you should go watch it.
But,

410
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,640
but in effect,
basically she tried to make an argument 

411
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,430
that you have heard a good Julian Times 
before,

412
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:55,431
but why does your right to free speech 
supersede a trans person's right to feel

413
00:18:56,461 --> 00:19:01,461
okay with themselves or something.
Even the way she phrased the question 

414
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,260
was a little confused and conflated,
but.

415
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,890
But the reaction to it,
it was your,

416
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,980
your answer was great,
but it was the reaction to regular 

417
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:09,980
people watching at home that we're 
going,

418
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,540
this is nonsense.
This is just abject.

419
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,610
No,
the only thing that's to make it viral 

420
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,200
is the fact that she recognized in the 
moment to what she was saying moment 

421
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,740
where you could see the light go on 
briefly and she just went,

422
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:21,850
wait,
what did I just say?

423
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,830
And there was no escape.
It was pretty.

424
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,890
It was pretty grand.
Yeah.

425
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,910
Well,
the funny thing about her argument is 

426
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,651
that it's Pr was predicated on the idea 
that somehow people have a right to be 

427
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:35,881
comfortable.
It's like that's just not a right you 

428
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:38,200
have in life all the things you can say 
that you don't have a right to in life.

429
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,370
Being comfortable is number one is you 
can offend me right now,

430
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:45,850
so the thing is is if you,
if you're right to be comfortable,

431
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,851
trumps my right to talk,
then I don't get to talk ever because 

432
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,150
I'm going to say things.
If I'm actually talking,

433
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,220
I'm going to say things.
If they're,

434
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,620
if they're profound things,
if they're contentious,

435
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:01,621
things are truthful things,
I'm going to say things that if they 

436
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:02,440
don't disturb you are going to disturb 
you and if they don't disturb you,

437
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:04,270
there's someone that's going to be 
disturbed about them.

438
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:09,271
So what's the answer to that?
Everyone can be comfortable in the 

439
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:12,901
silence,
but that doesn't also doesn't work 

440
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:13,330
because then we can't exchange ideas.
We're not comfortable in the silence.

441
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:15,670
We're isolated and Dan didn't the 
silence,

442
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,220
so it's a completely incoherent 
perspective,

443
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,120
but what does that tell you about just 
the way mainstream media operates?

444
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,150
Because if you even,
even just in this last week when I've 

445
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,731
read some of the pieces about you that I
think are so dishonesty attacking the 

446
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:33,571
way you do things or even there was an 
article about you and it was like Ben 

447
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,530
Shapiro is the cool kids philosopher or 
something,

448
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:36,940
something like that.
Yeah.

449
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:38,860
And it was like,
well wait a minute.

450
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:42,190
When did the cool kid be the smart 
Orthodox Jew?

451
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,740
You know what I mean?
Like,

452
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:42,790
yeah,

453
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,960
how did,
how does that.

454
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,100
But think about that.

455
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,100
And then you've talked,
you've talked about the shit that you 

456
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,100
went through when you were growing up 
and all that stuff and you don't want to

457
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,691
play the regularly,
but I can't imagine exactly the same.

458
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,750
Just like small and noisy,
bad combat,

459
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,590
man.
I could have taken care of both of you.

460
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,390
I always say I was right on the middle 
of sort of like loser and cool.

461
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,820
So like I actually did believe the kids 
below me,

462
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,130
but I was bullied by the guys that were.
I was right there.

463
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,350
And maybe that maybe that keeps the 
world in balance.

464
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,380
There you go.
But this idea that when they write the 

465
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,011
article,
it's the cool kids will ask her even 

466
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:25,081
though obviously you didn't grow up as 
the cool kid or James Demore is a great 

467
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:25,880
one where they write articles about him 
and they'll say the,

468
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,800
the tech Bro.
And it's like if you both have met James

469
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,330
Moore,
he's the shyest.

470
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Quietest decent.
You almost literally have to drag 

471
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,360
sentences.
Yeah.

472
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,610
But,
but he's.

473
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,250
But a spine of steel though.
It's really something.

474
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,210
Yeah.
Fearless.

475
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,850
Despite what his disposition may 
actually be.

476
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,290
But.
But what do you make of that?

477
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,800
The way that they try to frame it.
So they're already trying to undercut,

478
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,290
you know what I mean before it,
before you even say it

479
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,590
is your model.
But I think that they're trying to 

480
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:58,590
impose their own order on the chaos.
It's just the wrong frame.

481
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,730
So that's what happened in the channel 
for interview and it's,

482
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,760
it's sort of,
I was thinking about the model that you 

483
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,801
were describing with regards to your 
position on the iceberg is that Kathy 

484
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:11,461
had staked out a position on the iceberg
and I had staked one out that was way 

485
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:14,320
lower,
way lower and what happened was she kept

486
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:19,321
questioning me at her level of analysis 
and that just wasn't working because 

487
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:21,340
that wasn't the level of analysis at 
which I'm playing.

488
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,350
Well,
and I'm also not playing,

489
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,780
although I'm trying to play,
you know what I mean,

490
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,500
because it's a little bit.
But yeah,

491
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:32,270
I mean I was like wrestling,
you had a lower base of gravity and,

492
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,790
and I think that that gave you an 
advantage and that's partly.

493
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,020
I wasn't trying to win the interview.
Right.

494
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:42,060
You know,
like I and I don't try to win 

495
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,060
interviews.
I'd try to go to an interview and have a

496
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,540
talk and have a discussion and see how 
it goes.

497
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:47,480
And I don't have an agenda except to not
make a catastrophic mistake,

498
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,960
but that's agenda number one.
Don't say anything.

499
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:51,680
Unforgivably stupid.
Yeah.

500
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,530
I think that's the other thing that,
that makes all of this unique is that if

501
00:22:56,531 --> 00:23:01,531
you actually meet any.
I mean we've all met each other in the 

502
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:01,531
circle now because it's really funny how
life works that way.

503
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:06,010
These circles are so small,
but we tell each other and we actually 

504
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,010
talk with each other and all this.

505
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,020
That's what I'm saying.
They're forcing us together.

506
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:07,100
It's not even that we're seeking it,

507
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,890
but it's also that we all have a 
certain.

508
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:14,891
There's a certain baseline personality 
that we all have and that is we enjoy 

509
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:19,271
the discussion.
We actually enjoyed the exchange of 

510
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,480
ideas and so when you're on with Kathy 
Newman and she says stuff that like 

511
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,480
what,
what,

512
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,690
what you were getting from the right 
when the lot was how to even stand this.

513
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,010
How do you understand this interview?
Right?

514
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:28,910
How can you get through half an hour of 
this and you've done it and I've done it

515
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:33,911
too.
And the answer is because I sort of 

516
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:33,911
enjoy it.
I mean this is what you do for a living.

517
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:38,291
Right?
So the idea that I don't enjoy having 

518
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:38,291
conversations,
even with people who don't get it,

519
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:43,001
it's not enjoyable having your views 
radically mischaracterized as he as 

520
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:43,190
Kathy Newman was trying to do to you.
That's irritating,

521
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,340
but I was so over the top.
It was hardly even irritated.

522
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,580
It's mostly kept thinking,
well,

523
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,830
I don't know who you're talking to you,
but it isn't me.

524
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,790
Right?
Exactly,

525
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,650
exactly.
And so because of,

526
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,710
because of that,
that's the most infuriating thing to 

527
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,290
people on,
on the hardcore left and in the media,

528
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,030
because if they can't fit you into that 
frame,

529
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:07,031
it's what you were saying before the 
show started and if they can't fit you 

530
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,640
into this preconceived notion of Russian
nesting doll that they've got for you.

531
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:10,220
If you.
If you don't fit in there,

532
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,370
then they can't do anything with you.
And if you're an open minded person who 

533
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,160
actually likes to hear exchange of ideas
and you're willing to admit that there's

534
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,850
a piece of evidence you may not have 
considered yet,

535
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,770
it's almost impossible to be caught off 
guard.

536
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,730
But these people refuse to acknowledge 
that there's evidence they haven't 

537
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:27,730
considered yet.
Or do they just throw away the evidence?

538
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:32,410
Like if I brought you a piece of 
evidence that country that can do roll 

539
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,410
deed say,
okay,

540
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,630
that either fits in my worldview or it 
doesn't if it doesn't,

541
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:37,631
but it's a real piece of evidence.
Here's how I have to kind of shape and 

542
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:38,510
changed my world view in order to 
accommodate that piece of evidence.

543
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,000
And I think that's what smart and decent
people do.

544
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,240
But at the media is not in that role.
I think that's where Joe show was 

545
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,240
successful is because,
you know,

546
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,890
he's not a classical intellectual.
He talks about ideas a lot.

547
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:51,170
But the thing about joe is he's actually
curious.

548
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,210
He,
when he asks a question and he'd like to

549
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:54,700
know the answer,
you know,

550
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,080
and it's not so that he can demonstrate 
that he's right.

551
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,040
But yeah,
if this viewpoint,

552
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,710
so obviously like everyone does because 
you have to have a viewpoint,

553
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,740
but he does ask the questions he'd like 
to know the answers to and that's that 

554
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,270
and youtube seems to reward that,
so hooray for them when it's also the 

555
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,890
fact that it's a longer forum,
a longer span forum is also a nontrivial

556
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,810
advantage because people can take the 
time to riddick into something.

557
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,870
I didn't think a lot about what makes 
all of these various people have such 

558
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,111
different stripes successful and what I 
realized is that so much of it is just 

559
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:30,551
like in any movie,
it was the reason you watch a movie is 

560
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:30,551
because you know where the movie's going
to end.

561
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:33,911
It's going to end with the movie,
go turning off the screen and then 

562
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:33,911
you're going to leave the theater.
Right?

563
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,120
The every movie ends the same way,
but it's you're there for the journey.

564
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,530
And so when you watch your show,
Dave,

565
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,620
and you're actually trying to pursue 
things and take people along your 

566
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,221
thought journey and when you watch your 
lectures on the Bible and you're 

567
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:48,371
tracking them along a journey,
a journey of exploration and certainly 

568
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:48,980
with Joseph,
joe or Joe is taking you for three hours

569
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,220
through his thought process,
asking questions and going somewhere and

570
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:54,620
even when I'm doing my political show,
my idea is here I'm going to lay out all

571
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:59,621
the evidence and then try and piece it 
together so that we get to a conclusion 

572
00:25:59,621 --> 00:25:59,810
together and you can disagree with any 
step I take along that way,

573
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:03,200
but here's the journey that we're going 
go on so you can follow along with me.

574
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,470
I think what the media do is they just 
go straight from the beginning of the 

575
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,470
movie to the end of the movie with no 
journey and they just go,

576
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,410
okay,
here's the Intro,

577
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,990
right?
Luke Skywalker is on a planet by himself

578
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:16,991
and then you just go straight to the 
Millennium Falcon flying where you're 

579
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:16,991
like,
what?

580
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,310
Just what happened in the middle there 
that why we're we're we then,

581
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,620
or let's say your,
your moment with Kathy,

582
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,840
that we're sort of the glitch in the 
system now.

583
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,920
Like to me that were the undecidable in 
postmodern terms there.

584
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,210
There you go.
That's it.

585
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,920
That,
that,

586
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,000
that's a glitch.
Like if we were watching the matrix,

587
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,560
that's the glitch that you got to the,
to the wasn't on Youtube.

588
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,680
This was on real television.
Not that that even matters more than 

589
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:41,680
this because I think this is the real 
thing now.

590
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,220
But you caused the glitch.
That's

591
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,720
what you did.
You caused the glitch and her.

592
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:47,450
She actually couldn't come up with words
after,

593
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,400
but you actually was actually a glitch 
in the system that then.

594
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,480
Yeah,
well that was aided.

595
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:54,240
Everything else that you're doing isn't 
imposed narrative and I mean,

596
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,510
part of that's a consequence of the 
pathology of the medium,

597
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,570
I would say is that one of the things 
that's really like I stopped watching 

598
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,781
televised news like 25 years ago,
but one of the things that made me stop 

599
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:10,590
was my realization that the newscasters 
would show a politician.

600
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Right.
And then they'd give him like his 10 

601
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,140
seconds or heard her 10 seconds to say 
something.

602
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,390
Then they'd fade out the audio.
Then the newscaster would tell you what 

603
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,150
the person said and what it meant.
And I thought,

604
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,230
oh,
that's not so good.

605
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,000
That's,
that's there's something gone,

606
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,400
gone horribly wrong there.
And I think that's.

607
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,760
It's become more and more like that over
the last 30 years.

608
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,160
Partly I think that's because journalism
itself,

609
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,220
classic journalism is degenerating.
It's becoming a more and more desperate 

610
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,670
game for,
for smaller and smaller stakes.

611
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,490
But Youtube offers something that,
that,

612
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,490
that the traditional broadcasters just 
can't offer.

613
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:47,940
And that's weirdly enough for something 
that started out with cute cat videos.

614
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:52,941
It's actual depth and the capacity to 
have like a three hour conversation 

615
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:53,550
turns out people actually like that.

616
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,160
But that's why I think that youtube are 
particularly interesting cases because I

617
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,680
view you as sort of like a pure 
political beast.

618
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:01,570
And yet you've.
Because of all of this,

619
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:06,571
you now talk about religion.
I think more than probably you 

620
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:07,120
inherently want to perhaps or all of 
these other things.

621
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:12,121
And you as a clinical psychologist.
But that's where you really started and 

622
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:13,330
now you end up talking about politics 
all the time.

623
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,510
So again,
this is why we all sort of got forced 

624
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:18,510
into this,
into this space.

625
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,280
In the end,
we ended up in the same framework to the

626
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,420
ancient Greeks ended up in,
right?

627
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:26,421
They would all write a book on ethics 
and they'd write one on politics and 

628
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:26,910
then he would write one on,
on the pilot and it all comes together.

629
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:29,520
I mean if there is no such thing as 
apolitical,

630
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,730
but by the same token,
there's no such thing as a ethical 

631
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:34,730
right.
I mean if you're,

632
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,091
if you,
if you are operating in the sphere of 

633
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:38,091
politics,
you are going to end up.

634
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,380
If you dig deep enough in the same 
waters that Jordan is used to being.

635
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,130
And if Jordan elevates,
you know,

636
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:47,131
up on that chain far enough,
he's going to end up in these sphere 

637
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:49,491
where I'm used to operating.
Which is why there are videos of you 

638
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:50,210
talking to transgender people about 
about Pronoun use a.

639
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,200
What happened

640
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,720
to me,
I think was that like I was operating at

641
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:57,370
a,
let's call it a psychological level or a

642
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,440
level of,
of,

643
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,630
of archetypal story essentially,
and then the political intervened in 

644
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:06,740
that and said,
I'm going to interfere with your freedom

645
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:07,940
of speech.
It's like,

646
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,550
no,
that's not happening.

647
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,350
I know where that goes.
Well,

648
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:17,351
and then of course one of the scandals 
that emerged out of that this year was 

649
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:18,890
the scandal of Lindsay Shepherd at 
Wilfrid laurier university,

650
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:21,530
which was the biggest scandal that ever 
hit a Canadian university,

651
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:22,790
and it was like,
how do I,

652
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,510
in my most pessimistic prognostications 
about the consequences of bill 

653
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,600
[inaudible].
I didn't envision the inquisition of 

654
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,110
Lindsay Shepherd and so thank you very 
much.

655
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:37,790
Postmodernists for making that manifest.
So clearly is in the room.

656
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:39,230
So if you.
Can you tell that story?

657
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,940
Well,
there was a teaching.

658
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,790
They a great episode on the Rubin 
Report.

659
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,450
You should.
Yeah.

660
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,470
Well she's quite the creature.
She's a.

661
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,570
They picked what?
They messed with the wrong girl when 

662
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,501
they went after her,
but she was in the communications 

663
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:52,501
department at Wilfrid laurier university
in Canada,

664
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,630
and she had the temerity to show a five 
minute clip of me debating the 

665
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,120
biological reality of gender,
let's say with a professor,

666
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:01,870
Nicolas,
Matt,

667
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:06,871
who famously claimed that there were no 
biological differences between men and 

668
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,320
women and that was the scientific 
consensus for the last four decades.

669
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
She showed a five minute clip to her 
class while and hypothetically someone 

670
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,181
complained,
although it turned out that no one 

671
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:19,981
really did and that was brought to the 
attention of her professors and to an 

672
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:21,700
administrator named Andrea Joel who was 
basically hired as a,

673
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,970
you know,
a as an inquisition I would say by the 

674
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,350
university under legislative pressure.
And they raked her over the coals for an

675
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,490
hour and she taped it and she made it 
public and it's,

676
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:33,760
it,
it,

677
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,630
it was a tape in which they compared.
They said that playing a,

678
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,020
a video of me debating pronouns was 
neutrally because she said she did it 

679
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,740
neutrally and there's no reason to 
disbelieve her.

680
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,890
Was tantamount to playing a video by 
Hitler neutrally or Milo Yiannopoulos 

681
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,630
has been there.
The radical leftists are so clueless 

682
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,010
that they can't even get their insults 
right.

683
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,700
So I'm not Milo Yiannopoulos or Hitler.
Sorry.

684
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,750
It's one or the other and I've been in 
this building.

685
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,860
This building has some people at it.

686
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,970
Yeah,
I mean even right now we know that 

687
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,000
someone's going to write about this and 
write that this was the gathering of the

688
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,520
alt right and all that other nonsense,
but in a weird way,

689
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:18,521
do we owe the potter.
Postmodern is some thanks then because 

690
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:18,521
if you think about it,
they took,

691
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,470
they forced someone like Lindsay to be 
public now and I and I think she's 

692
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,891
wonderful as you know,
just the tremendous intellect and Bret 

693
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:27,320
Weinstein,
right?

694
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:28,640
Like all the,
all of these people,

695
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:29,540
you guys,
me,

696
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:34,541
I mean everyone out of the James Damore.
I mean he only is someone now with 

697
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,920
influence because they forced him to 
address these issues.

698
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,730
So in an odd way we owed them.
I mean,

699
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,510
for,
for all the complaining that we might do

700
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:46,511
about these people,
we owe them because they've sharpened 

701
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:49,150
not only,
they've not only sharpened us 

702
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,621
intellectually,
but I think they've allowed all these 

703
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:50,621
other people to wake up.

704
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:54,950
Monitors had a point like the point is 
is that the world is susceptible to a 

705
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,790
near infinite number of interpretations 
that happens to be true.

706
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,040
That's why developing artificial 
intelligence,

707
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,860
especially perceptual systems,
has turned out to be so difficult.

708
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:08,890
It's very,
very difficult to perceive the world 

709
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,171
because you can categorize it in 
literally in a near infinite number of 

710
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:11,330
ways.
Okay,

711
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,890
and then the next plane was.
Well,

712
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,790
it's very difficult to rank order those 
ways in terms of quality.

713
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,540
It's like,
yeah,

714
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:20,240
that is very difficult,
but then they pushed it too far.

715
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,330
Therefore,
there are no qualitative distinctions 

716
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,800
between loads of interpretation.
It's interpretation all the way down.

717
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:27,400
It's like,
no,

718
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,420
no

719
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,630
good,
good point.

720
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:34,590
Hard to disagree with,
but fundamentally wrong.

721
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,560
There's a finite set of viable 
interpretations.

722
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,220
Well,
the layman's term for that would be that

723
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,870
some things are real,
right?

724
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:43,310
I mean is that the simplest way to say 
it?

725
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,920
There are some things that actually are 
real.

726
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,540
I think that's,
that's,

727
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,600
that's one objection.
Another objection is there are some 

728
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,840
modes of being that lead you to 
perdition very,

729
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,870
very rapidly and that's.
And that isn't somewhere being human 

730
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:03,070
that you actually want to go.
So there's the material reality that's 

731
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,650
outside the interpretive framework,
you know,

732
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,770
but then there's an ethical reality that
isn't material and the same simple 

733
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,731
sense,
but there's an ethical reality that's 

734
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:13,070
also not merely a matter of 
interpretation.

735
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,140
I mean,
the best example of that I know is Jaak 

736
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Panksepp,
Jaak Panksepp work with rats.

737
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,600
I mean there's lots of models of this 
and the animal kingdom,

738
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:24,620
but that this one is particularly good.
So juvenile rats like to wrestle.

739
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,640
So if you pair two wraps together,
two males,

740
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,670
because they particularly liked to 
wrestle and one of them's 10 percent 

741
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,041
bigger than the other one with the 10 
percent weight advantage can pin the 

742
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:36,041
little one can consistently.

743
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,300
Okay,
so you say you pair them once,

744
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,160
they'll work to do this because they 
enjoy it.

745
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,650
The big one pins,
he wins.

746
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,540
Now he's the dominant rap.
You think?

747
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,250
Well,
there's dominance among rats.

748
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,580
Yeah,
except that isn't how it works because 

749
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,810
rats in the wild live in social groups 
and they'll play with each other,

750
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:58,811
continually cross many games.
So then let's say you pair the two 

751
00:33:58,811 --> 00:33:58,910
routes together constantly.
Okay.

752
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,920
After the first bout the little rat,
the loser has to invite the big route to

753
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:04,940
play.
That's the rule.

754
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,700
So he does his little play and the big 
rep thinks,

755
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,420
yeah,
yeah,

756
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,290
okay.
I'll play.

757
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,680
If you pair them repeatedly,
unless the big rat lets the little rat 

758
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,640
win 30 percent of the time the little 
rat will start playing with them.

759
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,680
I read that.
It just blew me away.

760
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,430
I thought,
wow,

761
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:24,431
look at that in rats,
which have been used as a model for 

762
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:28,040
human behavior for psychologists for 
like 100 years in rats.

763
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:33,080
There's an emergent ethic of fairplay 
that emerges across iterated games.

764
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:34,220
It's like,
really?

765
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,760
It's mindboggling,
so we could use that.

766
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:41,761
That would be an example of like when 
I'm playing basketball with my eight 

767
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:44,561
year old nephew,
I occasionally let him live because I 

768
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:46,370
want to because he needs that reward 
going if I just beat him mercilessly and

769
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,240
if you're good,
you let him.

770
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,550
When when he does something particularly
spectacular,

771
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,270
right?
You push them.

772
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,480
There's this thing called the zone of 
proximal development and it turns out 

773
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,190
that adults speak to children naturally 
at a level.

774
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,350
It's slightly above their level of 
comprehension,

775
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,680
so that's the meaning zone essentially,
and so you keep the kid there because 

776
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,341
the kid can talk but also learn at the 
same time and if you're really playing 

777
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,911
well with your eight year old nephew,
you're gonna let him win when he's 

778
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,360
pushing himself a little harder than you
normally would and you think,

779
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:18,320
well that's he is winning when he's 
doing that and so you want to set up the

780
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:21,860
game to reward it,
and that's an ethic that transcends mere

781
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,090
interpretation.
It's not.

782
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,850
It doesn't only apply to human beings.
It applies.

783
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,670
And Frans de Waal who studied 
chimpanzee's,

784
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:33,671
he's found quite clearly that it isn't 
the most tyrannical chimp who stays on 

785
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:37,770
top because the chimp tyrant who has no 
friends who does know mutual grooming,

786
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:38,190
who's not

787
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,190
reciprocal,
it's like he has an off day and two of 

788
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,101
his enemies tear him to pieces.
So the tyrant champ sits atop a very 

789
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:48,300
unstable hierarchy.
And so I've thought to,

790
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,660
in the West,
we don't have dominance hierarchies,

791
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,250
we have competence hierarchies and those
are completely different and you have to

792
00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:01,251
be a good player,
have iterated games to maintain your 

793
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:04,911
position in a competence hierarchy.
And that's the beginnings of a 

794
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:05,670
discussion about something like a 
fundamental ethic.

795
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,910
So That's interesting.
I think I can segue this too,

796
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:11,750
a little bit of the way that some of the
media deals with you is that you,

797
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:14,660
because you are fact based,
you talk fast,

798
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,690
you don't care.
I mean you genuinely don't care about 

799
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,331
people's feelings.
I know you pretty well now you don't 

800
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:23,420
that they don't.
Maybe your wife,

801
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,450
but they don't know how to respond to 
that then because they're used to 

802
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,590
dealing in a realm that is all about 
that.

803
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,250
So now you come out and you're like,
no,

804
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:32,490
no,
no,

805
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,770
no.
This is the way it is.

806
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,040
I'll debate you,
but you're not gonna beat me just 

807
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,940
because you happen to be gay or a woman 
or whatever else it is,

808
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,530
and I think actually now that's a lot of
the reason of your your surge.

809
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,040
I think that most people at root level 
don't actually want to think of 

810
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,760
themselves as their group identity 
first.

811
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:56,761
I think most people would want to be 
respected on an individual level and so 

812
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,250
when I say in order for you to be 
respected on an individual level,

813
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:59,440
that means that I'm not going to respect
you on the group level.

814
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,420
Meaning I'm not your group.
Identity doesn't mean anything to me.

815
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,420
Your individual identity means 
everything to me,

816
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:06,040
but your group identity means nothing to
me.

817
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,310
And when I say individual identity,
I don't mean how you identify,

818
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,170
you know,
in terms of race or gender.

819
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:12,760
I mean,
in terms of your thoughts,

820
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,620
are your thoughts interesting,
are they right,

821
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,680
are they wrong,
and they're either right or they're 

822
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:19,680
wrong and they're interesting or they're
not,

823
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,770
and that doesn't change based on who's 
saying it and if we could all get there,

824
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,050
I think that that's what people find 
appealing is that if you can get there,

825
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:25,000
then you can actually have a discussion 
about ideas.

826
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,180
If not,
then you're just going to retreat into 

827
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,180
your identity and there's no way for me 
to have a discussion with you.

828
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,931
I mean I just had a talk at Yukon and 
one of the students got up and was 

829
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,680
talking about abortion.
Then she said,

830
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,630
you know,
I,

831
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,850
I would never have an abortion,
but you as a white privileged male,

832
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,130
how could you talk about abortion?
And I said,

833
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:43,990
because right is right and wrong is 
wrong.

834
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:46,480
Regardless of whether I am a white 
privileged male.

835
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,490
I mean that's the basis for western 
civilization.

836
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,370
Otherwise we can't have.
We can't have a conversation.

837
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,460
Then what happens if we can't have a 
conversation across groups and we just 

838
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,410
fight for dominance.
That's exactly well that,

839
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,390
and that's the postmodern worldview.
That's all we're doing.

840
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,800
It's like,
fine,

841
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:04,960
but like you're,
you're,

842
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,010
you're opening the door to the radical 
right wingers because they're going to 

843
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,010
come in and say,
okay,

844
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,010
no problem.

845
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,850
We'll play identity politics,
but I'm not losing.

846
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,380
How's that?
Right.

847
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,950
Well,
that isn't the way you're supposed to 

848
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:19,950
play.
You're supposed to be guilty.

849
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:19,950
It's like,
no,

850
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:19,950
sorry,
I'm not going to be guilty.

851
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,340
I'm just going to be dominant.
Exactly.

852
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:26,341
This is the danger of the actual 
outright because with the own right is 

853
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:26,341
reactionary identity,
politics,

854
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:31,051
movements and left doesn't want to 
acknowledge its own role in helping to 

855
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:31,051
drive the,
the emergence of,

856
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:32,120
of a reaction or identity politics 
movement,

857
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,170
which by the way,
I find despicable because I think all 

858
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:37,170
identity politics,
movements,

859
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:37,170
artists,
exactly

860
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,560
what I think,
right or left.

861
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,590
I did a year of shows on if the left 
doesn't clean them when I was still 

862
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,660
saying I'm on the left.
If we don't clean up our house,

863
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:47,420
what is going to happen and look what 
has happened.

864
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,330
So shifting slightly a little bit,
I thought this would be interesting.

865
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Is there a criticism,
actually I'll start with you for using 

866
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,971
this one.
Is there a criticism of you that you 

867
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:57,971
think is the most legit?

868
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,800
No criticism of me?
You know,

869
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,000
I,
I think that

870
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,350
the,

871
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,620
the criticism of me that I think is 
legit is one that I think is probably 

872
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:12,620
common to most people,
which is I,

873
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,240
I tend to fall into confirmation bias,
which is true for everybody.

874
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,050
Uh,
so,

875
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,220
you know,
I think that,

876
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,420
but it,
you know,

877
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:23,421
when you're in the political realm,
the easiest thing to do is to find 

878
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:26,091
evidence that supports your position and
Cherry pick the evidence in order to 

879
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:28,461
support that position.
And so if the idea is that I tend to do 

880
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:29,340
that,
I try to fight that,

881
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,150
but I'll acknowledge that that's a flaw,
that I have a,

882
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,630
that you know,
when you're,

883
00:39:33,631 --> 00:39:35,400
when you're invested in a political 
fight,

884
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,700
that the easy that,
that your easiest mode of confrontation 

885
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,031
is to find stuff that supports what you 
already think as opposed to taking in 

886
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:47,780
all of the available evidence and then 
shifting every point as we were talking 

887
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:47,780
about before,
uh,

888
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:47,780
toward the,
toward the right position.

889
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,070
Uh,
it's because I think it is a weakness.

890
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:55,071
It's something that I,
that I tried to fight as often as 

891
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:55,071
possible.
And uh,

892
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:55,071
I tried to make provision for that.

893
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,100
So,
so before I ask you yours,

894
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,880
um,
what,

895
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:58,720
what,
what do I think,

896
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,800
what do you,
what do you think,

897
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,590
what do you think is wrong in the band?
And B,

898
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,500
what do you think is psychologically the
best way to deal with that?

899
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,760
To be,
to be aware,

900
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:09,520
right?
You're being aware of what your issues,

901
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,440
limitations are,
what your biases might be,

902
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,570
psychologically,
what's the best way to

903
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,830
yourself with competent people who,
who have their areas of expertise that 

904
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,430
aren't yours and to listen to them,
you know,

905
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:22,590
and that's.
That's helped me over the last 15 months

906
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,360
because I've had about 10 people around 
me,

907
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,000
five of them are family members,
about five of them were friends who were

908
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:32,001
extraordinarily competent people and 
they go over what I've been doing and 

909
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,270
they don't pull any punches.
This feelings thing,

910
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,420
this is something I'd like to spring to 
your defense about because the rule if 

911
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,900
you don't have an ethic is don't hurt 
anyone's feelings.

912
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,470
It's like,
okay,

913
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,660
but which feelings do you mean?
What do you mean?

914
00:40:42,661 --> 00:40:47,661
Like this seconds,
feelings or do you mean the person's 

915
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:49,530
wellbeing across a year?
Because lots of times when you're having

916
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,860
a firm discussion with someone that 
upsets them in the present.

917
00:40:52,861 --> 00:40:55,140
This happens with children all the time,
is you're.

918
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,240
You're not taking stock of their 
feelings at the moment except insofar as

919
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:05,241
you have to because you want to help 
prevent them from cascading into 

920
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:06,120
catastrophe.
For the rest of their life,

921
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,630
it's like,
well,

922
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:11,631
I'm going to discipline you,
right and I'm going to tell you why you 

923
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,791
were wrong.
We're going to have a hard conversation 

924
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,680
because if you keep that up,
your life is going to be a never ending 

925
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:15,680
stream of misery.
Well,

926
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,881
that's not cruel and so,
but because people don't see the ethic 

927
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,530
of iterated games,
let's say something like that.

928
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,220
They say,
well,

929
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:25,260
you just shouldn't hurt anybody's 
feelings in the moment.

930
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:27,540
It's like,
no.

931
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,740
Well,
this is why I think both you and I 

932
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:32,740
object to the whole idea of the pleasure
pain matrix being the,

933
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,250
the,
the thing that matters

934
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,250
in terms of human happiness and because 
the bottom line is that you may be 

935
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:39,710
experiencing a good deal of pain right 
now,

936
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,350
but that's going to lead to a more 
fulfilled life.

937
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,380
That's the utility of sacrifice because 
everyone knows that give up something 

938
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,430
now in a rather painful way and you may 
benefit in the future.

939
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,360
Yeah,
the pain,

940
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,410
the pain pleasures ethic doesn't work 
because of the problem of time.

941
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,610
Exactly on time and other people.
That's another reason that doesn't work.

942
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,480
So it's,
yeah,

943
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,850
you need a way more sophisticated 
solution to that.

944
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,130
So.
So now let's turn that question to you.

945
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,640
What do you think is the most legit 
criticism that you see?

946
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,820
Because I see a lot of blue check,
you know,

947
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,390
twitter,
people with 5,000

948
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,770
followers just attacking.
Yeah.

949
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,400
Very rarely about your idea though.
They'll just make up something.

950
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,950
Jordan Peterson says dogs are blue and 
green,

951
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
uh,
at somebody.

952
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,850
Somebody basically did that and I 
invited him on the show to talk to you.

953
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:27,851
And then of course he disappeared for I 
would say I have some problem with mood 

954
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:27,851
regulation,
you know?

955
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:30,260
And so sometimes I'm more irritable than
I should be.

956
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,260
Sometimes I'm more,
I'm,

957
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,770
I come across.
Well,

958
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:37,850
no,
I probably am more angry than is optimal

959
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,410
in the circumstance,
you know,

960
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:44,550
I mean,
one of the rules of English common law 

961
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,601
for example,
is that you're more or less allowed to 

962
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:46,820
defend yourself with minimum necessary 
force.

963
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:52,090
And I've had to practice and practice 
and practice to use the minimum 

964
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,920
necessary for if you really want to hit 
him right now.

965
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,830
Like that is the temptation.
I mean,

966
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,050
I think we all struggle with that.
I mean there's certain times or somebody

967
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:00,830
says something to say,
Oh,

968
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:01,820
I just,
oh,

969
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,310
I mean it's there,
there's certain questions that get asked

970
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:08,150
and it's just a slow pitch softball 
right down the center of the plate.

971
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,530
It's like,
do I need to,

972
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,570
do I need to hit this soft ball as hard 
as I possibly can,

973
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,770
especially rough if you have a sense of 
humor too.

974
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,620
But,
but it's,

975
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,010
it's really useful.
And I have learned this.

976
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:26,810
It's really useful to not defend 
yourself to vociferously,

977
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,960
which is weird because you'd think,
well you have the right to defend 

978
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:31,960
yourself.
Like no all,

979
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,090
no holds barred.
It's like,

980
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:33,630
no,
actually doesn't work that way,

981
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,430
that you have to defend yourself with 
minimal necessary force.

982
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,460
And I think I managed that in the 
channel for interview,

983
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:41,310
for Shank.
Go on.

984
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Believe me.
People have been talking to me about 

985
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,361
that nonstop for 15 months and I'm 
listening and it wouldn't work as well 

986
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,440
if he hadn't done that or if he just 
shall actor.

987
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:56,990
If he just gotten right at her and said,
what you are saying is so stupid for 

988
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,100
these five reasons,
it would.

989
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,140
It would have been bad I think.
I think the fact that you sat there and 

990
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,140
he just said,
no,

991
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,551
you're asking good questions and you 
know the fact that you're asking good 

992
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:06,560
questions demonstrates the invalidity of
your entire field.

993
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,370
That that was much more effective.
Right.

994
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Well,
and that's one of the things I've been 

995
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,511
meditating on for the last years.
There's a line in the new testament 

996
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:16,511
says,
resist not evil.

997
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,260
I think,
okay,

998
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,460
what?
Okay,

999
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:23,470
what the hell you're supposed to apply.
It's like because it's really a 

1000
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,101
difficult thing to figure out.
You really mean that you don't resist 

1001
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:27,101
evil.
Well,

1002
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:31,130
there's a couple of problems is if you 
punch back then you have a fight.

1003
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
Well,
but you can't just not defend yourself 

1004
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,581
like weekly.
You can't be weak and not defend 

1005
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:42,831
yourself,
but you can be strong and defend 

1006
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:44,340
yourself minimally,
and that's a real art.

1007
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:46,830
Like that's,
that's the essence of sophistication.

1008
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:48,930
I would say.
Like I'm not,

1009
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:50,910
you know,
I come from kind of a rough place.

1010
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,250
I'm coming from northern Alberta.
I come from the frontier,

1011
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:58,251
you know,
and my town was scraped out of the 

1012
00:44:58,251 --> 00:44:58,251
bloody prairie 50 years before people 
move before,

1013
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:00,090
before I lived there.
And so,

1014
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,890
uh,
it's,

1015
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,980
it's been an,
it's been a continual challenge to 

1016
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,280
adjust my sophistication to the level of
challenge and I've,

1017
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,600
I'm trying to do that.

1018
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,830
Do you think that.
I don't always manage it.

1019
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,180
Yeah.
So to that point,

1020
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:21,181
do you think that we sometimes actually 
at a deep level use identity politics 

1021
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:23,620
against ourselves in,
in this regard?

1022
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:27,880
So you're sitting across from Kathy,
she's female at some level.

1023
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:30,820
Do you think you may be moderated it 
because of that?

1024
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:34,480
Because had it been a male and you talk 
about this often,

1025
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:39,481
that we have to act differently towards 
males and females and there's a 

1026
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:42,181
physical.
There's physical reasons for that and 

1027
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:42,181
biological reasons for that,
but that had she been a male,

1028
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,750
say,
say the same exact age from you,

1029
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:48,751
from Alberta and all of that,
that perhaps your response might have 

1030
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,780
been a little more forceful even though 
you're.

1031
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,030
We're all agreeing your response was 
done correctly and even handedly.

1032
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,300
Yeah.
Well,

1033
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,830
I.
it's hard to say,

1034
00:45:57,831 --> 00:46:00,900
but probably yes.
That's interesting.

1035
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,030
Well,
because you like,

1036
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,420
I can't.
I don't think that you can say that you 

1037
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,600
fight with a woman the same way that you
fight with a man.

1038
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,750
That doesn't mean you can't fight with a
woman.

1039
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,770
Doesn't mean you shouldn't,
but I don't think the rules are the 

1040
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:15,770
same.
Now,

1041
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:16,220
why are the rules different?
Well,

1042
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:19,340
some of the rules are,
there's a physical limit.

1043
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,800
It's much more stringent,
right?

1044
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,860
I mean there's a level of hinting out 
physical threat that you can bring to 

1045
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:32,981
bear in a conversation between men that 
you cannot bring to bear in a 

1046
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:33,890
conversation with a woman.
So,

1047
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,070
and the mechanics of that are very,
very subtle and difficult and it's 

1048
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:43,421
especially challenging in an 
intellectual discussion because an 

1049
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:47,291
intellectual discussion is a kind of war
and it isn't obvious how men and women 

1050
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,380
should go to war with one another.
We don't know.

1051
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,060
We don't know how to sort that out.
You.

1052
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:56,260
My sense has been on the panels that 
I've done is that I definitely have to 

1053
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,800
pull my punches.
If I'm on a panel with women,

1054
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,950
that doesn't mean that I don't.
It doesn't mean that it's any less 

1055
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,670
challenging intellectually,
but the strategy and the attitude has to

1056
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:12,671
be different.
It's much more likely that you'll be 

1057
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:16,511
seen as a bully if you bring the same 
force to bear on a female opponent as 

1058
00:47:16,511 --> 00:47:18,080
you would on a male opponent.

1059
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,780
Yeah.
So I'm wondering if Hillary Clinton is a

1060
00:47:20,781 --> 00:47:22,460
perfect example of this in the political
sphere.

1061
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:27,461
You,
Rebecca [inaudible] and hilary was 

1062
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:27,461
running for Senate in New York and 
riskalyze.

1063
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:30,570
Lazio walk across the stage and asked 
her to sign a piece of paper and like 

1064
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:30,570
them

1065
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:31,960
headlines where they basically assaulted
her.

1066
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,060
Right?
Or if Rick Lazio had walked across stage

1067
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,440
another man,
it's said sentence piece of paper,

1068
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:40,441
but like,
what a tough guy look at that he's 

1069
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:40,441
willing to stand up to him.

1070
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,950
So I suspect in that case your answer to
this question is no.

1071
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:46,951
You would treat people the same if,
if Piers Morgan that night had been 

1072
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:47,170
female,
you would have done the exact same.

1073
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,250
Well,
I mean I was,

1074
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:49,840
I was actually relatively polite to 
peers.

1075
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,710
So it's uh,
it's,

1076
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,970
it,
to me,

1077
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:54,430
it's,
I try to be as polite as possible unless

1078
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:58,180
the person is being very impolite,
in which case I'm happy to go employed.

1079
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,800
So I,
I tried to,

1080
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,200
instead of trying to gauge sort of the,
uh,

1081
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:07,490
we're doing the same thing just from 
different directions instead of trying 

1082
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,580
to determine how I engage with the 
person by all of the various,

1083
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,610
you know,
I,

1084
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,480
I let them take the first punch.
Basically you take the first step in the

1085
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:15,360
waltz and then I'll respond in kind.
So if you,

1086
00:48:15,361 --> 00:48:20,361
if you wanna if you wanna act polite,
that I'm happy to act polite with you 

1087
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:21,790
and I'm happy to have a nice cordial 
conversation.

1088
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:24,280
If you want to get nasty then we'll get 
nasty and we'll do that.

1089
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:29,281
And I prep for interviews.
So I'm happy if you want to go into 

1090
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:29,281
mine,
I'm happy to go to the mind.

1091
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:29,281
We can do that.

1092
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:33,620
Yeah.
So I want to circle back to something 

1093
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:33,780
related to religion that we,
that I wanted to get to earlier,

1094
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:35,820
but we're,
we're doing a lot here.

1095
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:41,110
Um,
do you think there's any difference or 

1096
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:41,110
do you both think there's any 
difference?

1097
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:45,470
Ben's belief in Ben's Jewish and your 
belief is Christian comes from the 

1098
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,250
Christian tradition.
Yeah.

1099
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,180
Does that matter at hall?
Whatever differences there are in that 

1100
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,600
little place where you're both saying,
you know,

1101
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,700
we see the reasons why our morals and 
ethics and all that come from this 

1102
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:58,700
world.
So acknowledging,

1103
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,460
uh,
you know,

1104
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:04,461
the,
the real world and biology and all of 

1105
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:04,950
those things,
whatever differences you may have,

1106
00:49:04,951 --> 00:49:09,951
which I don't even know that we,
that any of the three of us know what 

1107
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:09,951
those differences are.
Do they even matter?

1108
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:11,060
They might.
All right.

1109
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,650
That would be a lovely.
I'd love to figure out if there are,

1110
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:14,870
if there are.
I mean it depends.

1111
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,000
For me,
it depends on the brand of religion that

1112
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:19,400
a person is,
is espousing.

1113
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,430
So,
so let's just,

1114
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:21,860
let's just do this with youtube.

1115
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,850
I mean,
so my,

1116
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,750
my feeling,
and I'm writing a book on this right now

1117
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:26,890
actually,
so I,

1118
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,950
I,
there are certain principles that 

1119
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,691
obviously under the Christianity that 
are from the Judaic tradition and that 

1120
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:35,140
clearly the first manifestation of the 
prophetic tradition.

1121
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,260
Exactly.
I mean it's,

1122
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:41,270
it's,
it's essentially an attempt to merge 

1123
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,270
Jerusalem with Athens is,
is I think the,

1124
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:46,000
the book of John is the most obvious 
example of using the logo says as sort 

1125
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,080
of the unifying feature and writing the 
whole thing in Greek.

1126
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:47,870
Right?
I mean that was not the,

1127
00:49:47,871 --> 00:49:48,610
the,
the,

1128
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,180
the Lingua Franca of the time.
That was not what people were speaking,

1129
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,830
excepted and educated circles.
So I'm all the Judaic principles,

1130
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,240
things like a god involved in history,
a god who cares about individuals,

1131
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:06,410
uh,
the notion that you have a choice 

1132
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:06,410
between good and evil,
so choose good,

1133
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,010
uh,
and that and so that you will live long 

1134
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,010
on the earth,
right?

1135
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,010
The,
all these things were taken forward into

1136
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,920
Christianity.
The major distinctions in terms of,

1137
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:15,370
of Christianity versus Judaism are the 
idea that,

1138
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,540
and again,
it depends on your interpretation of 

1139
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,141
Christianity.
Early Christianity sort of suggested 

1140
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:23,821
that history had ended with Christ and 
then in later kind of iterations of 

1141
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:24,850
Christianity that was moved beyond,
right?

1142
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:29,851
It wasn't that history had ended,
it was that Christ come back when 

1143
00:50:29,851 --> 00:50:29,851
history had reached its logical 
progression.

1144
00:50:29,851 --> 00:50:32,360
The progression of history didn't end,
but original messianism was,

1145
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:33,690
this is the Messiah were done,
right?

1146
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:35,570
History is over.
It was a millennialist religion.

1147
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:40,850
It depends on.
Every few people think that that's 

1148
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,791
right.
So this is why I'm trying to 

1149
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:42,791
distinguish,
you know,

1150
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,040
brands of Christianity,
because obviously there are serious 

1151
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,490
differences even in basic root level 
between Catholicism and calvinism.

1152
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,740
And lutheranism and all these things 
have different iterations.

1153
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,850
So you know,
my very strong belief in freewill and my

1154
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:57,851
actual building of a moral system in 
Judaism is building moral system on the 

1155
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:58,580
notion of free will obviously runs 
directly counter to,

1156
00:50:58,581 --> 00:50:59,480
for example,
calvinism.

1157
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,190
Calvinism suggest that freewill is a,
is a miracle and there's no basis for it

1158
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:09,191
and uh,
that God grants you grace based on what 

1159
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,861
he wants to do.
So it depends on the brand of 

1160
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:14,051
Christianity.
But I think that overall the conflict 

1161
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,920
between Christianity and Judaism in 
large measure is,

1162
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,580
especially in the early conflict,
was political rather than ideological 

1163
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,931
and a lot of ways it was a new religion 
attempting to establish its own footing 

1164
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:29,711
and was angry that,
that Jews would not join this new 

1165
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,620
religion and leave behind tradition.
I think that there are certain ways in 

1166
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,950
which Christianity,
you know,

1167
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,990
like for example,
the,

1168
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,610
the main distinction between 
Christianity,

1169
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:41,630
Judaism,
the people usually make is that 

1170
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:41,630
Christianity is a great space.
Religion and Judaism is a religion.

1171
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,610
Meaning the Judaism says you sort of 
earn your way into heaven,

1172
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,560
right?
You earn your way toward a better life,

1173
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,640
uh,
and,

1174
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,150
and Christianity says,
if you believe right,

1175
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,120
I am the way,
the truth and the life.

1176
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,320
If you believe,
then you're good.

1177
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,940
But the truth is that Christianity sort 
of back doors,

1178
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,100
the,
the Judaic view by saying,

1179
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:03,250
if you really do believe,
then you're going to act in these 

1180
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,261
particular ways to demonstrate your.
There's this weird paradoxical 

1181
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:07,040
relationship between the idea of belief 
in Christianity,

1182
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:12,041
the belief that that Christ came to save
everyone from their sins and that all 

1183
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:12,950
you have to do is admit that and you're 
redeemed.

1184
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,220
Like there's symbolic truth to that.
That would take a long time to unpack,

1185
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:21,490
but there's also an injunction goes 
along with that to imitate Christ in 

1186
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:21,490
your life.
Exactly.

1187
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,230
I feel like a lot of these distinctions 
are almost,

1188
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,140
some of them are almost a little false.
I mean,

1189
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:32,141
meaning that they're,
they're either a Christian misreads of 

1190
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:32,141
Judaism or Jewish misreads of,
of Christianity,

1191
00:52:32,141 --> 00:52:33,110
and that when you get to the root of it,
I mean,

1192
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:38,111
this is what my mom says,
that there are significant differences 

1193
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:40,751
between Judaism and Christianity,
but his view of Christianity from the 

1194
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:43,031
Jewish historical point of view is that 
Judaism was never bound to convert 

1195
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:46,690
billions of people around the world,
but Christianity was specifically 

1196
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,210
because we have a lot of crap we got to 
do.

1197
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,790
I mean Jews have,
we have 613 commandments,

1198
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,890
you know,
we gotta we have to keep kosher.

1199
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:54,680
We have to do all of these things.
I appreciate you doing a lot of them for

1200
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:55,110
me.
Yeah,

1201
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,800
no problem.
And taking care of it.

1202
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:57,180
Yeah,
I'll,

1203
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I'll transfer over the point.
I'll give you one of my afterlife 

1204
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,670
exactly.
But uh,

1205
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,410
but I think that Christianity ends up 
doing a lot of those same things that,

1206
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:12,060
you know,
there were supposed to be start 

1207
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,060
distinctions just under a different 
guise.

1208
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,730
So when it comes to the,
this is why in the modern world when the

1209
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:16,440
discrimination between from Christians 
toward Jews largely has,

1210
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:21,441
has ended,
I think that what you're seeing is this 

1211
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:23,260
tremendous confluence between 
particularly orthodox Jews and observant

1212
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,310
Christians on matters,
on matters of values,

1213
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:31,470
uh,
because once Christianity and in the 

1214
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,760
late 20th century,
in the Mid Twentieth Century in America 

1215
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,221
more broadly with Christianity,
because American Christianity is very 

1216
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:37,221
different than European Christianity,
once,

1217
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:40,620
once there was an idea that Jews were 
not the enemy to be converted,

1218
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,470
but we're,
maybe you still want to convert me,

1219
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,790
but we're not going to come at you with 
a knife.

1220
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,450
We're going to come at you with the book
and that we share a common framework for

1221
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,510
how the world is supposed to work.
You may not agree with the second half 

1222
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:53,510
of the book.
Right?

1223
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:57,471
And then I think that that's,
that's created a pretty good working 

1224
00:53:57,471 --> 00:54:00,621
relationship with [inaudible].
This is why I'm struggling to come up 

1225
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:00,720
with what are the significant 
differences.

1226
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:05,870
And so I need,
I need a Christian to tell me what is 

1227
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:05,870
the significant difference.
I can argue with that question because I

1228
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,960
know my own religion better than I know 
Marshall question is being,

1229
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,840
I don't know if the rule that the state 
plays in Judaism and Christianity is the

1230
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:16,320
same because I'm not sure what to make 
of the.

1231
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,480
Like what I would say is the Jews put a 
tremendous amount of emphasis on the 

1232
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,210
state as a mechanism for salvation,
something like that.

1233
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:29,210
That might be the symbolic idea that 
underlies the establishment of Israel 

1234
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,750
and I would say that in Christianity and
the nation,

1235
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:33,360
or you mean like the government,
I mean the nation,

1236
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,670
but then it gets tangled up with the 
government.

1237
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:36,210
Right?
So,

1238
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:37,290
so,
so.

1239
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,620
Right.
This is a distinction that Jay,

1240
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,340
that Christianity is a universal 
universalistic religion,

1241
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:46,341
right?
The idea is that it that in the Kingdom 

1242
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:46,341
of God,
everyone is Christian basically,

1243
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:50,180
and Judaism is not in one sense,
but it is another which is that God 

1244
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,411
identifies a nation that he treasures as
his own and he has a special 

1245
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:54,690
relationship with that nation,
but Judaism is not exclusive.

1246
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,280
This with regard to who gets into 
heaven.

1247
00:54:56,281 --> 00:55:01,281
So there's this,
there's this basic idea in a in genesis 

1248
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:02,820
that there are commandments that are 
given prior to the giving of the Torah,

1249
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,070
right?
That there's the call,

1250
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:09,090
the Sheva Mitzvah Day and off the seven 
commandments that are given to the sons 

1251
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:09,090
of Noah,
meaning all mankind.

1252
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,730
And these are things like no murder,
no idolatry,

1253
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:16,790
no adultery.
They basically mirror a lot of the 10 

1254
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,060
commandments.
And so the idea in Judaism is that God,

1255
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:23,150
it's almost like a priestly cased.
God chose this specific group of people 

1256
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,210
to be a light unto the nations by 
demonstrating what a godly lifestyle 

1257
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:29,511
looks like.
If you dedicate every aspect of your 

1258
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:29,511
life to God.
And then he said to everybody else,

1259
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:31,590
I know not everybody else is up to this 
and I and in fact Judy's are supposed to

1260
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:33,570
try and turn away conference,
but if you,

1261
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,600
but you can still get into heaven.
The idea that we are trying to force 

1262
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,660
anyone into,
into being Jewish,

1263
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,590
that that's not a thing.
So nationalism without version.

1264
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:47,610
And think about that psychologically as 
an attempt to both manage the 

1265
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,951
preservation of group identity.
So that would be culture or cultural 

1266
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:55,191
identity,
which has some utility and also to be 

1267
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:55,240
able to coexist with other things.

1268
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,290
We're doing things in a different way 
and again,

1269
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:02,310
Judaism has had a long history of of it 
just like every other religion of sort 

1270
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,160
of evolution on this stuff or like when 
you're the push of the book of Joshua,

1271
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,680
there's actual forest conversion that 
happens in the book of Joshua,

1272
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:12,830
but by the time you get to a mid,
early Christianity and midpoint Judaism,

1273
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:15,870
right?
Because Judaism and Christianity,

1274
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,740
then you're already talking about Jews 
who are not looking to convert people.

1275
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,480
They sort of want to live in their own 
state.

1276
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,730
They don't want to bother anyone else 
for the most part a.

1277
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,490
So the idea of like a tidal wave of 
conquering Jews going out.

1278
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:29,110
I mean,
even to think about it now is hilarious,

1279
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:30,430
right?
Nobody thinks about it that way.

1280
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:35,230
Except if you're a conspiratorial nutbag
inquisitions usually work the other way.

1281
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,740
That's right.
So,

1282
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,320
so any,
anything that you might've heard Ben 

1283
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,401
just say,
would any thing jive with the 

1284
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,490
fundamental belief that you have that 
would cause a problem?

1285
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,790
You know what I mean,
like coding a problem in I think in 

1286
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,880
society.
I think that one potential problem 

1287
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,731
that's that's worth discussing,
but it would take forever to discuss it 

1288
00:56:56,731 --> 00:56:57,580
is the relative role of the individual 
versus the state.

1289
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:02,830
I mean you see this argued out in the 
prophetic books and in the Old 

1290
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:08,050
Testament,
I mean there's the Jewish state and 

1291
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,411
it's.
It's sort of the central player in some 

1292
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:13,231
sense,
but there's clear evidence that it can 

1293
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:13,300
become corrupted,
can fall away,

1294
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,450
and then a prophet who's an individual 
has to step forward and re revivified 

1295
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,480
it.
Right,

1296
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,600
and so there's tremendous emphasis on 
the utility of the individual.

1297
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,490
You see that in Judaea,
Judaism,

1298
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:26,810
I would say overall it's,
it's a,

1299
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,270
it's a very cohesive.

1300
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,500
It,
it,

1301
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,470
it,
it promotes in group cohesion,

1302
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:37,530
let's say,
but it also allows for individual 

1303
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,691
expression in a very interesting ways 
because there's tremendous emphasis in 

1304
00:57:39,691 --> 00:57:42,700
Jewish culture on learning and an 
articulation and mastery of ideas,

1305
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:45,820
and so that provides the space for the 
individual to flourish.

1306
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,270
With Christianity,
you see more of a move away,

1307
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:54,271
I would say from the idea of the state 
now that's not necessarily without its 

1308
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:56,260
troubles.
One of the things you pointed out was,

1309
00:57:56,261 --> 00:58:01,261
well,
as Christianity becomes more about the 

1310
00:58:01,261 --> 00:58:03,901
individual,
the religion itself tends to fragment 

1311
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,961
like it did with protestantism until 
just fragments right to the point where 

1312
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:09,991
every individual is their own church and
then you have no continuity and new 

1313
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:11,980
tradition and the Catholics were kind of
a bulwark against that.

1314
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,390
But I do think that there's a discussion
to be had about the relative role of the

1315
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:21,391
individual in redeeming the world,
let's say versus the state in redeeming 

1316
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,710
the world.
And I would say the Christians come down

1317
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:28,711
more strongly on the side of the 
individual and the Jews come down more 

1318
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:31,651
strongly on the side of the state now.
Like I'm willing to be corrected about 

1319
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:35,971
that because I've never actually been 
able to have a discussion with anyone 

1320
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:35,971
about that.
So

1321
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:37,440
I think there's some truth to that.
I mean,

1322
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:39,120
I think the idea of,
you know,

1323
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:40,310
in,
in Hebrew Ami,

1324
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,260
I like the idea of the nation of Israel 
being paramount and when you pray,

1325
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:45,570
you pray and collective terms,
you don't pray in individual terms,

1326
00:58:45,571 --> 00:58:47,570
everything is,
is done in terms of inaccurate,

1327
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,440
in terms of we praying as a group,
right?

1328
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:54,441
You're supposed to pray in a minion.
So how do you square that away in your 

1329
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:54,441
own ways?
How do you square that away?

1330
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:57,240
As soon as there's a lot of enjoyable,
there's a lot of play in the joints.

1331
00:58:57,241 --> 00:58:58,380
Meaning that,
uh,

1332
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,030
so for example,
to take the most,

1333
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,540
to take the most obvious example,
if you,

1334
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,090
if you were talking about the power of 
the Jewish state,

1335
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,170
uh,
in,

1336
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:09,171
in sort of biblical context,
there's tremendous argument between 

1337
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:12,711
whether a kingship is a good thing or a 
kingship is a bad thing in the Old 

1338
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:12,711
Testament,
right?

1339
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:12,711
I mean,
it says,

1340
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:14,280
it says like Samuel,
Warren's the Jewish people,

1341
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,400
if you take a king,
here's what's going to happen.

1342
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,760
It's all going to suck,
right?

1343
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:19,650
And then they form a kingship and things
suck.

1344
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,980
And so there's a strong case to made the
kingship was not actually what was 

1345
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,731
wanted because you have an entire period
of just judges and the judges are 

1346
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,270
legitimately just individuals who are 
trusted by the people,

1347
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,300
but then they can be supplanted at 
anytime by another judge who's not from 

1348
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:34,300
the lineage.
So,

1349
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,610
you know,
so when we say that that group identity 

1350
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,390
matters in Judaism,
it matters to the extent that you're 

1351
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:40,390
following God's law.
But if you stray away from that,

1352
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:45,071
the idea,
I think Judaism has always said that 

1353
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:45,071
what you do is what makes you part of 
the group,

1354
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:47,420
not what you are.
So Judaism has a weird dichotomy in it,

1355
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:52,630
uh,
that's largely driven by exigent 

1356
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,911
circumstances,
which is the idea of biological Judaism 

1357
00:59:54,911 --> 00:59:54,911
versus the idea of religious Judaism.

1358
00:59:54,911 --> 00:59:56,180
So I care very little about biological 
Judaism,

1359
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:59,570
like when somebody says such and such as
Jewish Noam Chomsky's Jewish,

1360
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,400
like,
so what I really don't care.

1361
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,860
And,
and I think that most orthodox Jews,

1362
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,730
we basically biological Judaism or your 
mom was Jewish,

1363
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:13,180
which is the way that it works in 
Orthodox Judaism is the sort of the 

1364
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,080
entry ticket to being Jewish,
meaning you have to either have 

1365
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,201
converted in or your mind has to be 
Jewish in order for you to become fully 

1366
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:23,620
Jewish,
but the practice is what matters to me 

1367
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,140
more than anything else.
And that's where you get back into grey 

1368
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:26,140
space versus based a little bit.
Right?

1369
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,440
It's also,
that's another place where the group 

1370
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:30,620
identity issue becomes paramount.
It's like,

1371
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,940
well,
there's this group,

1372
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,770
well,
how has membership defined,

1373
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:36,080
but let's say it's,
it's defined by ethnicity,

1374
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:39,800
something which would be related to the 
descent through the mother.

1375
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,450
It's like,
well that's a problem.

1376
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:45,330
I'm not saying it's wrong.
I'm saying it's uploaded demarcates.

1377
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,100
A group say,
well,

1378
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,650
this is a group that only we can belong 
to.

1379
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:52,300
What's weird is you can convert in my 
way.

1380
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:57,420
I'd say when there's play in the joints,
a lot of the problems are solvable 

1381
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:57,420
through the idea that you can convert 
in.

1382
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:02,570
Judaism says you can't convert out,
but then we don't punish people who 

1383
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:02,570
leave.
Right?

1384
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:02,660
But is it right?
Which is different than Islam,

1385
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,330
but yes,
it's actually a relatively important.

1386
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,760
But I mean,
one of the people who I worked with at 

1387
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,100
my company,
Andrew Klavan is a guy who was born 

1388
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:15,100
Jewish and now is Christian,
right?

1389
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:15,100
So in my view,
he's Jewish,

1390
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,150
but am I going to like drag him down to 
my synagogue?

1391
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,000
Like that's not a thing.
So it's.

1392
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:23,100
But uh,
I think that what the group identity 

1393
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,720
that the good,
the one thing I will say for a group 

1394
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,500
identity is that what we have seen is 
that if there is lack of group identity,

1395
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,380
that group identity is filled usually by
nefarious groups.

1396
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:35,710
Meaning that people do have a necessity.
The idea of existing that you find your 

1397
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:39,710
meaning or your find your purpose or 
your find your identity just in yourself

1398
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:44,711
as an individual is not only wrong,
it's belied by virtually all of human 

1399
01:01:44,711 --> 01:01:47,260
history.
Make an argument for identity politics,

1400
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,260
but the point that,
but,

1401
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,120
but what Judaism does,
what America does,

1402
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,760
it says,
find your identity in the ideas.

1403
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,980
Right?
That's the difference is when I'm.

1404
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,080
So this is what I don't care about 
biological Judaism,

1405
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,230
you know,
particularly the,

1406
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:06,231
to.
I care much more about the ideas that 

1407
01:02:06,231 --> 01:02:06,231
you hold.
So I'm in favor of group identity.

1408
01:02:06,231 --> 01:02:07,820
If group identity is built around a set 
of ideas that are worth preserving,

1409
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:11,030
I'm not in favor of group identity.
Like I am a conservative.

1410
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,650
That's a group identity,
right?

1411
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:14,690
But that's an identifier more than it's 
an identity.

1412
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:18,590
Meaning it's a way of identifying me as 
a person who thinks this way and because

1413
01:02:18,591 --> 01:02:19,980
I think there are differences in,

1414
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,070
in modes of thought.
Then those group identities.

1415
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:24,390
Do you matter?
I mean this is why we get together.

1416
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:26,740
This is why we have discussions.
This is why we have friends,

1417
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,010
family.
But I'm glad you.

1418
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm glad you said that the way you did 
because I.

1419
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:36,001
I try to challenge myself on that all 
the time because I talk about the 

1420
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:39,141
individual.
I believe in the individual and I want 

1421
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:39,520
to make sure that I'm not going to let.
If I,

1422
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,600
if we can,
and this is what I think is one of the 

1423
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:44,600
things that's broken down is we used to 
have a common purpose.

1424
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,071
Like I have this framework that I'm 
working on in the book that I'm writing 

1425
01:02:49,071 --> 01:02:49,680
where I basically say that in order for 
an individual to be happy,

1426
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,150
you need.
You need four things.

1427
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:54,060
You need individual purpose.
You need individual capacity.

1428
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:59,061
That the feeling that you can accomplish
that purpose or at least make moves in 

1429
01:02:59,061 --> 01:02:59,061
that direction.

1430
01:02:59,061 --> 01:03:02,720
You need a communal purpose.
You do need to feel like you're part of 

1431
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,481
a group that's moving in the right 
direction and you need to communal 

1432
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,911
capacity,
which both allows the community to 

1433
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:09,921
activate together and also protects your
rights as an individual to do what you 

1434
01:03:09,921 --> 01:03:10,590
want to do in pursuit of your individual
purpose.

1435
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,740
And that's the apotheosis of happiness.
And that's what I think the founding 

1436
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:15,740
fathers were trying to do in the United 
States,

1437
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:20,091
for example,
set up a framework where you could 

1438
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:21,560
fulfill all of these things,
but you do need the idea of communal 

1439
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,711
purpose.
And one of the things that's happened 

1440
01:03:24,711 --> 01:03:24,711
post enlightenment is that people don't 
even think in terms of they either think

1441
01:03:24,711 --> 01:03:27,690
purely in terms of communal purpose or 
not at all in terms of communal purpose,

1442
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:32,750
because they think either purely in 
terms of communal purpose and that's 

1443
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,180
identity politics,
meaning I'm black for the black 

1444
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,180
community,
should do x,

1445
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,660
or I'm Jewish,
therefore the Jewish community should do

1446
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:41,661
x.
and then there are people who think not 

1447
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:42,360
in terms of communal purpose at all,
meaning full on libertarian.

1448
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:47,360
I make my own meaning.
We don't have to have anything in 

1449
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:47,360
common.
We have.

1450
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:47,360
And,
and that's a lie.

1451
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:52,040
Even Libertarians believe we have to 
have an idea of liberty and common live 

1452
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:52,890
with other people that were right.
Exactly.

1453
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,330
Harmoniously.
And when we don't,

1454
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:59,370
and when we don't have any of the.
When we don't have any sort of communal 

1455
01:03:59,370 --> 01:03:59,430
purpose and we live with a bunch of 
people with whom we share nothing,

1456
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:03,150
then it falls apart incredibly quickly.
So here's,

1457
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,500
here's how the Christian drama,
it looks to me it,

1458
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,190
it addresses this issue,
right?

1459
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:13,191
So Christ is presented as a figure who 
is an absolute master of his tradition,

1460
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:18,610
right?
He's debating with the Jewish elders 

1461
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,201
when he's 12.
So think about it psychologically is 

1462
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:25,010
first your child and you're dependent on
your parents and then you have to make 

1463
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,270
the move from being a child dependent 
into the world,

1464
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,760
but you don't move from child to 
individually.

1465
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,660
You move from child to group.
That's your teenage gang.

1466
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:38,661
That's your adolescence.
You have to catalyze your group 

1467
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:38,661
identity.
If you don't have a group identity,

1468
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:41,130
it's actually a developmental failure,
right?

1469
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,840
But then you might think,
well wait,

1470
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:46,620
a second group identity is necessary,
but is it the highest?

1471
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:52,420
Is it?
Does it represent the highest plane of 

1472
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:52,420
moral achievement?
The answer to that is no.

1473
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,450
You have to emerge from your group as an
individual.

1474
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:59,810
Okay,
so now this is how I read the Christian 

1475
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:02,721
story symbolically,
and this is a consequence most of have 

1476
01:05:02,721 --> 01:05:02,721
having students studied young.
He said,

1477
01:05:02,721 --> 01:05:04,620
look,
you need group identity.

1478
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,740
That's the persona that you.
Where you have to have a persona.

1479
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:09,720
You have to be able to wear a suit.
You have to be.

1480
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,270
You have to simplify yourself for other 
people.

1481
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:14,920
You have to be able to play the game.
Otherwise you're.

1482
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,160
You just have failed developmentally,
but if

1483
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,650
you're only a persona,
then that's a big problem,

1484
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,660
partly because when the group goes 
insane,

1485
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:24,100
so do you.
Okay,

1486
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,740
now you got to emerge out of the group.
Okay,

1487
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:29,860
so now you need a symbol for what 
emerges out of the group.

1488
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:35,160
Okay,
so Christ is the symbol of what should 

1489
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:35,160
emerge out of the group.
Speaking,

1490
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,390
psychologically,
bear the tragedy of life.

1491
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:42,280
Speak the truth.
Be Willing to transform through death.

1492
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:46,420
That's the rules.
Now I'm speaking purely psychologically.

1493
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,910
You learn something new,
you learn it,

1494
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:52,870
it makes you suffer.
The part of you that's wrong has to die.

1495
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,880
You have to let go of that and it's 
hard,

1496
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:56,920
especially maybe you learn something 
profound.

1497
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:59,440
It's like,
it's like you have to regrow and arm.

1498
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,820
It's really painful,
you know,

1499
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,080
but you identify with the part of 
yourself that transforms through 

1500
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,681
voluntary acceptance of suffering and 
that's what Christ represents as a 

1501
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:11,530
symbol,
and I think that that's.

1502
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,080
I think that that's correct.
Symbolically,

1503
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:17,410
this is what actually severed the 
relationship between Human Freud,

1504
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:20,560
by the way,
because young laid out the,

1505
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:25,030
his understanding of Christianity in 
those terms and Freud,

1506
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,070
it wasn't a Jewish Christian thing 
because Freud was really he,

1507
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,380
he was Jewish by ethnicity,
but no,

1508
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,010
no,
not at all.

1509
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:36,190
He just didn't want to have anything to 
do with religious ideation at all.

1510
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:41,191
He thought that that would introduce,
he called it like a tidal wave of black 

1511
01:06:41,191 --> 01:06:42,610
title wave of cultism back into what he 
regarded as a science.

1512
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,760
He had his point,
but I think you've got the symbolic 

1513
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:47,760
structure.
Right,

1514
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,930
and so what does that mean in 
relationship to Christianity and 

1515
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,450
Judaism?
What's really complicated?

1516
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:57,451
Because you have the prophetic tradition
in Judaism and the prophets are also 

1517
01:06:57,451 --> 01:07:01,500
symbols of people who emerge from the 
pathological group who stepped forward 

1518
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:05,890
courageously and who reconstitute the 
group.

1519
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,070
You believe these people could exist 
right now,

1520
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,740
which,
which people?

1521
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:15,160
The profits.
I think profits of sorts exist always.

1522
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,610
I think Dostoyevsky was a prophet niche.
It was clearly a profit.

1523
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:21,380
I mean he predicted it was going to 
happen in the 20th century.

1524
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,490
Can you imagine predicting?
The reason I asked that was because I 

1525
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:26,490
think when people,
when you say profits,

1526
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:31,471
I think people think of someone coming 
down from heaven and they're going to 

1527
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:34,381
have a halo on or some crazy,
but you think that that's what I'm 

1528
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:34,910
trying to get to the right now.
I

1529
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,450
fully agree with this.
In fact,

1530
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:41,451
I was my manatees.
Manatees has an entire section in guide 

1531
01:07:41,451 --> 01:07:43,861
for the perplexed about prophecy and 
what he says is there's Moses level 

1532
01:07:43,861 --> 01:07:47,491
prophecy which is the the legislating 
profit which is and he says he's the 

1533
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:47,980
only legislating profit in the Jewish 
view,

1534
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:53,130
but all the other prophets are just 
people who see things incredibly 

1535
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,261
clearly.
Essentially there are people who've 

1536
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:55,261
studied philosophy and who have studied 
human morality and has studied the human

1537
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:57,850
being and then that's the way down on 
the iceberg.

1538
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,530
That's just the thing that makes them 
different.

1539
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:01,630
Exactly.
And so in that sentence,

1540
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:04,710
people who predicted the thing about,
you know,

1541
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,070
providing a certain level of stability 
for folks and we're,

1542
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,080
you know,
I think,

1543
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:13,110
I think there are levels of prophecy is 
what I'll say and I think that the 

1544
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,771
better you are at,
at recognizing human behavior and the 

1545
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:16,771
interplay of forces,
the better

1546
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:16,771
you are at saying,
okay,

1547
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:21,731
here's what's going to happen next week.
I think it's very difficult for anybody 

1548
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:21,731
to say here's what's going to happen a 
hundred years.

1549
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:23,270
Because if you could predict that you 
make a lot in the stock market,

1550
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:25,580
but I think that you can certainly,
you know as well,

1551
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:30,330
you can also get a sense of plate 
tectonics like the details rob out.

1552
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,260
But like,
and I think that's where we're at now.

1553
01:08:32,261 --> 01:08:34,530
Like I believe we're in,
we are in a war of ideas.

1554
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:35,820
We're,
we're,

1555
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:41,150
we're,
we're at a point where we're debating 

1556
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,881
the validity of postmodernism now and 
that's tainted with neo Marxism and that

1557
01:08:43,951 --> 01:08:46,500
should have been laid to rest a hundred 
years ago.

1558
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,980
We're driving because that,
that just.

1559
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:55,220
I mean,
the reason that the DMO postmodernist 

1560
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,740
can't let go of neo Marxism is because 
there's no impetus forward in 

1561
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,090
postmodernism.
That's fundamental flaw.

1562
01:09:00,091 --> 01:09:00,750
It's like,
well,

1563
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,130
there's no grand narrative.

1564
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:02,900
It's okay.
Like,

1565
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,620
what are you going to do tomorrow?
Well,

1566
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,050
I don't know because everything's the 
same as everything else.

1567
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:07,500
It's like,
well,

1568
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:09,390
you can't live.
You can't live that way.

1569
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:14,391
It's impossible to live that way.
While I will just sneak some Marxism in 

1570
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:14,391
the back door,
it's like,

1571
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:14,391
well,
that's.

1572
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:19,550
That's prime a fascia evidence in my 
estimation that your philosophy is 

1573
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:24,230
pragmatically lacking even though you 
can make a perfectly coherent case for 

1574
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:24,360
it.
It's like you can't live it out.

1575
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:29,480
You just can't do it,
so you have to sneak in this 

1576
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:29,480
pathological Marxism in the back door.
Well,

1577
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,460
no,
that just invalidates your entire 

1578
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:34,460
system.
But apart from all that,

1579
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:39,140
I think the postmodern objection to 
meaning is actually wrong.

1580
01:09:39,451 --> 01:09:44,451
While we talked about this earlier,
I do believe that there is a 

1581
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:45,990
transcendent ethic and I do believe that
it touches on the metaphysical.

1582
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:50,990
I believe if people experienced that 
because people are perfectly capable of 

1583
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:54,771
having unalterably profound religious 
experiences and the naturalistic 

1584
01:09:55,141 --> 01:09:57,030
materialists don't know what the hell to
do with that,

1585
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:59,160
they have no idea what to do with that 
fact.

1586
01:09:59,310 --> 01:09:59,730
Say,
well,

1587
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:00,810
it's delusional.
It's like,

1588
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,770
well,
hang on a sec.

1589
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:05,610
People who have those experiences appear
to be more successful and healthier,

1590
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,160
so when exactly in what manner is that 
delusional and if you induce it in the 

1591
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:11,760
lab with Psilocybin,
for example,

1592
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:15,600
among people who are dying of cancer,
their fear of death goes away.

1593
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,860
It's like that's you're going to just 
lay of the lay that out there as 

1594
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,991
delusional or you quit smoking.
80 five percent success rate with one 

1595
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:27,771
mystical experience on psilocybin 
produces 85 percent cessation rate and 

1596
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:31,590
smoking completely and with MDM,
a ecstasy.

1597
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:37,160
The three treatments with Mtma.
That's what the current research 

1598
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,521
indicates produces a 72 percent cure 
rate for intractable posttraumatic 

1599
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:42,900
stress disorder.

1600
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,390
It's like those are miracle cures and no
one,

1601
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,790
and they have to be accompanied by the 
mystical experience.

1602
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:51,190
No one knows how to account for that and
so there was a transfer,

1603
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:54,410
so it's a very physical thing.
I mean in a case like that,

1604
01:10:54,411 --> 01:10:56,490
you talked about Iowa or any of these 
things,

1605
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:58,710
right,
that you're eating something,

1606
01:10:58,711 --> 01:10:59,970
you're ingesting something,
smoking it,

1607
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:01,920
whatever it is.
It's physical.

1608
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:06,921
It's here and now,
but the experience is metaphysical is 

1609
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:09,870
metaphase.
That's a place where the biological and 

1610
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:09,870
the transcendent touch and we don't know
what to make of that.

1611
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:15,050
Well,
that's why psychedelics through our 

1612
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:15,050
whole culture into such a such a

1613
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:16,830
flip this upside down.
No one knew what to do with them.

1614
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,360
You know?
I mean the Indians regarded psilocybin 

1615
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,430
as food of the gods for a reason and 
when people have encountered psychedelic

1616
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:28,431
substances throughout human history,
that's always how they've been 

1617
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:29,100
characterized as,
right food of the gods.

1618
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:34,190
It's like beware of them,
but there they opened the door to the 

1619
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,701
transcendent and well,
I think the evidence that they are doing

1620
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:43,311
something that psychedelic substances 
are doing something that we seriously 

1621
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:45,300
don't understand at all.
Not a bit is overwhelming.

1622
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,420
Rick strassman wrote a book on his 
experiences giving Dmt to a whole bunch 

1623
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,170
of people down in.
He was at in Austin,

1624
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:56,370
I think strassman's a pretty straight 
scientists,

1625
01:11:56,371 --> 01:12:01,371
you know,
he was interested in measuring 

1626
01:12:01,371 --> 01:12:01,371
psychophysiological responses to the 
drugs.

1627
01:12:01,371 --> 01:12:04,911
Well,
he'd give people dmt and they all came 

1628
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:05,280
back with the same story.
I was blasted out of my consciousness.

1629
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,550
I went,
I met a whole bunch of alien beings.

1630
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,870
They were really surprised I was there 
and then I came back and it was the most

1631
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:15,630
real thing that's ever happened to me.
And straussman would say,

1632
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:16,260
well,
you know,

1633
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:21,261
well,
you had a Yogi and archetipal 

1634
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:21,261
experience,
or it was a dream and they'd say,

1635
01:12:21,261 --> 01:12:25,220
you don't understand.
Then he got so distraught because of 

1636
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:30,231
these continual reports that he had 
stopped doing the research and like I'm 

1637
01:12:30,231 --> 01:12:31,980
not making a claim for,
for anything metaphysical here,

1638
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:36,981
but I'm definitely pointing out that 
there are undeniable realms of human 

1639
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:42,651
experience that involve religious 
experience and a sense of the infinite 

1640
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:49,491
transcendent that looked like they're 
healthy and that you cannot deny well.

1641
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:51,990
So what are you supposed to do with 
that?

1642
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,600
Well,
you sold a box and you say,

1643
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:55,860
well,
we're not going to pay attention to.

1644
01:12:55,861 --> 01:12:56,970
It's like,
that's not gonna work.

1645
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,000
Yeah,
that's not going to work.

1646
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:03,001
And I've done a lot of those things that
you just mentioned and virtually always 

1647
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,360
had good experiences on them.
Now is someone that I'm pretty sure he's

1648
01:13:04,361 --> 01:13:07,280
never smoked weed mushrooms.
You haven't?

1649
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:10,390
Okay.
You haven't done Mtma and all that stuff

1650
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,450
will take a drink.
Yeah,

1651
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,780
I mean I've done all of those things.
I don't really do.

1652
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,150
Well.
I mean I smoked some weed but I don't.

1653
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:20,250
I'm not doing.
I haven't done ecstasy and years and 

1654
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,410
mushrooms.
I did do about a year ago and I had a 

1655
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:22,570
great day and I kind of wandered around 
and I thought I,

1656
01:13:22,571 --> 01:13:23,590
you know,
I felt some,

1657
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:25,210
some things happening.
I didn't.

1658
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:30,420
When I did them in college,
I had a couple of those type of 

1659
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:30,420
transcendent feeling.
I was just part of something,

1660
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:30,420
whatever.
But.

1661
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:35,370
So when you hear all this as someone 
that doesn't partake in any of this 

1662
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,210
stuff,
what do you make of that?

1663
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:42,240
That people can perhaps use some 
substances that you're not down with on 

1664
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:47,251
a personal level to get to a place that 
I think you actually think is a good 

1665
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:47,251
place.

1666
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:50,650
I mean,
I think the answer is that it depends on

1667
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,650
the level of expertise of the person 
using it is what I would suggest,

1668
01:13:53,651 --> 01:13:54,310
you know,
the idea,

1669
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,230
like I'm not against prescription 
medication.

1670
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,850
So if you're talking about,
you know,

1671
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:00,160
an actual program that is going to 
better somebody's life,

1672
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,960
that's one thing.
But if it's somebody who's just,

1673
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,140
I want to have a religious experience 
than perhaps in Lsd.

1674
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,660
And then there's some serious downsides 
to drugs that I,

1675
01:14:07,661 --> 01:14:10,210
I do wonder if it is necessary it.
Well,

1676
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:11,500
two things.
One,

1677
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:12,010
the

1678
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,640
in,
in,

1679
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,700
in Judaism,
and I keep reverting back to this 

1680
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:17,700
because I know it's the religion.
I know,

1681
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:17,700
um,
but there,

1682
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,630
there's two kinds of schools of thought 
with regard to Judaism.

1683
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:21,220
One are called the,
uh,

1684
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:22,780
the,
the Ms Dot [inaudible].

1685
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:26,080
These are people who are sort of 
enlightenment mentality,

1686
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,760
hard science folks.
And the Hasidim not considered murder.

1687
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:30,310
The people he see really Kabod,
they have the,

1688
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:31,930
the big beards.
And of the past,

1689
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:32,920
uh,
and they,

1690
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:34,750
and they like to dance and they drink 
on,

1691
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,050
on Purim and,
and all this and that.

1692
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:41,051
They're wonderful people and they a 
great outreach specifically because 

1693
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:41,320
they're so spiritual and I tend to be 
more of this noggin than a,

1694
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:42,400
than a faucet,
meaning that,

1695
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,030
uh,
it's,

1696
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:43,520
uh,
I,

1697
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,730
I try to get to dance.
Oh,

1698
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,590
it's nice operating.
Uh,

1699
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:49,010
but I,
I,

1700
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:54,330
I try to get to spirituality through 
reason as opposed to through experience 

1701
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,390
simply because I think that,
well,

1702
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,510
I know people who've had religious 
experience and it's really changed them.

1703
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:06,870
I think there are also a lot of people 
have religious experience and it lasts 

1704
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,451
for a given amount of time and then 
they're done with the religious 

1705
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:09,451
experience and they just go back to 
doing whatever they're doing.

1706
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:13,741
Right.
I mean this is what you were doing in 

1707
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:14,731
college.
So I think that if you're looking for 

1708
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:15,940
that as a gateway out of whatever it is 
that is troubling you in terms of a lack

1709
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:17,980
of purpose,
like a permanent solution,

1710
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,020
maybe that works for a small number of 
people.

1711
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:20,550
But I,
I,

1712
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:25,740
I highly doubt that most people can find
a level of purpose necessary to drive 

1713
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:29,671
the entirety of the rest of their lives 
outside of a framework of conscious 

1714
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:33,061
will,
moving them in the direction of doing 

1715
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:33,061
the right thing.
You told people,

1716
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:37,141
he talked about Mescalin and Lsd in the 
context of Huxley's introduction of 

1717
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:38,140
those substances into the Western world.

1718
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:42,010
And he said two things in is inimitably 
wise manner.

1719
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,770
The first thing he said is beware of 
unearned wisdom,

1720
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:46,440
man,
man,

1721
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,990
that's great.
And he also said you,

1722
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:53,220
you have to be very careful about about 
entering the realm of the gods because 

1723
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:58,350
you end up with a responsibility that 
might be more crushing than you can 

1724
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:58,840
tolerate.
And it's the same kind of idea.

1725
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:03,841
And I thought,
I've never read anyone who wrote wiser 

1726
01:16:03,841 --> 01:16:05,440
words about the dangers of psychedelic 
use than that because he didn't say,

1727
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,030
well,
none of this is real.

1728
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,790
He said it's more real than you want it 
to be.

1729
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:13,150
And so watch the hell out.
And I think that's extremely good advice

1730
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:18,151
and it is very difficult for people to 
integrate those experiences into their 

1731
01:16:18,151 --> 01:16:21,361
life.
Although my experience with people has 

1732
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:21,361
been,
and I've seen this with lots of people,

1733
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:22,060
they've said that they've done 
mushrooms,

1734
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:24,250
for example,
how to mystical experience and that that

1735
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,520
provided them with a moral compass that 
they lacked before.

1736
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:32,580
That never went away.
And I've talked to many people who've 

1737
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:32,880
had that experience so,
but you know,

1738
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:37,890
I've also been in Amsterdam watching the
50 year old punk rockers and beer and go

1739
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:44,821
pound out some street kid.
There was the downside of transcendence 

1740
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:49,381
is something that's not to be trifled 
with and there's also the opportunity 

1741
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:52,921
not to go to heaven but to go to hell.
And that does happen to people and that 

1742
01:16:52,921 --> 01:16:56,971
can be,
that can induce posttraumatic stress 

1743
01:16:56,971 --> 01:16:56,971
disorder essentially.
So,

1744
01:16:56,971 --> 01:16:57,640
you know,
be aware of,

1745
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:02,160
be aware of wandering and realms,
not competent to wander,

1746
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:02,710
rather they,
yeah,

1747
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,090
that's my,
that's my central take.

1748
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:05,590
And then I think it's really good for 
you.

1749
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:08,640
Like I think that what you're doing 
really works because you know,

1750
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:10,010
you,
you do Kinda what I

1751
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,760
did with a biblical lectures except you 
take it to an even greater extreme.

1752
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,310
I would say you're so rational in your 
approach,

1753
01:17:16,311 --> 01:17:19,280
like people know that you ever religious
over view,

1754
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,380
let's say,
but you don't use that.

1755
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,060
You use it less than I do,
I would say.

1756
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:28,061
Yeah,
and I think it really works well for 

1757
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:28,061
you.
I think it's very.

1758
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:31,980
I think it's hard to for his faith on 
people and I don't think it's wrong to 

1759
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:31,980
force faith on people.
So if you want also counterproductive.

1760
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,090
Exactly,
exactly.

1761
01:17:33,091 --> 01:17:35,430
And I,
I'm not preaching that you have to agree

1762
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:40,431
with how I got to these values to say 
that these values are necessary for the 

1763
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:44,571
civilization.
And this is essentially what I said to 

1764
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:44,571
Sam when I was debating him is his,
you know,

1765
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:44,880
he said,
well,

1766
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,290
you know,
a lot of religious people.

1767
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,200
He sort of suggested that I think that 
atheists can be moral people.

1768
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:51,210
And I said,
I don't think that that's true at all.

1769
01:17:51,211 --> 01:17:56,211
I mean the point that I'm making is you 
have to get to these valleys to have a 

1770
01:17:56,211 --> 01:17:56,211
civilization.
How you get to those values,

1771
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,510
in my view,
you know,

1772
01:17:57,511 --> 01:18:02,511
I think requires a leap of faith.
You can make that leap of faith a 

1773
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:02,511
variety of different ways,
but you're going to end up needing these

1774
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,430
central values at road if you're gonna 
build a civilization off of that,

1775
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,720
so whether you do that through,
you know,

1776
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:12,730
the,
the kind of method that the team wants 

1777
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:12,730
to get to.
What was weird is it,

1778
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:12,810
you know,
Sam and I come from completely different

1779
01:18:12,811 --> 01:18:17,811
perspectives on virtually everything,
but we share probably 90 to 95 percent 

1780
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:21,081
of our values and so what I was 
suggesting is that those values are 

1781
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:25,190
rooted in a Judeo Christian civilization
that is mixed with a Greek civilization 

1782
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:28,970
that brought us to the same place 
because we grew up five miles from each 

1783
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:28,970
other.
So of course we have the same values,

1784
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:28,970
right?

1785
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:29,250
Yeah.
It was counter argument to that.

1786
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:32,250
Basically would be that you're really 
talking about enlightenment values,

1787
01:18:32,251 --> 01:18:35,350
but you would say those values 
ultimately came to.

1788
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,300
The funny thing about that is that's 
actually a silly argument that those are

1789
01:18:39,301 --> 01:18:44,301
enlightenment.
I hope you guys will talk about when 

1790
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:46,170
you're on stage together.
Biologists have already made short 

1791
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,441
shrift of that.
It's like Sam can't be an evolutionary 

1792
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:51,000
biologist and say that the values that 
run Western civilization sprang from the

1793
01:18:51,001 --> 01:18:56,001
enlightenment.
It's like you don't get to have those 

1794
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:56,001
two timeframes at the same time.
I may have slightly so putting words out

1795
01:18:56,001 --> 01:19:00,271
there and can see that I disagree with 
you a little bit about the atheist issue

1796
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:05,541
because I think this is the reason.
It's like if you think about the layers 

1797
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,140
of the mind with the iceberg analogy,
it's like,

1798
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,550
well,
you've got your,

1799
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:09,740
your,
your,

1800
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:14,750
your patterns of action,
and then you've got your justification 

1801
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:14,880
for those patterns of actually might 
think that those are rational,

1802
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:20,160
but,
but then there's something underneath 

1803
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,251
that which is like the images that 
represent reality and the stories that 

1804
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:26,361
represent reality and then there's 
something underneath that even and I 

1805
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:29,631
think that to be religious is to have 
all of those things in order 

1806
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:33,051
simultaneously and I don't think that 
you can have an ethic that's only 

1807
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:37,371
grounded in rationality because I think 
the integrity of that rationality 

1808
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:41,130
depends on the type of stories that you 
don't understand that that exists.

1809
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:42,360
So let,
let me rephrase that.

1810
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:47,361
I actually agree with everything you 
just said when I say that we have to 

1811
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:47,361
ground these values in order for us to 
build a civilization.

1812
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,590
How you get there as your own business.
I mean on an individual level,

1813
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:54,591
I don't mean that every way you get to 
those values as equally valid or 

1814
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,950
otherwise it Sam and I would agree like 
I,

1815
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:00,980
I do not think that the,
the mode of thinking from evolutionary 

1816
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,710
biology to the values that I think are 
necessary for building a civilization.

1817
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:06,920
Even if I see weaknesses coming up in 
Sam's representations for this reasons,

1818
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,010
the first thing is he has to

1819
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,970
dispense with consciousness and he has 
to dispense with freewill and I actually

1820
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:16,971
think that's deeply problematic and I 
think the reason he has to do that and 

1821
01:20:16,971 --> 01:20:20,170
Dennett does it too,
is because there is something 

1822
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:22,551
metaphysically strange about 
consciousness and you can't allow for 

1823
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:23,310
that if you're a reductionist,
materialist.

1824
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,140
And so I'm more than willing to say,
look,

1825
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:28,920
I don't understand consciousness at all.
And the more I think about it,

1826
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:33,921
the less I understand it because it 
seems to be the linchpin of being 

1827
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:35,520
without consciousness.
There's no being we could say,

1828
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:38,100
well the material reality continues.
It's like,

1829
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:43,460
well maybe and maybe not because we do 
not understand the relationship between 

1830
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,910
time and space and consciousness.
So there's no,

1831
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,640
it's not self evident that what you're 
saying is true.

1832
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,920
It might be true,
but even if it was true,

1833
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,810
well,
exactly.

1834
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,800
How does the universe that has no 
conscious ness in it exist?

1835
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,950
Like how do you parameterize it?
Does it have a duration?

1836
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:01,770
Does it have a size?
Does it have any qualities?

1837
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,920
Like what is like a video game that no 
one's playing,

1838
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:05,600
right?
It's like,

1839
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,080
well,
what is that exactly?

1840
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:08,550
Well that this is,
this is where we get to,

1841
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:13,610
you know,
back to that three hour conversation 

1842
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:13,830
that you and Sam had as to the nature of
truth and what exactly truth is.

1843
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:15,160
And one of the things that I always 
will,

1844
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,160
I don't want to,
you know,

1845
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:18,450
Critique Sam's ideology without him here
to defend himself.

1846
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,580
Although it's fun.
It's definitely fun,

1847
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:22,470
but we'll have to have been here to 
actually actually do that.

1848
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:27,540
It'd be a lot of fun.
But one of the things that I've always 

1849
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,991
found weird is that he and I have 
precisely the same notion of an 

1850
01:21:29,991 --> 01:21:32,391
objective truth,
but I don't understand where he's 

1851
01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:33,270
getting his from,
meaning like I'm getting,

1852
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:34,290
I don't either like,
well,

1853
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:35,490
and he also,
because if he,

1854
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:35,860
if he,
if he,

1855
01:21:35,861 --> 01:21:40,861
if you base your viewpoint on in a 
materialist evolutionary biology than 

1856
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:44,451
what you would say,
w what you would say is the truth is 

1857
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:44,451
that which is most biologically 
successful,

1858
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:44,520
right?

1859
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,770
That's the claim I was making when I 
talked to Sam.

1860
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:47,280
Right,
exactly.

1861
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:52,281
Which is which is your claim,
and also a claim that leads to religion 

1862
01:21:52,281 --> 01:21:54,861
because biologically speaking,
religious believers are more 

1863
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:54,861
biologically successful.
The nonreligious believers,

1864
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:57,600
all history,
religious belief evolved,

1865
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,100
right?
That's the thing.

1866
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:02,340
Not only did religious belief evolve,
clearly it evolved.

1867
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:07,341
It's one of the human universals.
The capacity for religious experience 

1868
01:22:07,341 --> 01:22:08,280
evolved.
When you might say,

1869
01:22:08,281 --> 01:22:09,350
why?
Well maybe you could.

1870
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:14,400
You could take the viewpoint that seems 
to be characteristic of Steven pinker 

1871
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,400
and say,
well,

1872
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,351
it's a spandrel.
It's just a side effect of something 

1873
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:20,601
more substantial.
In my objection to that is define your 

1874
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:22,730
spandrel first.
You know,

1875
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:27,890
you don't get to eat right.
You don't get to define a way the side 

1876
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:27,890
effects of the drug.
Right,

1877
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:28,470
exactly.
That's exactly it.

1878
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,800
You know,
when people talk about drugs,

1879
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:33,150
very often what they'll do is they'll 
say,

1880
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:33,600
well,
you know,

1881
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:38,601
the drug is for a headache,
but it has the side effect of causing 

1882
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:38,601
your cancer.
It's like,

1883
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:38,601
well,
no,

1884
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:38,601
the drug causes cancer.
Yeah,

1885
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:43,420
right.
They're getting rid of the headache is 

1886
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:43,420
the side effects.
I mean,

1887
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:43,930
every one of those prescription 
commercials,

1888
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:44,500
you know,
headache,

1889
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:45,400
diarrhea,
nausea,

1890
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:46,590
thoughts of suicide,
et Cetera,

1891
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:47,650
et cetera.
But your cough,

1892
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,540
Michael,
you know,

1893
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:49,410
it's really nuts.
All right,

1894
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,890
here's what we're doing.
So I want to be very respectful of,

1895
01:22:51,891 --> 01:22:56,891
of both of your times,
but yours particularly because you're 

1896
01:22:56,891 --> 01:22:56,891
doing like a two hour lecture tended to 
the orpheum.

1897
01:22:56,891 --> 01:22:58,960
There might be a surprise guest there.
I don't want to say who,

1898
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:04,220
uh,
so we're gonna do a half hour more if 

1899
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:06,091
you guys can do that.
We're going to do a q and a from the 

1900
01:23:06,091 --> 01:23:09,091
audience,
but I do want to ask guys one other 

1901
01:23:09,091 --> 01:23:09,760
thing first and I just want to try to 
get this to truly be as as personal as I

1902
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:14,761
can get out of you guys in front of 
thousands of thousands of people as 

1903
01:23:14,761 --> 01:23:19,080
these last couple of years it happened 
and as you both raising profile and 

1904
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,991
you're out there saying what you think 
all the time and defending your beliefs 

1905
01:23:21,991 --> 01:23:25,351
and being friends with people like Sam 
who you disagree with on different 

1906
01:23:25,351 --> 01:23:25,650
things and all that.
What,

1907
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,840
what sort of been the most personal 
thing that you've kind of struggled with

1908
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,160
along the way?

1909
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,350
I want to go deep before we open it up 
to the audience.

1910
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,390
Well,
for me it's two things.

1911
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:39,840
One is for,
it's not so bad now.

1912
01:23:39,841 --> 01:23:44,841
It's still pretty bad.
Like I've lived in constant existential 

1913
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:48,711
terror of saying something that will be 
fatal because I've been in this 

1914
01:23:48,841 --> 01:23:52,250
situation for 15 months where,
well,

1915
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:57,620
and there's been a few things that I've 
done or said that have people have 

1916
01:23:57,620 --> 01:24:00,180
argued skirted the edges and perhaps 
they did.

1917
01:24:00,181 --> 01:24:01,940
Because if you say 10,000
things,

1918
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,830
something's going to skirt the edge,
but I've been,

1919
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:09,980
I've had to watch myself in an intensely
hypervigilant manner to ensure that I 

1920
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,030
don't provide those who would like to

1921
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:18,410
provide those who regard me as their 
enemy with the tools to dispense with me

1922
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:23,770
and you know,
I have my family resting on me as well 

1923
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:23,770
as well as whatever else I happened to 
be doing.

1924
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:26,410
So that's been extraordinarily intense.
And the other thing is,

1925
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:31,411
is persistent feeling of surreal 
seriality that see one of this,

1926
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:36,880
one of the markers of posttraumatic 
stress disorder is that you can't 

1927
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,280
believe that what's happening to you is 
real.

1928
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:42,400
It's like I felt that for literally I 
felt that way every single day since 

1929
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,421
September of 2016.
And so I just cannot get accustomed to.

1930
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,730
Well,
even just to the scandals that I've been

1931
01:24:49,731 --> 01:24:52,130
involved in,
it's just one scandal after another,

1932
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,190
you know,
and I,

1933
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,680
I,
I don't know,

1934
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:57,820
I don't have a frame of reference within
which to put this.

1935
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,920
Yeah,
I think that I'll just briefly say for 

1936
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:02,920
myself,
I think,

1937
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:02,920
I mean both of those,
right?

1938
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,821
We're all afraid of the one thing that 
you're going to accidentally just 

1939
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:07,640
misspeak or say something right out of 
context.

1940
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:08,870
You wave a meeting,

1941
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:14,410
something stupid defending yourself in 
which you could certainly do.

1942
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:14,600
Right.

1943
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:16,580
He had been writing columns since I was 
17.

1944
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:23,140
No,
I know there's one line with you that 

1945
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:23,140
you wanted one tweet that you sent that 
you regret now and it's like,

1946
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,130
I don't need to read the tweet in the 
actual tweet thread.

1947
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:26,600
I explained exactly what I meant in the 
tweet,

1948
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:31,601
but nobody ever reads the next tweet 
that literally explains what I meant in 

1949
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:34,841
that tweet.
We don't even have to mention which 

1950
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:34,841
tweet to just add more fuel to the fire 
button,

1951
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:35,150
but very quickly because I do want to 
get to the,

1952
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,980
to the audience questions.
I think for me,

1953
01:25:36,981 --> 01:25:41,981
the second one is the one that I 
struggled with it this surreal one 

1954
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:43,550
that's sometimes I'll look and see what 
people are saying about Dave Rubin and I

1955
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,050
and then I for a moment I'm like,
wait a minute.

1956
01:25:45,051 --> 01:25:48,640
I'm Dave Rubin.
I don't think any of them.

1957
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,640
Even if I do think even if it's 
something they're nice saying about me,

1958
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:52,330
I'm like,
wait a minute,

1959
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:55,280
that to me and,
and also just the other part of,

1960
01:25:55,281 --> 01:25:55,970
you know,
we,

1961
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,750
we sort of live close to each other.
It'll proximity and I'll go out and,

1962
01:25:59,751 --> 01:26:04,751
you know,
the Petco will say something nice to me 

1963
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:04,880
and then for some reason they always,
they like Ben more but they look great.

1964
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:06,530
But like I go out and then I'm like,
wow,

1965
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:09,000
like the things that I'm doing has 
meaning to people.

1966
01:26:09,001 --> 01:26:11,870
Like there's a lot of built in pressure 
or at least for me,

1967
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:14,090
there's a lot of responsibility.
Yeah.

1968
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,520
Well I feel that too because now 
whenever I go somewhere people come up 

1969
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,110
and they almost always say the same 
thing.

1970
01:26:20,111 --> 01:26:21,640
They say,
you know,

1971
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,880
I was in a pretty dark place and I'd 
been listening to your lectures and 

1972
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:26,880
they've really helped.
Thanks a lot.

1973
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,730
And I think,
man,

1974
01:26:27,731 --> 01:26:29,180
if you could have your wish and you 
could,

1975
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,190
what strangers would say to you on the 
street?

1976
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,520
What a cool thing.
No kidding.

1977
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,850
But it's also kind of a terrifying thing
because you know,

1978
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,920
people have pinned,
well,

1979
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:40,720
let's say they've pinned their hopes on 
what I,

1980
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:43,030
what I'm saying,
that's the right way to say it,

1981
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:48,240
but in some sense that also means they 
pinned their hopes on me and like I'm 

1982
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,950
not by any stretch of the imagination 
perfect far from it.

1983
01:26:50,951 --> 01:26:55,290
And so I do live in constant terror of 
sinking my ship in a,

1984
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:58,540
in a know,
in a particularly awful manner.

1985
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:00,030
I still think that's the most likely.

1986
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,680
Oh No,
I wake you up again.

1987
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:04,880
This where you just wake up and terror 
in the middle of the night that somebody

1988
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:07,370
is going to take something that you said
out of context and you think,

1989
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:09,370
did I really say it exactly the way I 
meant to say it?

1990
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:11,390
That didn't mean that that.
Yeah,

1991
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:12,950
that's,
that's a definite thing.

1992
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:17,951
And then you and it that the upside is 
that people listen to what we're saying 

1993
01:27:17,951 --> 01:27:22,631
and take it seriously.
And the downside is that people are 

1994
01:27:22,631 --> 01:27:22,631
taking and taking it seriously.

1995
01:27:22,631 --> 01:27:24,340
So for you then,
would it be something,

1996
01:27:24,341 --> 01:27:25,750
I mean,
without getting too in the weeds,

1997
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:27,730
like saying related to security or 
something?

1998
01:27:27,731 --> 01:27:28,150
I mean,
you,

1999
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,710
when you travel now you have to have 
someone with you.

2000
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:34,940
I mean,
it's ridiculous that I filed under 

2001
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:35,370
surreal because I actually have never 
thought of myself as in serious physical

2002
01:27:35,371 --> 01:27:40,371
danger.
Even when people say you're serious 

2003
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:40,371
physical danger.
I think it was like this is America.

2004
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:43,941
Am I really in fiscal?
Like whenever I do these lectures and 

2005
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:46,341
I've got a security team of 10 people 
around me when I tell myself maybe it 

2006
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:47,910
was me whistling past the graveyard is 
I'm the safest guy in the room.

2007
01:27:47,911 --> 01:27:49,050
I'm older.
Um,

2008
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:50,880
but it's.
Yeah,

2009
01:27:50,881 --> 01:27:55,881
I mean that's weird.
The confluence of politics now is so 

2010
01:27:55,881 --> 01:27:55,881
odd.
I mean,

2011
01:27:55,881 --> 01:27:56,730
the last night during the state of the 
union,

2012
01:27:56,731 --> 01:28:01,731
they introduced trump as the president 
of the United States and I just find 

2013
01:28:01,731 --> 01:28:01,910
myself laughing out loud because what in
the world is going on?

2014
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:04,110
Like I forget that I liked a lot of the 
stuff he's doing,

2015
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,640
like what in the world?

2016
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,530
And,
and there's a,

2017
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:11,610
I was reading a book about Brahms the 
other day and in this book about Brahms,

2018
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:13,880
it talks about how he's hobnobbing with,
uh,

2019
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:18,920
with various other composers.
He's friends with Jacques and he is 

2020
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:18,920
fights with wagner and he's,
and he's,

2021
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,760
and he's walking in these circles and I 
thought,

2022
01:28:20,761 --> 01:28:22,350
wow,
that must have been a cool thing to walk

2023
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:27,351
in these circles.
And then I look around and I realized 

2024
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:27,351
that the people that I work with in 100 
years,

2025
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:27,351
this may be the people that they're 
writing about,

2026
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,260
right?
Is like.

2027
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:33,470
And that was the day that Shapiro got 
together with Ruben and George Pearson 

2028
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,980
and talked about deep issues of 
philosophy and you realize,

2029
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:36,660
well,
how did we end up in this position?

2030
01:28:36,661 --> 01:28:41,661
Like this is one of the issues of 
existential terror I have is are we the 

2031
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:45,681
best that we have to offer?
Like I look at all the people in the 

2032
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,180
White House for example,
I know like half the people in the White

2033
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:51,570
House and I think is this the pinnacle,
like are like,

2034
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:53,320
that's not a rip on the people in the 
White House.

2035
01:28:53,321 --> 01:28:56,130
That's some grip on humanity,
like is this the best that we can do?

2036
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:01,670
Am I even close to like,
why should I be in this position of 

2037
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,161
prominence?
Like there's got to be people smarter 

2038
01:29:04,161 --> 01:29:04,161
than am I mean a lot

2039
01:29:04,161 --> 01:29:07,130
of them.
There's a beautiful thing I would hope 

2040
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:07,130
and I got it.
I asked somebody this,

2041
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:07,920
so this thought experiment the other 
day,

2042
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:12,921
which would,
which would you prefer to be the 

2043
01:29:12,921 --> 01:29:14,841
smartest man in the DM civilization or 
the dumbest madness Martin civilization 

2044
01:29:14,841 --> 01:29:18,380
and I think I can honestly say I prefer 
to be the dumbest man in a smart 

2045
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,781
civilization and some sort of something 
disquieting about being seen anyway as 

2046
01:29:20,781 --> 01:29:22,260
one of the smart people and dumb 
civilization.

2047
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:22,820
Well,
you know what,

2048
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,080
there are literally thousands of people 
watching this live,

2049
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:30,081
obviously in that election is over the 
next couple of months and hopefully 

2050
01:29:30,081 --> 01:29:32,751
there will be some people that will come
up with some better ideas than Ben 

2051
01:29:32,751 --> 01:29:34,570
Shapiro and Jordan Olsen and Dave Rubin 
and we'll find something else do.

2052
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:35,640
All right.
Here's what we're gonna we're gonna.

2053
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:37,000
Take a quick little break.
Uh,

2054
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,490
I know already they're giving me the 
signal.

2055
01:29:38,491 --> 01:29:42,630
We have roughly 400 billion questions.
We will do our best to be brief.

2056
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,640
That's easy for you guys.
What we're known for.

2057
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,420
That's another thing.
I've known him for A.

2058
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:50,340
Alright,
so give us just like a minute or two.

2059
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,600
Hang tight right there.
Uh,

2060
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,490
the questions in a moment.

2061
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:10,380
Alright guys,
we're going to try to plow through as 

2062
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:10,380
many questions as possible.
As I said,

2063
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:11,980
Jordan is at the orpheum theater here in
downtown Los Angeles tonight.

2064
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:12,820
Um,
it's sold out already,

2065
01:32:12,821 --> 01:32:15,160
right?
There's gonna be riots outside.

2066
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:20,340
Uh,
but if you have a ticket you will see 

2067
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:20,340
Jordan later.
Uh,

2068
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:20,340
here we go.
All right,

2069
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:23,691
super chat for Jordan.
We're going to try to do these as 

2070
01:32:23,691 --> 01:32:26,041
quickly as possible.
I've recently taken your understand 

2071
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,310
myself personality test and scored very 
low in all aspects of agreeableness.

2072
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:32,490
I have the cognitive ability to emulate 
these aspects and do so for the benefit 

2073
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:36,271
of putting my kids in community here is 
emulation or enough or do I have to 

2074
01:32:36,271 --> 01:32:37,580
actually take the steps in showing and 
honestly showing,

2075
01:32:37,581 --> 01:32:37,660
okay.

2076
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:39,210
Agreeableness,
can you fake it?

2077
01:32:39,211 --> 01:32:40,760
Basically?
If,

2078
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:43,890
if,
if emulation is motivated by a,

2079
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,100
let's call it a noble aim,
the understanding that reciprocity is 

2080
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:52,521
necessary,
there is evidence showing that 

2081
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:52,680
disagreeable people do quite a bit 
better if they go out of their way to do

2082
01:32:52,681 --> 01:32:54,870
things for other people too.
They make that a practice.

2083
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,100
And the thing is,
is if,

2084
01:32:56,490 --> 01:33:01,490
if you're an introvert,
you have to become a conscious 

2085
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:01,490
extrovert,
right?

2086
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:01,680
If you're,
if you're,

2087
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:02,630
um,
so,

2088
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:07,640
and if you're disagreeable,
you have to become consciously 

2089
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:07,640
agreeable.
You can do it.

2090
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,520
And emulation is the first step to 
incorporating it,

2091
01:33:08,521 --> 01:33:13,521
I would say.
So if you're doing it to manipulate 

2092
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:13,521
people,
well that's okay.

2093
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:14,080
Different story,
man.

2094
01:33:14,081 --> 01:33:19,081
I mean there's,
there's a ton of people here that 

2095
01:33:19,081 --> 01:33:19,081
donated on super chat just to say hi and
thank you.

2096
01:33:19,081 --> 01:33:21,640
So hello to everybody.
I'm a quick one for band.

2097
01:33:21,641 --> 01:33:26,641
I think we've already hit this,
but any chance of a future discussion 

2098
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:26,641
with Milo?
No.

2099
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:26,830
Okay,
fair enough.

2100
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,270
Um,
have something to say.

2101
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,730
Okay.
Here's an interesting one.

2102
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:35,731
And Jordan,
during the break mentioned that we 

2103
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:35,731
should be doing a show on the future at 
some point.

2104
01:33:35,731 --> 01:33:40,080
Do you think like me,
that abortion and artificial 

2105
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:40,600
intelligence will eliminate humanity as 
we know it?

2106
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,780
I'm watching this new Philip k Dick 
thing on Hulu now,

2107
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:44,080
so

2108
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,330
I'm very,
very into it.

2109
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:49,420
Come on,
you can do it.

2110
01:33:49,421 --> 01:33:50,720
You're a Scifi guy.
You can get it.

2111
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:55,800
We could talk about Ai.
Ai is going to transform what human 

2112
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:00,031
beings are dramatically.
We're going to have to decide in what 

2113
01:34:00,031 --> 01:34:03,001
manner we want to be transformed and we 
should bloody well hope and pray that 

2114
01:34:03,001 --> 01:34:05,500
the people who are leading the 
technological revolution are careful and

2115
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:07,000
ethical.
People just don't.

2116
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,050
It hasn't.
That ship sailed.

2117
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:13,051
I mean,
I feel like we know already that that's 

2118
01:34:13,051 --> 01:34:13,051
not how it's going to be.
We know there's so many problems related

2119
01:34:13,051 --> 01:34:17,341
to the diversity memo and the algorithms
and all that already from the tech 

2120
01:34:17,341 --> 01:34:17,830
companies,
people working on these.

2121
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:23,090
You shouldn't be.
You should be terrified of this 

2122
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:23,090
transhumanism.
It's like,

2123
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:23,770
what do we want to turn into?
We need a vision of the future,

2124
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:25,570
which is why we need to talk about the 
future.

2125
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:29,140
What am I think one of the things we 
need to do collectively is to develop.

2126
01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:30,250
It's like,
okay,

2127
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,820
I believe that the human race can do 
anything it wants in the next 30 years.

2128
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,440
You know,
Gates was talking.

2129
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:37,960
Bill Gates was talking the other day 
about eradicating malaria.

2130
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:43,150
He's really set on eradicating the five 
major transmissible diseases that could 

2131
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:46,570
happen.
We could eliminate most of our problems.

2132
01:34:46,571 --> 01:34:47,200
It's like,
well,

2133
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:52,201
we should concentrate on the future that
we would like to have and try to bring 

2134
01:34:52,201 --> 01:34:55,291
it into being and then maybe we can get 
artificial intelligence to serve that 

2135
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:59,430
instead of serving whatever in Kuwait 
and pathological set of principles that 

2136
01:34:59,601 --> 01:35:01,950
it's serving now,
which we will suffer for it.

2137
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:02,650
Yeah.
Well,

2138
01:35:02,651 --> 01:35:07,651
let's cross our fingers.
What is the likelihood that the sjw 

2139
01:35:07,651 --> 01:35:09,610
postmodern left collapse will happen 
soon?

2140
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,270
Basically?

2141
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:15,430
Um,
I think that it's more likely than 

2142
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,430
people think it is.
I'll put it that way.

2143
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:19,001
I think that right now the,
the sjws think that they are on top and 

2144
01:35:19,001 --> 01:35:21,821
they think that they are ascendant and I
think that the growing popularity of 

2145
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:23,090
people who are not that,
especially among young people,

2146
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:28,091
I mean my entire audience is young 
people like legitimately mind higher 

2147
01:35:28,091 --> 01:35:28,250
audience is people who are under the age
of 40 and probably half.

2148
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:33,390
It's under the age of 25 and I would,
I probably imagined since him for you 

2149
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:33,390
Jordan,
um,

2150
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:33,880
you know,
I think that the,

2151
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:38,890
there's a whole group of young people 
who are just looking at this stuff and 

2152
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:40,340
innately saying I'm bored with it.
There's nothing here.

2153
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,460
And so I think there's a good shot that 
did the identity politics is actually an

2154
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:44,270
older person's game.

2155
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,220
Yeah.
Uh,

2156
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,880
all right.
You know,

2157
01:35:45,881 --> 01:35:47,350
we're,
we're only gonna do two more.

2158
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:48,670
What will,
we'll categorize,

2159
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:51,700
categorize all of these and maybe next 
time you guys are on,

2160
01:35:51,701 --> 01:35:52,290
we'll,
we'll get,

2161
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:54,090
we'll hit some of these.
Um,

2162
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,660
but we'll do two more because I think 
they're good.

2163
01:35:55,661 --> 01:35:57,310
They sort of hit right where we're going
here.

2164
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:59,020
Uh,
you both can answer this,

2165
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:00,190
but it's directed to you,
Jordan,

2166
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:04,330
any followup on your call earlier this 
month for students to stand up and leave

2167
01:36:04,331 --> 01:36:07,600
the classroom whenever the teacher 
mentions equity,

2168
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:12,601
diversity and justice,
and I know this is something you've 

2169
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:12,601
talked about a bit about how you deal 
with

2170
01:36:12,601 --> 01:36:14,560
college professor.
This was for junior high and high school

2171
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:16,120
kids to talk to their parents about.
Well,

2172
01:36:16,121 --> 01:36:21,121
I was trying to provide people with easy
markers to note that their children are 

2173
01:36:21,121 --> 01:36:21,760
being indoctrinated,
not educated,

2174
01:36:21,761 --> 01:36:22,270
and I said,
well,

2175
01:36:22,271 --> 01:36:24,580
if they're talk about equity,
diversity,

2176
01:36:24,581 --> 01:36:26,770
inclusivity,
white privilege or gender,

2177
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,980
it's time to leave the class.
And I,

2178
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:32,230
and now that didn't cause nearly as much
trouble that video is.

2179
01:36:32,231 --> 01:36:37,231
I thought it might be.
That's a pretty dangerous idea to be 

2180
01:36:37,231 --> 01:36:37,231
telling that to a 13,
14.

2181
01:36:37,231 --> 01:36:39,340
Yes.
But it's also dangerous not to tell them

2182
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:44,341
that.
And I mean it's particularly Germane in 

2183
01:36:44,341 --> 01:36:46,321
Ontario where the elementary teachers,
Federation of Ontario has explicitly 

2184
01:36:46,321 --> 01:36:49,720
developed a social justice curriculum 
with that name,

2185
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:54,810
whose explicit purpose is to transform 
kids from kindergarten to grade eight 

2186
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:58,831
into social justice activists.
They've even bent the selection of 

2187
01:36:58,831 --> 01:37:02,101
literature to promote that,
so they're perverting art for ideology 

2188
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:04,020
and that's the official policy,
the elementary teachers,

2189
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,790
Federation of Ontario,
if they're going to do that,

2190
01:37:06,791 --> 01:37:07,570
play that game.

2191
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:08,770
Then for me to say,
look,

2192
01:37:08,771 --> 01:37:13,771
here's five phrases that that are pretty
decently diagnostic.

2193
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:17,860
You can be pretty certain that if these 
topics come up in your class that you're

2194
01:37:17,861 --> 01:37:20,160
now into indoctrination territory.
Yeah,

2195
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:23,320
I think people should walk.
What's the risk though of saying that to

2196
01:37:23,321 --> 01:37:28,321
a kid that may come home and the parents
may not even understand these issues 

2197
01:37:28,321 --> 01:37:28,330
enough to defend risk,
risk everywhere,

2198
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:29,070
man,
it's,

2199
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,120
it's,
it's the risk of going along with it.

2200
01:37:31,121 --> 01:37:33,580
There's the risk of standing up against 
it and I believe,

2201
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:35,710
and that's why I've been doing what I've
been doing,

2202
01:37:35,711 --> 01:37:40,711
is that I believe that the risk of 
stating that this is dangerous and 

2203
01:37:40,711 --> 01:37:43,390
should stop is way less than the risk of
going along with it.

2204
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:45,050
All right,
so this is going to be.

2205
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:50,060
This is gonna be the last one for now.
We will pick this up at another point 

2206
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,750
and we also discussed during the break 
that maybe we can do some kind of live 

2207
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,110
thing together with this whole crew of 
people that we're talking about.

2208
01:37:54,111 --> 01:37:55,950
We'll see who we can get to that 
probably in la,

2209
01:37:55,951 --> 01:37:56,770
but we'll see.
Uh,

2210
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:01,970
this one,
I'm sure I've asked you some form of 

2211
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:01,970
this in our other interviews before,
but I think it's,

2212
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:03,210
it's the one that sort of handed this 
back to the,

2213
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,360
to the audience for both of you for some
time now.

2214
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:09,450
I've wanted to start doing something to 
protect liberty and western values,

2215
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:11,370
et Cetera,
but I have no idea where to start.

2216
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:15,270
What's the most useful thing I can do to
start as an average person?

2217
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:17,930
I mean,
I think that my answer,

2218
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:21,030
this is sort of the same answer as to 
what you just do in life generally.

2219
01:38:21,031 --> 01:38:26,031
Find something that you're good at,
find something you like to do and find 

2220
01:38:26,031 --> 01:38:26,490
something that's useful.
And where are those three things kind of

2221
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:27,590
conflate?
Well,

2222
01:38:27,591 --> 01:38:28,830
what are those three things?
Overlap.

2223
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:34,070
That's where you're going to be the 
happiest and that's where you're gonna 

2224
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:35,720
feel you're making a difference because 
if you only have two of those three 

2225
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,881
things,
then you're butting your head against a 

2226
01:38:37,881 --> 01:38:39,291
brick wall.
If you'd like to do something and you 

2227
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:39,291
think that it's going to influence other
people,

2228
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:39,291
but you suck at it,
it's not going to work for you.

2229
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:42,410
So try to openly identify your own 
skillset,

2230
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:44,400
find what it is that you're good at,
and then figure,

2231
01:38:44,401 --> 01:38:46,860
how do I use this skill set something 
I'm good at and enjoy doing?

2232
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,250
How do I use that for a purpose that is,
that is useful,

2233
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,920
and it sounds like you already have your
purpose.

2234
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:56,790
It's just a question of what can you do 
that that actually helps effectuate that

2235
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:58,650
purpose without knowing your skillset.
I don't know,

2236
01:38:58,651 --> 01:39:03,651
but if I knew your skillset,
then I could help define what you could 

2237
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:03,651
do with that to get from point a to 
point b.

2238
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,550
So I suspect you probably.

2239
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,270
Yeah,
but what about the courage,

2240
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,960
but I would just add a little bit to 
that.

2241
01:39:08,961 --> 01:39:12,770
It's like there are some things that you
will see that will bother you.

2242
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:16,130
Some of those are your problems.
That's why they bother you.

2243
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:21,270
Like there's lots of things in the world
that are happening that don't bother 

2244
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:21,270
you.
It's like they're not your problems.

2245
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:22,790
The things that bother you for some 
reason or your problems.

2246
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:27,290
Find something that bothers you,
that you could fix,

2247
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,390
that you could start fixing and start 
fixing it.

2248
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:30,440
That's,
that's it.

2249
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:32,900
And you know you should do it 
competently.

2250
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:36,110
Doing a domain where you're competent in
a domain where you're interested,

2251
01:39:36,111 --> 01:39:41,111
but there are things that you'll see 
around you that you think couldn't be 

2252
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:42,380
set right that you could set.
Right.

2253
01:39:42,381 --> 01:39:44,030
It's like,
go for it.

2254
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:49,060
You'll get good at it,
and then you will get bigger and bigger 

2255
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:49,060
things.
Right.

2256
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:49,060
That's,
that's,

2257
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:49,730
that's where to start.
Start small.

2258
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:50,840
You won't end small.

2259
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:56,340
I mean I can tell you in the most 
intimate way as you guys are now in my 

2260
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:56,340
house,
in my studio that we built,

2261
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,550
that's funded by the people that are 
watching this.

2262
01:39:57,551 --> 01:40:00,040
I just had an idea that I started 
talking about it.

2263
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:03,430
I started a youtube channel that 
literally everyone watching this can do.

2264
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,150
You start.
I mean,

2265
01:40:04,151 --> 01:40:09,151
look at the three of us.
We all started putting stuff out there 

2266
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:09,151
going,
is this going to work?

2267
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:12,780
None of us were greenlit.
I've never been greenlit or had any 

2268
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:13,540
respect from the industrial together.
Listen guys,

2269
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:14,800
it was a pleasure.
Really.

2270
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,480
What do you do before so you can take a 
nap.

2271
01:40:16,481 --> 01:40:18,220
Maybe.
I'm definitely going to take a nap.

2272
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,220
You don't take naps because Ben Shapiro 
take that nap.

2273
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:22,650
Yeah,
I have two kids.

2274
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:24,800
They're both and one just turned four 
yesterday.

2275
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,400
Take nap.

2276
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:27,870
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

2277
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,870
It's been a pleasure.
Guys will figure out some ways to expand

2278
01:40:30,871 --> 01:40:33,870
this to the wider group and do some live
events and everything else and we'll.

2279
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:36,690
We'll keep this conversation going.
Thank you guys for all the comments.

2280
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:38,280
I promise you.
We're gonna.

2281
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:41,220
We're gonna list everything out,
so whether you submitted on superchat or

2282
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:46,250
patron,
we'll try to get back to all this stuff 

2283
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,200
and when I do my live streams,
I'll try to address some of this 

2284
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:48,200
directly.
So thanks for watching and thank you for

2285
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,710
Youtube for actually allowing the stream
to be up.

2286
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,500
What are the chances were

2287
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,600
monetized by tomorrow.
Alright God,

2288
01:40:52,601 --> 01:40:55,300
I'd hate bet.
Luckily I haven't been demonetized is.

2289
01:40:55,301 --> 01:40:59,560
I don't have any ads sent me self select
that.

2290
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:00,520
Alright.
Alright great.

2291
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:02,460
Thanks everybody.
Nice.

2292
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:02,560
Good.
