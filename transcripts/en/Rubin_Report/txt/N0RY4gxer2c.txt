Speaker 1:          00:00:05       One of the things I'm most amazed by at the moment is how the ideas and issues that we're talking about every week here on the Rubin report are relevant, not just in America, but all over the world. The amount of email I'm getting from you guys across the globe, whether it's Sweden, Australia, Brazil, hungrier. Japan is actually staggering. It really seems to me that there has been a real awakening as to what being a free human being is all about. You are in charge of your own life and if you start with this simple premise, you can accomplish anything. While the discourse on social media may seem more toxic than ever, I see a growing dynamic group of people coming together through ideas and conversation regardless of where they were born or the color of their skin. We're partnering with learn liberty this week and our guest is Rajshree Agarwal.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       She was born in India to a traditional family only move to America where she now teaches about capitalism at the University of Maryland where she is the chair and professor of entrepreneurship. She believes that capitalism provides maximum freedom and happiness to all people regardless of race, religion, or anything else, the ideas of freedom that one sparked in her as a young child or the same ideas that she's now helping further by teaching minds of young people today. That is what freedom is all about. If you want to join me in spreading these ideas of freedom and individuality in person, I will be joining Jordan Peterson on his 12 rules for life tour for as many dates as I can possibly fit in. We kicked off the tour a couple of weeks ago at the beacon in New York City where the energy in the room was absolutely bananas. I'll be traveling with Jordan to the UK to speak in London at the Apollo Hammersmith Theater on May 13th, and then on May 14th, I have the incredible honor of speaking at the Oxford Union.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Hopefully I'll get to meet as many you guys as possible and I also promised to down as many points as possible. I'm also working on an Australian tour and hope to have some more info on that for you guys soon. You know, I've mentioned on the show lately that the endless hysteria of the left and the politically correct craziness that we're caught up and was eventually going to drag me back into standup comedy and this finally came to fruition this past Sunday at the Irvine Improv. The show is billed as an evening of stand up and sit down as I did about an hour of standup and then Bob Saget joined me on stage for about 45 minutes of a sit down. It was awesome. Meeting so many you guys out there in the show was a huge success. The manager of the Improv even told me that it was the first sold out, standing ovation.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       She seen at the club in her 18 years. We're going to announce travel dates for upcoming standup gigs pretty soon and I hope that you guys will join me for at least a two drink minimum and plenty of laughs. And finally, after years in the making, we taped our interview with Dr Thomas Soul yesterday on location at Stanford University in San Francisco. We flew our whole team up there and rented a studio to make it happen. It was truly a personal and career highlight for me and I can't wait to share our sit down with you next week. Big thanks to our supporters on Patrion who make interviews like this, so all these announcements aside, whether a year in the US, India, Oxford, San Francisco, or anywhere else, we're all in this fight together. Keep fighting for what you believe in and I'll do the same. We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty today and joining me is the root of p lamone chair and professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland as well as the director for the Ed Snider Center for Enterprise and Economics. Rajshree Agarwal. Welcome to the Rubin report.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       Thank you for having me. Dave.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       I feel we're going to have a very good talk because we've already sort of had the interview before we started. We've been doing it already. I'm looking forward to this because we did meet once before we were at a conference in DC that was sort of focusing on academia and free speech and we spent a couple of minutes talking and what I thought was interesting. Yeah, I don't think you knew who I was beforehand and that I didn't know who you were before hand and they sort of brought me there to talk a little bit about how youtube plays a part in reaching young people and technology and all that and you were very interested in that. So we didn't really focus on free speech together, but we focused on how technology is shifting the conversation a so just very quickly to start, why are you interested in how technology is affecting the conversation related to free speech capitalism? The whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       So I'm not interested in technology per se, but I'm interested in technology because it represents the manifestation of the human mind at work. Ultimately, what is technology? Technology is better machines, but what our machines ultimately, whether they are fast computers or whether they're the industrialized age engines or whatever you call it, right? They are ways for us humans to make our lives easier by using machines. So technology ultimately is a way for humans to communicate better, to live better lives and to use their mind in doing so. So I study innovation. I study technology because it enables us to be the best we can be by using our mind.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       I was very proud when you walked in here because you study innovation and entrepreneurship and this is my garage that we turned into a studio. So I thought

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       yes, and think about all of the creativity that went into it, right? Not just by you, but all of the thing, all of the, the techniques the machines had, we're looking around. It was someone's mind that had to come up with it first. So creativity, which is at the heart of individual enterprise is what I love. And that's what I study.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       All right? So that's what we're going to spend most of this hour talking about that. Uh, and you know, when we do these shows with learn liberty, they always send me just a quick one page bio and everybody and I really loved years. There was a bunch of quotes in there that I, that I want to quote directly to you, um, but

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       no, that when they asked me to write that bio, I dish that out in about 15 minutes at 4:30 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       Oh, look at you patting yourself on the back saying, well, this was really good when you got here. But first let's talk a little bit about your history because you have an interesting history. You were born in India and you lived there for that, for your first 21 years. Tell me a little bit about that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       Well, um, I was born to a very, very traditional family, Hindu family. My father was your typical rags to riches entrepreneur. He embodied enterprise and he, in fact, I'll tell you about this one story. I was in fifth grade and I came home so upset because the history lesson that I had just heard was all about how the United Kingdom, Britain came in and just plundered his Golden Pico. That was Indian. Look at all the nasty things that they did to us and how oppressed and victimized we were. And my father, who was a very much a traditional Orthodox Hindu at that time said, no, actually Britain did more good for India than they did bad. And it's like, Huh, what do you mean by that? And he went on to talk about why before that it's true that India was rich, but what does rich mean? It meant that the kings and the traders were rich, but then also very feudalist economy at that time.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       And of course they were also very balconies because each of these kingdoms were fighting with each other. So one of the things that he talked about is how the advent of the British, you know, they bought the rule of law, they bought infrastructure, they gave us English as a language. You know, often people, my husband says, Oh wow, you talk better English than I do. And it's like, yes, that's because I was educated in English as well. But at the same time that he was such a entrepreneur in his mindset, he was very traditionalist in his views of how a woman should be. And so when I was 12 years old, he said to me, the right and the responsibility of finding a husband for you is mine, don't you forget that. And of course any woman in his family couldn't work because that was a slap on his face in his ability to provide for us.

Speaker 2:          00:08:27       But if you think about it at 12 years old and being told that the two biggest decisions any individual can make for themselves who you marry and what you choose to work in. And I, and I, and I tell you know, I'd like to think that those two decisions under grid, everything that we do both at work and they're not work life that we live. If those are taken away from you, what does that mean about you as an individual? You as a person. So between 12 and 18, I had to navigate that distance because at 12 years old I was a daddy's girl. Instead, of course, dad, just please do me a favor. Find me a husband who lives in Bombay because I can't even bear the thought of being in a city that's different from you. And at 18 I had to see for myself that I couldn't renege on that decision, so between 18 and 21 was really my discovery of who I wanted to be. And at 21 I left India, two suitcases in my hand left everybody that I loved, a very generous inheritance and my father did not speak to me for seven years.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       Wow. I mean there's, there's so much there of your formative stuff that, that leads you to where you're at right now. When you came home that day in fifth grade, you learned something in school and then you hear something different from your father who you obviously respected and admired and had, as you said, rags to riches had provided a good life for you guys. How did you go back to school after that? I mean, did you go back and start arguing with teachers?

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       Oh, I was always arguing with. I was. In fact, I remember my science teacher saying Rajshree, why do you ask so many wise?

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       Pretty sure that's not what a science teacher. You're supposed to say that. That's really fascinating. So you picked up and left and left an inheritance. All of this, you get to America. Just tell me a little bit about that initial experience.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       So, uh, for me, uh, this was, um, freedom. Uh, it was, you know, I had lived in India, especially in the generation that I was in. A woman didn't go or a woman did not live by themselves, right? The God, they stayed with their parents still. They were married and then they went to their husband's house. So the concept of really being yourself and having the responsibility to make your own choices is both liberating. But then I also realized I can't blame my parents were my mistakes anymore. Indeed. Oh, five years later I've been my mom, or six years later when my mom came to visit with us, my husband said, you know, what is the one biggest difference that you've seen your daughter? And this will tell you a little bit about my personality there too. She says to him, she's become very responsible.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Wow, that's fascinating guy.

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       And she's uses this as evidence. She says, you know, are her father used to give her a very generous allowance, but we were, we would marvel at the fact that this kid would go through this allowance within 10 or 12 days and then she'd say, I'd like more and then her father would sometimes give it and sometimes there's no, that's all you're going to get. So then come to me or she'd come to her brother or I started to Taylor because I often said I owned my own bread and butter, but my father provided we met with the jam. Right. But, uh, one of the things that she said was, now she looks at me and she's realized is just how responsible that become. That where before money would just flow off of my fingers and I wouldn't give it a second thought. I had become so much more responsible in my thinking and I think she was talking a lot more about than just money in India.

Speaker 2:          00:12:24       I was rebelling because I was fighting against something. I came to the United States. I didn't have to fight against anything. So I had to figure out who I was. And what I really wanted to be and it allowed me to thrive. So you mentioned you didn't talk to your father for seven years after that. It had the reconciliation it or was it a reconciliation? Reconciliation? In fact, one of the things that I really, really treasure is, um, you know, for the, I was a daddy's girl and I did want his approval and after I got my phd, I remember this one conversation that I had with him where I was the prodigal daughter. He was just finally talking to me again. I think he'd given up on the fact that I would be this person that would ultimately come home with my tail between my legs and say, you know, you were right.

Speaker 2:          00:13:13       I was wrong. He just completely given up on that. And so he was listening to me and of course I was trying to impress him. So I was talking to him about all of these achievements as a young assistant professor. I had received a couple of awards. I was getting to go to these prestigious conferences and he's listening, but there's silence on his side. And the more I'm talking, the more he silent and then finally I just gave up. I had nothing more to brag about or talk about and I wasn't getting the. I'm so proud of you from him. And so there was this uncomfortable silence after which he says it's a phrase in Hindi which roughly translated says if a peacock dances in a forest who sees. So who cares? And his point to me was, you can be all of the peacock, you are, but if you're not next to me, it doesn't mean anything.

Speaker 2:          00:14:10       So that was the harshness that we started off with, even in the reconciliation. But my last visit with him paradoxically was when I was asked to give a keynote in India. This was immediately after India's liberalization. It was trying as an economy that we now know it to be. And so I was asked to give a keynote at an academic conference on entrepreneurship and economic growth. And so on my way to this conference, I stopped by and 10 years after I had done my phd, I'm finally talking to my father about my research and connecting it to his own entrepreneurial spirit and him being a serial entrepreneur and I can finally see the pride in his eyes. I got there and then add the keynote at the end of this thing. When you go to India, you realize that when you give a speech, they will give you a present. So in front of about 500 people, they give me this president that I opened and believe it or not, it's a peacock.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       Seems fitting seems there's so much there and it's so obvious hearing this story, how it led to all of the things that you're teaching about now and care about the concept between the battle between sort of traditionalism and then the entrepreneurial spirit is really a fascinating one because he obviously had that. Yes, he built something for himself, built a good life, and then still wanted that piece of sort of the old world. And I think we all kind of struggle with that in a way. Maybe that's what the struggle of western civilization is and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:15:44       I actually think that this relates to often the need to think and integrate one psychological growth with one's growth in the material and in the Richard Israel. So one of the things that I think my father was as a paradox unfortunately, and I think that caused him as well as me, so much of this angsty between us, is that at the same time that he applied his intellect into the economic realm, he psychologically did not necessarily realize that, you know, part of the reason he was successful is because he was able to make his own decisions, which also meant the freedom to make your own mistakes and learn from your mistakes. So why he allowed that there as far as family was concerned. There was this very protectionist, I need to take care of you, but that I'm realizing this as a parent is not very conducive to your children's growth because what you really need to give them are the tools to make their own decisions as opposed to telling them, you know, this is the way you should do it.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       Yeah. And ironically, had you not broken away and been free, although, although he may have been very pleased with your life and who knows what your life would be and maybe you maybe you would be happy in some ways it wouldn't have led you to all this, so you had to directly have to do that. So. So one more thing about India before we move on to everything else that you're doing. A I told you right before we started that I can a ton of fan mail from India. I think there's some really interesting political things happening right there that seemed to be driving people to watching shows like this. Just give me one thing that we should know about India right now that maybe we don't know as Americans, which I think is probably probably everything because India never comes up in the new Israeli.

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       So. So I can talk about India right now a little less than I can talk about the India that I grew up in and why growing in India actually fostered my entrepreneurial spirit. Okay. So we can do it a little bit of a little bit of that. Right. And I think that that is one of the aspects. It's definitely selection at play, but I do think that across every culture people, individuals are born Tabula Rasa, some cultures are much more conducive to having the entrepreneurial spirit bloom and as a result you see people go so much farther. But there are other cultures and other cultures stifle it. But as individuals, I think we all have the same proclivity to be the persons that we can be. But one of the things that I always credited in my education in India is the focus on thinking and critical thinking and intellectual ism.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       So the concept of a nerd growing up for me was unheard off because the, the coolest kids were also the ones that participated in science and elocution debates. You know, I was always at the forefront. I wasn't so much of a sportsperson right. But I was very much in debates in elocution competitions and science competitions and so on. And that was cool. That wasn't considered rural United States. Right. So the concept that there's a node and a node is socially awkward, which was unheard of for me. I'll give you another example. You know, my brother was the one that first talked to me about Iran and of course in that journey that I was telling you about where I had to find my own identity reading atlas shrugged was really the pillar of strength and helped me identify my own sense of life. But the way I read atlas shrugged you'd find very funny is I'm in colleges in India.

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       If you're a guy and you want to impress a chick, you carry, at least in my time, a paperback novel of Atlas shrugged in your back pocket because that means if you're intellectually you're thinking now. I was also said it was also sad. That's so fascinating to me. Right? And, and, and it's also said, well, if you're young, then you believe in these views, but then you grow up and you grow over it. I had never grown over it. I think that that aspect of the mind, uh, the ability to think through decisions is one that I will credit the Indian culture and my father for endowing in me.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       Yeah. Well you'll be happy to know, as I mentioned to you before that you know, I was at the students for liberty conference and I met several students from India who were there that are involved with Iran, instituted in that consider themselves objective isn't all that and it seems that some of those ideas at least are thriving there. So that brings it into the modern day. Okay. So as I mentioned, I really loved your bio and they were a couple of great quotes in there. So I want to read one directly to you. You said my passion is upward mobility integrated across intellectual, psychological and economic realms. I cared deeply about growth. Achievement for me is measured not by the level you have attained as much as the road you have traveled. For me, the journey is the destination and I cared deeply about integrity as in the whole of a person rather than the individual part.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       And I thought there's obviously a lot there, but it seems to me that this is sort of what we're missing these days. We've got people that are just screaming at each other all the time that everyone's pretending they're an expert in everything. Nobody sort of listening. Um, you know, I've been traveling with Jordan Peterson allowed who's talking so much about what I think is such simple stuff in a certain way, although he's quite brilliant at it. You were talking about personal responsibility and being a full person. And I thought that that was really what you were getting to.

Speaker 2:          00:21:35       Yes. So, um, what's the question?

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       So the question is, well, I guess I sort of know why you came to believe this, but we seem to have a real lack of an ability to be a full integral part

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       these days. I think in part it really relates to this entrepreneurial mindset and a growth mindset. And for me personally, that is, um, a perspective that is in some sense, selfish. Let me explain by what I mean by that. And I mean selfish in a very positive way here. Oh, I am right now in endowed professor. I'll just give you an example of it, right, and I get to mentor a lot of young minds and many of them come to my office, particularly Phd Students, uh, with this mindset of I know so much it is true, I know a lot, but think about the interaction between a student and a professor where if the professor says, I know everything, you're my student and you're going to learn from me. It's a one way street. It's the student benefiting from the professor with that mindset. But how has the professor benefiting from it?

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       Where is my learning? Where is my growth? So in this conversation, one of the ways that I approach this relationship is I see you have to start this conversation thinking of each other as intellectual equals. I may know more than you, but especially in the realm of research which is creating new knowledge. I need you to have an questioning mind because what happens if you're saying something that I want to challenge, and after all in academia, we are in the marketplace for ideas. If I challenge you and your mind immediately shuts down because you say, oh, Rajshree said this, she's the expert professor. She knows everything and you're not going to challenge me, then you're not allowing yourself to learn. But more importantly, if I know that about you, I'm going to shut myself down and I am going to send so myself from expressing my ideas because I want your mind to be open. So now we both lose. And the bold silenced ourselves. So this is just one example of where I think that this, um, this focus on growth and on learning is actually very liberating. And in that sense, very selfish for me because now like with them is a two way street. I'm not just teaching, I'm also learning how do you get

Speaker 1:          00:24:12       over the concept that selfishness is somehow evil? That I think a lot of people believe this inherently. You say, well, I'm selfish, or they think, well, you're evil.

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       So this actually relates to one of this point about the lack of integration or this, uh, uh, thinking about either or. So the common concept of selfishness is as in, well, you're only thinking about yourself and not thinking about the other. Why, why does it have to be an eternal? Why cannot it be a wind when trade, which is fundamentally recognizing your dignity, my dignity, your identity, my identity and knowledge that should we, you know, right now you and I are talking, why are we sitting here and having this conversation other than the fact, of course that, uh, you know, we're, we're passionate about these ideas and we find that our time together is meaningfully well spent. So much enjoyment out of this conversation is not at your expense. Neither is what your gaining outfitted my expense. In fact, we're creating value together.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       But you brought it into this room because that. That's exactly right for me at least. It's like in a way I'm doing something selfish in that. I'm doing my show. I'm bringing a guest on that will hopefully get people to watch. Right? And you're here because you want your ideas to spread. The people that are watching this hopefully are getting something out of it for themselves. I mean, that's what people really need to understand that that's what's integral about this. It doesn't mean we're taking from you. It actually means that we're giving to ourselves and something.

Speaker 2:          00:25:50       Yes. And so for me, this notion that selfishness means this brute that is just going to ride roughshod over everybody else's rights and responsibility fundamentally does not get to this idea that each of us have our right to live our lives the way we see best and you know, take the consequences, good or bad, all our decisions.

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       How much of this do you think is about just whether people view humans fundamentally as good or evil? So if you fundamentally think people are evil and you say to someone, be selfish, well then it is that they're going to run roughshod over everybody and destroy the environment and steal money and kill people and all that versus if you believe people are fundamentally good or at least neutral than if they do something for themselves, it will potentially be

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       for themselves. Me, the only evil is really the use of force to, um, throttle somebody else. You can do what you want to do. So long as you're not infringing on other people's rights and responsibilities and their ability to live their life the way they do and indeed in a civil society that is the fundamental respect that we all each other that I live my life the best way that I think is done, but I'm not going to impose my views on you. I may have a conversation with you about my views and you're free to agree or disagree with my views and free to agree or to interact or not with me, but I can't force my views and my beliefs on you and neither should you force. I mean that's fundamentally the conversation between my father and I didn't think about it, right. It is that we were both very aligned in our views 80 percent of the time, but the 20 percent where he thought that as a father he had the right to tell me what I should do as opposed to be the facilitator and guide an advisor to my decisions. That is the fundamental disconnect.

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       Do you think we spend too much time on that 20 percent or you know, I think I heard Barry Weiss on real time called the narcissism of small differences where we, we can agree on almost everything philosophically and then we find something. Yes. And then that is what we focus on our level

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       and it really depends upon, is that something in a hierarchy of your values, a fundamental issue that you do need to disagree on or is that something in the hierarchy of your values and your beliefs? Something that is not as critical to the conversation that we're having. So I prefer a indeed. I am a big believer in win-win outcomes. Um, I don't, you know, my husband is my best friend. I love him. The last thing I would want is for him to say Rajshree, I'm with you. Not because it gives me any selfish joy, not because I get any pleasure. I take pity on you. I feel sorry for you. And that's why my life's objective is to take care of you. Do you want a relationship? I walk out the door, I'd say, if I am not giving you personal satisfaction and joy in being with me, if I'm not your best friend, just like your mind, then this relationship is not a win win and I don't want to be either an object of charity or a or pity or A. I don't want you to feel like you're obligated,

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       so I want to backup to say you said a few minutes ago about the way that you teach and that exchange between professor and student where it's sort of you're trying to look at each other as equals. I might learn something from them and they might learn something from me. So. So two parts of that. First all, how often do you find that you actually learned something? Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:29:48       every time. Indeed. Last year, University of Maryland honored me with a distinguished scholar teacher award and one of my first slides was about exactly that. The debt that I owe to my advisor who incidentally gave me away when Robin and I got married. I remember my father wasn't talking to me. My advisor was my second father and so I learned a lot from him and I have benefited from that learning off a mentor advisor relationship, but I have benefited equally from paying it forward so every one of my phd students I can pinpoint to you exactly what ideas they helped me learn which empirical context and innovative industries I went into along with them and how my own scholarship has fundamentally benefited and even change trajectories because of my phd students.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       So the second part of that then would be do you think that is a real rarity on college campuses these days that that professors are willing to learn from students because when I go to colleges, which I'm doing all the time now, one of the things I hear most is that students are actually afraid to challenge their professors because they think it's going to hurt their grades and that generally just generally speaking, this seems to come from more leftist professors that if you challenge them on intersectionality or or any of that, that people actually think their grades will suffer. Do you think that that's

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       a broad problem in academia? It is. Unfortunately, I, you know, I, there is this part of me in my soul that says that just cannot be true. Please let this not be true because the fundamental identity, often academic should be one which is focused on learning and focused on ideas and indeed I would say that one requires a confidence and a self esteem and to be comfortable with being challenged and so often I do have several colleagues that I worry about in as much as they don't make good advisors and part of the reason they don't make good advisors is not because they are not experts in their sphere, but precisely because they cannot stand being challenged by their students and in my opinion, that's a lose lose. Not only are you stymieing the students' growth, you signing your own growth.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       Yeah. So when you hear people talking about the free speech issues on college campuses and at the conference that we were at, I mean there were literally hundreds of professors there to talk about how do we defend free speech. That was the whole purpose of it. Do you sense that something has shifted in the last couple of years? Does it seem worse?

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       I give you my own personal story. About three years, two years ago, I ended up writing an op Ed in the Washington Post on confessions of a silenced professor. Now you've heard me these last 15, 20 minutes. Anyone that knows me says Rajshree you silence. Give me a break. Easily silenced. Exactly. And indeed part of the team off that ipad was a very important self realization that I had. And that was a, that I was now starting to think, do I really want to take this on? And it was a colleague of mine who we were just having a conversation about something that had happened at a conference, uh, and she said to me and I was like, you know, I'm wondering, should I weigh in on this or should I just let it go? And the point is not what the issue was. The point is that I even asked that question, which is what this colleague said to me, she says, Rajshree, when did you become so afraid of speaking your mind?

Speaker 2:          00:33:48       And that really hit me in my gut, if you will. It's like, when did I start thinking if I do this, what's going to be the fallout within the academic circles? Should I repress myself? And that's when I realized that the spiral of silence where we ended up. So, you know, you can talk about censorship. I actually think at the University of Maryland, I am in a great university president on down. We have a investment and a dedication to words, freedom of speech, and thinking about the academia as a marketplace for ideas. So great to hear it. I, I mean, I just, before I came here, I had a phenomenal conversation with the president, uh, regarding an event where we're worried about whether or not there is going to be some backlash because of some of the people I've been bringing in in a debate. But for us it's very important to have that reasoned and respectful discourse.

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       But for me it was, you know, people from the outside can tell you whatever they want. But when you start to silence yourself, that's when you silence your mind. That's when you don't let your innovative creativity. What is freedom of speech about it is not in the freedom to agree. It's the freedom to disagree, but doing so in a manner, and again, coming back to this use of force, right? I can say what I want. I am not. You know, I, I in college campuses these days, one of the things that they say is, well, words can hurt. You know, I was in a convent and the teachers used to say, sticks and stones can break my bones, but words don't hurt me. Right? And yes, words do have power. I'm not denying that for sure. Several of the things that father said to me psychologically will very wounding and I had to work through that. So I'm not denying the fact that words in the psychological and intellectual ram are very powerful, but the point is, is a fundamental difference between words and coercion. As in now I am forcing you to think otherwise because words are fundamentally our minds thinking and then communicating with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       We've had a long sort of slippery road on this, right? Where people are starting to think that words mean action or that you have some sort of right to not be offended or a right to comfort. I mean you just simply don't have.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       I think actually, oh, it's the converse is true. You need to be courageous to look at something and say, this doesn't accord with my beliefs, so you know, they. Let me use a different analogy out here. People often talk about open versus closed mine. I actually think neither of those concepts make sense because what is a closed mine that is the professor that you and I were just talking about who says, I'm right? How dare you challenge me? I've made up my decision already. Right? But an open mind is someone that's just sitting on the fence, not willing to take any kind of a committed stand. In fact, I would prefer a close mind to an open mind in that way. Right? But what I really care about is an active mine that I have some opinions, some beliefs, and they're based on the prior thinking that I have done, but I'm not omniscient. I'm not infallible. I could have made mistakes in my thinking, so having an active mind allows me, the, gives me the permission to say I do have these thoughts and beliefs, but if someone provides me with compelling evidence and compelling logic that would make me change my thinking, then it isn't my best interests to do so.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       You know, it's funny. I find I often, I sit across brilliant people all the time and every now and again someone dropped something that I think, wow, that's what I've been trying to get to active mind. I mean I'm going to start using that phrase because that's right. You don't just want an open mind of, of endless nothing actually. And you don't want to close my but an active mind. Keep. Keep working. Yeah. So I want to ask you one other thing on it. So then I really want to focus on all this stuff that you're teaching for the whole second half. What do you think the actual solution is related to this? So if a, if a professor like you has this sudden need or fear of self censoring and I get. It's pretty obvious to me how open and courageous you are inherently. Um, what do you think the solution is? And when we were at this conference, a lot of the professors were saying this has to come from the donors because the administrators at the schools cannot be brave enough if they think that their jobs are on the line all the time. But that the one way to do it is that if the donors are slowly turning off the money to professors that won't defend free speech or administrators who won't back the professors who do that. That might be though

Speaker 2:          00:38:48       the chain. Does that make sense to you? Yes, and I disagree with it, but let me explain to you why I disagree with it. Oh,

Speaker 2:          00:38:59       you cannot. So this comes back to the first question you asked me. Why do I focus on integrity and why do I think about economics, which is money and donors along with psychological and intellectual growth. For me, you cannot have one without the other. These are pieces of an entire, uh, that, that fit together to make an integrated whole within academia. One always has to worry about the fact that you've got all of these pressures, pressures for conformity, pressures for funding and resources that are coming in there would you really care about and which you cannot renege if you are an intellectual entrepreneur, which is truly what being in academia is all about. Being an intellectual entrepreneur is your unwavering focus on knowledge, creating knowledge, and if I, if I may say so, untruth

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       resources, just like any venture capitalist, so this intellectual entrepreneur, maybe a good analogy, actually venture capitalists provide you with the financial resources, but they are complimentary resource providers. They cannot tell you which direction should you go, nor should they right? If you don't have that creative mindset, that intellectual horsepower, if you're not courageous enough to go for that, then any kind of pressure from the venture capitalists is not going to help nor are any kind of pivots and directions and so on. So the way I look at it is I do not and will not ever change my research based on what donors may or may not give. On the contrary, I will look for aligned to donors because you cannot put the cart before the horse. You cannot put your purpose behind the money or the success metrics of your purpose. Your purpose has to drive all of the other resources that you garner. So if an administrator lacks courage, that's on the administrator first and foremost. If an academic lacks courage of conviction, that's on them. You can have complimentary people aligned with you kind of helping you along the way, but they cannot substitute for that fundamental drive that you need to have.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       All right? So everything that we spent the first 30 some odd minutes talking about, it sort of leads to academic integrity. It sounds like to me that these, that we need not only the students to have some integrity, but the administrators, that professors, everything else, everyone at the university altogether. Do you think that's a fair?

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       That's what I expect you to do? Absolutely. In fact, um, I think that we often confuse the terms academic freedom and academic integrity. Would we really care about is academic integrity first and foremost, and academic integrity really means that I'm not going to sell my soul or my ideas based on the highest bidder. I believe that, you know, and this is again the search for truth that requires integrity and then of course I have the freedom to collaborate with people, including donors on areas where we find mutually beneficial relationships and when, when trade.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Yeah. So one of the things that you talked about, and I referenced it earlier in one of these quotes are that you really focused on is upward mobility. Yes. And it, I think it's particularly interesting right now because if you listen to some of our political leaders, it seems like we've sort of completely lost the ability that we were separated by class and all that. You come from a place where upward mobility was very hard. Um, it's gotten less hard as they've embraced as India's embrace capitalism first. I guess in the most broad sense, tell me why you think upward mobility is so important, but more importantly, what's the state of it in America right now?

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       So I actually think that we in the United States, focus on upward mobility as if this was a major problem in the US. Other countries are becoming more market oriented than the United States. The United States still stands as the one place where you really, really have the ability to be upwardly mobile and I think that is the greatest asset that the United States still have. And I'm very proud to call this country my country of choice.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       So let, let's sit in that idea for a second because I totally agree with it and it seems to me that all of the people who say that's not true are missing, that are laws here allow you to do whatever you want with your life. It doesn't mean that you are going to do it. It doesn't mean that it's going to be handed to you, but as you just said, as an immigrant that came here, that is become tremendously successful. You're living proof that you can do it.

Speaker 2:          00:44:04       Absolutely. And that still holds. In fact, in some ways I think we so take these laws for granted that we don't know what the rest of the world is out there, so my daughters have grown up and been born in the United States, but I think that their biggest learning moments come when they leave the country and see things even in India today as they as it exists, these see the disparities of the things that they can take for granted were Susan India, but you still have to fight with the corruption. You still have to fight with these status aspects. The United States is very status free relative to most other countries, including India and there's a dignity to human labor here that is often missing in many other cultures. That is the aspect that I care about when I care about upward mobility and you know what? Let's be honest.

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       Out here I did not have the kind of privileges that my daughters too. I could've been more on the fact that, you know, I came from a country or from a traditional family values that I had to have the family tradition. There was such that I had to have this fight that for sure defined me positively, but also class some psychological scars and of course my hope is that my daughters don't go through that and I could go there and say, you know, of the level at which they're starting off is so much higher than the level I'm starting off and are they privileged and look at all that I didn't have or I can focus their minds and their ideas and you know, you may start here, but the definition of your achievement is not your level, but where you end, you find it fascinating that people are constantly attacking that they are.

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       They attack people that have a little bit more to start with, which is the whole point of life. You want your children to have more. The only way that it would be fair it is not because I can be raised to their level. The only way to do it is to bring them down to the level that I started. And is that fair? Right. And so again, by focusing on the level that one starts with as a measure, often individually achievement, I think is not necessarily focusing on their individual effort and a lot of people. Um, even in India, um, you know, as I said to you, my father went from rags to riches and there were a lot of people that, that were my friends. Then we're quite rich and they had a very entitlement mentality. I don't think that they're any happier than I was even when I was poorer.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       So this comes back to the point that you, the quote that you had, I can just measure a person's success by their economic riches. You also happiness, which is what I care about, is a state of mind. It's a state of consciousness that has to be earned. Self esteem then combined with the sense of I'm a materially at a place that I'm comfortable or rich, but more than that, psychologically and intellectually, I feel like I've made something of myself. I think that is something that is so much more inspiring to go after money. And Snyder used to say money is the reward. Not The reason, and I completely agree with that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:34       Yeah, it's so interesting because I've been thinking about this a lot lately because obviously the show is kind of catching fire and I'm doing okay financially and we're building something good and I'm traveling a lot. People say Nice things to me all the time and I've been thinking about that and people keep saying, well, you're going to get some big offer from one of these networks or something. And it's like, I hope I do too, but I love this. Like I'm actually happy now, like I'm doing what I think I'm supposed to be doing and I don't know where that road goes, but looking at everything holistically, it's not just about money, it's about doing something that gives you value at all that uh, but we, we seem not to focus enough.

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       But that's the point, right? I get so much joy. So again, to that quote that you were talking about, for me, the journey is the destination. You know, whether I would, I feel younger today than I did when I was 20 years old. And what's the big difference? I feel like I have earned the self esteem, not recognition outside because people you know and you know this, you need a lot of people and they come to you and say, Hey Dave, you're so great, but who is saying your great makes a big difference to you hearing whether you see what I mean. So there has to be a sense of do I believe that your saying I'm great for the reasons that I value and if that is there, then I will take external adulation as a positive. If not, it's hollow. It's empty. So self esteem is truly what one should be striving for.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Yeah. Do you think at some level capitalism and maybe the western world in a wider sense is suffering from success at the moment that it almost seems like because we've been so successful, we're now going to that place that we mentioned earlier where we're just fighting over little differences were then. There's a lot of people right now. I mean if you talk about socialism on college campuses, you'll, you'll sell out the room, you know, and if you talk about. Fortunately, I find when I go and I mostly talked to libertarian or capitalist or whatever groups, you know, we're, we're doing quite well as well, but that the ideas that are completely contrary to everything you've just said seemed to be gaining some momentum,

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       so I don't think they're victims of our success. I think we're victims of the fact that we have never really sat down and thought seriously about the reasons for our success and by eschewing that intellectual thought and ideas that under underpin our success, we have actually sold our success. Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       How should we have done that? Do you mean on that? Our politicians should have talked about it more or you mean more in academia?

Speaker 2:          00:50:16       I think it starts from k through 12 education. Actually. I think that we have taken this concept, uh, we have short our mind in k through 12 education all the way through college and this comes back to your example of the faculty advisor that does not want to be challenged by their students. When you have that mentality as a teacher, whether it's in k through 12 or as a professor in academia where I know what is best and I am going to tell you what it is as opposed to facilitate your learning process, we are not training our students how to think anymore. We're not giving them the ability to learn in the manner that they do. I'll give you another example. Memorization caught off as a huge negative today, but you know, um, Sir Anthony Leggett who wasn't about law. It was a Nobel laureate and a professor at Illinois, which is where I was give this inspiring speech to middle schoolers one day.

Speaker 2:          00:51:26       And the theme of it was, the more you know, the more you know what you don't know. Knowledge is a building on process. You have to learn first to then learn what you need to learn again. And so fostering that spirit in students will then allow you to go back to first principles. So it's not about being an expert on any area, but it's about any area that you choose to go in there. Don't just look at the outcomes. Don't just get the success factors and then try to emulate the symptoms if you will, or the the, the things that accompany success go down to the very fundamental levels of what are the ideas and what are the first principles that enable success to begin with.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       It's interesting because this seems to be a place where maybe technology has harmed us because it's like instead of having a holistic and integral view of really knowing what you're talking about, well, what do we do? We Google it, so maybe you'll get there, right? Maybe you'll get there with Google, but you, but you'll get just a quick answer instead of going to the root of what you mean.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       Where I'd say, again, technology is a tool. It does not absolve us of our responsibility on how we use the tool. I'm actually a huge fan of Google. Google scholar has made my life so much easier. I remember being a doctoral student and having to go through Lockwood, Lockwood Library in six feet of snow in Buffalo. Better, right. If I wanted an answer to a question now, google scholar allows me to do it in seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       Microfiche is

Speaker 2:          00:53:05       exactly and I had to work with microfiche to do my data gathering, but, but the point out here is I can use google scholar to get just an amazing amount of knowledge at my fingertips. How great is that? I mean, I am so thankful to technology to do that, but that does not absolve me of the of saying your is all of the pieces of information. In fact, I would say this age of information technology, the need of the mind to have judgment and to discern across all of these pieces of information is at an all time high.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       Yeah, so obviously you teach and you talk about entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurship. One of the things that I think is fascinating related to technology right now is that Peter Teal is leaving silicon valley because he feels that collectivism leftism, cultural Marxism, maybe you have some other phrases for whatever that is, has sort of crushed the ability to think so that there isn't the creativity coming out of silicon valley that there used to be, which is why we don't have that many new apps anymore. We don't have that many new breaking technologies and he is a capitalist and he's ironically moving to la to become freer, which is sort of where people don't think of us as a capitalist haven here in California and La specifically. Do you find that fascinating that that silicon valley seems to lean so far left and yet it's supposed to be the place of innovation?

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       Now that you're saying that, I just made a connection that I never thought of. My father represents exactly that. If you think about it, right? He was very free market oriented as it came to the economic realm and being entrepreneurial in terms of creating new products and services and economic riches, but when it came time to thinking he was very traditionalist and I think that that bifurcation, this mindbody dichotomy, if you will, is what's plaguing a lot of people right now. So I am not an expert on silicon valley. I have noticed of course that a lot of people, so facebook, I just. I just saw mark Zuckerberg say something to the effect of you should have economic regulation and social media. It's like why you were successful is because you did not have any barriers to entry. The best way to keep them monopoly is to have government regulation because again, that's the use of force, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       If I cannot go into an industry because there is prohibition, so think about Uber and Uber had to deal with in the taxi cab industry. Think about when airlines was not what we know it because there were just that regulated carriers, right? That's someone that monopoly and the best way for an entrepreneur who has achieved success, but now no longer wants to continue to own their success is to say, let me create barriers to entry through government regulation so I can be protected by any entrepreneur such as those days ago, right. To then come and infringe on what I have.

Speaker 1:          00:56:26       It's almost as if he's trying to protect what he has. I think maybe the thing, you know, it's so funny also how these things change because you know, 15 years ago before uber, when I lived in New York City, basically my whole adult life and people would complain relentlessly about the cabs. They're all broken down and the drivers are in friendly. They don't pick you up if you're a certain color, et Cetera, et cetera. Then Uber comes around, fixes a lot of these problems by ingenuity and now people are saying, you see what they did, they put the cabs out of business. The same people who were upset

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       first in Boston. It's even worse in Boston, every uber or lyft ride has to be, has to pay five cents of a surcharge and every, you know, a fraction of that. I don't remember whether it's two cents or three cents, but you know, it adds up and millions of right goals to the taxi cab industry.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       That's the industry that's actually being replaced by doing a much better service. Yes, yes, exactly. So that just. So then is there a flaw in capitalism there somehow because that there's probably some cronyism that's allowing the politicians to write these ridiculous

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       is not about markets. Cronyism is about state isn't cronyism is not capitalism at work. It is government regulation at work and this comes back to, you know, Dave, you're successful. I take pride in watching your videos, somebody because I enjoy it, but I'm sure is a bit of envy to about, Gee, I wish I could be as eloquent as David and as the 500,000 people that watched the day Reuben show, you know, wow, wouldn't I love to have that kind of an impact? Now that's envy on my part. There are two things I could do, it can either be a positive driver of my energies, I could say I want what Dave does has, but I don't have, and that can put me on a growth mindset, entrepreneurial mindset. What is it that I need to do in order to achieve those success factors? Going back to those principles, what are the reasons behind Dave success and what can I do to emulate or do differently than dave or I can say, no, I want what Dave has, but I don't need to own it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       I don't need to do that. So let me get the government to take some of what Dave has some of Dave's sponsorship, right? And that's what income inequality and redistribution is all about. I'm taking some of your viewership and I'm going to be forcing those people to now listen to me. So that's where we're using government force. Whether it's income redistribution or any kind of yardstick of value where we're redistributing, we're saying we're going to take it from you and that actually negates your viewers rights. Right? Because now if I have the government saying that, then some of them would be forced to not watch you, but watch me on the other hand, this jealousy, by the way, the difference between envy and jealousy. One of my colleagues just told me recently and we is when I want something I don't have jealousy, is when I want to keep something that I have, but I'm being threatened against, right?

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       Again, positive or negative. If I feel jealousy because I feel threatened about what I'm about to lose, I can go ahead and say what is it that I need to do in order to keep it? Or I can create barriers and say you can have it through the use of force. The same principles. I work at cronyism at both sides of the yardstick. So when we talk about relative poverty in the United States as an income inequality, by the way coming from India, I know what true poverty is. We in the United States, the minimum level of poverty here is so much better than the rest of the world. So if we care, again, it's about inbeat. These rich people have what I don't have and I should get them, or on the rich end of the spectrum, I have this as a welder. I'm a person regardless of whether I got it out of an inheritance or because of prior entrepreneurial thinking, it's being threatened, but I want to keep it for myself. So the best way for me to do that is to lobby the government and erect barriers to entry on both sides. The use of governmental regulation to respond to envy and jealousy is a negative, not a positive driver of economic growth.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       So where do you, where do you draw the line or where is the starting point then of what government is supposed to do?

Speaker 2:          01:01:07       A government has a legal monopoly on force as it should because you and I in a civil society cannot focus our mind, our effort on creating value if we're always going to worry about somebody looting or taking things away from us. Right? So I am not an anarchist. I believe in governments. I believe in the rule of law. I believe in the protection. So there are basic functions of the government that absolutely are essential beyond that keep the economy away from the realm of the government because the government's only ability to do something is to say you and your best judgment. I think you should go a I am telling you you need to go be, you're forcing the mind to not think or act on their best judgment.

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       Yeah. So it's interesting in the, in the case of Uber and what you were describing in Boston and the penny's going back to the, to the cabbies who have nothing to do with it. That actually is because of regulation and that the, and the only way to that and let new businesses thrive is let them thrive. Let me just let, just let them, let them know. Um, all right. So there's a couple more things that I want to do with you and you had a four questions about personal leadership. Then you ask a lot of your students and I thought that these were really great at it and it really, this I think sort of puts a nice bow on everything that we've talked about here. So the first one is what is your purpose? Kids must be kids. Students must be. They must look at you Kinda Kinda curiously when you asked it that one because that's a. that's a big.

Speaker 2:          01:02:50       So that means spend two seconds just telling you about why I came up with this framework. Yeah. I'm a strategy and entrepreneurship professor and I was asked to teach in a program which was largely minority, high school student based and I was asked to give a lecture on strategic management and strategic management is typically the realm of ceos. How can highschoolers identify and associate with questions that a CEO has to deal with. That was the big challenge that I had. How am I supposed to talk to them about at that time with Steve Jobs is doing for apple even though they recognize apple and make it real to them and I realize I didn't need to do that. I could say to them especially because they're at the cusp of identifying who they are and creating their identity. You're the CEO of [inaudible] incorporated. Are you thinking like a ceo? What are the four fundamental questions that a CEO should ask and are you asking those questions of yourself? And it begins with the first one is what is your purpose? The second is, what does success look like? The third is, what's my value proposition given that that's my purpose and that's what success looks like. And then finally in this stumps a lot of people with whom should I trade? So these four questions I think are the essence of any entrepreneurial individual or any entrepreneurial organization.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       How often when you ask these students these questions, did they have some good answers? Oh my gosh, these are tough. I mean these ones, your purpose, these are the questions of all time, right? You're asking them in the framework of business and entrepreneurship.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       Actually, so I, I, I'm actually agnostic about whether they want to define what is your purpose as it relates to their career or as it relates to their life, but the answers that I provide them in the context of thinking and you wouldn't be amazed as to how much this resonates all the way from beginning high schoolers, including my own daughter who was forced to take this class with me to executives in my executive Mba. So what is your purpose really requires people to think about what problems do I want to solve that are meaningful to me. So it again comes to making world a better place to live by doing something important to yourself. And you know, people say, oh, making the world a better place to live or come on rush, hurry. Right? But what is, what is your world, Dave? What is my world?

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       It's the places you go, the people you meet and the things that you do. And if in doing these three things, you have solved the problem and made it a better place, then you've made a world a better place. But you've done it by focusing on things that are important to you. So it's interesting you're talking about all these things through the business lens, but business, what you're talking about is what you said before, which is, which is happiness. Yes, absolutely. And in fact, on that point. So what does success look like? To me it is the ability to say I love what I do and I'm good at it because that's the word. Choose spiral that enables self esteem. And when you have self esteem because you're good at something, you want to invest in it to become even better at it. It's pretty cool waking up with that, with that feeling.

Speaker 2:          01:06:17       So that was number two. What does success look like? You mentioned all of them already, but I just want to read a little bit. So what is your value proposition? So notice that, uh, the answer to the question, what does success look like? Takes an inward perspective, what do I love? And then what are my abilities that will help get me to where I love and what I'm good at? What is my value proposition is still looking at your abilities, but now the yard stick is how is it creating value to you? So can you say, I love enterprise and innovation, right? I love what I do. I think I'm, I'm pretty good at it. Are pretty good. I come up every morning with a spring in my step. But why would that cause you to want to use, you know, ask Rajshree to join you this morning as opposed to multiple other people that you do.

Speaker 2:          01:07:07       So what's my value proposition to you? What benefit do I offer you? The features that are unique to me that is the focus on value proposition and it's obvious because we have the evidence right here because of all the people that I talked to that weekend. Uh, you were one of, I think two people who I said to the learn liberty guys, we're going to get her up the show. You came up to me after we had a great conversation about all of this stuff and they go and then finally, uh, with, who should I train? That is the one thing that stumps a lot of people and uh, goes back to the what is my purpose, making the world a better place to live by doing something important to me, right? So providing benefit to someone else, but making sure that I'm benefiting and I'm doing something I love to the answer to what does success look like is really getting to what you love doing, which is about you.

Speaker 2:          01:08:04       The answer to your value proposition is providing benefit to someone else, right? Making the world a better place to live, with whom do you trade is bringing those two together. So you and I are trading right now. We may not be exchanging any dollars, but there's a trade going on out here and that relates to your abilities and your aspirations and my abilities and my aspirations and were combined together with a common objective. So the alignment of your aspirations in my abilities are what's going to determine our actions. And in doing so, I get to do what I love doing. I also you a benefit. So do you and its amendment trade.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       Well, I got to do what I love doing here. I feel that we, I think we did almost everything. Is there anything that we possibly missed? This was, this was truly a pleasure because this was exactly what I've tried to do in my life and with this show and everything else, and you're, you just exude exactly what you're talking about, which is a joy to see.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       Yes. And in fact, that's exactly why I want to trade with you. I love that, right? Because you exude the same positive can do sense of life and I would rather have people around me that have that same spirit make me better, make me more energized than people that either I bring down or they bring down, uh, you know, do they bring me.

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       Can we do a live event together? Can we do something I knew, Marilyn, we're going to make something happen. Sounds good. This was, this was truly a pleasure. I'm glad it happened. After a couple of months. And for more on Rajshree, you can check out her website, which we've linked to write down below.
