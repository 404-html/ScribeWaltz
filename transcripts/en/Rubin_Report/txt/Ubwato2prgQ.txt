Speaker 1:          00:04          Alright, let's shift altogether. Let's talk about the step. You really know. How about that. Okay. Biology, evolutionary biology. I thought this would be an interesting place to start. You just recently did a talk with Richard Dawkins just in the last couple of weeks. Uh, as I understand the video of it should be up online somewhat soon. It will be up within a couple of weeks. Okay. So hopefully people will be able to actually watch this conversation. I'm very quickly, this event was put together by Pangbourne philosophy. There's been a little tumbled around that and I know you just wanted to quickly address what's going on there. So pangbourne philosophy is obviously imploded and that has left people speculating about what happened and why some of us like myself continue to participate with Pangbourne. I just very quickly for people that have no idea, they were putting together a lot of the public events that included a, well the one that you moderated with Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris and Vancouver.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Also the one that Douglas Murray moderated, which I think. Was that in the UK or was that Australia? One in Dublin and one in London. Yeah. Um, and then a series of other events like the one that you did with Dawkins and this this day of reflection that was supposed to happen on November 17th that we all pulled out of which now I think you can take it from there. Sure. So, um, let me just say that I know that there is a lot of speculation about what took place, why people pulled out of the New York event, why some of us like myself stayed in and I was in at the point that it was canceled a couple of days ago and I do hope people will recognize that there was a predicament for those of us like, uh, like myself and like Eric who were looking at the, uh, the Pangbourne situation and trying to figure out what to do, which was at the point that Pangbourne canceled the Auckland event.

Speaker 1:          02:01          Something new emerged. So other events had been canceled, but there had always been refunds for people who had bought tickets. At the point he canceled the Auckland event. There was a lack of refund money, which called our attention to the fact that something was off money that should have been kept separately for that event so that if it was canceled, it could have all been refunded, somehow wasn't, which we didn't know. And to be clear, you guys, and I think not just, you guys hadn't been paid for some previous things too, so it wasn't just about the people that were buying the tickets. Just. Oh, it was an auckland, it was Sydney. Sydney is where speakers, as far as I know, that's where speakers didn't get paid for the first time. And I'm certainly one of the people who didn't get paid and still haven't been. Anyway. Yeah. And also as a sidebar, that's. So that is why I pulled out of the day of reflection thing in New York. I was supposed to host the whole day, but then when I realized that people hadn't been paid for previous things and I had heard through the grapevine that there was some shady stuff going on and I just said, you know what, let me just

Speaker 1:          03:00          get involved in this mess. And that's right, which makes perfect sense. Yeah. So I think what I did also makes perfect sense, which is I looked at the situation and I said, well, you've got people who haven't been refunded their money for Auckland. You've got speakers from Sydney who haven't been paid and if the New York event comes apart, then it's going to compound that. It's going to create a new ticket holders who haven't been paid. Um, and so my thought was let's have an event that gives people what they paid for so that we don't make the damage worse. And I certainly didn't sign up for anything new after the Auckland. A event was canceled and there was a failure to repay patrons. But my thought was from the point of view of a protecting the fan base from whatever was going on a behind the scenes at Pangbourne, the better part of valor was to make the event happen and be successful rather than create another auckland situation.

Speaker 1:          04:02          So in any case that you know, and I should also point out that up until so Pangbourne gave us a, a little bit of warning just a couple of days before he canceled it, he said he was about to cancel it and Eric and I tried to save it. In fact, Eric who had pulled out of the event quietly so as not to cripple it, uh, he and I got on the phone with Travis and we tried to get travis to agree to hold the event and to lead us rescue that we offered to work for free and we would have liked to have held the event so that it wouldn't cause further harm to people. And I don't know why Travis refused, but he did. So anyway, it got canceled and I, uh, I just, I do want people to understand that it was not that anybody was unaware that something was going on. The question was what's best for the fan base, the movement, to the extent that there is a movement, is it better to have another event canceled and have more harm? I didn't think so.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Yeah. And I know this is all a little insider baseball for people, so I know you just wanted to get that out. So I'm glad that it is a few of us. Also, we had discussed possibly doing a free thing and who knows, maybe there will be something in the future if people ended up getting stiffed on ticket prices because obviously we want people to get something and if we can all figure it out, we will. Okay. So that being said, you did do an event with Richard Dawkins as we said the video should be up soon enough. Chicago, what should we expect from this? And uh, I think on its face, I think a lot of people would say, wait a minute. Well, we've got Weinstein and Dawkins, these guys should agree on everything, shouldn't they?

Speaker 1:          05:49          Well, this goes back to the question of what happened to evolutionary biology 30 years ago and um, darkens and I do agree on a tremendous amount, but the place at which we start disagreeing I think is a, the branching point where you have the way evolutionary theory went 30 years ago and the way it should have gone, and you know, that's not an indictment in and of itself. Fields take wrong turns all the time. But what should happen is you should detect that you're on the wrong path because suddenly progress, uh, ceases and that didn't happen. So, so what actually happened 30 years ago that got us that ironically a, I would argue that the, the last piece of progress that we all really agree now there's been lots of empirical work, but the last piece of theoretical progress actually involves a Dawkins' selfish gene, which essentially encapsulates a synthesis that does lots of things, including, brings a proper theory of cultural evolution online.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Which cultural evolution is a non issue for almost all creatures. But for birds and mammals, it's a big deal. And for human beings it is the big deal. So to the extent that we did not have a way of discussing cultural evolution prior to the selfish gene doctrines, introduction of the concept of memes which have now been trivialized by, you know, people putting funny captions on pictures, but the concept of, I think you could argue they've become the most relevant way of communication in a bizarre way. Yes, but they'd be, they've become, you know, little tidbits become little bites and the fact is almost everything about human beings that is interesting and special, at least touches cultural evolution if not is entirely housed there. So in order to understand ourselves, we have to get this cultural evolution thing straight and documents set us, I believe, on the right path.

Speaker 1:          07:52          Chapter Eleven, he introduces the word meme, he introduces the concept, he sets us in motion, but he makes an error in that chapter. No big deal. We all make errors, but it hasn't been corrected in 30 years. And so, so. So what does that error? The error is in a, a misportrayed of the relationship between culture and its evolutionary units and genes and the way that they evolve. So what Dawkins says in that chapter is that means the units of cultural evolution exists in a new primeval soup, right? He says, this is a new kind of evolution. It begins at the point that culture begins to happen and it is independent of the genes that cannot be the case cannot be the case because the only reason that you are able to pick up units of cultural evolution is because you have a brain that your genes created, which is hospitable to those things, which means that to the extent that your, a culture starts wasting the time and the energy and the resources of your genes, the genes are in a perfect position to shut it down.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Right? So my point to dokkens on stage in Chicago was that can't be right, and if you make an adjustment to the theory that you presented to the 1976, if you adjust it correctly, you discover that um, many things that are paradoxical about cultural evolution are no longer paradoxical and many things about human beings are suddenly tractable. So can you give me an example of that? I can give you the ultimate example, I will accept that. And so the ultimate example has to do with a religion and things that function like it. So if you think about, um, you know, this is the antithesis of some little picture with a caption on it, right? You Imagine Catholicism, for example, Catholicism is a set of beliefs that has profound implications on the way that believers deploy their efforts, their resources to things that they elevate, the things that they issue, all of that.

Speaker 1:          10:13          So the question is why, right? So, Docklands and I would agree there is no supernatural explanation necessary to, uh, interpret what is taking place on earth or anywhere else in the universe. You don't need a supernatural explanation. Um, if you were trying to explain phenomena. So why is it that people who hold a belief that supernatural forces are at the heart of a human affairs? Why are those people so successful? Historically, that's the question. And Dawkins, and I disagree with it, I would disagree over it, uh, because a, he has this view of what cultural evolution is that it's independent of genes. I say it is actually much more flexible than jeans, but it is subordinate to the will of the genes. Um, and he also does not subscribe. Actually, he came around a bit on this on stage I thought, um, but he also does not subscribe to a, uh, a lineage level interpretation of selection.

Speaker 1:          11:20          He is a traditional kin selectionist who believes effectively that the individual, that the gene and the individual or the places that we must interpret a evolution. And if you do that, then lots of things are paradoxical, hard to explain. Maybe intractable. If you accept that lineages evolve, um, that adaptation can apply to the lineage. Then you can begin to understand phenomena like a religious traditions as adaptive properties of a population. And uh, there is tremendous progress to be made. So what happened on stage with Dawkins was at dinner prior to the event, we more or less agreed that I would lead the discussion because I had a sense of where we disagreed and he would react to it. And I put together a list of points on which I was certain that we agreed points on, which I was pretty sure we disagreed and points on, which I wasn't sure which way to call it, which we didn't get to. But anyway, I started out by pointing out the vast agreement between the two of us and asked them about each one and more or less I had been right about where we agreed. And then I started going through the list of places that we disagree. And I thought it was a fascinating conversation. It was definitely a closer to the conversation I hoped we would have won. I feared we might have, um, there was a lot of progress.

Speaker 2:          12:53          Could you, could you sense which way? Not that this matters in the grand scheme of things, but at some level it does. Which way the audience was going. Not that it, not that it is about who gets more cheers or anything. But what I do find fascinating about these things. And although I didn't attend any of the live events with Sam and Jordan, um, you know, I've watched some of them and just sort of noting a little bit of crowd applause and jeers and pauses and things I think gives you some extra taste that may be for you guys on stage. You can't quite quantify. Well, I mean, first of all, I'm a believer in that and it was one of the most of them

Speaker 1:          13:31          important tools that I used to use in the classroom, you know, figuring out what people heard, how it landed, what they don't yet have. So anyway, I'm very cognizant of what people are hearing and I was listening carefully to the audience and um, you know, the thing was set in motion, you know, as another new atheist event. And so in some sense I was, I was battling uphill because my basic point was new atheism is, is a Culdesac, it's, it's a problem in and of itself. Um,

Speaker 2:          14:04          it's a problem because at the end, at the end of it, there isn't enough. Is that like the most simplistic way that I could present it? No. I mean, let me just put it in stark terms. Atheism is defensible, but new atheism is wrong and new atheism is wrong because it portrays religious belief as a

Speaker 1:          14:26          of mind rather than an adaptation, non literal adaptation and so in a room full of people who, you know, Dawkins is a very famous person because people presumably showed up to hear a Dawkins. Almost all of those people have at least deep sympathies with the ideas of new atheism and so somebody setting out to say actually new atheism is an incorrect instantiation of atheism because it is effectively ideological and and accuses people who have religious faith of being mentally defective and in fact darkens and I tangled over this. You know, I said, look, you're, you've called religion a mind virus. That's an incorrect interpretation. And at first he said, well, I don't really mean anything deep by virus. He said it's, you know, you could argue that every gene in the genome is like a virus. Right? And I said, well, but what people hear when you say that is that, that they're mentally ill for believing this.

Speaker 1:          15:28          And he said, well, they are mentally ill, right? And so you know, you could see the division in his own thinking, right? Because at that point he's then saying both things at the same time, Sandy's saying both things and I, you know, I understand his position about you could interpret each gene has independent, you know, I could defend that position too, but in order for there to be an honorable atheism, we have to own up to what all that religious belief was about. And then I mean, and this is the place that I get into an easier pickle, but a pickle with Peterson as well is the question of if we acknowledge that religious belief is adaptive, then all of the things that are true of adaptive phenomena kick in and the most important one is that adaptive phenomena are not timeless. They are adaptive relative to a historical time and place.

Speaker 1:          16:27          And it may be a very long standing time and place. But the point is there is nothing. It is purely magical thinking to imagine that religious traditions that are thousands of years old are the core of the toolkit for moving forward. Our existence in 2018 is so novel that if there's one thing we can be sure of, it's that are adaptive nature is a poor match for it. So then can anything be truly timeless? Is that the right question? Well, yeah, but the way you do it is this, the longer standing, some truth of some kind is the closer it gets to being timeless. In other words, if we look at things that are um, very evolutionarily longstanding, well those things have persisted through environments that were very different from each other. So what that means is that thread still functions irrespective to an extent of the context.

Speaker 1:          17:26          The longer it lasts, the more likely it is to speak to truths that continue to be relevant, but the, the bitter pill for modern people with respect to understanding the degree to which evolution is the key to seeing ourselves properly is that we live in circumstances that are more novel than almost any creature has ever faced. Now, you know a creature can, you know, fish and flop into a boat and it's suddenly a novel circumstances and it's dead within minutes, right? Don't tell that to the dinosaurs and the media was coming. Well, there you go. That was so novel that you know, I mean dinosaurs didn't survive that one group, the birds, you're still with us and they're doing great, but we are creatures living in circumstances that are not only novel at an unprecedented level but are changing so rapidly that even to the extent that we can figure out what to do, the world changes out from under us.

Speaker 1:          18:31          We have to stop that, right? That is going to kill us. That if you want to know what the greatest existential threat to humanity is, it is the rate of change that we have set in motion, which makes it impossible for us to adapt fast enough to it. It has to be slowed down to a point that we can catch up. Is that impossible though, because we already have that power because I'm with you on this. Just from my limited knowledge of this, just from what I do, you know, from doing these shows and that people can watch more, you know, the amount of information that you can intake on a given day, the amount of things that you can share, you can speed things up and listened to them two times as fast. You can clip everything and that we can take all of this information.

Speaker 1:          19:12          Things can be live streamed like all of this bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. It's happening faster. We're learning more. We know there's a great thirst for this. Um, but can it be slowed down? I mean, what, what force could slow down progress really wisdom. Um, and that that's the, that's the problem is that we are children in this landscape and children grow up, right? I mean, the key to raising children properly is to, is to back off the things that protect them enough that they actually get burned without being burned so severely that they're crippled. In other words, you have to experience the places that your notions are naive in order to become less night. We are now in a situation in which we are behaving in a childlike fashion in, you know, in a very, in a foundry or something like that.

Speaker 1:          20:09          Right? We're like children running around in the foundry. There's molten metal that we need to, you know, figure out how to recognize it, how not to touch her were just pressing every button. Going buttons are cool. There's power. We've got to stop doing that. I don't think, you know, if I'm to be candid about it, I don't think we are in an unrecoverable situation. I can see the path forward and it's all still plausible as far as I know, but I'm worried that we won't get there and the reason we won't get there is that there are lots of things that have been true that just aren't true anymore. In other words, the people who are in love with a limitless market in which you can do anything that you can manage and it's all cool. And then at the point we find out that it isn't cool.

Speaker 1:          20:55          We might have to take some action, but in the meantime, you know, you're, you're free to explore. I'm very sympathetic to this view as well. I would be sympathetic to this view if I didn't recognize that there was a problem in which, for example, if you look at the way our economic system is hooked up to our political system, there's a problem where anytime you set a new force in motion in the market, if that force pays a at a high rate in the short term, but it costs at a high rate in the longterm, by the time you get around to discovering the costs in the long term, it has found its way into the political system so that it cannot be reversed. You can't have a system in which you can't reverse things. So this, the simplest way to frame this would be some sort of crony capitalism kind of thing, right?

Speaker 1:          21:41          Well, you know, we're not, we're not truly free market because we've politicized a competition basically. Well, you know, I try to look at everything through an evolutionary lens and to me, politics and economics are just one more landscape. And they're interesting because it's humans and humans are, um, especially capable in this regard. But the, um, the natural tendency for a creature that has found its way into a niche is to protect its access to that niche. And the way creatures do that is they freeze other creatures out. So there is this natural pattern, and I mean I can't not see it now that I, now that I've understood that it exists. There's this natural pattern where the upstarts who succeed, the stories that we know we don't know about the upstarts that failed mostly, but you have startups that succeed end up tremendously powerful. And then they go through this process in which they become hostile to upstart newness and they become hostile to upstart and us for the most natural of reasons which is that their wellbeing depends on shutting down the process through which they became successful.

Speaker 1:          22:57          So this could be like facebook buying all of their competitors and things of that nature. It's the, let's put it this way, there are obvious versions and then there are innumerable versions that are cryptic and we, we're never going to understand the whole landscape of ways in which those who have reached this level of power that you and I will only dream about, that they will then shut down the access to others. It's like there's a, I don't even want to call it a conspiracy because it doesn't have to have any consciousness to it at all, but there is a tendency for, um, for those who have succeeded to shut down the, the mechanisms through which they succeed. I mean, you can see this with a people frequently remarking on the fact that immigrants are often not that wildly enthusiastic about immigration. Why is that? For obvious reasons. You know, you're talking about do people who've just entered at the bottom of the economic ladder want more competition? Well, they're actually a. there's a tension between what people should want that you shouldn't imagine that there's some immigrant ness that necessarily has you favorable to anybody else who has that label.

Speaker 2:          24:06          Does this also sort of explain a little bit of what's happening in the tech world right now in terms of it seems that these companies, twitter, facebook, youtube, are potentially at least using algorithms against their own audience, a shadow banning people. I mean that they are basically now turning against their own people because of their whatever they perceive to be their own protection or longterm health. Even though I would probably argue in most cases, that's not really what's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          24:35          Oh, without question. This is what's going on and let's put it this way. If you're at the top, if you're in that strata, you have a lot to lose through anything you can't predict, and so there is a way in which we expect the upstart who got there through some sort of radical transformation to be favorable throughout a radical transformation. But the way we should understand it is that once you've gotten there, radical transformation becomes threatening and you start to conservatizing evolutionary force and you know, we can look at what twitter is playing with these days with a potentially eliminating like some follower counts. You know, at a breathtaking act of paternalism, you know, at best and are doing it for us, for us, right? Because we shouldn't be so concerned about who's paying attention. But really the truth is, as much as we all recognize that there's a problem with, you know, tweeting to get trivial likes, on the other hand, understanding what your audience hears, what they find favorable, what doesn't ring true to them is the way you learn, it's the way you steer. And so effectively twitter is playing with blinding us so that we can say whatever we want into the void, but we have no idea how it, there's no ping back to you basically. And so, you know, I mean, I don't need to tell you, you're a comic, you're standing in front of the room and you get a

Speaker 2:          26:08          lot better when they laugh. It's better, it's better when they laugh. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um, what should we be thinking, you know what, before I get to that. So as you know, I was just in a, in Europe and I did a bunch of the Scandinavian and Nordic countries and uh, Sweden was a particularly interesting case because I know that our fifth most viewed country for this show is Sweden, which is sort of fascinating considering how tiny Sweden is. Uh, so I, I sort of circled that we did two shows in Sweden. I kind of circled them on the calendar because I was like, something's going on in Sweden. I want to figure out what it is now. I thought if you would've asked me before I did the show that first night, I thought it was gonna have a lot to do with immigration.

Speaker 2:          26:48          What I realized, although there were a lot of questions about immigration at the end, it had much more to do with gender and what is happening to their highly egalitarian society that have done most of the things related to gender and true equality correctly for many, many years. And all of our friends on the left always point to Sweden and Norway and Finland. These countries that I was just as the examples of their perfect societies and they're really struggling with certain things that you know, that the government's forcing them to have genderless kindergartens and that the, the emasculation of men and the removal of the father and that they have supposedly Europe's first feminist government and all of these things. So I thought as long as I have you here and since gender seems to be such an endlessly a provocative and also misunderstood topic, um, what should we do on gender right now?

Speaker 2:          27:45          Yeah. Um, well beyond you going to Sweden and figuring out what's going on there. Something. Well, what struck me as is that they've done everything right in effect in terms of egalitarianism and they've done it for, for decades now. They've done it right. And when they got to the end, which is now, and they got to the current day, they realized that despite all of this equality, men and women are still different. That women still care more about people and men still care more about things. So even though they've been given the exact same opportunity, women are still becoming nurses and men are still becoming engineers and it's like the social justice warriors or whatever you want to call that crew, they still don't like the results of true equality. So I think that's why Sweden's in such a weird place, the average person's like, what? We've done it right, we did it right. Everyone's equal. You can do whatever we want, but then the result isn't being allowed to be accepted. Does that, does that make some sense? Oh, it makes perfect sense. In fact, right?

Speaker 1:          28:42          I think the, uh, the naive left finds the failure of its hypothesis absolutely galling. And so they're effectively trying to erase that failure by hard coding the solution into government. So I think that's exactly what's happening in Sweden right now. And it's tragic. And with respect to sex and gender, it is so needless, right? The fact is the truth of sex and gender is, there are parts of it we don't fully understand yet, but in general, actually we do. We pretty much understand how we got here. And the truth is, it is asymmetrical. It is a complimentary. The truth of male and female is a complimentary truth. It may be largely irrelevant in the present. In other words, technology has eliminated most of the basis on which the division of labor between men and women initially evolved. So I think we have actually an opportunity here to become, to behave in an enlightened fashion that the the easiest place to solve this problem, insects and gender, what we should do is pretty clear and it is not hard to ground and evolutionary theory because unlike other places like a race, for example, we do know what to think with respect to sex and gender and the.

Speaker 1:          30:11          The basic outline is this. Men and women are different for historical reasons. The basis for that difference and the utility of that difference has largely been neutralized by the modern world. We don't need to retain those distinctions, but some of those distinctions are built in at a deeper level than others. So meaning you could potentially be a stay at home dad and that could be perfectly fine, but that probably for evolutionary reasons is not going to be the thing that usually happens, right? But here's your would be my point. We can democratize access to almost every with respect to sex and gender, there are very few places where we actually need to have some asymmetry in access, but probably, you know, the firefighter who comes into the burning building through the roof to pull you out when you're panicking and you don't know what to do because you've never been in a fire before.

Speaker 1:          31:13          Um, on average, that should probably be a guy. They're just better built for it. If there's a woman who is well enough able to do it, should you be picky about the firefighter who plucks you out of the burning building? Absolutely not. I mean, I personally am thrilled to see it every time it runs against the narrative that we expect. You know, I, uh, I'm very fond of Stacey Brown, the police chief at Evergreen, who was driven out along with heather and me. I thought it was great that she was female and that she was a, an excellent cop. So I'm, I'm up for the narrative being broken by, by, uh, by reality as often as possible, but you democratize the access, but you don't force people to do what they otherwise would for one thing, you wouldn't even want to force it because for every job that you would, you know, force women into at some higher rate, let's say engineering jobs because it sounds like a good thing to do.

Speaker 1:          32:12          There are some awful job that men are disproportionately represented in that you would also have to force them into to be fair. So you democratize the access. You recognize that the division of Labor that we have, that we have inherited is largely outdated. Um, but you don't override people's a choice, you know, if, if women, if you democratize access to engineering perfectly and women go into it at equal rates, great. If they don't, that's cool too. Um, so in any case, it's, it's a question of allowing liberty to decide where people go after you've done away with unnecessary barrier.

Speaker 2:          32:54          Well, it's so interesting because I think then you hit it right on the head that, well, Sweden's now politicizing it. They're making a point of making this political because they will not accept the science of what they've done correctly. And I think at that is what is what has led this sort of average person there to go this, this is just not right. So it's, I don't know what the way out is and I sense that most of the people there didn't know what the way I was. Well, I mean,

Speaker 1:          33:20          the way out really is to recognize that the, the ire of the authoritarian left on this point is actually indicative of the whole problem. In other words, because sex and gender is more or less clear, the desire to erase it, irrespective of the collateral damage is an indicator of just how wrong this path is. So, you know, I find this all the time where people have, if you're not focused on biology and you're focused on the world that you find in your galled by, uh, by inequality, then you think, well, let's just solve the inequality. Which is hard code the solution, but then you hard code the solution and it says men and women of the same to the extent that there's any difference in what they choose to do, that's the result of a either cryptic barriers or internalized misogyny or whatever, and then the problem is you're now interfering with my biology class.

Speaker 1:          34:24          You're now telling me that we that the received wisdom is that men and women are the same thing. When I know damn well that can't be right, so you don't want to build a solution that forces you to confront your biologists, physicists, your statisticians, right? You want all of these stories to the extent that they're true, have to reconcile all true stories, records to the extent that you've got a naive notion over here and you want to just write it in because it seems very important to you and you're willing to tolerate all of the cascading effects elsewhere. You don't belong in a position of power.

Speaker 2:          34:59          Unfortunately though, a lot of those people are in a position to power and I think we're seeing more of them get into positions of power and I think it's also now having a counter effect in Europe, which is why we're seeing the rise of more far right parties because people are just like, screw this, this is so wrong. I'm going to take my chances over here. People who inherently are not say far right or certainly not racist, are now playing with people that perhaps they wouldn't have played with before because they're so sick of this and I. and I'm worried where that leads us.

Speaker 1:          35:28          Oh, I think, I think this is exact and I've, I've heard you say this, is that you were afraid that the, the lunacy over on the authoritarian left is actually going to, you know, it's collapsed. It's going to leave people who otherwise wouldn't play ball with the far right over there,

Speaker 2:          35:43          but not because they're racist. That's the key to this. It's not that they'll suddenly become wake up and be racist or hate women or hate gays, but it will be such a disgust of reality. And, and, and a rejection of what's provable that they'll going to be like, at least there's something over here. I mean, it's awful bargain, but I think it is. I think, I just think it is. I see this, uh,

Speaker 1:          36:06          frequently where people, you know, because they detect that there's something wrong with communism and socialism are often driven, right pretty far into the let's not regulate anything camp and the answer is actually have to regulate stuff just out of a desire to continue as a species. So, you know, I don't want to see people driven because there's something wrong over here. I don't want people to be driven into, into a reactionary position that is not justified. The thing on sex and gender though is maybe this is the key question. Every reasonable person who just simply observes the world knows that men and women are not the same thing. They know that, uh, those differences have an implication for the way we view all sorts of things like mating and dating, what careers we want to have, how we view risk and all of these things for historical reasons.

Speaker 1:          37:04          All reasonable people can infer that from just their own observations of the world. You are now confronted with people who insist that you not acknowledge what you can see. Those people are crazy, right? They're dangerously out of control. They are dangerously out of control on other topics where it's harder to know what's true, but you wouldn't want people who were so naive as to argue that men and women are effectively identical, but for depression, in charge of any policy, you don't want them in charge of economic policy, in charge of, uh, you know, a prisons, anything. Um, so having seen just how far their confusion goes, can we all agree to shut them out of the discussion about how power is to be wilted and the rest of us can have a discussion about what our values are, what we think we know, what we don't yet know, and what its implications are.

Speaker 1:          38:01          That that's the place we should go. That seems like an effective ending here. Unless you want to throw in one more. Did we not hit something that's been rattling around in your brain? Actually, he's a know I covered a lot of territory here. Yeah. All right, well it's always a pleasure sitting down and India. And you joined me last night for standup in Bray California. This will be up already, but you're joining me tonight and Oxnard, I'm turning into a standup comic, which is a biologist. Worst nightmare. No, no, it's a, it's not quite the, uh, the thing where you're, the lead singer of your favorite band has laryngitis

Speaker 2:          38:36          data, but it's about as close as I could hope to go. Yeah. All right. Well we're going to do this. Will do. Well, we did it about a year ago after the original line, but we'll do this more than once a year because you're, you're right in the center of all the things that I think are, are right at the moment and for more on Brett, follow him on twitter as long as they can track how many followers he has at Bret Weinstein.
