Speaker 1:          00:00:02       One of the reasons I like doing long form interviews is that I can really focus in on important issues with my guests. In many cases, the issues are inextricably connected, making it easy to go from topic to topic. If we're talking about political correctness, that's a pretty easy jump to free speech, which is then another easy jump to the regressive left. Sometimes these jumps just appear when I'm not looking for them, and that's usually when the conversations get really good is the spaces where you have to think that are the breeding ground to spark new ideas. My guest this week is civil rights attorney and legal expert or Reba Martin. I've done the Dr drew show on Hln several times with Reba and always find her to be incisive, thought provoking, and passionate. While we've appeared together several times. This will be the first time we really get to flesh out some ideas in a long form way without worrying about a commercial break.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       A rib and I are going to dive into a ton of hot topics and big ideas. This week we're going to discuss everything from the black lives matter movement to the war on drugs to the Oscars, so white controversy as a Harvard educated black woman who founded and manages her own very successful law firm. I don't think I could find a better person to tackle so many important issues with and arriva. You see what just happened there? I just played some identity politics, didn't I? Arriva happens to be black and happens to be a woman, but in reality, how is that important to our conversation? Actually, I don't really think it is. I assume some of her views are based on her own personal experiences, but what I care about are her ideas, not the color of her skin or her gender. We really have to get over the idea that by looking at someone, you can figure out what they're all about.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       I literally could not care less about someone's skin color or their religion or their sexuality. What I care about is their ideas. What do they believe? Why do they believe it? Are they right? Are they wrong? What kind of world are they trying to create? That is simply all that matters to me. There are black conservatives out there, there are Mexican Libertarians, there are Lesbian Christians and there are cis gendered, blue haired video game playing bisexual quakers, and if you care about all those labels more than the ideas that the people themselves believe in, then you are actually part of the problem. If you truly care about minorities, then you have to care about minorities within those minorities. If you truly care about diversity, then you have to acknowledge diversity within diversity itself. We should be defined by what we believe, not prejudged by people's assumptions as a wise man. Once said, when you assume you make an ass out of you and me, my guest this week is a civil rights attorney, legal expert, and you may have seen us on Dr drew's couch together, or Eva Martin. Welcome to the show.

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       Good to be here. You know, from sitting next to each other to sitting across from each other. This is, it seems that we're going to be adversaries because we're

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       usually on a couch right next to each other. We get some legs touch.

Speaker 2:          00:03:03       It helps with some of the crazies that come on that show and really make it difficult for people. I think like you and I who have really intelligent and smart things to say,

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       wow, we're, we're, uh, building each other up just as we start here. But that's exactly what I wanted to have you on the show because we've been on Dr drew a couple of times together and I always find you, you're extremely passionate and you know your stuff. And I find there's so many people in television, especially in Cable News and on the cable channels that are just yelling and screaming about stuff but aren't really experts.

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       I can tell you, and not to brag about my background, but you know, when you think of an expert, you really want the person. I have some credentials that really make them an expert and I can't tell you how many times on these shows I've sat next to someone. I'm having a conversation, I want to go, you know what? I'm sorry. I am fifth grade. It just drives me crazy. But yes, there's been this proliferation of quote unquote experts because there's so many shows and it seems like if you are willing to say something so outrageous and to say it very loudly, you can get booked on a show. And that's what we see pretty routinely on a lot of these shows.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       Yeah. And that is again, I mean that's why I love working with you because not only do you know your shit, but you get right to it. So then I'm sitting next to you and I'm thinking, man, if I just had that kind of just incisive way of going at it. So we're going to get into some stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       Well, I've been working on TV for a while and I've had to perfect the soundbite because oftentimes you get 30 seconds and I tell you, I start checking the news at five. I read seven, eight newspapers throughout the day and I'll get a call. And it's some complex issues that I've got to go on and talk to millions of viewers to make them understand sometimes very technical legal stuff. And the reality is what's happening to the courtroom and a a difficult case, a murder trial doesn't really play well when you're trying to reduce it to a 32nd sound bite. So you got to get kind of skilled and how to bring that very complex information to really digestible television viewers.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       Yeah. And that's exactly why I like doing the long form interview because now we have an hour or maybe a little bit more even to really get into some stuff, really exchange some ideas. So

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       for it, because some of these topics are so big theater we spend all day talking about, but yet you've got to reduce it to a sound bite. So I love long form conversations

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       and we're, we're in the right spot. But before we get to the issues, I want to do a little bit on your history. So you are. You're from St Louis originally, right? It

Speaker 2:          00:05:39       was right next to Ferguson, Missouri. So when we were all eyes on Ferguson with the Mike Brown shooting, it was really personal for me because not only did I grow up in that community, I knew so many of the people that were involved on the front lines doing the protest. So when that happened, that explosion in that community occurred really personally for me. So yes, from St Louis and went to college in Chicago, University of Chicago. Love Chicago. Glad I'm not there this weekend though, given the blizzard that's been just, you know, ravishing the comp a country, you move the right direction. I moved it right. It's in the sunshine and then went onto Harvard. Uh, so I lived in Cambridge. Uh, unfortunately the patriots aren't going to.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       Yeah. And my husband's like

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       the Patriots, but uh, anyhow, yeah. So I went to Harvard, then I actually worked in a corporate law firm. I worked on Wall Street and I was in this major corporate law firm representing big fortune 500 companies and doing a lot of corporate law and I just got tired. I just stuck. It. Didn't fit with my background, didn't fit with you know, who I had grown up to be and the people that had influenced me. So I left. I left is really, really, really, really, really, really, really good job.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       Yeah. Are you saying the corporate lawyers make a lot of money? Is that what you're saying? I left a good job with a lot of money and a lot of perks

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       and an office like on the 40th floor, big. It was amazing. So imagine me calling St Louis family. That's like just over the moon with happiness that first generation college graduate, first generation Harvard lawyer, big corporate law firm. And now I'm leaving to go work with one other lawyer in this tiny little office on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. Yeah. Give up this huge salary. Uh, it didn't go over too well. I can,

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       you must have felt incredible pressure because you had sort of accomplished a lot. Not, not that advanced in age. And then you say, all right, I'm going to step away from it. Isn't that sort of what it's all about really what life is all about? And I think it is, and I think that

Speaker 2:          00:07:53       folks who find the most happiness in their careers is because they've taken a risk and they really follow their instincts. They follow their intuition, they don't do what's on the kind of the path that's been laid out for them. And if you go to Harvard and you're in the top of your class, your path is supposed to be either you become a supreme court clerk and you go on to be a judge or you go and you run a corporate law for. You start off as an associate, you become a partner and you make a ton of money and that's a great life. And having lots of friends that do that. So I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, right? They have a great lifestyles, but it just wasn't who I was at my core. I wanted to have more control of who I represented. I wanted to represent little people. I want it to be involved in issues that really mattered to me. And I just wanted something different for my career. So I had no husband, had no mortgage and no kids. So you could walk away from a big job like that when you don't have all of those responsibilities.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       Yeah. And now you have a husband. Oh my God. You have a law that you run with your husband, correct? Yes. And you have three kids and all of this stuff. So you're doing a lot of fun.

Speaker 2:          00:09:01       But I'm happy about it. And about seven years ago I decided I wanted to step away from my courtroom practice. I was a trial lawyer and I wanted to have a greater impact and I had this amazing case, a amazing because I was representing these great families. Horrible thing had happened to them. Their kids had been abused of the classroom, some nonverbal autistic kids abusing the classroom by this just criminal teacher. Really. Uh, and they called me from Las Vegas and asked me to come and represent them. And I did that. And Dr Phil was very interested in their story and invited my clients and then me as a result of representing them onto his show. And I got there. I loved having an opportunity to raise awareness about an issue I cared about and break down, you know, what had happened legally and why this teacher was being prosecuted and that began my TV career and I've been working in TV ever since that one appearance on Dr Phil.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Yeah, and even that, we're going to get to this a little later, but even having a case involving autism, you've written a book about autism. Your your son has autism. I don't like saying is autistic because it seems very defining versus has autism. It's just a piece of who he is a so that even that right there, it's a nice way to start your adventure sorta because it was something that was very important to you.

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       Yeah, and you're right. I did write a book because I was frustrated. I didn't like what was out there. I was too hard to figure out how to you get the best education. How do you get the best healthcare, and I said, this is crazy. I'm a Harvard trained lawyer and I'm having such a difficult time. What about the mom who has four or five kids at home, maybe working two jobs and doesn't have the time to sit on the Internet all day like I did, and search for this information. So I wrote a book called the everyday advocate standing up for your child with autism and other special needs to really bring a lot of the information that I had learned as a parent and as an advocate and as a lawyer into one place that apparent a professional could go and get the help that they need for their child or grandchild or whatever. So really just tried to make that journey a little easier for parents.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       Okay. All right, well we're going to dive a little deeper into that in a bit, but let. Let's knock out some issues. Okay. So you already brought up the first thing that I wanted to discuss with you, which is black lives matter. So as you said, you're from St Louis, right next to Ferguson. You know this area. A couple of weeks ago I had larry elder on who is, who is the eye roll already. Was that side eye or eye roll? It was

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       fit on his radio show. We've debated these issues a lot. Uh, I don't understand Larry, to be honest with you. Bright Guy, lawyer, a turn, talk show hosts radio talk show host. But his views are the most extreme views. I can't even imagine where he got them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       So, so I don't wanna I don't wanna make this about him. It's not necessary, but the reason I mentioned it is because a why I liked doing the shows. I want to talk to people that believe one thing and somebody that believes something else. So that's a great place for us to start because basically his take, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but to paraphrase him was he felt that there really is no more systemic racism in the United States and that, that really the struggle for the black community is because of the breakdown of the family. So if you want to address that a little bit and then we can dive right into really the nuts and bolts of the stupid. I thought

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       really it can be more articulate about it, but I'm just going to say that's stupid a to say there's no longer systemic racism. Just ignore so much data, so many statistics, so many reports, uh, just, it ignores the fact that ignores the reality and conservatives like Larry, like to deflect from those issues because if they can blame it on the family, if they can blame it on the victims and they don't have to accept any responsibility. But the reality is the criminal justice system, let's just start there. Disproportionate number of African Americans and Latinos, but particularly blacks who are incarcerated who have longer sentences, who are treated differently, everything from driving while black. So who are racially profiled even when they drive their cars. And we've seen so many examples of this from high profile people like Chris Rock. Oh, James Blake, the tennis player who all have had some negative experience. The President Eric holder, when he was attorney general, talked about him and his brother being stopped in, in Washington. So

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       Danny Glover, something happened with Danny Glover. He couldn't get a cab or something.

Speaker 2:          00:13:43       I don't think we could identify a black man serious, whether they're high profile celebrity professional or just the guy on the street that hasn't had some negative experience with the police simply because of their race. So when folks like Larry Talk about, you know, we're post racial society, the facts are off. There's this wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       So what would you say about the family part though? Because there, it seems to me that as I say on the show all the time, two things can be true at once. So everything that you've said, they're fully make sense to me, but also that the breakdown of the family in general, black, white, Asian, green is, is a problem that we have.

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       Well, I don't know what he means when he says the breakdown of the family. I think families have change. So let's talk about two gay, uh, individuals who are now parents because they can't get married, they can adopt the kid. Don't go to depot. Well, okay. Well the reality is the family today isn't the family of the 1950. So when they say the breakdown of the family, what family are they talking about? Single moms are as common as two family households and are we to say that that's a better structure? So I'm not sure if even I buy into that assertion that there's been some breakdown. I will agree. There's been an evolution and families look very different today. Interracial families couldn't exist for the 50 years ago. Is that the breakdown of the family? Because now you and I could be married and have kids.

Speaker 2:          00:15:10       Is that no longer? Well, you know what, that could be the new thing, but you and I could decide to have a child together, right? Sure. Even though we're not married you in vitro. I mean there's so many ways that families are created. So when they say the breakdown, what are they talking about it. So I don't buy into that. Alright, good. That's good to hear. Alright, so let's dive really into black lives matter. As a movement, what do you make of the General Movement itself? Do you feel that it's, it's hitting the right tone. I'm going to say this and I'm going to get just slaughtered on social media. Oh my God. Somehow I become like the spokesperson for black lives matter, even though, you know, they haven't enlisted me, they haven't called me on the phone and asked me to do it, but I find myself trying to give some context.

Speaker 2:          00:16:03       I think what black lives matter has done has been nothing short of brilliant, the issue of race and race politics in this country, very complex and all hands on deck. So I play a role as a civil rights attorney that represents families who have been the victims of any kind of police violence or they've had their rights violated their constitutional rights. So I stepped in as a lawyer and I represent those people. But then I, I have this platform, it gives a talk on television every week about these high profile cases. So I get to lend my voice to that. Then there are these people who go out and they march and they protest and Hook as a result of that. So folks in the courtroom, folks using their platform on television, uh, folks like Al Sharpton using his voice and then these protesters. So now the issue of police profiling a police shootings of African Americans, it's been elevated to this national level, uh, black lives matter have had audiences with Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders.

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       It's come up in the presidential debate and I think we've got to give those protests or some credit for that because, but for their activism, this issue would not have become a part of the national dialogue that we're having about how do we make communities safer? What did, what did you make of the instance when the two protesters went up to Bernie's a podium and basically grabbed the mic from him? He sort of let them do it because a lot of people felt that that was like, you know, I talk about identity politics a lot and that my problem with identity politics is I find everyone has to figure out who's the most aggrieved. So your autumn, Bernie is an ally obviously of the black lives matter movement. He's an ally of the other always. But

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       if everyone is always looking out just for themselves, then you have the right in your mind to grab the mic away from him. Who even though he's as left as it's gonna, get in politics in America

Speaker 2:          00:18:00       now to say that I support what black lives matter has done in terms of elevating this conversation to a national level. It doesn't mean I agree with everything that you do. What I like for them to approach Bernie differently. Yeah. Did I feel good about watching him try to figure out what do I do, do I call security, do I have them escorted and then kind of what's unfair about that. He didn't have secret service protection. The reality is they wouldn't have even gotten here that microphone or a stage had that been Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or any of the other candidates that trump has secret service, but he has plenty of have security. So the reality is Bernie in allowing himself to be open, kind of left himself open to these hyper protest or so I didn't like that bottom line. I didn't like that, but it doesn't take away from the overall efforts that they've had and the successes that they've had.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       But I do think that we have to get comfortable with this concept of disruption and that's what I think is so upsetting to a lot of people. Even African Americans, even traditional African American civil rights leaders, they want black lives matter to fit into this box. They want them to follow the mode of the 19 fifties and 19 sixties protestors. And they're like, hell no. That's not who we are. We're not looking for Martin Luther King to come and save us and to lead us. This is a movement of the people from the people and it's being done totally different. So they. They're not looking to organize in a way that John Lewis and a lot of those civil rights leaders did. And I think that's a little unsettling for people. They don't get it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       Yeah. So that's an interesting sort of generational struggle. Obviously John Lewis and Martin Luther King and Malcolm x and many other people did things at different levels, some on the ground, some via speaking and all that. And I find that this movement hasn't quite figured out what it is yet. But I think your point is that that's part of,

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       that's part of it, part of the magic that's the part of this new paradigm that literally you can go on twitter and organize a thousand people to show up at a rally and sometimes at that rally it and my daughter has been so there was a big rally last year after Thanksgiving in Los Angeles and she says, mom, some people had this sign. Some people had that sign. There was really no organization. I'm not even sure if people knew why they were there, but he caught fire on facebook. It caught fire on twitter and thousands of people showed up and I says, well, you have to get used to that. That's a part of the unorganized nature of it is what makes it special and what makes it unique. And yes, some people were there for gay rights, some people were for human rights, some people were there for sex trafficking, some people were there for police brutality. I said, but they were all people who were at the end of the day just trying to make their lives, their communities, the people they care about have a better quality of life. So for that I have,

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       so interestingly there could be sort of, this could be the genesis of setting sort of much bigger because when you take all those people, and again this is where my thing with identity politics is sort of interesting because everyone's got their issue and yet they're coming together so that's good in itself, but I'm afraid that that it allows for a lot of issues to then just jump on top of each other when some of these things aren't necessarily connected,

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       but, but what's the alternative? And that's what I say to people. Okay, you don't like how black lives matter has address this police brutality issue, which by the way, you have to give them some credit for all of the legislation that's happening at the federal level and state by state requiring body cams. California just passed a law now that says a special prosecutor has to be appointed if there is a police shooting. So we, we have seen the fruits of their labor and I say to people, give me an alternative. What, what in your worldview at or if you could wave a magic wand, how would it look? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       I hear. Yeah, I, yeah, I don't think you're asking. No, I'm with you. I find they're philosophically. There's something to me that seems a little dangerous if everyone sort of jumping on the social, the social justice things, but I do hear you.

Speaker 2:          00:22:23       I don't, I don't see anyone else. And the black lives matter protesters that you talk about generation. They said Al Sharpton and some of these other civil rights movements, uh, leaders, what they do is fine. They really are about grassroots there, about local people, indigenous leadership. So people in their own communities standing up and demanding that they get a voice at the table when decisions are being made. Like who's going to be the police chief? Who's going to be the district attorney now, what I would say is what I hope to see, and I was disappointed in the midterm elections last time. How do we translate all of this social activism into electoral politics? How do we get those thousands of people that showed up for a rally? How do we get them to vote in the election and beyond?

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       Yeah, and you talk a lot about local politics. So I can backing up for a sec. I can't give you an example where I think it's a bit of a problem. So for example, what we're seeing on college campuses right now with free speech now I get that the, the thrust of what they're doing, they're standing up for social justice and they want equality. We're not just talking about the black community, the gay community where whoever it is. So I understand the idea there. Uh, but then when you see the instances like at Yale where they're shouting down this professor and that they're, you know, they're demanding professors be fired. It seems to me that we've created a situation here where the students are now dictating the policy, which it seems a little backwards and I know that there's a lot of people in academia that are, that are really afraid of where this is headed.

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       But they're 18, they're 19, and think about what, what, what should you be doing at college? I think what those students are doing,

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       well you should exchanging ideas but not demanding that professors be fired.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       Why not? If the professors are are racist and the professors are not sensitive to the issue of inclusion and diversity, why not them that they'd be fired.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       Did you feel that that professor at Yale, the, the he, he was the dean of that college and his wife had written the letter about the Halloween costumes. I mean, to me it was just, you know, if they don't want to. Okay, here's the problem for me

Speaker 3:          00:24:34       and any

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       transition, anytime you're trying to transform an organization that has had systemic racial inequality and injustices for decades, is somebody going to get somebody going to be sacrificed that perhaps really wasn't the person? Are they going to be scapegoated? Probably. Yeah. But why is a university like University of Missouri that all predominantly black football team, if they hadn't stood up and stood with the guy, Johnathan Butler, who went on the hunger strike if they hadn't stood up with those students? I doubt

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       if Jonathan was still be on that hunger strike, I'll be dead by now. I doubt that unit. Right. So in that case nobody responded so but, but why is it a public, university of Missouri, like seven percent, five percent, such a low percentage of African American students. Why does it take us to get to the point where the students have to shout down the professors for the universities to look at themselves and say there's something wrong with this picture is not reflective of the community where this school is. And you remember that University of Missouri, a president, he's in his parade and he was so arrogant and he wouldn't even address those students. So did he. Did he end up stepping down? They forced him out. Absolutely.

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       So interestingly, the Missouri and the yellow ones, which happened basically at the same time, I see as to what, to me at the Yale thing was, was far worse than Missouri thing. Yeah. Had the mostly black football team not got involved then nothing would have happened. So I do hear that. But even in that instance, you know, there was that professor or a part time professor, that woman who came out and got caught on camera saying we need some muscle here and then that isn't. That is a free speech issue. So I guess that goes to your earlier point, which is you can be for a movement and that doesn't mean you agree with every, every tech,

Speaker 2:          00:26:27       some of the tactics are not well thought out. But again, that's why I said they're 18, they're 19 years old. This is their first. Some of them first experience with any kind of unrest or any kind of protest. So I wouldn't expect their thoughts to be as developed by their tactics to be as developed as you know, somebody is 30 or 40 or beyond. So I think we have to just accept that these are teenagers just kind of finding their way in and young adults who were finding their way on some pretty complex issues. But I think more importantly for me is if I'm a university president, why, why I'd be more proactive on these issues. Why aren't I addressing issues of diversity and inclusion before it bubbles up and now I have the kind of protest that we've seen on campuses across this country, so I just don't think a lot of these folks have been very smart about the issue of diversity, a diversity and inclusion, and we could segue into the Oscars. Very good example of that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       Let me throw in one other thing and then we'll go ask, but this is exactly why I wanted to talk about this because I think that basically the bulk of the same people in the middle of this country pretty much see these things in a similar way, but even just what we're doing right now, it shows that there are, there are different ways of looking at it doesn't mean someone else's racist or someone else's automatically a bigot or something that we're so used to using those words. So that's, that's why. That's why I wanted to unfurl somebody

Speaker 2:          00:27:54       times. Unfortunately we can't sit down. Yeah. Well that's what kind of dialogue because those words that you use just shuts the conversation down.

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       Yeah. So one of one other piece on this and then we'll move to the Oscars is my guest last week, Michael Shermer, who is a thinker and a skeptic. He made an interesting point about the college thing where he said to me, you know, if these kids at Yale, if at this point what they're protesting about his halloween costumes that might offend them, then that actually shows great progress in society because of the things that they would have had to protest 30 years ago. And I thought that actually gave me a little bit of a. It was a nice feeling to sort of take away from this that it doesn't mean that problems don't exist, but it means that we actually have moved forward in society and we don't. We don't. I think sometimes we don't stop and acknowledge.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       Yeah. And I think Obama did a great job of that when they had the march on the John Pettus bridge in Selma and he says, as much work as there is to do on the question of race in America, we cannot lose sight of the tremendous progress that has been made. So I would agree with Michael on that point that yes, they weren't protesting because they couldn't eat in the same cafeteria or drink from the same water fountain as the white students. Now the issues of race and they've changed. They are there, they're more subtle. Uh, they're more in some ways in city is because they're not overt. So the colored only signs made it real clear what our mission was, you know, there wasn't much dispute about that. But now you're right, because even again, African Americans are often divided on this question and I've sat on drew's couch with some conservative African Americans who say like, Larry, what are they complaining about? They, they were in the college, uh, work hard, get good grades and everything will work out. So the people aren't, you know, speaking from one voice on this issue of race because it's important.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       Yeah. So I know I said last thing, but I'm gonna throw in one more. Just jumping off that. So what, what do you make in general of, of black conservatives? Because I'm friends with a few black conservatives, David Webb, who's a Sirius xm host, who is a Fox News contributor, is a good friend of mine. We worked together at Sirius and I know that he, I know him extremely well and I, you know, we've had drinks together. We make dinner together. I know that he believes what he's saying and, and when I see what people say about him online, you know, uncle Tom and we could go through the list of things that people say, um, wh, what do you make of people like that?

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       First of all, I think David and any black Republican, conservative, however they identify themselves, they're perfectly within their right to have the opinions that they have about race and politics and, and to identify with the GOP party or the independent party or whatever party. So I don't come from a place that because you're black, you have to agree with everything that I believe in or because you're gay or you know that there is no monolithic thought in any of these communities. That people have different points of views. And I like a conversation where all of those points of views have an opportunity to present themselves and to be a part of the conversation. I don't think that because David or Larry or any of those conservatives have their view about the family that that view is any less significant than my view because I don't see it the way they see it doesn't mean that their points on important. So I like debating those guys. I like talking to those guys and I think it's a mistake to try to shut their speech down or to try to silence them. The silence who, you know, some people call these lefties, these super progressive. So no, I,

Speaker 1:          00:31:36       yeah, I'm not thrilled with those guys either, but bring it on a whole other topic. This is a perfect segway now to the Oscars so white situation because Fox News had stacey dash on who is black and she was saying to the black community, she was just like, get over it that this is not an important thing. So that we have decided that we all take a deal and give. We will take you. That's a fair trade. Basically our number one white person right now, and you're good. You can take. Stacy was in one movie, I think in 1995. Clueless. That's what we're getting. Can we get a draft pick or we want to Dale, you know, everyone wants a deal that was

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       on black twitter. So just the power of social media space is entitled to her opinion. And I don't necessarily put stacy in this category. I don't know her personally, but there are people of every race, every persuasion that have branded themselves as we started this conversation as experts, they like the attention that they get from saying outlandish things that they like to be provocative on topics. I don't know if this is her, like I said, I know her personally, but I do know because I sit in this chair and I sit on these shows, you know, four or five times a week and some of these folks I know that they're intentionally trying to be provocative, but she may believe that African Americans should get over it. I say again to her. She's misguided in her thoughts and her statements. Uh, and you have to look at the history. None of this happens in a vacuum. And for those folks who say, or what about the naacp image awards, they're all black. And what about bt? It's all black. Why are white actors complaining about that? And I say, well, his look at the history, why is there an NAACP? Why are there Naacp Image Award?

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       Right? I mean I, look, I have no problem with her saying whatever she, I, if she believes it, look, even if she's just saying it to say it because she's on television, that's part of the game at some level as you're saying. And if she believes it, then she believes it. I thought the one part that was a little odd really was that she said that we shouldn't have a black history month, which every part of our culture, everything. We should have a black history month and we should have a Latino history month then probably going to get history,

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       do away with everything that identifies or a celebration.

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       Yeah. One's culture. Let's start with Columbus Day. Alright. So Oscar, so white here. So here we go. So there is a big Brouhaha right now, we got a Hashtag on twitter, gone, uh, and a lot of the black community is not happy about this. Um, I should say right up front that Chris Rock, the guy who's going to host the thing, we said he's still going to host it is black. The president of the academy is Black, but I think 94 percent of the voters are white. I hope I'm getting that 94 percent of the academy. The academy, Seventy seven percent of the voters are white male. Yeah. So okay. So there are some numbers now. I also saw some numbers that were that since 2000 that pretty much it's been about a that the black community America is about 10 percent or about 12 percent and they've gotten about 10 percent of the nomination, so that since 2000 that it basically works out. So I'm just throwing out some numbers to start. How do you feel about that? So

Speaker 2:          00:34:53       I think that again, I love protests. Let me just start here. You can tell that you're telling because it works. So Cheryl Boone Isaacs came out and said change needs to happen, but it needs to happen faster. She was frustrated, she was heartbroken. A Jade Pinkett Smith did her facebook video to her 7 million viewers a and we have spike Lee make his statement and guess what happened? There was an emergency meeting on the agenda was this issue of diversity for the academy and out of that emergency meeting came some commitments that were pretty significant. Like we're going to diversify our membership by 20, 20, we're going to add more women, we're going to add more minorities and we're going to make the issue of diversity a bigger issue for the academy. And it makes sense. You know, I didn't tell you this, I went to Harvard for law school, but my major in college was economics.

Speaker 2:          00:35:52       So some of this stuff just boils down to money. So you want it to be an actress. I'm an economics major. So look at the facts here. Last year they said the ratings down 16 percent and a lot of that was attributed to last year when there were no black nominees. And that Hashtag trended Oscar. So White, the Oscars Cheryl, they got a job to do it at the end of the day, they got to sell a television program to one network and the network has to bring in sponsors and advertisers to make a lot of money. So imagine if that 16 percent grew to 25 percent because high profile African Americans like Spike Lee and will smith and Marlon Wayans and Jaden Pinkett Smith all said, I'm not going to watch. I'm not attending.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       And to that point, if there were more black people nominated, it's not like suddenly white people would be like, oh, I'm not watching this. There were some more black nominees is ridiculous. But do you think there's a little risk though in that this is forgetting the politics side of it and we know there's plenty of politics in Hollywood, but that these are subjective award, so it is possible. Do you think it is possible? I should say that the people voted and they just happened to the votes? Just bullshit. They just don't think that that's a possibility. Really?

Speaker 2:          00:37:06       Absolutely not. Because what we're hearing is that the membership, they get to watch whatever movies they choose to watch. So if I'm a 78 year old white guy, okay, and I got all these movies to watch, what are the chances that I'm going to watch straight Outta Compton? It's just not likely. And here's what African Americans wanted.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       So That's interesting. So that's not necessarily. So that's almost, you would say that sort of racist by omission.

Speaker 2:          00:37:31       So there a bias. That's why the city, that's why diversity matters. And some of us as well, we don't want affirmative action for the awards. No, we don't want affirmative action. We just want the academy to reflect the reality of movie goers. So 46 percent of all tickets sold at the box office from minorities. So if the people buying your product, by and large, all we're saying is let the academy reflect those people. And at the end of the day, if an African American or Latino decides to straight Outta Compton, isn't a movie that they want to vote for it to be best picture of the year. Okay. We can live with that. We're not asking them to get any special treatment. All we're asking for is diversity so that at least there's some confidence that the process is fair. Even the plainfield don't give us any greater advantages. You know, Viola David says is best the difference between black women in TV and white women are the opportunities, so we're really just talking about opportunities and spike Lee I think was spot on saying this way before we get to the award seasons.

Speaker 2:          00:38:37       This is happening in the c suites at studios because when we look at who can green light projects, that's where we've got to start. There's no diversity is no Africa. I think he told me that. I think he said there's one African American that has the power to green light a project. So it starts with a major studio project. A major studio, yes. Obviously not independent films, but it starts with those. The number of and will be Goldberg, talked about this on the view as a director and an executive producer, is that the black directors and writers and producers, they cannot get their projects through mainstream studios and when they do, their budgets are smaller and the opportunities for success on those projects, but just again, I'm going to go back to my economics, right, so yeah, go to that. You'll have straight out of compton making $200,000,000. You have ride along three pushing star wars out of the top slot. I think somebody ought to take note. The bean counters, the accountants, the money people ought to be taking note of that and and ought to do what TV has done to recognize, hey there's, there's some money in these urban movies

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       and that's, to me that's the interesting part because if I know one thing about now living in La and being part of the Hollywood or whatever this is, is that this town I think basically is just run by people want to make money that, that it's a capitalistic town. It's not like. So your argument though, would would prove if they said, all right guys, we're looking at the numbers here, 46 percent of the people that are coming to movies are minorities. Then we should be trying to increase that percentage of the pie. It's not going to come at the cost necessarily have your white viewers that I think the town would be would go for that because they want to make money. But I think that's the fear.

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       You hit on something really important and we're seeing that in the presidential election, this fear that if, if I make way for you African American minority, somehow that means there's no way for me. So your, your success comes at my expense and this is also what you should have learned. I'm sure you have about this town is very relationship driven. So if you, if I don't have that relationship with you, I'm not necessarily even going to get in the room to have the meeting and again, to spike Lee's point if we don't have more diversity in the top jobs and upper level management in the decision making positions than maybe I've never even in the conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       Yeah. You know, it's funny, I saw our friend Larry Elder, who we've mentioned a few times here, uh, I saw he was tweeting at spike and basically was saying, come on, Spike. You've made, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. You're selling your mansion in New York for $35, million bucks. It's a little disingenuous for you. Now I think I know what you're going to say to this, but I think it's interesting that it's good at least that any community is having those internal fight that. But again, look how ridiculous that argument is. You can sit here and say, Eva, come on. Your son

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       has autism. So when you're standing up fighting for more autistics are services for people with autism. That's just about enriching your own son's life. Oftentimes it's people's own personal experiences that causes them to become advocates or activists, and it is because of spike Lee's position inside the movie industry that he has the voice and the credibility to speak to it. I surely don't have any credible voice about making a movie. I've never made a damn movie. So who wants to hear from me about that? You want to make a movie? No, I don't want to make a movie. I want to talk about the folks that make that better, but I think his argument is disingenuous and I think spike Lee is in the best position and he's been on this point. He's not new to this party. If you look at the history of spike Lee, Spike Lee will tell you lots of projects he didn't get because he's always been outspoken about this issue of race and diversity and inclusion and yes, he's made a lot of money and make more of it.

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       Ironically, spike is fighting the same fight in reality that a lot of his movies were about fighting made. His moves are like, he's coming out of nowhere with this and he's hired, and this is a statistic I didn't even know until he got this a honorary Oscar himself. He's hired more African American actors than any studio bar none. So here's one guy who has not had, you know, a slew of blockbuster movies, but yet he has made it a point to hire more African American actors and he accepted that award with Sam Jackson and Denzel Washington or top actors, black, white, green. No matter what or you know, and they were there because they have been in so many of his movies. You know, it just hit me as we're talking about this, that it's so sad that so much has to be framed within, within the racial lens because we haven't gotten it there because I've had, hey harry on my show who was the first black woman to ever win an emmy.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       And I remember watching when I was like, I was probably 10 or 12 and I remember thinking this woman is absolutely hysterical. I didn't look at her and think, oh, there's a black woman making me laugh. I just thought this woman is hysterical and I guess, you know, talent ultimately is what has to reach the top, but that doesn't mean that some of these systemic things can't be. And that's again, that's where people were not talking per se about affirmative action, but people I think get that wrong. We're not asking that you lower the standards. We're asking that you even the playing field. And that's a very big difference. What would you say to the people, I've seen this bubble up a little bit lately, that people are saying, well, if you look at the Latino community there, there are numbers in America versus their nominations or the Asian community really, uh, that they, they never get nominated basically. So I see a lot of people saying, well, the black community is fighting the wrong fight here. They're fighting something that makes everyone else go. You're fighting about Oscars. Nobody cares about Oscars while the Latino community is way less represented in. That is a fantastic

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       question. And I knew I'd get one right. Look at the history. What do black people do? We break the damn doors down. So everybody else, the gays, the Latinos, the Asians, women can walk through the door. So watch what happens when diversity happens is, and I got to just be about black actors. It's going to be about diverse actors. It's going to be Latinos, Asians, people with disabilities. They will all benefit. Somebody has to lead on this, and if you look historically, it's been African Americans who've been willing, even though you're right, disproportionately our numbers are much smaller than Latinos, but we have a much more organized and developed a system of protesting and raising issues of racial inequality in this country than Latinos and Asians. And Trust me, when we break the doors down, nobody else is saying, oh my God, they broke that damn door down. I'll watch that door is too broken. Watch everybody run through that door. So I would say to Latinos, Asians stand up with us. We all benefit from this. We're not saying that it's all black actors. I want us, I'm a woman. I want to see more females. I want to see I'm a disability rights advocate. I want to see more individuals with disabilities portrayed in movies. And television, so I think nothing but good from any marginalized group comes from the efforts of what we see happening on this Oscar. So white.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       Yeah, in a way it shows the strength of the black community actually because because a lot of what we care about culturally and the music we listened to and all of that stuff comes from the black community. So it's like in a way that the black community has the lead on this for the other minorities. So it does kind of make sense.

Speaker 2:          00:46:19       And for those folks that say, Oh my God, you know, this is a bunch of millionaires fighting about a gold statue. Who Cares? The Oscars are a very important institution and the entertainment industry, particularly in a state like California is huge. And again, if we're buying 46 percent of the tickets at the box office, this is an issue that we need to be aware of. Does it mean that we don't care about hunger? Does it mean that we don't care about poverty and the poverty and the fact that, you know, one out of three black kids live in poverty, you know, and what our capacity is large enough that we can fight the fight on poverty as well as address issues at the Oscars. I don't see them as mutually exclusive

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       at all. Yeah. All right. Well let's, let's go with the poverty thing for a little bit because, uh, one of the things that I've seen lately is that a lot of numbers are showing that the black community has not gotten any better economically under the seven years of Obama. And you know, people felt, you know, he wanted to sort of be a post racial president. I don't think we've quite got there. Not necessarily his fault. Um, but what can the black community do to get those numbers?

Speaker 2:          00:47:28       Well, don't necessarily agree with those statistics. I think they're there. If you, depending on what you read, the economy overall is much better under Obama. Millions more. However, the economy itself at the economy itself is, but that the black community still behind in that sort of regroup the black community has made some gains under Obama. So again, I disagree with and, and I reject those statistics that say blacks are worse off under Obama than they were under George Bush. Hello? I don't think so. Uh, do we still have a ways to go in this country? Absolutely. Are we still a disproportionately impacted by a criminal justice system? Yes. Are we still lagging behind in wages, a in asset accumulation? Absolutely. So there is a lot of work to be done, but that doesn't dismiss the great work that President Obama has done on healthcare. A look at the jobs, the unemployment rate lower than it's been in a decade.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       Uh, so I, I think we have to celebrate those pro, you know, the, the, the advances that have been made and keep fighting and just overcoming hundreds of years of systemic racism. Obviously what we are now seeing doesn't happen overnight. It is a long and entrenched fight that is, I think, what we learned more attractable than perhaps what we thought. I don't think anyone thought that Obama's legacy, you know, the hope we were all high on hope. Here's a were on hold and no one could have predicted that the rancor and the adversarial nature of what he has faced, particularly in these last three years. I, I know, I couldn't imagine that and saw that and it's hard to say. Is that, is that racial, is that that our system is just warped wood. Would the Republicans have been more willing to work with a white president?

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       I hate bringing everything down to that. To that point. There may be some element of it. I don't. I don't think we really know. I don't think we know. I don't think we can ever. And again, I get so beat up about this, but it's just what I know just historically, I'm, I'm a student of history. A race matters in this country and no matter whether you're the president of United States or you're the president of the Oscars, the fact that we're still fighting these battles have to tell us that race still matters. So. All right, well let's go. How about we get away from Raytheon?

Speaker 2:          00:50:01       It's just, it's such a shame that we have to spend so much time talking about it, but that, that is the point, I suppose. Uh, so let's talk about politics because politics thing too. You are supporting Hillary. I am supporting Hillary Clinton. I'm also supporting a slew of progressive and some female, mostly female candidates. I'm a big proponent of, of inclusion, not just for race, for women, for lgbt, for Latino's. I just think this country works better. Our state, our city, our county, when we have diverse voices. So I support a lot of candidates at the local, state and national level that don't look like traditional candidate.

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       So what do you make of the Hillary campaign? Because I've, I'm not sure who I'm supporting at this point. I'm really still, I've become a really at this point. I see myself as a real centrist and I'm just not sure now, it seems to me that Hillary and Bernie are way better than any Republican debates, uh, have been about substance, you know, they've really, even with the gun thing, you know, Hillary's trying to pin Bernie as the gun guy. Meanwhile he got a d minus from the NRA, but so it's really been about substance. The Republicans, it's trunk, it's silliness. We can talk about that too. Um, but one thing I have seen with Hillary's that to me, this campaign, because of the email stuff and then guys, he, which finally that's going away, but whatever it is, but there is no, there hasn't been a point where it's been like a run, like a nice, like month long run where this is about really feeling good and maybe that's the media doesn't like her. I don't think the media really likes or something. But how do you feel about the campaign in general?

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       So here's what I think. I think the trump and the outsider voices that have dominated the news media isn't just impacting glp and the Republicans. It's also impacting dims as well in Bernie is lining up as that outside voice, and Hillary of course is the mainstream establishment candidate. When you listen to what Bernie and Hillary are saying, knowing what we now know about Obama, Bernie's policies, they just don't have a snowball's chance in hell of ever coming to fruition. He's talking about a 90 percent tax rate on the rich.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       Hello, rich guys in Congress as Senate are going to vote for 90 percent tax rate on that snow jumping because I know people are going to be yelling at you over that because I've mentioned that and people have said to me what he's saying is that it will be a progressive tax, so it's not that you're being taxed fully on the 90 percent increase on the rich. It doesn't play well to Congress

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       because most of those guys are rich guys. He's talking about eliminating obamacare as single source, single payer source healthcare system. We couldn't get that voted in even when the congress was controlled by Dims, so I like his fire. I like his progressive politics, but I'm a pragmatist at heart and I just don't think any of those things he could get accomplished and we don't need eight more years of not being able to get anything accomplished. What I like about Hillary is she setting me on fire. Am I as high as I was eight years ago when I don't have any of that, but at the core of me I like getting stuff done. I think the woman can get shit done and you talk about the in Gaza and the emails. To me, the crowning joy of her campaign was sitting at those hearings for a moment.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       The way they attacked her, it would have taken Mother Teresa herself to too restrain some of these junior just got to Congress five days ago, don't know where the bathroom is. People yelling at her about the most ridiculous and unimportant details and she just sat there. I so I'm with you 100 percent. That that was not only was her best, that to me was like, you should be the president. Just for that. I posted a really funny line. Did you see there was a moment where she did this little thing, she was like, it was like drop the mic and it was like vote. That's the kind of level headed toughness that you need an office and that's what, to me, Bernie, when Bernie is doing all that, I'm like, dude, okay, you got to bring it down a notch. You yelling, I can't really understand you. You're making it. You're giving me a headache.

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       So it's interesting because I know so a lot of my audience loves Bernie and I've said several times that me and my heart, I like Bernie the best. I liked the ideas the best, but I also, because I consider myself a pragmatist when he saying these things, sometimes I see what he tweets these really lofty things about, you know, it's all about changing the system. I'm all for changing the system and getting money out of politics and all those things. But we just had Obama tried to change the system pretty intensely too and we were all higher than seven years ago. Right. So that's, that's why at this point I sort of think I'm mostly begrudgingly

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       supporting hillary too, because here's the problem with that, and I tried to tell people this with Obama. Nobody would listen to me. Then he says to me that that's okay, that's fair. That's why my clients pay me a thousand dollars, but no, we have a two party system and the president is here. He can do nothing. She can do nothing without the congress and the Senate. You can be the most Charisse, you cannot bend more charismatic than Obama. The guy is like swag on steroids, but that doesn't mean anything in Washington DC. And that's the problem with all these people following trump. Trump is not going to be a dictator. We don't have a dictatorship in our government. Our government is about, it's a collaborative and if you're not able one to understand that and then to, to navigate that, you get nothing done.

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       So that's the crazy part and where it goes to in this I think is probably a throughline of everything we've said here is that education is the most important part. We have. We have three branches of government. People forget that we have a judicial branch. They decide what's legal. We have a legislative branch. They decide to make laws and then we have all these policies, these, these

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       glp candidates are talking about. They're gonna build a wall and they're going to hell how exactly you're going to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       So that to me is the most dangerous part of this for a second, because I saw him say a week ago or two weeks ago, he said something like, when I'm president, you know they're going to put a merry Christmas back on starbucks card or something like that. Now I get it. It's just a stupid. He's just throwing stupid red meat out to some morons, but like even that it shows, it shows a inclination to not even really understand what the role of the president is

Speaker 2:          00:56:50       dummied down. If you watch those gop debates, I'm sitting there, they're foreign. When Ben Carson said, see my mother, she used to drive a car until the car wouldn't drive anymore. Then she would take her pennies and she'd buy a new car. Well, he is supposed to translate to economic policy of the world hard. Her pennies do well on ice as well. They said, well you one of the questions like when you can't bomb these, these, these vehicles, because they have civilians. Well just tell them if they ride in the car, they're going to get bombed so they shouldn't get in the car.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       So that's the, that's the piece. That's a piece. Yeah. I mean look,

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       that's not a policy. What Isis is stupidity.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       And that's the piece that goes across both sides because. So you hear that right? Did you hear Ben Carson? And it's like you clearly know nothing about foreign policy. Like he just uses a couple of buzzwords, Caliphate Jihad. He just puts a couple words together, but then I'll hear Bernie talk about it and I'm not for war. I'm certainly not for nation building and all of that stuff. But I hear him say, well, you know, we're gonna have to work with our allies, do this. But. But he, he also will say I'm never for war, which means that there's no threat of anything too. So it's like both sides are playing. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       That's the scary part. And that's what I think the worst thing about the trump reality show is it has dummied down the conversation so that we're starting to believe that these bluster is, you know, blow horns can go in with these simplistic solutions to these complex. I mean the, the problems are so complex. So his whole Muslim policy, do you know that the people who are fighting isis the most are Muslims? So when you insult for Muslim community, you insulting our outside. But if you don't know anything about foreign policy, you don't know that. And now what's really scary me as they're saying, when trump becomes the gop nominee, he's got an now somehow figure out how to reverse himself. You know, he's insulted African Americans, Latinos and Muslims, just about every group that you need to win the general election in this country. So now he's got to walk that. But how do you walk that back? And here's his dilemma. If he walks it back, those white lower middle class men mostly who were supporting him, they're going to be, they're going to be passed because the reason they like him is because he's standing up to make America great. I eat white again. So how do you embrace the immigrant population in the Muslim population without alienating your base? And that's the stupidity of the GOP party did me?

Speaker 1:          00:59:39       Yeah. You know, it's interesting. This is where I've been very critical of the left because I think that the progressive's because they. So their intentions usually are very good, but they're so their knee jerk responses to yell bigot or racist or homophobic or sexist or whatever it is at everybody that they. In a way they've enabled trump because they've silenced so many centrists and so many liberals that I think they've enabled will then trump just comes in with answers instead of saying instead of a real debate where we say, what are we really doing with immigration right now? What are we really doing about refugees and migrants? Trump just comes in and says, Hey, I'm banning everybody and then that sounds good. So I partly do blame our side of the aisle on that because we haven't, we haven't dealt with it well,

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       a narrow group of people that he plays too. But I. One of the things I find most interesting about the glp election, remember after Mitt Romney lost, they went and did this exhaustive audit. How did we lose? So let's dissect it, let's analyze and figure out what happened. And what they concluded was they did not Garner enough votes from the minority voters, particularly Latinos, and that they had to become the party of inclusion. And so, and in all their big money donors said, we're no longer supporting any of these kooks. We want candidates that can win. We're going to put our money behind candidates that can win and we're going to go out and become the party of one. And they've done the exact opposite front runners, not runner runners have made the concept of inclusion like a joke.

Speaker 1:          01:01:19       Yeah. And that's clearly why trump is. The party is against trump. Alright. So one last thing before we wrap up. I do want to talk a little bit about your son and your activism in with autism and the things that you've written and things like that. So we hear a lot about autism, but I don't think people really understand what it is or how many people are now affected by autism. Not only the, the kids that have it, uh, but the families and all that. So in just a couple minutes, can we just do like a autism one? Oh

Speaker 2:          01:01:47       yeah. Quickly. So autism is a neurological disorder impacts three major areas. Your communication, your ability to learn. So your cognition and then your social skills. One in 64 children. Some say that number's understate. It could be as high as one in 34, one and 35, but the CDC number is one in 64 children have autism boys four times more likely than girls to have autism. So it impacts the fastest growing childhood disorder in America. Probably not possible for you to not have a friend, a coworker, a family member of someone in your circle that's been impacted by autism. My best friends. So spectrum disorder. So that means you meet one person with autism, you've met one person with autism, because every child, every adult is impacted differently from some very high functioning folks who you might've heard the term asperger's disorder, a false side, Bill Gates allegedly have asperger's disorder to people who are so low functioning that term low functioning, and I don't mean it in a pejorative way, but who have no verbal skills have to be in some kind of group home or very restrictive environment.

Speaker 2:          01:02:57       A huge, huge push was made in the last decade to address issues of adequate diagnosis and intervention. Again, statistically African Americans, Latinos diagnosed two to four years later than their typical peers. Really difficult time accessing services. Now the focus and the push is on the aging out. So a lot of the kids that were diagnosed 10 years ago, 20 years ago, are becoming teens and young adults. So the question of college employment and independent living. So there's been kind of a shift in the community or there's this slowly the shift is happening to focus on what do we do with this population of teens and young adults. So if people want to find out more, where can we find out quick about my work? Uh, uh, Riva, Martin Dot Com and then the nonprofit that I started, especially with these network, especially news network, that org. All right, well it's been an absolute pleasure. We did the long form thing. I mean I literally didn't pick up my notes so that, that is a good conversation. All right, so I want to thank her eva Martin and you can check out more of her work as you just said at Arriva Martin Dot Com and we will do it again next week. Thanks guys.
