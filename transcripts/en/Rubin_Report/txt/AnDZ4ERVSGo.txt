Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I'd

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       like to believe that critical thinking is woven into pretty much everything we do here on the Rubin report, but today's show is going to have an even keener focus on this all encompassing topic. At the end of the day, whether we're talking about politics, religion, or current events, it all boils down to critical thinking, the definition of which is quote, the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment end quote, can we really look at the world the way it truly is, not the way we want it to be. Can we set aside our faith based hopes to analyze real world problems or his faith actually a part of the problem as opposed to being the solution each week I try to have conversations that exist in this space without resorting to ad hominem attacks and Straw man arguments. That guiding principle is fully based in critical thinking and moral reasoning.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       Joining me this week is Peter Boghossian, philosophy instructor, critical thinker and author of a manual for creating atheists. Peter's book is a really incisive, clear take on why critical thinking is important, how faith based thinking can be dangerous, and also relates what you can do to spread ideas based on fact and reason with your friends and family. He writes in an understandable and relatable style on topics that many are afraid to touch on, even with the people closest to them. He gives the reader the very tools to help people trapped by faith based thinking. Yes, I did say help. Their help is exactly what I believe is needed in this situation. When your beliefs aren't based in reason and critical thinking, it creates a space where extremism can creep in. This of course, isn't beholden to one religion or ideology. Anytime you throw reason in fact out the window to trade it with ideas that aren't provable, you create the very breeding ground that extremism needs to spread.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       It's not a coincidence that in places where gays, women and minorities are treated poorly are also the places where religion has often been a substitute for clear moral thinking. By the way, uh, we here in the West could do a much better job of this ourselves. I know we're more focused on Islamic extremism on this show, but there are all kinds of extremism in the world. You can't deal with any of these ideologies with half truths and by shooting the messengers, you must deal with them by looking at them head on and tackling the ideologies with better ideas and moral clarity. We live in a time when religious extremism is on the rise. I'm going to guess that we probably don't have many religious extremists watching this show, so I don't know how much of an effect I can have on those people. The people that I can have an effect on, however, is you guys people out there from every walk of life, from all over the globe who want to do the work of finding out what brings us together, not what tears us apart.

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       I firmly believe that critical thinking is the solution. Critical thinking doesn't care about your race, your sexuality or your nationality is a roadmap to solving serious issues and combating superstitious thinking. That has led to many real world problems. Much of the right in America is led by Christian religious ideology. Much of the left, while not guided by religion, has become as dogmatic in its beliefs between the two is where most clear minded free thinking people live. It's what my guest on next week show Ali Rizvi he refers to as the new center. I think by letting go of our superstitions and focusing on real solutions, we can change the world for the better. Either that or we can leave it up to the zealots after all the world is what you make of it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       Peter goes in as a philosophy instructor, critical thinker and author of a manual for creating atheists. He's also an anterior aggressive warrior and can back it up with some Jujitsu. Peter, welcome to the show. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Really looking forward to our chat. I am looking forward to it as well. You know, every week I feel like I'm connecting with people that I know in the digital space and mostly through 140 characters and I put you in that group. You just did three hours with Rogan. I did. We had an interesting conversation. How you feeling? You came up, you came up to good. I feel great. I feel great. Did he say good things about me? We said nothing. Well, you know, that's the thing. We don't. I think part of it is when people are together and they're sincere, I think they'll, they'll either agree or disagree or there'll be a convergence around those ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       And I started off when we were talking, thinking that I feel like I know you, like I feel that the stuff that you think about and the values that you have are in congruence with my own values. And I think part of that comes from, from the uh, type of honesty with oneself. Yeah. Well we're obviously going to talk a lot about those values and I think it really is cool that this, this group of people come together. You were sort of in this a little bit before me and connected with Sam and some of those other guys, but now Rogan, Christina Hoff, sommers, all these people who don't necessarily agree on everything. Don't come from the same walks of life or the same socioeconomic separate, whatever, that we've all sort of come together because we have these base principles, apps that we want to put out there.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       Yeah, I think that's right. And I think that it's so. So here's one way to think about it. We often think about the right and the left on some kind of align. So there's the far right, which is obviously on the far right of the line, the far left and the middle. There's this philosophy, there's a French philosopher has this idea of a horseshoe theory. You take the ends of the line and you bend them together. The far left and the far right are closer to each other than they are to the center. Yeah. And so I think that that's a helpful heuristic or helpful way to look at some of these issues. And for me it was, you know, rather than give a geological account about how this came to be for, for me, what's always interesting is when

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I look at the mean spiritedness, the anger, the tactics of the regressives, they're just so fundamentally contrary to what my values are and for the sort of person that I want to become. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and I do see that that horseshoe, that far left in that far right and the left the regressive seem extraordinarily angry and eager to smear those people with racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. If you don't buy into certain, even if you ask questions as opposed to buying into something they have made any kind of discourse almost impossible.

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       Yeah. Well, we've talked a lIttle bit about that and i. Sam said something, sam harris said something about how it's almost like scorched earth. I think I'm loosely quoting what he said because the tactics have been so bad. But before we get into all that, let's talk about you a little bit so people can understand where you come from. All this and, and the book that you've written, which I just read this week and manual for creating atheists. It was, it was wonderful. It was, it was what I tried to do here actually, uh, which I guess goes to what you said at the top because it was understandable you were trying to give people the tools to go about talking about, you know, reasoning and, and morality without taking the leap of faith.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Yeah. And, and asking people starts off in. So thank you for the, for the book. You enjoyed the book. I fully did. It really did. And if you didn't, you tell me. I absolutely. Okay. So that's the type of sincerity and I'd appreciate that. So, so the book talks about in the forthcoming app atheist, which talks about how to have more civil productive conversations with people to help them break through dogmatism, to help them break through these deep seated beliefs that they hold and that they think that they're better people because they hold these beliefs. So how to really have productive conversations and engage people. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       So I think the best way to jump off on this is let's just define some terms and I've done this in one incarnation or another a few times on the show and we've talked about religion and atheism and agnosticism and all that. But why don't you just give me some basic definitions, which is sort of how you start the book. So just what is an eighth?

Speaker 3:          00:08:01       Yes. So the way I define ads, I think it's right. These are placeholder terms. I'm willing to revise those. I don't have an atheist is a person who doesn't have sufficient evidence to warrant belief in god, but if they were given that evidence then they would believe so inherent in the term atheist or the way that I use it is a sort of open mindedness.

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       Right. Which is funny to me, and that's the way you describe it in the book because there seems to be a certain subset of people that think that atheists are actually the most closed minded people, but that's not the way you are defining. And maybe that's just sort of the personalities that have been publicly attached to them.

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       To a certain extent. We, we can understand why someone would think that because the word theist is contained with the word atheist and just as theorists tend to have these dogmas where they latch onto religious propositions, faith, faith promises to faith. So two, one would think that atheists does. But again, I think that the faithful have constructed these narratives to, to make it as if there's some kind of a parallelism, assymetry of belief. Look, we believe these things. You guys believe that we, we, we have beliefs that are predicated on no evidence just like you do. Right? And I, I don't, I, I think that's a type of insincerity. I don't think that people who are honest with themselves and have a minimal level, you know, basically enough intelligence to tie a shoe, a shoe is, I don't think that it's possible to come to that conclusion.

Speaker 3:          00:09:28       Yeah. So, so before we go too deep on that, what are the other, what are the other terms we should just define right at the beginning? So agnosticism for example, um, I would, you don't, you're not big on. No, I don't like that. I don't like the term. I think it's a, it's a useless tournament we need to do away with it. You don't believe in santa claus? No. So you were a santa claus, a atheist or don't understand to close. Agnostic, right. So the word agnostic is gives wiggle room worse. No wiggle room should exist. The default to any belief shouldn't be. Maybe the default should probably be no, unless I have sufficient evidence to believe. But again that's part of the hijacking of the narrative. Right. So that's interesting. So a lot of people I've heard lately, they described themselves as agnostic atheist.

Speaker 3:          00:10:17       That seems to be like the new or have you heard about that one where it gives them, I guess a little more wiggle room, but you're saying that that in a way that sort of cheating the, the idea here, right? Yeah. And maybe people self described that way because they feel they want to reap some social benefits from it. Maybe they feel that they don't want to offend people or insult people or make people feel bad so that they use these wiggle terms. Yeah. So in the book. Well, first off, is there anything else we should define? Just real quick. All right. I don't know. I don't think so, but if, um, if we've defined something and it's, you're right, it's important to define words and those can be placeholders for later on because if someone says, I'm an agnostic atheist, I'll say, well what do you mean by that?

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       And I can challenge or what have you, but if not it's like two ships passing each other. Not like we don't know what the conversation is about. And there was a lot of that in the book where you're talking about, you know, people with faith and people without faith or a nonbeliever verse believer, whatever, however you want to define it there they're talking about two different things and that sometimes makes the conversation really kinda crazy. It does. And that's the problem with faith is that it has a broad semantic range and people try to use the term to do some work that it doesn't do, like they try to use the term to protect like, well I believe that muhammad fluid having a winged horse or I believe jesus walked on water fasting or the dalai lama incarnates through bodies where it. But I, you just say you have faith, your wife loves you or you have faith in a plant. So they use that term as an umbrella term to almost cover their beliefs from any make an impervious to reason. And I just don't think that's, that's a very sincere way to approach any inquiry.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       Right? So I think a lot of people just from this first five or six minutes are going to say, well, this guy, this guy is a pretty open minded atheist like that. That's going to be part of it. And I think one of the things you said right at the beginning of the book is you don't really define yourself as an atheist. And I thought you were. I thought your reasoning was actually really clever. Can you go into that? What you tell me what you got it and then I'll, I'll. Well basically you were saying I don't define myself as someone that doesn't believe in leprechaun. Right. So, but, but yet there seems to be with atheists, there seems to be so much onus on them to constantly have to talk about it or, or whatever it is. I've only been in this kind of.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       I never even publicly said that I was an atheist. Yeah. Literally it was about two months ago, I think when milo yiannopoulos was on the show, I always considered myself sort of a friend of the atheist community. I always liked atheists. I like free thinkers. I like critical thinkers. It never, it wasn't something that really hit me one way or another. I didn't feel like I needed to say, all right, I have to make this announcement or this announcement. but somehow in that conversation with him, I had finally got to my breaking point or something. Well that was good then. It was a good car. So Yeah, it was all good

Speaker 3:          00:13:06       honesty though. Public asta. And so I think that the Word atheist still has some negative connotations and a lot of negativity is attached to it, but I don't. I think that atheism is a conclusion and it's ultimately, it's much less important that then epistomological hygiene if you were like thinking about how you come to knowledge and making sure that, that, that those ways to come to knowledge or reliable. Because that's the other thing that was a big realization for me a long time ago is that that faith, faith claims are knowledge claims. So when someone makes a faith claim, they're making a claim about the world. Like I have faith because of x. So people use faith as a process to get to a claim about the world. I mean the whole thing is just so bizarre twisted, but unfortunately where we live or it's surrounded surrounding us, but I don't, I don't have. It's really weird to me. Like I'll go to, I'll speak an atheist conference and people would be singing about being an atheist since I just, I can't. It's just unfathomable.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       Right. Well that's why your description of it felt decent to me. You know what I mean? It does. It certainly, as I said, I didn't talk about it until three months ago. It's never. I don't think it will ever be something that defines me. What defines me are my thoughts and my, the breadth of all the things that I am, but that's just to define yourself by saying you don't believe in. Actually it doeSn't make that much sense. Right? Yeah, and

Speaker 3:          00:14:26       I'm trying to think about defining yourself in terms of your thought. I don't even know if I had to do that. I mean, I think it important to ask yourself, what kind of person do you want to be like, you know, I want to be a kind person. I want to be a compassionate person. I am very confident that those values are derived through reason and that we can articulate ways to get through those very clearly, but I'm not. I'm not Sure if he hit me. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I want to be tHe type of person who's willing to revise my beliefs. Maybe I want to be the type of person who's inquisitive and trustful of reason and who treats people well, you know, maybe that's the kind of person I want to become. so maybe those things are identify self identify with those, but I don't. It's just an odd thing to me to latch that onto an identity.

Speaker 2:          00:15:15       Yeah. Well I, I certainly agree with that. So a lot of what you're doing in the book is really, I think you actually use this word is to deprogram people from faith and I thought using that word was particularly interesting because you're viewing it as sort of, you know, we all enter this, this life sort of as a clean slate and then we're programmed with this stuff and you're trying to give everyone the tools to, to deprogram.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Yeah, that's exactly right. We have been indoctrinated by ideas, culture. We have. Everybody has a kind of cultural myopia that's reinforced by religion and beliefs. So how do we help people to become more reflective about their beliefs? How do we help people to become less dogmatic about what they, about their thoughts and, and you know, maybe maybe that's why like for me even the is and part of an identity, but maybe that's because it's a dominant heteronormative or you know, so I mean, I, I don't, I don't know. What I do know is that people think that havIng certain beliefs makes them a better person. Dan debt talks about this in terms of belief and belief and part of the problem is once you start taking that, you're holding beliefs makes you a better person. You're much less likely to revise those because it moves from the realm of epistemology that is knowledge to the realm of morals and you don't want to be that guy like you don't want to be. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       yeah. No, I'm with you. The difference between knowledge and morals, which people seem to conflate constantly, right?

Speaker 3:          00:16:47       Yeah. And it's interesting in terms of the, the regressive left and the, the idea of race. When people talk about race that is just so charged and so politicized that they have made it almost impossible for a sincere inquirer to ask a question without being smeared or labeled in some way, and we've lost the ability, we've lost the ability in an academic context to ask sincere questions that we get. The only way to solve any problem, the first step is to be honest about it. If you're not honest about it, you're not going to solve it. And you've written about this. And Douglas Murray was on sam's podcasts. Other people have spoken buts. I've tweeted about this. I wrote about this. If you do not allow questions than extremists are eager to come in with answers. And so that's one of the consequences that we see and we see this in a religious landscape. Very it, especially with islam. Now with me, we see this terrible problem. So we're,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       we're jumping ahead a little bit. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Follow you on this jump. Um, so when it relates to, to the left, now I assume you're basically someone that comes from the left, right? I mean, from everything I knew, classical liberal, liberal class every, every virtually every sense. Yeah. So I assume that also that you feel the same way I do that it's your job to police them more than the. Right. Right. Like for me, people always say to me, well, why aren't you attacking the right as much? And it's like I see I have not part of the right. I do attack them. I, I, I don't think I've ever voted for a republican in my life. Not, I'm not a fan of the democrats and I'm not a democrat. I'm an independent, but I. But for me to police the people that I'm not part of, you know, it, it just seems silly. I want to police my guys. Do you feel that? I mean, is that part of what you do and

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       I feel to me it's more germane in the sense that the left, the regressives have taken over academia. They have literally hijacked the institutions and now they're institutionalizing these policies which are really rather extreme by any in any, any classical liberal would be horrified at what their speech codes, microaggressions. Troy, it's horrifying and they're Basically robbing a generation of people have the possibility of being able to think clearly and critically and their ever increasing the threshold. People's threshold for what they consider to be offensive or the types of conversations they'll have is continuously dropping. So for me it's personal only and then I have to deal with this every single day and I write. I mean it's, it's the most personal thing. Yeah, it's, it's endemic now. Why? Why don't you criticize the rightest much? Well, I mean, look, I have criticized the right, you've criticized the right. Think about the type of criticism you have to label against a guy who is a bonafide. Can I start?

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       We're on. Your shows were away. Yeah, everyone always asked me before they swear I probably, I probably asked me for a while. That's fine.

Speaker 3:          00:19:46       Yeah. I mean think of, think about about, you know, like huckabee, who is a bonafide fucking lunatic, right? I mean think about guys like Donald Trump. I mean these guys are so outside, not even actually that's status. They're not outside the mainstream or at least have that place. Yeah. And labeling a sort of criticism against that type of crazy is very different from people for whom I feel sympathies for these impulses they have. They have very decent impulses that base and we need to be careful that because they're so insincere and dishonest that we don't disregard their whole message. Like the onus falls upon us to think clearly about that, into really, okay privilege, I got it, you know, this gender thing, you know, but to really take a step back and separate the message from the messenger so that we don't discount the whole thing. Yeah. I'm

Speaker 2:          00:20:41       very, very aware of that all the time, you know, because I know that I'm attacking the trigger warnings and safe space and all that stuff and I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater and I know that there are legitimate racial issues in early legitimate socioeconomic issues and all of that stuff. But because of the way these guys have behaved and frame the debate, they've made it extremely difficult to separate legitimate issues. That's exactly right. From pure craziness. So I think what's interesting related to someone like you that comes from a place where you're writing and talking about moral clarity and and critical thinking, this has to be. It's almost like doubly worse for you in a way to be part of this because there's the, there's the thinking part, the spiritual part. Like it's just a lot mixed into one crazy thing.

Speaker 3:          00:21:26       Yeah, it's interesting. I mean everybody, you had I think nicola here and other people have given geological accounts of how we got into the situation, but I think the thing that people really aren't thinking about or talking about that much or what are the implications for these things. I mean, what are the philosophical. What does this mean? What did this would interest. We're both speaking quickly. We have so much to sacrifice, so much to get up and go, what does this mean when we've created academic environments in which people in which professors are terrified to give a dissenting opinion and then when dissenting. I mean something from, from the regressive party line. What does that mean

Speaker 2:          00:22:06       for a second, let's define dissenting because it's barely dissenting. It's literally just saying anything other descending. It's not like you're saying something that's really against what the mainstream belief is. It's pretty much anything like, you know, be okay with someone else wearing a halloween costume that you may not like. ThAt's the tour sort of dissenting. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:24       And that's the kind of craziness that you get when you. So it's again, it's the issue of how we got there is extremely interesting and valuable. I'm, I'm interested in recently my work has been focusing on what does that mean for one's intellectual life? Like what does that mean for one's ability to reflect on issues? What does that mean for one's ability to make decisions about things that really matter? Not halloween costumes. I understand that some people think that matters, but that's just evidence of an inability to show moral triage, you know, to prior to indexically partners prior to some kind of a hierarchy to identify that one need and another need and show why that's important. And the way that you do that is through reason and rationality. That's how you get there and the way that you. So when you attack safe spaces and when you attract trick, true warnings, you're actually, this is the key thing, you're actually doing them a favor because, because you're giving them an opportunity, you're giving people an opportunity if their values are true, like if their values are morally correct.

Speaker 3:          00:23:31       And I do believe that there's such a thing as being morally correct and obviously they do as well or they couldn't be espousing. And that's just parenthetically, that's the interesting difference between, that's the, uh, the contradiction in their beliefs between being lost. My train of thought. Well that I think, I think you're going that they think that, oh yeah. So right. Yeah. So, so you. So these people, they have the legacy of relativism, but yet the values that they put forth a radical egalitarianism, you cannot be a relativist entity. Galitary and safe. You cannot say everything is relative and then all systems are equal. So one of the things that you're doing, you're doing, they'll look at it as to them, but I will look at it as to advance their cause. One of the things you're doing is you're giving people an opportunity to reflect on how they know what they know, and the only way you can do that is through an unsafe space.

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       The only way you can do that Is to really take a look at these ideas and examined these ideas. There just is no other way. So if they have their values are arbitrary and subject to cultural capriciousness, unless they can be rationally derived and they've taken out the engine of rationality once they've created spaces in which you can ask these questions. Yeah, so that's why I've a few times I'll say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions that I believed that these guys. Actually. Joe rogan fought me on this when I said this, I said, I believe these guys, like with the athletic thing on real time with sam harris and all that I did, while his intentions were good. You know what I mean? He was intending to try to protect the other joe. Basically it was like, nah, he's a hollywood guy.

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       He's just protecting her zone, his own internals and actor. He's an actor. That's it and he's, he's out for number one fund, but I guess that's probably what really is perverse about what's going on on the left because by taking kids, by taking college kids whose thoughts aren't fully formulated yet and then putting this thing on them, they think they're doing everything for good intentions, but then they're going to walk out into the world realizing the world doesn't really react that way. Yeah, and if they're listening to this and they're just dumping on you and hate you and hate in me, I think it's perhaps a nice, helpful heuristic to think about it in terms of standing for the flag.

Speaker 3:          00:26:02       An example on the rIght, people on the right are big on respect for the flag. They've made their own thing sacred, but I don't think that's important. I think what's important is to teach people why they should stand for the flag, what our values mean and and that's why they're standing. It's not an icon, but I think that the same property holds on the left. They have to. They have to start being honest and realizing that if their values really are true, then they have to subject those values to scrutiny and then we have to create spaces. we have to create environments where the marketplace of ideas, we can have a discourse and a dialectic above these things. Exactly. If that's just a little different, we just do the do the officers. That's why they should be thankIng you. I'm, I mean, I'm being facetious.

Speaker 3:          00:26:52       I'm being really sincere. That's why they should be thanking you because if not then that means their values are arbitrary. So when I talked about this with milo and the and the college thing, you know, he said that what this really is about, this isn't about left and right. He was saying that thIs really is about authoritarians versus the word of porsche and that's what you're really talking. That's the horseshoe. Yeah. So, so somehow though, I think this is related to religion to right, we can relate this very much to absolutely. Thinking of religion. So can you go down that path for me a little bit? yeah. So the, they use many of the same mechanisms. They have things that are sacred. In this case, it's the rise of the victim, the victim hood culture. They have certain questions, certain ideas can't be questions, can't be challenged to churches or safe space to university campuses are safe space.

Speaker 3:          00:27:36       And, and so here's what's super interesting. When I did a talk a few years ago, uh, I dunno, five years, I don't even know it's on youtube. Jesus, the easter bunny. And other delusions just say no. Yeah, I know if you saw that or not, doesn't matter. But, but the people who protested that were not chrIstians, I had some christians come in, the audience, I speak all around the world. People are in general with very few exceptions. Christians and muslims are very civil to christians. I go out for beer off afterwards, but it's the regressive leftist who, I mean this, I mean really think about this. This is, this is like the feminist is rice said to joe today. It's like the feminists in bed with the islamists, I mean is you just could not conceive of a relationship that was more eight to thetical t two, one, one of those parties interests, right?

Speaker 3:          00:28:24       So, so it's interesting that, that, and I'm pretty sure that the, the islamic, no, uh, that they're never going to treat these women any better. Right? It's. So what is that? What is that? I'm sorry to cut you off, but what is that? That, what are they doing? So they just view. So these feminists for whatever, they just view the other as more oppressive than they are, so they just have to give them their credit. I mean, is that, it's really that simple and that is a comp. I have thought about that a long time. I think it deals with the color of people's skin oppression. I think it deals with, you know, this whole third wave feminism that I still don't understand. Uh, I, I, I don't know, I don't, I cannot explain to you, and I've thought about it extensively, how this cohabitation fine, not a marriage, but how, how this, how this bizarre relationship came to be.

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       I still cannot understand it. and the most recent event at goldsmiths dot dawkins was tweeting on and such. I mean that is, that should be a case study for people. The, that is even boggling my mind to even think about trying to understand that. Right? And then so that and, and all of this and all the stuff that we're talking about in this discussion, it shows again why that if you don't help the reformers, the actual reformers who are trying to change make things better for women and gays and might not even question if you don't help these people and you keep framing these people as the problem. Well what do you, do? You get the rise of trump? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just going to say that extreme. I think my treat was something like a, if you have create environments in which you can ask questions, extremist step in with solutions.

Speaker 3:          00:30:03       And I think that that's exactly right. Could this, so really could, do you think that this atmosphere that, that trump has taken advantage of their, their sense of palpable fear, right in America that I haven't felt before. I really do. I sense that people are feeling like everything is screwed up, that there's, we have this terrorism stuff. We don't know what the answers are. There's this refugee thing. We're all children of refugees are descendants of refugees here, unless you came over as a slave or a american indian, right? If you were actually indigenous to this land. Um, and I just had this sense that people don't know what's going on. and then when you shut down the people on the left, zach, then of course trump. Yeah. Okay. So I really wish that every single person listening to that would put the rewind button and listen to that again.

Speaker 3:          00:30:50       So if you're one of these people who thinks that you're doing the world a favor by creating, you know, triggering, protecting people who are, you know, you want to protect the sensitivities of others. Again, not a bad impulse at all, but the consequence of that is that people become less capable of making discerning, rational judgements, particularly in the moral sphere. So the consequence of those things is that Donald Trump is right there with the answer and I just read a piece about the number of people who, who support trump who won't admit it, is far higher, which is terrifying and we know that the way we don't want to create adversarial relationships. I mean if so, I think that part of this problem, I don't want to go down this rabbit hole necessarily, but part of this problem is we have to engage trump's arguments on his own terms.

Speaker 3:          00:31:38       And part of that is if the idea is that, that this is going to make America safer, I think that's what we should. We shouldn't appeal to patriotism, which we should take a look at that. I don't think that claim is true. I don't think that's borne out by the evidence. I don't think there's any reason to think that first off, it's not even constitutional. Any of the keeping people out based on religion or we can accept. We can just bracket that. Yeah, and we can just look at, okay, what is the consequences of this? and you know, what is the concept? Well, let's see. Well what is the content you think that muslim, muslim, islamic. It's again, so we need to figure that they're getting caught in words. Even this. Isn't that the crazy thing? Yeah. They've made us also crazy about words that whatever you were about to say there, you had to think about it 18 different ways.

Speaker 3:          00:32:20       Even though you're sitting across from somebody that you know is okay with the idea of what you're going to talk about. I was, I was caught because I said, okaY, well we should have defined the term islam is the religion, the belief, the ideas that so and mostly from the people of the people and it for some reason that seems to be an unbelievably too way too complicated for people to understand. I don't understAnd, why do you think that is? Because it, and it also seems like they can only do that with islam, like the issue only seems to be with islam because if we were to say anything about christianity, people would be saying, great job. You're awesome all day long. Or if you say anything about radical islam, they'll say, well, the crusades, which is right. So that. So you did it. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:02       So that's right. Because that's. Remember I said the values, they hold her egalitarianism, relativism for them in their minds. Egalitarianism. Look, every age has had a dominating value. In aristotle he talks about the and gentlemen in homer. It was strengthened little tara was humor and now it's, it's in one side. It's egalitarianism in relatives. for them, everything has to be relative. It'S like the, the, the, uh, usually the default is relativistic and andy galatarian. So while they have their band guys, but you have your bad guys. I'm actually no, actually those things are not morally equivalent. And so, so you're asking the question was, was a pertinent and it's one that should be explored. Like what is that about? I think part of it is that we've extended the, the umbrella of rights a wider and wider and I want to be crystal clear that I'm, I'm being descriptive, not evaluative.

Speaker 3:          00:33:59       I'm describing the state. I'm not saying it's good or bad, you know, I was just at a restaurant with my buddy there before we came here and you know, I don't eat, um, I try to eat only cruelty free meat so I won't eat that's school. So we've now extended the umbrella of rights to, to animals, right? So that is constantly extending. So the next step for some people is to extend that to ideas. We've extended that and, and I. And I think that's really interesting, right? You got it. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, no, I want to throw it again in that for a second. So we've extended the ideas of rights, which used to be for people now to animals because we want to treat animals better. Minority. The next version of that will be with ideas. So we're going sorta take, we're going to put on even softer gloves and when it comes to ideas, because even that should be held in some sort of.

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       Yeah, because people, as I said in my tam talk, ideas don't deserve dignity. People do, and it's kind of become a meme, but it's true. It's, it's that. It's just the next kind of radical. Taking that idea and extending it further on, and the problem with that is that you do a disservice to those people holding beliefs because you don't respect their beliefs to engage them enough. Let's do the thing that's really not talked about. This whole enterprise is really one of disrespect that they're. They're trying to engender these values of respect but not listening to people, not engaging people, people's ideas. Even, you know, you've talked about your show, the soft bigotry of low expectations. I think it was bush bushes phrase and I kept crediting bill maher, which at least sounded nice. Now I'm quoting George W. Bush. I don't know. I feel like, well, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       So then you'll be an con, right? Everybody's going to gang up on us because they're going to say, look at you guys. You're really love bush deep in your heart. Yeah. No, that's actually not true. That's just a fabrication. That's the kind of mental gymnastics people need to do to keep their ideological biases in place. Yeah. Well that was one of the things, you know when we launched the show in order to sam was the first guest and he said that they're always looking, that these people are always looking for something in you, not that you've said this opinion or that you've shared this idea, but if they can somehow link together something that gets them to where they want you to be, you're out. Yeah, and just thInk about this kind of person. Think about discharging that impulse that you have. Think about the kind of person that you are.

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       It's difficult for me to say without, without being overly harsh and as soon as example of a time when someone ought to be overly harsh, but that makes me feel really sad for somebody. Yeah. Well that's. That's very much how I feel I had out of all of this because like I could barely speak what I'm saying because this, this situation has cost me friends and relationships already and I've only been talking about this stuff for a couple months and so I see the way people have turned on me and I, I've gotten into big debates with friends and said, can you point me to where I said what you're accusing me? And they never do because they can't. So thAt's that. So, so if I may ask you, what is the point of contention you lost? Was that an issue? Was it a sweet one who exists in the world that we exist in?

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       That's public person, uh, who I no longer talk to anymore who's been a good friend of mine for the last couple of years, said that my whole show now is about bigotry to muslims. And I said it's actually the complete route. I'm trying to separate people from the ideology and trying to show that not everyone believes this. I brought on people repeatedly to talk about tolerance. You know, the way they'll frame, they'll say sam and majid that they're, uh, that these are the bigots they're book was called. It was about islam and the future of tolerance, not islam in the future of nuclear war, you know, so it's, it's these mental gymnastics as you just said. So what would that person lIke you to do not talk about it? I suppose not talk about these important issues. Okay. But I'm not going to do that. Right. But then again, that goes back to what we started the conversation with them.

Speaker 3:          00:38:03       That's why you get trump's. Yeah, exactly. SO I don't, I would ask them. So that's kind of the feasibility test that I talk about in the book. And the app haS the feasibility tests. It's under. What conditions do you think that that belief would be? False. You can leave. It doesn't have to be religion. You can use the usability tests is not my idea. It's matt mccormick's. You can use the usability tests with anything. So under what conditions could I demonstrate to you that I am not a biased against muslims hydro? If they say to you, well, there are no conditions, well that's a type of belief closure. There's, then there's, there, there almost is no conversation. then you have to take a step back and I hate to say this, but to the metal level and have a conversation about that. Um, but, but I think that, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:38:46       I'm now, now I'm kind of ideating. I think I'm concerned about your friendship with this person. I mean, I've given up basically because once, because after being called a bigot repeatedly and saying, actually, no, and can you point me to any, and I know I'm not a big, you know, uh, Douglas Murray said something really interesting on sam's podcast. He Said, I have no time anymore for people whose intentions are not good. You know what I mean? So I know I'm not a racist, so if you want to call me a racist or call me a bigot, it actually, since I'm not, it actually, I don't like being called a racist or a bigot, but it doesn't really have any meaning because it's just a word. If I was secretly racist and you were calling me a racist, I suppose I would struggle with it a little bit more, but so that's, that's the hard thing about, that's that really is difficult about dealing with people who are insincere and I think a lot of those attacks on sam, like in philosophy, this thing called a hermaneutic of charity. You want to give everybody a charitable reputation and you want to say, okay, these guys actually believe this stuff, you know, but over time you just have to grow up. Yeah, I mean I, I, I hate to say this, I'm, and I don't hate to say this because it's.

Speaker 3:          00:39:52       I should have woken up to this conclusion long ago. I don't think these people are sincere. No, I don't think so at all. But that's hard to grasp too. It is hard to grasp because if they thought they had the truth, why wouldn't they be sincere? Yeah. So excuse me. That's, that's the thing thAt kind of keePs me from going on a full throttle attack. I mean, maybe the, their cognitive software has somehow been hijacked by this moral. This idea that they think that they're defending the downtrodden and we, you know, we need to do this as an examPle. It's okay to do this because we're stripping some, you know, there's some utilitarian calculus, like, oh, it's going to be in the greater goods. I don't know what goes through their mind, but that's the problem with dealing with someone who's insincere. Yeah. So I do think that I think that they think, and maybe I, I'm probably giving them the, the leash, that they wouldn't afford me.

Speaker 3:          00:40:47       Right. But I do think they think as much as said he thought he said they think that they were in a war. So they're gonna use whatever tactics they have. What I find particularly odd about it is that now that we live in a digital age where everything is recorded and you can be quoted, you know, talking to this person about this or this person about that even when they're confronted with new evidence or frontier or exposed as frauds, they just doubled down even more, which is incredible. Yeah. So, so I share your frustration and I'm sympathetic with it. Um, I dunno, I, I would, I would, I mean I'm a hey look, I just, I'd call your friend again and say, hey look, I've been thinking about this. let's have a talk. I mean, I wouldn't let that friendship go because that's not like trying to get them to sit down.

Speaker 3:          00:41:31       We did this over text. They wouldn't even, they wouldn't even sit to even say let's get coffee. that's again, part of the regressive left. Yeah. They don't want to have conversations. They want to end those conversations. And ironically they turn that against us and say, well look, you guys are the ones who don't want to have conversations. And I look the whole prompt. This is the schism and liberalism, right? And it was made can naked on the bill maher show with ben affleck and sam. And this is something again, to solve these problems, we need to be on it. We need to be forthright, we need to be honest. We need to create environments where we can talk about the problems and almost if you were to, again, create a list of how not to solve your problems. These people have it. I mean, they've done it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       Perfect job. You know, what's amazing to me also is that I never mean to go this deep into it even. I really wanted to focus more on atheism. Oh, I'm happy I'm. We're going to go there now and I'm happy to do this, but what I think is particularly fascinating about this is that everything else that we talk about and that we're going to talk about is so related to this. That's why this, this whole situation has been so bananas because this schism has exposed something that I think people didn't really realize. But let's. Let's just leave that portion there. Unless you want to give me a closing statement on that and then we'll take it isn't. No, it isn't. I just think that we. This is not a very hopeful time right now. You know, I mean we're dealing with very serious ecological issues and we have people who are apologists for big oil companies and denialists and end of anthropogenic global warming.

Speaker 3:          00:43:03       And again, I actually do think those people should be given a seat at the adult table and anybody who has a view different from my own, as long as they provide evidence is welcomed to have a conversation. I think that there's something that's morally damaging about what the regresses are doing. And I think people have had enough. I have had way more than enough. And, and I think now like your, your show has really caused this catalyst almost this cascade of people who also feel the same way and they're like, mines are gravitating and they've, they've really robbed us of any idea of hope that we have because we look at the presidential campaign and I, it's just. Holy moly. I mean, I look at the republicans and I think, wow, like any one of those people would be an unmitigated disaster. Right? and this is this.

Speaker 3:          00:43:59       I mean, we. All right, we're just gonna keep going with this, right? No, no, no, no, no, we'll, we'll just keep going because you're hitting on it that, that, this thing is so it's so powerful because I watched the republican debates and I think I could never in good conscience vote for all you people. And, but now part of, there is a piece of me that when I see that there, this regressive group when they want to, they all like bernie. Now there's a piece of me that's like, do I like the same guy they like, that's crazy because I do like him, you know what I mean? But that's how perverse this whole thing is. That's why we have to make sure that we separate the message from the messenger. Yeah. And that's why it's so difficult to do that when you're constantly smeared.

Speaker 3:          00:44:41       If you use the wrong pronoun by accent. Look, I'm 49. I've been growing up calling. Uh, he, he, I, I, it's not mal intent. I'm not, I don't have some deep moral malignancy in me that I'm kinda, you know, it's like I made a fucking mistake. And so we have, again, we have been there so morally right all the time too, you know what I mean? There's so they're always policing everyone else's words as if they have high gna of ha ha, that's, that's part of the genius about this. Anyway, let's, we'll do the atheism thing. It's crazy though because I do want to keep going with this because I feel each week I feel like I can get away from this a little bit and then something else happens that brings me back into it. And we've talked about it in a little more of a lofty way, which is nice.

Speaker 3:          00:45:22       AlSo, not so much the nitty gritty of it, but in this sort of, in sort of a bigger sense. But uh. All right. So let's, let's get to somebody, and this is all going to relate back to it, but. So I want to know about new atheists. There's a, there's an attack on new atheist as I understand it. New atheist pretty much are just atheists who are finally speaking up about atheism. It may be a little more you, you define it. I think a little more specifically write in the book. There's a little more about that. They're actually trying to shoot down some ideas where an old atheist maybe just removed themselves from the discussion. Is that fair? Yeah, I mean different people define it different ways. Austin, dc. Some people think there's no difference between new and the old. I think. I do think there is a difference.

Speaker 3:          00:46:04       I think there a little more kind of a forthright in their speech and people interpret being forthright as being disrespectful, overly aggressive. I think that's a mischaracterization. I think that they've made this, the additional move from the, these, this set of beliefs or this suite of beliefs is irrational to these beliefs are delusional. And I think from my work delusion has been a component of, of how I think it's helpful to think about the problem and uh, but they don't take too kindly to that. The believer, the believer, the average believer and you say you're delusional. they're usually not that responsive. If you do that, you haven't read the book because you never, you don't want to invoke a defensive posture and something that you want to enter into a conversation in which people change their bullies from point of view of safety, so this is literally what you do in the book.

Speaker 3:          00:46:56       I mean you lay out the exact tools on how you should talk design by line word for word as a template that you can use and people have gone around. One anthonY, magna, bosco has gone around videos on youtube who implements the uses, the scientific method. What iS your confIdence in this belief? Gives an intervention based upon the book. Now what is your internet post-test, pretest intervention post stuff, and it's amazing that the down moves that people make and only five to 10 minutes. So we know that this works. We that this is effective. We know that these sorts of very civil, very engaging and that's the other thing, you never have to worry about anybody saying they don't want to talk about their faith. Everybody loves. that's the one thing that people will get. The one commonality among people of faith. They love to talk about it. So speaking of talking about it, I, you also hit upon how people

Speaker 2:          00:47:48       are very selective in what they believe and if you get them to admit, well I don't believe that a this or that happened, right? I don't believe some heart, you know, about chopping off hands are tied to your head. That's, that's the crazy part. But I believe in this other stuff. But I think what you were saying is that basically if you can get them to sort of started meeting something not true, that's sort of how you pull the string right to then leading to getting them to admit some other stuff probably.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       Yeah. And in a lot of that is you have to create conditions. And again, this isn't me, there's a long body of literature. There's a long line of literature about how to change the behavior of people who don't want their behavior change. It's from drug and alcohol counseling. It's from, you know, motivational interviewing, cult exiting. This is out there, but nobody is really synthesized it. Nobody's brought these disparate elements together. So

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       I was partly thinking this when I was reading the book, what would you, what would you say is the problem if there's the average person that's a believer that uses religion for community, you know, celebrate some holidays, whatever the religion might be, um, but isn't doing anything, uh, you know, not, not the people that are beheading people, but if you're just some average person that doesn't necessarily take your faith seriously, but you get some sense of community, whatever it is, do you see an inherent problem in that? Or is that just for you? It's like, well, you're just sort of diluted, but alright, go, go with it.

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       I do see a problem because I think that people are wasting their life energy on something that's not true. They are harboring of belief about reality that is almost definitely false. And we just know this empirically because of the number of different religions that make different claims about the world. They can't all be right. In fact, there are contradictions. Perfect one, jesus was crucified. Jesus was not crucified islam. Christianity. Mohammed was the last prophet. muhammad was a prophet for mormons. So people are harboring views about reality that are true. The other thing is I've heard people say that a lot and I have to challenge. I have to push back with you on something. I'm not so sure that people can hold a private belief. I'm not so sure that somebody can have a belief and had not had that belief bleed out. Interaction. hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:50:01       Not necessarily base speaking it, but just by the way they are. Can you give me an

Speaker 3:          00:50:05       yeah, well that, that's what it means to hold a belief. I wouldn't say so. Like I, I don't like people. I'm thinking about homosexuality, but that's to charge so many users. Your blazer, like I don't like guys who. This is a nice blazer. We're brooks brothers. I'm just going to make that. I like guys who have brooks boilers but like if I can't stand the smell different, they look different, you know? But, but I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna let that. I'm not going to show that. Like if I meet some, I can work with someone who has a blazer. I can. I think what it means that that's almost a denial of what it means to have a belief, to hold a belief about something so, so I'm also not sure that these beliefs are as benign as people think that they are. And every time I bring that up, people will bring out a study.

Speaker 3:          00:50:49       Well look at this like, you know, religiosity in this group correlated. The smart people will say correlated. The less intellectually adjoined people will say, you know, some causal correlated, okay, whatever. It's a huge difference, but let's just go with it a look what happened to you have religion, you have lower incidence of heart disease or whatever it is. I think that the word you used before was apt. It's community. Those benefits can be found from community and you can get communities of likeminded people without believing any superstitious silliness. You know, you can get, you can get like the same sports team. I mean, he has a community. Yeah. And, and I think that you say, well, what's the harm of someone rooting for the patriots? I don't know anything about football. What's the harm of someone rooting for the patriots? Well, that, that that's this analogous because you're not claiming that it's objective lee.

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       True. Right? And so if I think that the patriots are ordained by god to win the superbowl or whatever it is that they do, you know, again, I don't know anything about sports. So thought was good. Yeah. Linda, thanks super bowl. They'll take me down that road. I travel, then I get 50 hate mails. People love football. Um, so, so I think that the problem is that people make objective claims and they live their lives accordingly. And this is all you got, man. Zach just said, so wouldn't it be better for those people to be invited to see reality for what it is? Wouldn't it be better to give those people an opportunity to flourish? Because if your beliefs, if one belief, it's like you can look at it as like an architect tonic struggling like a big building, right? If one of your beliefs on the bottom level of that building, it's contaminated like a base belief, like jesus rose from the dead order, then all of the beliefs that flow from that are stemmed from that becomes suspect.

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       So if you, if you. So what's the harm? The harm is that if you want to enaBle yourself to flourish and you want to enable your community to flourish, you have to align your beliefs with reality because if you don't, then what you think is objective, moral of the right thing to do will actually be leading you away from flourishing. Right? So that's interesting. So almost in a way you then systemically you have to constantly be compromising because no matter how much new evidence comes in to prove something else, you really have to skirt around it because you built sort of your, your base in things that aren't true. Yeah, and you put your finger on the cognitive problem. The cognitive problem is then in order to reconcile that, they make a virtue out of not revising their beliefs. they make a sin. Then you need to import new words, words that have words that are anathema to belief, revision like sin, like sacred and that buttresses or protects those beliefs from being revised.

Speaker 3:          00:53:46       So there's a whole mechanism to keep this that almost like I talked about in the book, it's. It's almost if you look at it epidemiologically how these things spread, like memes. They spread the medically. When you really think about that, the harm is that literally billions of people are living in ways that they think is just and kind and right and it's not and nation states are created around that and we're in a very serious problem with technology and the instantaneous flow of an access of information. We are in a problem that we can no longer afford. Not only to ignore that, but to disallow. There we go the rest of leftist ago, but to disallow conversations about those things. We look a shocking number of people in this country, and I'm ashamed to say this, but that doesn't. Don't Shoot the messenger. Do not want muslim immigration. They want to target people and not their beliefs. We need to have a talk about that, ignoring that is not only not going to make it go away, but it's going to make that percentage increase and that's the thing that the regressives just cannot seem to understand that.

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       So, and of course we're back to no, but that's okay. So the but the point being that. so then if you were to take someone like sam who's having extremely difficult, complex thought out conversations about the difference between islam and muslims and islam, islam and jihad and all those things, and if you put him in the same bank as trump, there is nobody left. I think that for me exactly, that for me is why I've taken this so that I've taken this thing on because I saw this guy who I told sam to his face. I didn't even know who he was before that, right? Believe it or not, I, I didn't reallY know. I didn't follow them on twitter. I had never read any of his books. I had maybe heard of him, but I watched that thing and I thought, jeSus, here's a guy trying to tell the truth on some pretty controversial things and look at the way he's beIng the

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       even trying to ask questions and that's what's so interesting and that's what you moral look. It's complicated. Moral arguments are just complicated. That's why you have guys very smart individuals who have substantive disagreements about eating animals factory from this is complicated, but that's more reason and not less reason to talk about it and what they've done to sam is that they have created conditions to make it impossible for people to speak. They have really done exactly the opposite of what they.

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       The danger of what's going on in the colleges really, because you were usIng. Sam is one example of this, but if they can breathe that ideology in the colleges now it goes to what you were saying before. You worry about the future because now you're going to bring up all these people with all this idea. So it was some of this though that to have these conversations. First off, people, we view things on vine in six seconds, 140 characters and I'm really happy to be doing long form again and I really do believe that it's coming back and I get emails every day saying that people are digging it so we're on to something, but it's part of it that to have real discussions about real things and especially when you take, when you do it from the religious angle and and atheism and all that. Well, you're basically bill maher and dawkins and a couple oTher people that are really in the limelight of it and that you're putting too much on a few people and that's sort of the reverse of how this should go if you want to have real open discussion. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:57:17       Putting a lot on a few people. Aaron,

Speaker 2:          00:57:21       for example, sorry to, but for example, people always. I'll defend bill maher in related to this and people say, well, he's a dick about it and he's throwing it in everyone's face and all that. And although we say, well, I grant him a leash on this because he's fighting the good fight, in my view, he's fighting thing that's so hard to do and really using reason to explain complex things. So I have to, if he's a little bit of a dick about it. Alright. It's guess what? There's plenty of dicks or the other side too.

Speaker 3:          00:57:48       It's interesting. And again, I think again, afflecks respect clip was just perfect. Afflecks response was so implematic. Now I don't know if rogan's right. I have no idea if this guy is such a good actor. He had us all believe in. I really, I can't. I don't, I don't know the answer to that, but I do know is that that reaction is more typical than ever now and we need less of that reaction. Here's one way that we may want to think about getting less of that reaction. And I'm not being facetious when I say is an incredibly sincere. virtually every time I speak to some and not every time, you know, they're a professional apologist and that goes out the window virtually every time. Excuse me, when I'm speaking with someone, I always think to myself maybe they know something. I don't know if you can just attempt to hold that in your head in. I have found in conversations with religious people, it's been very helpful. I will admit to you, I almost cannot do that any longer with the regressives because because they make a slip of the tongue into some monstrous, heinous act or I always feel that it's personal. Like it's deeply personal. Like there's something, there's something in me that they need to cleanse or something like there's some kind of like, well that's what I mean

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       about the authority or anything. Like they're in a weird way they're doing religious trickery.

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       They are doing. Yeah, right. Yeah. The horseshoe they're buying. Yeah. they're using a lot of the tactics. So the question is like, what do we, how do we engage these people? I mean this is a very. This is a very difficult question. Particularly when they now have at their disposal. They've been there, they've infested academia, you know, like what do we do in these people now the rule makers. Well, it's interesting that the more I try to bring this towards atheism, the more it comes back to this because it seems to me that they're there at the attacks that they've done on the new atheists where they use it as a pejorative. Now you're a new atheist. It's sort of some sort of evil creature, even though I don't know many. I don't know anyone really that identifies as a new atheist as a, I don't think maybe sam does.

Speaker 3:          00:59:56       I, I'm not even sure. Um, I don't know, but they've just muddied the water. You were just saying you don't identify as an atheist. So yeah, I mean, you can attempt to smear me. You can attempt to. But the irony is joe and I talked about this. It's like I have never heard a person used the word intersectional who wasn't just a nasty, who wasn't just a really just mean spirited, angry person. Yeah. And so, and, and I think that is part of the. Of course I should be indignant because I'm a good person. Good people become indignant at these things. Yeah. So, okay, we're going to talk about atheism or we're going to go back. Okay, this is fine. We're Going to do what kind of chart could we do on this? I'm ready to back. Yeah, I know. I know you're going with me.

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       So I think part of the problem is also that when people have made the choice to make the leap of faith, right, whatever the religion that they've jumped in in a certain way, even though I think in their eyes they're doing something very lofty and in a certain way you're doing, you're just. I view it as sort of like you're giving up sort of your like this. The world is a pretty fucked up place. I don't know the answer so I'm just going to leap and just hope that this. So is that, is that part of why it makes the rational person's argument to them? Very difficult because there you're, you're arguing against something that's not rational in its most pure form that I. Did I get somewhere there. Yeah. I don't know. Only because I think different people believe for different reasons and so.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       So I, I don't know. here's what I do know, unlike this belief that seems to be out everywhere, it seems to be going around, you can actually reason people on an audit of unreasonable positions. In fact, I was just talking to my. My buddy that's a couple of days ago, john w dot loftis. I wrote the forward to his new book. He was a disciple of the greatest christian apologist senator. He reasoned, so jerry [inaudible], the list goes on and on and on of people who have done that, and I think it doesn't start with reason so much. It starts with honesty. You really think there was a talking snake like no bullshit like you think, but yet if you looked at your garden and you're raking up and a snake started talking to you, you'd be freaking out, right? Yeah. So, so I. Nobody would believe you and no one would believe you. Right? so these things cohere in a very complicated. Not to use a big word, but covariance set of beliefs that reinforced our beliefs, et cetera,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       et cetera. So I don't think that there's. We can narrow it down to one note or one data point for why people believe. I think it's a very complex equation. Yeah. You know, it's funny, I haven't thought of this so literally until just this second, but years ago, I think in 1997, so I was 21. I went to Egypt and I was at mount sinai, which is supposedly where moses got the 10 commandments and I hiked up the mountain. It's a long hike. You're supposed to do it at night. I did it during the day I ran out of water. I mean I was basically delusional. My stomach was messed up from apes and bad pigeon in cairo. I mean I was. If I was, if there was ever a moment where I was gonna have a spiritual awakening, like that's where it was because I was compromised in my body.

Speaker 2:          01:02:58       Right. And I remember not getting it all. I mean, I remember going to the top of that thing and thinking like if, if there's something here, you got to give me a sign, right? Like if there's something here and this is where moses supposedly saw the burning bush and got the 10 commandments and all that, then you've got to give me something and there was nothing. So for me that was sort of like, oh god is very good at hiding. Yeah, great height or this guy. Yeah, and I think that that's kind of. I mean, if you Really think about this, I apologize ahead of time. If this loWers your iq by a couple of points for jews, peep, people will say, well, that's why you need faith because there is no evidence or there is no. There is nothing for god. You just have to have faith in that, but you don't act that way in any other aspect of your life.

Speaker 2:          01:03:46       Like you know, there's no other arena in that in what you think like that. Can I, can I go back to your friend, your friend again because they're still thinking about this. So what if you had another belief that had nothing to do with muslims or islam that that friend found odious, they would probably let it slide. I think that's where you're going. That's what I'm going. Yeah, that's what I'm. That's what I'm amazed about with this whole thing. This seems to be the one sticking point they can. So what is that? What does that so, so vachon opportunity. I'll tell you what that is. that's an opportunity for your friend to reflect, to sincerely reflect about the moral priority that she or he has given this one issue and to ask yourself, well, does that seem just as an outsider, as an outsider, does that seem that that this one issue should trump everything else?

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       Because I'm frankly, I don't even know if I'm concerned about their wellbeing. I'm concerned about their well priorities. Well that was also part when we were having this discussion, but you get amazon text which also felt so weekend. It felt like nothing. You know, when you're having a video conversation with someone and you can feel a weight to it and you can feel important to do it over text felt ridiculous. I mean not even email, which also wouldn't have felt great, but I could not get this person to sit down with me, um, that there would've been nothing else. And I, and that's your point, there would be nothing else. And when I said, well, is there evidence of this? Have I ever in all the time that you've known me, right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       Was I secretly doing this yet? So here's the thing that I've been, I've been saying it about the thing that I try to be careful of what I've been noticing. It's like I sometimes if somebody has a belief that's just so out in left field, it's really easy for me and I try to rein myself in with this internal tendency. I don't verbalize it articulated if thinking that these people have mental disorders, like it's very, you know. and then I'll talk to people who believe in actual talking snakes and stuff. And again, these are very nice people. They're very easy to talk to. I debated the guy in perth, a, I still keep in touch with them, written to each other. There is something about literally believes that he talks to the snakes. No, in talking snakes, like in the bible. Oh, leave that. He did him.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       Yeah. No, no, no. That's a whole different level of person. And I said, yeah, that, that is, uh, and it's, it's, it's very difficult for me, dave, I, I try not to characterize people whose beliefs are so far afield of mine that they have mental disorders and I find it, I think I find that the type of people who go into religion are the sort of people who tend to be imbalanced anyway and they find a nice community for that, a way to discharge those bizarre blues. It's the same thing with the regressives oh, you're supposed to keep talking about. Yeah, they find this wonderful social justice warrior place where they can be behind their keyboard and angry and smear people that get all the hate and the reach and they. And it's very difficult for me to rein myself in and not write them all off as people who have mental disorders. And I'm, as part of my work, man, I'm trying.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       I hear you in the most that I can possibly hear someone. Yeah, I hear you. And that's why I find it exhausting and it is exhausting. I wonder, so for you, even before the regressive thing took hold so much, this discussion, a discussion about, you know, free thinking and critical thinking versus faith and things you can prove and then you toss in some of the regressives how exhausting is this for you on a, on a day to day basis because I do find that it can be extremely exhausting that at the end of the day I can have trouble shutting off my mind or I'll wake up at six and I click on twitter and then I immediately see craziness before I've gotten out of bed and I do find it sort of exhausting. What about for you?

Speaker 3:          01:07:52       Yeah, I think that's because you care a lot and I don't really care about like the negative things people send it to. I really don't. I mean I legitimately don't die of pressing things that I care about my family and my health. Friendships, you know, relationships and I don't. But I guess in a sense I'm genuinely interested in what people believe and why they believe it and how it's possible to hold preposterous beliefs. So it's just presently perennially interesting to me. What's problematic though in what is exhausting are the constant ways that I self because I'm afraid of academic punishment or they're constantly and I just had another complaint filed against me or the ways that I can't. And it's not that I know that the administration has said anything to me. It's the culture in which were the Academic culture now is you, you just have to be extremely cautious about what you say, particularly in regard to islam or particularly regardless.

Speaker 3:          01:08:50       There are certain things you don't have to be conscious whatsoever. If you want to criticize big pharma, you can just use a thing like in class you can say fuck shit, you can say want but don't use a pronoun wrong or don't say, you know, don't slip again. Forty $9 with the retarded word. I don't do that anymore. But you know, the things that are exhausting to me are the mechanisms that are in place that prohibit the free expression of ideas and not necessarily that I don't have tenure and I'll never get tenure. Not necessarily that anything. It would be a career ender, but it is a theft of my time. It is now. I have to constantly go deal with it and I have to have it in the back of my mind and then, oh, if I say something else, I have another complaint and then I'll be the guy who gets all these complaints.

Speaker 3:          01:09:36       So it's working within these and you know, the other thing I was thinking about last night is that what this does in essence is it pushes the whole system towards mediocrity. It pushes the whole system because then people are afraid to voice controversial ideas or opinions or give sides that students wouldn't here. They want to be the people who don't get complaints filed against them. So they take the evil, the, the ease you, they take the easy courses you know in and what they're not talking about is like, for example, nothing to do with the regressive left, but our end, a cognitive disability in it's challenged. More philosophy were to read a great book about that. We're not talking about the status. Peter singer has really interesting stuff about this philosopher of what should the status of cognitively disabled people be and he says they should be more equivalent and treatment too.

Speaker 3:          01:10:30       I don't want to mischaracterize them, but to to to basically a pigs and cows. I think that that's an important conversation to have and the whole system is then being pushed towards mediocrity because professors don't want to deal with it. They don't. They just can't stomach or handle all these ridiculous student complaints, so they just don't teach it. Yeah. Why are you never going to get tenure? All. I was told that I could publish 10 books from harvard and I never get tenure here. It was like the best thing that ever happened in the moment after this guy, my I won't say who is this person told me this. I wrote an article. I'm like, well, okay, well since I'm never going to get tenure, and I know that there's nothing I can do independent of my accomplishments, I'll never get promoted. I it just felt was the most freeing feeling ever.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I left his office and I wrote a little piece of something that I published, some like a, what should the role of the educator be? And I said that the role of the educator should be to change students' beliefs if they're not in alignment with reality, seems to be totally uncontroversial. My colleagues freaked out about it. The piece went viral. This is brief how this chronology and I got in touch with sam harris and then uh, some guy from paul party from philosophy, so said you want to do a podcast? And when the podcast sam harris tweeted, we need more educators like peter boghossian, how I got in touch with dawkins. Dawkins just tweeted it and that, that just started this whole cascade. But I've never felt more free to talk about anything that I want, knowing that I could be fired at any instant. I'd love that. Actually. It's a freedom that I relish.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       Well, I love it. I love it because it shows you the importance of ideas, which is really, that's the big thing here, that everything else is couched in, right? That you had an idea, you shared it. And then your idea was shared by people that you respect and admire, who you credit in your book for helping you get to this place, and then they spread an idea and that, I guess to sort of bring this all around is what the regressives are fearing. And That's why they want to silence everyone because they don't like. They don't like your ideas. Right? So that they're not going to debate them. Yeah. They don't like it. They think they have the truth. It is really a bizarre kind of a pistol. Logical myopia. Not even, it's just that they, they have these ideas that they're completely convinced are true.

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       Again, like religion, holding them makes them better people. They're sacrosanct. You can't criticism. Not only can you, you can't even ask about him. Can you ask how they derived it? Bang. Interlaced in there. So morally sure of sanctimonious. I guess that's why I wanted to bring this around to relate it to religion because I had been trying to put this all together and there is these underpinnings that are so the same of the authoritarian religious thing. It's all there. It really is all there. It's like they hate really there on the left. So they hate religion, christianity, right? Then they have one religion that they want to protect, uh, because it's, it's, uh, the downtrodden religions and then it just, everything they do is in, it's a constant shell game. They're just moving the goal posts all the time and how intellectually exhausting must that be for them.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       And I don't think it's that tiring for them because they're just so ingenuine and since that's what I've come to believe because many people every day I get email people saying, why don't you sit down with one of these guys and there's, you know, there's a list of the public ones that I could sit down with, right? And I know some of them personally and it's like, what, what could we do if I had been exposed repeatedly as liars as they have and as repeatedly with bad intention. So then for you, for you someone that deals in the moral landscape Without religion, right? And deals and critical thinking, what, what should the decision process be? For me? You know, because I think about all the times. Yeah, I guess I could do it. I. Okay, so

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       here, here's a piece of mine. My friend jerry coyne said this to me, very evolutionary biologist, very useful piece of information when somebody's trying to say this without pumping this, giving this person in the identity. But here's what I think you should do it give you the piece of advice he gave me. Yeah, people are going to criticize you no matter what. So if someone says to you, hey, you know I'm going to donate to charity, I'm going to do this. The question I think is, do you think that this person is sincere and honest in their engagement with you? Not what would I get out of it? Not what would they get out of it, not even what would it do to further the discourse, but is this a sincere person who, who's willing to sit down and talk with me and look at the evidence and are their beliefs to feasible?

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       Are they willing to, you know, hey, look, dave, I came in here. I thought this had a conversation with you, but equally important, you have to ask that of yourself. Right, and if, if that is absent from that discourse, it's just a farce. So why would you, you should. That should never listen to someone on twitter. You going to have this global fuck you like have your own show. You know, you should never listen to you. You're not held hostage to the irrationality of others. Yeah, I like that. That's a good ending. That sounds like a good ending. We could have done so much more here and I pretty much, I could have just mixed these up. I don't even know that I really looked at them, but I could have just thrown them all over. I'm dying to know it's on there. You can have those.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       we will absolutely do this again and then we'll. And I won't bring any of those cards and we'll just see, see what happens. But the beauty of this is that this, this is big and this is what a lot of people have wanted to talk about and I liked the fact that I'm able to talk about it with people that are dealing with it in different ways. So at the academic level and the and the religious level or belief level and then people are dealing at the political level and all that. And you've been a catalyst. I mean you've brought people together, you've talked about an issue that's important. More and more people are becoming aware of that and you've kind of, you've, you've become a figure in which people go to and they look to and they respect for these sorts of conversations to help them navigate these difficult terrain because these are not easy issues.

Speaker 3:          01:16:17       Particularly not easy. When again, a lot of the arguments that people on the progressive regressive have, they really should be taken earnestly. You know, treating people, not treating people differently in the basis of skin color. I mean these are really important things and we need to be sensitive to how we behave. We need to be more kind and more just and more compassionate. The way to do that is not through the regressives. the way to do that is by being honest and sincere with ourselves and having these sorts of discourses, having these kinds of dialogues. I want to thank peter because he in for joining me. You can check out his work at peter boghossian dotcom and buy a manual for creating atheists wherever books are sold. Thanks for watching and we will do it again next week.
