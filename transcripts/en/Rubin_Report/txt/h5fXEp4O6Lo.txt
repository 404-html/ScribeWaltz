Speaker 1:          00:01          Right. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:02          There is a ton. I have to talk to you guys about this week. As you probably know, I was in Israel last week where I was invited to speak at a video conference. The remainder of the week was spent wandering the streets talking to people about peace and eating ridiculous amounts of Hummus. Spending most of my time in Tel Aviv, I saw people have pretty much every race, color, religion, ethnicity and nationality, living side by side. I heard Hebrew, Arabic, English, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, and several other languages being spoken simultaneously in restaurants in cafes. I saw a coexistence in a part of the world that has very little of it. I also spent a day in Jerusalem. If you saw the video that we posted a couple of days ago. I tried to show how close these religious sites are and give a little context to an extremely small yet complex city walking through the old city of Jerusalem.

Speaker 2:          00:51          I explored the Jewish and Christian quarters and stop for falafel and the Arab quarter. I felt it was important not just to talk about these places as we do, but actually to live them as well. I exited the Old City at the Damascus Gate where literally a day before a Jew had been stabbed. While there was no doubt the neighborhood was tense, there was also a feeling that this was life. Life goes on. Unfortunately. I heard about the San Bernardino terrorist attacks while on the beach in Israel. I can't really explain to you guys how incredibly surreal it was to be so far away from something so horrific happening 60 miles away from where I live while I was 7,600 miles away from home. Adding to the surreal feeling was that I was in the Epi center of a country that deals with terrorism in some form or another pretty much every day.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Suddenly I had people asking me what it was like to be in America with all our mass shootings. The world felt completely flipped on its head. On the 14 hour plane ride back to Los Angeles, I read what's left by my guest this week. Nicole and nick is a writer for time. Spectator, the observer and standpoint, his first book, what's left is an absolute must read if you dig what we do here though, what's left was written in 2017. Nick absolutely nails so much of the lunacy we've been talking about on the left these days from their dishonest tactics of lying about opponents' views to aligning themselves with people who are just as easily have them killed. He goes on a journey through history to show how the far left has so often strengthened the very ideas that they purport to be against. There were so many passages of the book that I felt like could have been written today, that it was almost like reading something from the future.

Speaker 2:          02:29          He nailed the regressive left before the term was even out there. Speaking of the regressives, you didn't think I was going to get through a show without mentioning them data? Yeah. Not gonna happen. Uh, one of the issues I've called them out on consistently is that if they don't stop smearing, the liberals willing to talk about Islamic extremism, that they're going to hand our future to the far right. We're seeing this right this very second across Europe as far right parties are winning elections and gaining in the polls from France to Belgium to Sweden and more. This is clearly coming to the American shores, right, too. As Donald trump just this week called for denying Muslims entry into the United States. Obviously this is idiotic over the top and ridiculous, but it can only exist in a climate where fear of real discussion has been stifled. If we aren't afraid of talking about Islamism, especially the difference between people and doctrine, then we can finally have an honest conversation about refugees, immigration and everything else, but if we do, as the regressives are doing this very second by making no distinction between people who are trying to talk about serious issues versus people who trade on fear, then we help the real xenophobes and silence the reformers.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Even as a kid, I always loved John f Kennedy's famous quote. We have nothing to fear but fear itself. It's lofty and big, but it hits something that is extremely human. Sometimes fear and things is scarier than the actual thing itself. That's not to say that radical Islam is scary, but we also feed that fear if we don't deal with it honestly, now that we live in a time when people are incredibly fearful and much of it is with good reason, as we've seen the spread of an evil ideology with no signs of letting up, that doesn't mean we have to be afraid to speak out against it or silence those who dare to do so. Actually, of course it means the exact opposite. Fear is what the regressives and the far right are both going to use to splinter us against each other so they can gain power.

Speaker 2:          04:26          The world is in a strange, fearful moment, right? This very second, we can either give into our worst impulses or try to be better. I'm pretty sure you guys know which side I'm going to choose. As we sat in a packed restaurant in Tel Aviv, I asked a friend how he feels about all the stabbings without missing a beat. He said, we have to keep living. We have no choice. I think we could all use a little of that spirit right now. Let's not give into fear fed to us by terrorists or fear fed to us by politicians. Let's keep fighting because if we don't choice is exactly what we're going to give up.

Speaker 2:          05:02          I guess this week is a writer for the Observer, the spectator time and standpoint. He's authored two books. You can't read this book and what's left. I just read what's left and I'm thrilled to have him here. Nicole, and welcome to the show mark. So Nick, I was telling you right before we started, I just read the book, so all of your thoughts in what's left are there right at the tip of my brain right now, and I loved it. I have been so in this regressive left thing this far left that your whole, your whole book is about and you saw it. You saw it early. So I want to get to that, but before we start, give me some of your liberal credentials because I want people to know that you're a lefty, but because we're going to talk shit about the left. So I want people to know you're an actual lefty,

Speaker 3:          05:52          Britain and Europe. You wouldn't call me a liberal socialist, left

Speaker 2:          05:58          a way for whatever his problems and they are manifest and man, if bold, because you didn't really cover it at great length in America, used to believe in things like tourism and antique fascism in feminism to an extent in being a part of the party of progress. And it used to have some idea of what to do with the world. And I gradually realized looking around me, but this was no longer the case that as you like, if you want to post it in sort of really, um, a road rubbish terms really, this know I didn't leave less, less, less meat, less somebody's true, but the, the, there was no longer a universal leftwing mess with which meant that people around the world could say, look, we're oppressed and we're oppressed by heaviest reactionary forces. The less wind resources. So being in the UK, I've had a bunch of my guests have been lefties in the UK that are, that are talking about the same issues that you're talking about. What is going on in the UK that I think woke you guys up to this before it was awoken in America? Because really here, it's only in the last year. I think that that liberals are waking up to what's going on on our side.

Speaker 3:          07:15          Yeah. Whatever happens in America happens in Brooklyn and your five years later for one since the other way round, I think that really big arguments and big battles we've had in Brisbane in particular all now coming to America, you know, the, the, the Alice has been reversed the bit. Um, there has been the most, uh, for Roche rouse head, which I'm pleased about because, you know, I'm a on polemicists system that Swiss blendable I don't believe that the being pc and nice and kind and gentle is a way of sorting out problems is often a way of covering them up. But there have been huge rounds in Britain, uh, really since nine slash 11 in my case, since the Iraq war, which mouse might seem rather wrong, but, uh, your older may remember your faculty to credit viewers may remember the won't set on the saying was the enemy if left, left wing is used to campaign in favor of rights for the Kurds and pools have damaged Sadam Hussein and fashion is.

Speaker 3:          08:21          So in my case, it wasn't nine slash 11, it was 2003 with the Iraq war. And I says, well, thinking, well, you know, what happened to all my youth? Why are, why are you European? Lester's food reason to, you know, help. You never need a good reason to. There are plenty of good reasons for post George W Bush. Um, but, um, why, why, why was it, there was simply no concern for courage in the Ra for socialist in the wrongful trade unions from the rock who had been until the late eighties. Uh, yeah, that'd be demos to bound them. That'd be petitioning to that support. They've kind of at my parents home or that kind of thing. And you want to go, well, what happened there? And once you start asking that question, very simple question, who are your friends who to use old left wing Lang Lang, joy, your comrades, uh, who you sticking up for whatever kind of Chris would you want to be of American policy or public policy? And our piece again, opt for an interview. There are always good grounds because of American British policy who you actually supporting. And then you get some rather ugly answers and you, you find a source of great vacuum on or most of the left and many good left wing is on most of the left were a principal ideology or to be.

Speaker 2:          09:42          Yeah. So right there. I mean you hit a lot of the books. So a lot of the book deals directly with Iraq and how it woke you up as you just sat in the horrible things that Saddam was doing and the horrible things that the bath party was up to. Um, so before we get into that, because I was actually surprised how much of your journey was through Iraq. But before we get into that, specifically, the phrase regressive left, so it was coined by marginalized and it's really, it's really taken off here and end at the beginning. At the beginning of the book, you mentioned that you didn't necessarily have a word for this and you said you didn't want to get too hung up sort of onwards. Do you like the phrase regressive left?

Speaker 3:          10:19          I'm sure there's something else. Here's the thing, a waltz graph came out in 2007. I'm might go, I'm, I'm old. I'm old. No revolution like Kaboosh kids. The reason I didn't, I love the French progressive lesson is absolutely right. The reason why I didn't put a name to it, this, you can say a very easy, obviously it's just a fall next, uh, people who used to be Marxist, Leninist, trotskyists, starbucks, what have you. But here's the problem. When you interrogate these attitudes, they go way, way, way into the mainstream. It's people who don't consider themselves less than at all. I mean, typically in Britain, I'm sure this is true in America as well, from what I've seen, it's people in broadcasting. It's people in universities, people in schools, it's people in publishing. It's people who are, you know, you had to define themselves and quite favorable, but then have a load of ideas, a lot of baggage on them, the terrible ideas we've started on the far left and, and this, this is what grows people wilds in Britain.

Speaker 3:          11:36          But this book was because I wasn't just talking about how some people on the friends and all sorts of talking about people here in Britain will say, BBC site people who never considered himself extreme all with themselves, models and new. I'm not going to say, well look, these are ideas that began on the phone and that it's okay to go along with great dreams and movements that want to subsidize the women kill. Hadn't sexuals kill Jews, kill any Muslim who have his or her own free will decides to change their religion. There is no god, there is no our tool. You're getting along with all of this. It wouldn't matter if it was gas six grade, what masters is permeating the whole liberal, um, uh, uh, uh, a spectrum. And that's what growth people wild available. So to me that was so obviously true and it seems to be true of as American as well,

Speaker 2:          12:36          so you hit on a lot there. So partly it seems to me that it's a little bit like the phrase, you know, the road, uh, the road to hell is paved with good intentions that these people, and I think you hit on this advantage that these people, they have good intentions in that they don't want extra war and we have had a ridiculous, both of our countries, right? You in the UK and in America we've had, we have had plenty of ridiculous unnecessary wars. We've done all kinds of things, drone strikes, all of these things that we on the left are not thrilled with, but you make a really good argument for what is the alternative that we basically just give up on all of these people that live under these horrible theocracies. And that's what put these people in the far left in bed with some really terrible people.

Speaker 3:          13:23          Yeah. It's also a, if you could get a time machine and go into the future, say 50 years into the future, there are bound to be all kinds of ideas are accepted. The objects on the fringes of American society at the moment. Uh, all your great panggang drums in the media, Time magazine, New York Times barely even think about will be the common sense. Whatever age that applies to paddle ideas as well as good ideas. A really bad idea started on the far left. I would even say it wasn't even less wind at all after the collapse of communism, after the end of socialist and members, socialism defines what it means to be a left winger for a hundred years. You know, some fruits are not, they're not all girls. Then somebody there, all these people. I mean, noam is a classic example to me who have that same spirit but no longer have an ideology they can believe in.

Speaker 3:          14:25          And so what did they do? They still just send anyone who is against the West can't be all bad. Anyone who is against the west, it has to be the West fault. We all the root cause to use a phrase that's been repeated to and then you suddenly find people who call themselves radicals or progressive socialist feminists going along with movements. We anti progressive and she says, Auntie radical anti women, anti gay, anti Semitic, and she everything, Auntie liberal in the classic sense actually movements that have stepped out for a liberal nightmare if you look at their effects, but because they're anti west, that's all that matters is because there's no longer a positive program would be laughing. They just seize on any body who is against America, again, against to you Sarah rather contentious. Then you can have an organist bath we want later against imperialism, and that that just stops on the extremes.

Speaker 3:          15:24          Like good ideas start off on the fringes and it comes into the main screen. Now that's not wholly the faults. Mainstream liberals, senior, never let drop your books off the whole. Nevertheless, Oralis is off the hook. Yeah, password is perfectly possible. Action results. So terrible and not just in, you know, poor countries. Uh, what about people in America? What about, um, people in Britain? What about people in my country, Muslim women are now being told, what are you going to go through a course? What is a free women in a free country, not second class citizens, so you don't have to have, uh, some, some, uh, fear classic legal system saying evidence worth half that,

Speaker 2:          16:08          right? But you as a white guy say that, then people go bananas and you're pushing your views on that even though if you're the one that's abiding the laws of your country, which is what they are governed by.

Speaker 3:          16:21          Well now I'm afraid to lose my country is slightly worse than that. You know, there's a danger. We're not quite there yet. We'll have parallel legal system will have a say up in civil case, divorce cases, big deals. Uh, I'm a Muslim woman will, uh, seems quite content. Say we can settle this to Shariyah cool, but this is, this is kind of racist. Is it not? If you say to a woman, you have to go through a. you're right. All liberal opinion across Breslin, across America, across the world who go wild sexism. New social needs is patreo police. Okay. When that happens to a brown skinned woman, yeah. Were you in the name of liberalism? We all, we all create shaking the uh, the classic double standards of, of predictable days. You know, a white people have more rights and white. Certain people are more honest and brown skinned people. Kristen issue for how people are treated in Saudi Arabia or Iran or, or, or, uh, any other country with a uh, um, an for me, I would say a unfair, classic legal system. It's here now. I'm already societies. It does seem to be the liberal soul to decide what type of liberalism they believe in July, I believe in liberalism means we've got equal rights and universal values or does liberalism main. There's one law for one group and one law for another group depending on their couch.

Speaker 2:          17:53          Does this part of this seem to you that it's just the end game? This is the end result of identity politics. We're, we're going through right now in America, this really strong phase with identity politics. What? Right. So we're all divided on sexuality and race and just every, anything that you can divide people on were divided on it right now and is part of this just that you saw the end game of all of this sorta before we did

Speaker 3:          18:23          your profit, profit bibles or any of that. To me, there is a big, big vacuum. Opens up at the end of the 20th century were first of all, as I said before, it may not be so much in America, in Europe and the love of the world, the collapse of socialism, the collapse in the belief of off the plan to call me of national society, but all the sudden the clap, so it kind of lung collapse, but a marginalizing and flip real optimism, liberal locksmiths and just says, look, there were universal human rights. It doesn't matter what your skin color is, you know, it doesn't matter what your religion is. You can't say, oh, it's my culture to oppress women. You can't say that I was laughing. You actually now like they laugh with you and that's allowed. It's identity politics, which sounds fun. Sounds Fun.

Speaker 3:          19:19          You know, I ain't going to last, you know, I read these reports of black students. So again, when you think about history of a black oppression in America and you can understand them, nesting is kid's sake a bit nuts by identity politics has and you think, well, you know, let them have their, uh, that fuss by identity. Politics has a hugely dog. So [inaudible] you have no onset. We're in the people who say we're the masters, we are against identity. We all the community leaders, we all the mothers will a rabbi's priests. We control this group, this block and we say you were a part of our group or block or community and uh, we, we say that you didn't have the same bright. So it's a, you know, a white Anglo Saxon woman at Yale. We say the constitution, the bill of rights doesn't apply to you. It's against your culture. And that hasn't been thought through at all.

Speaker 2:          20:13          Right? So we split people into, into these little boxes. But then what we ended up carrying the least about is the people that are in the smaller boxes within those boxes.

Speaker 3:          20:22          Well, as monitoring the wall set, so you mentioned doing it view has this little phrase, what about minorities? We remind ourselves, you know, what about what about liberals and this is thinkers, the blast females, the women, the gay. So people who say, what the hell, what the hell? I am not this group. I'm not a Muslim or a Jew or whatever. I'm American.

Speaker 2:          20:46          Right? That to me is the

Speaker 3:          20:48          ultimate irony here is that the spectrum of people that I've brought on the show in that now I've connected with on twitter or wherever it is, is I'm not judging any of these people based on their color or their religion or their ethnicity. I'm basing it on their ideas, which is, which is the most liberal idea. Yeah. Well, you're actually treating them as individuals because they're very, very different. Uh, a golf help you. The only problem of identity politics is when you stop preaching to people as individuals. You kind of identity politics is, is, is, is, uh, is a, is a slippery, treacherous conjunction is you can only have like, or you can have politics. Politics means you don't just look at people and say, there's a block in this instance, what we're talking about, the Muslims, what do you mean there's a group called the Muslims because when do you say that you normally end up handing over the right to speak to these Muslims who have asked your permission to the most reactionary people in it.

Speaker 3:          21:54          The people who who, who wants to enforce a communal identity and want to enforce it. First of all, you know, I know there's all this paranoia going round after the Paris attacks and those awful events in California, but yeah, first and foremost want to enforce on Barrow, unkind on their tribe in fourth or fifth of booze on them to keep them down. And the worst part of it is, I think we've been particularly bad in Britain and America because we have this identity politics. Multicultural problem you've had is, well, you know what? I'm about the men and the women who say, I'm the second. This guy said, the community leader doesn't represent me. I've never voted for him and agree with him. What about this man who says he's a priest? The rabbi and Lula, I can't believe in all this crap or I'd be partially believe in it or I believe in bits to this, but you, you then stopped treating me as if this guy and this meeting is, this group owns me without my permission that that's his.

Speaker 3:          22:55          That's his huge weakness today. It's well an awful lot. Before we go onto great question, so with the sound, with your right, with Syria, you know, what are you going to do about Islamic state is where everyday cruelty happens in also song. That's it. It's where men and women who need a confident liberalism and liberalism beliefs in human rights, liberalism that says, well actually we're not going to say that. What matters first and foremost about you is your color or creed. They need them to help them and they turned around to the very people who will be able to help them and they're not there. In fact, they're on the other side.

Speaker 2:          23:34          In fact, they're on the other side. That's, that's the key piece because it's not just that it's there. They're actually working to stop the reformers and by calling everyone racist and all of this stuff, and then you know what we have going on very much so in America right now is that Donald trump just this week says, we're going to close the borders to all Muslims. Well, now he throws red meat to the right. He gets. He probably does more good work for isis recruiting that he could possibly do, but unfortunately he's been strengthened by by a week left. You talk a lot about that actually, about how they the this far left group. Now what we're calling the regressives ultimately end up strengthening a lot of ideas that they should be against.

Speaker 3:          24:14          That's what we're seeing with trump. I was amazing today in which is where I work and I loved the place and here's Britain's leading left, the newspaper and people in your questions about Donald Trump. That first questions were know and you could see perhaps I'm reading too much into the audience members and such, but Donald Trump was stopping her. She taking on reaction. Whereas in, you know, all on years, on years besides so you, you've gone. It's very hard to, uh, to get the notion that there are two extreme rights, there is the extreme right, and I wouldn't until a few weeks ago said Donald Trump was on it. It seems to be heading that way now and there is the religious extreme, right, extreme, right, uh, and you need to find them both for the same reasons and with the same arguments. She's very different. People seem to find that very, very difficult to do. Strikes me as the only principal position, but I imagined if I walked onto any campus in America and said that there'll be no platform,

Speaker 2:          25:31          not only would there be no platform, but they'd be trigger warning. Do they go into a safe space? All the other stuff we're talking about it. And then

Speaker 3:          25:38          was so frightening.

Speaker 2:          25:40          Right? I've had several guests that I didn't think were that frightening, that for some reason have to have trigger warnings issued before they speak on campuses. So a look, a lot of this is happening in Europe first, which is another reason that I'm talking about it so much because I don't want it to take hold here the way it has taken hold in Europe. What do you make of the far right parties that are now winning across Europe? Right? Marine Le Pen. Just one in France. We're in. I now see that in Denmark and in Sweden far right. Parties are leading in polls for the first time ever. Belgium. Uh, so this thing seems to be miss metastasizing, uh, right in front of our eyes.

Speaker 3:          26:18          Yeah, there are reasons for that day. I mean the European Union. It's not like USA. You're trying to beeline the USA without the common culture, common institutions. And as I'm fond of pointing out to a, uh, a in new world to be like the US. So I said, well, USA had one hell of a civil war before it became the USA Today. I mean, do you want, do you want that? There are other reasons. A, there's two things I want to say. One you might quite like the other than think you might quite like is, is we seem to agree on this. It says you can't run around the streets in your head off A. Yeah. Having trigger warnings and safe spaces where I'd know a celebrity or a politician makes a slightly off color remark about homosexuals or women who's like sexist remark about women and having reading the news and a couple of times, um, uh, needing, needing a culture to calm themselves down afterwards and then, and then ignore religious homophobia, including beverly religious, Saturday, February among ethnic minorities.

Speaker 3:          27:31          You can't do that without paying a price because I think people aren't watching you, you know, don't think the rest of society had lots of political writing on the left as well as the right. It's like it's a private club, you know, it's talk to themselves, but yeah, the right watches, Fox News, sort of less walk. She's Gong Stewart, you know, they just talk themselves. So it's like a private club and everyone understands the rules and they forget the sound side. It's a watchman and get outside and are say, you bloody hypocrites. You, you, you will, you will have one rule for white people and another rule for the rest and you will not stand up to get back. And as principal, so there is that, that does matter. A political correctness in Britain has become, has become this kind of swear words and it doesn't mean stuff that you would understand.

Speaker 3:          28:21          My political rights means deep, deep, deep hypocrisy. Ms Dot government too. Government. So that's all true. You can blame the left only on hands. You know people about how bad am I allowed to swear on your progress? Where away bring it people who voted for Donald Trump. There has to come a point where you just say, well, fuck off. If you're voting for Donald Trump, you have a greater pet. We moved Sean. We will not, we will not give up on you with your fellow citizens. But there comes a point where you said, well, to hell with you, you know, you are peddling. The difficulty is, and is. It does come. I can't. If you're very confused about this, we've now go the worst type of, uh, of leftist leading or opposition parties later who's like a caricature. If I had to write an example of, of the worst of the leftists and Britain, Jeremy Corbyn, Jeremy, Jeremy, yeah.

Speaker 3:          29:19          The only good thing about them becoming a believer, his books I wrote are now selling like hotcakes, but I mean by selfish point of view of science is, is you've got a terrible rights in America with trump in France who's national front in Sweden and Denmark and all these places a pendulum and, and he's popping all over your, no interest because immigration integration, Paul, because the European, a single currency as being one of the greatest economic mistakes. Um, and then you go left in a space where a principal should be certainly embracing. You've got this kind of geographical, a good girl. I'm with, um, uh, any organization, how as a fascistic uh, as long as it sound. So you didn't who? Lots of people who are feeling a bit political politically homeless over here.

Speaker 2:          30:10          Yeah. Does it all feel like a perfect storm to you? What's going on right now, and again this, this is the stuff that's after your book when we talk about the refugees and some of the economic problems in Europe and this, you know, dealing with radical Islam. It was going on while you were writing the book obviously, but it seems, it seems to me we have like five things right now that are all working at the same time. Then you toss in social media, you toss in that. We see videos from everywhere now we see, we can see beheadings, we can see bombing, you know, so you can see, you can see religious violence and you can see state violence all the time that we really have all of this happening at once and it's leading to a, to a very strange place.

Speaker 3:          30:50          I think one thing Dave, we can say with certainty that whoever it was a full of Berlin Wall was the end of history history. If over boy was that a stupid thing to say and you can't, you can't. Let me get back to the point I made. She was stopped at the weirdness and hypocrisy and the awful betrayal of people you get on. People who call themselves the left comes, were like, don't have a socialist alternative you like to have in the Soviet Union falls. Socialism collapses across the world. No one believes that anymore. And that, that was fine for awhile. If I may generalize it a very Glib way, uh, that was fine for awhile because capitalist, and we'll call it what you will, seems to be a great success story, seemed to work. That's why I it for Carolina was not an idiot when he said, well, ever since the crash of 2008, that system of liberal capitalism has failed.

Speaker 3:          31:54          And that's why you've got this feeling of perfect storm. Too many things coming, as I said, what is it is not entirely. There's a wonderful phrase by the Italian socialists, Antonio Gramsci, you own despair. The new cannot be born in that interregnum. Many strange, strange forms will appear. It seems like that we don't know what comes next. We're not sure of what we've got. We're not sure it works anymore. I'm not sure it works, so yeah, or Ms Dot middle class America. Americans watching your program have their payers and going after the super rich are getting richer. The American dream doesn't seem to quite work anymore. Even with it with a bomber. Listen, not quite clear where. Where are the old challenges for that? Aren't you get these strange boredom's a free case forms, which is when I wrote about cork. Yeah. As I said, people just kept saying for your neck, neck, neck that suggest they suggest on the friendlies. Well now it's on the main screen.

Speaker 2:          32:50          Going to that point. What about some of the tactics these guys use and I want to talk a little bit about Chomsky, but first we can talk just sort of in the more broader sense. When I've seen the way these guys debate or the way they treat topics and you know, again, everyone is racist and all that. They don't seem to mind if they get caught in lies. They don't. They love just throwing out the bomb and then we let it spreads like wildfire on social media and you know, there's that famous saying, you know, it takes one second to lie, but it takes a lifetime to get it back or whatever. And it seems that a series of these guys, they love this and I don't know, look again, I'm not on the right so I can't really. I don't like the right. I've never been part of the right. So I police them differently, but I don't want to see this from my guys. So what do you think about just the tactics that they're using?

Speaker 3:          33:37          One question to you, a plain speaking, open heart. It doesn't behave. Any bathroom that people

Speaker 2:          33:45          look, they don't look, I'm, look, I'm dealing in America with trump right this second with over the top bombast city. So, and again this is why. Look I'm a guilty liberal in that sense that sometimes I feel bad. I spent so much time on the guys on my side and then I'm afraid, you know, people ask me all the time, am I afraid that ultimately this will strengthen the right? But I, but to me it's like, if we don't stand up now, well then the game is over. We just hand it to the right, which is what's happening. I think with trump.

Speaker 3:          34:14          Uh, well, um, there is a long tradition of, of, of lying on the left, you know, if you go back to, to Stalin, he, he golfs gullible people to believe in show trials where people confess the croc impossible crimes that were committed. So there is bad. I'm less, I'm less interested unless concerned about left and right. Then this, here is something that happens when with new media, you know, have stapes, uh, here for two years, I think is a pretty bad thing. Uh, I think his main audience seems to be little girl, and this could be reusing material to write, but you know, uh, it's, you know, it's a bad day. You've got nothing to do. You got no ideas. I know I'll turn on Fox News is, is we're pretty lucky. You've now got states, Russia and Iran most notionally producing propagate the gamble. So beggar cater to pushing whole truth, conspiracy theories, lies, you know, gets shot down over Ukraine.

Speaker 3:          35:24          There's television channels in English who are pumping stuff out. So you were around as wants, if you're on the left in America, you just have to go on and on about something. Nixon was posting downs or something in the Wall Street Journal reading something on Fox News. And if you're only in America, you were complaining about New York Times, you know, deliberately covering something up. Now you suddenly go whole states, uh, with their secret services at foreign offices that propaganda arms behind him pumping material include west, which is instantly taken up by both the far left on the roads case. It's very difficult certainly in Britain. So as I say, things have gotten much much earlier than they have in America is very, very difficult to tell her. Um, uh, uh, the people who support boosting, for instance, in Russia today, you've got marine Le Pen doing it. Who is the lead for French far right party. You Got Galloway gallaway who's just screening as combination of left business. And Mr Griffin, I mean, and so you've got a kind of merger of the extremes against liberal democracy and they're both equally Kim Kardashian that both equally sinful nature raw. What matters to the most is, is building conspiratorial narrative.

Speaker 2:          36:49          So in a lot of ways we really could blame sort of mainstream media for this craziness, right? Because it seems to me that for a long time, mainstream media, which had no competition before the digital age, they did such a poor job that then they handed everything over to the digital side and I think for awhile the online media for the first few years of it, I think they did do a really nice job in breaking stories and getting out information that you wouldn't, that you wouldn't get otherwise. And now it seems like the gloves are off and now it's, anything's true. Nobody knows who to trust.

Speaker 3:          37:20          Yeah. Um, yeah. But there's a lot of truth now except some kind of binary division between new major in Obj. It's good journalists and it's a problem. Dave, if you are me to go and observe a or a on the time, do you, you're talking reports on the La Times a and something that you've done a terrible job of. You're allowing all these, a crank. These fruitcakes sees a Flim, flam merchants from all over the world or to walk all over you. The man or woman the La Times was, it looked like, oh, business models collapsed. You know, we're trying to staff your rows and in Peking and Beijing and you know, give me a break. Yeah, we can. We can. We can barely get a report or you know, up the road, San Francisco, the business model for if you like serious, a serious farmer, as good as it is, getting harder and harder, sustainable.

Speaker 3:          38:23          Surely La Times and newspapers and across America are to my knowledge from having met him and we work on them. I'll to try and keep it going. But Indian, the lack of money talks, money talks. That's the silence that comes from the lack of money is a silence between. Yes, yes. This debate, so the gap is being filled and what worries me is it's not people talking rubbish or people talking drivel is they always have is where are you going to get the reliable report? So what is happening in Peking, Beijing? Where are you going to get the reliable pull reports on how coaching is manipulating a European opinion that's getting harder and harder to.

Speaker 2:          39:09          Okay. Well, as it, as someone that I consider an expert in this space, how do you decide who to trust? I, I really don't know anymore. I, you know, I follow a lot of different organizations, right? Left middle, know as reputable and some off the deep end and I try to pilfer out some knowledge and some truth and I try not to only follow things that reinforce my beliefs, which is another huge problem with social media has given us. But how do you decide who to trust?

Speaker 3:          39:34          Well, you probably got accused me of being horribly old fashioned stuff, but I mean there are student organizations I trust, you know, um, I still trusted off trying to newspapers and Alexis because I know there's a very, very strong editing process there and it's opinion pages are sap for us and what have you. Now that may changes as the business model for journalism goes down, but I still don't.

Speaker 2:          39:57          Well, look, they had an op Ed on the front page for the first time in [inaudible] 95 years.

Speaker 3:          40:00          Just disgraceful. Disgraceful. Yeah. Let's go around the wheels, go round and have a dinner. So we don't want your bloody opinions. We also say, give us some news.

Speaker 2:          40:10          I've read a paper that had that on the, on the front of. All right, so let, let's back up for a second. Let's talk for a few minutes about Noam Chomsky because you talk about him a bit in the book. It's not a tremendous amount but you. But I have a friend, uh, who is on what I consider it in this regressive group. And a lot of times we'll be debating back and forth about this stuff and I'll, I'll be giving him as much historical knowledge as I have and as much factual knowledge as I have. And then he'll sort of always end everything by saying, well, I don't really know about that, but I read some Chomsky and I'm just kind of giving back to you. And I think you sort of hit on that also in the book that there's just this belief in this guy that maybe isn't fully warranted or he's been. He's been very good at waving off the things that don't quite agree with his worldview.

Speaker 3:          40:56          It's interesting for two reasons. I mean, he was an old guy. Come on, shout them down. But I mean he's adopted some pretty disgraceful positions, a massive Bosnian Muslims. And so going along with people who are 1990 and going along and never missing is wrong. And building this very. Trump's, his writing is very poor writing, so stands for English, but it builds is very dense web of light. Your friend wants your in your like, uh, a fly in the. Whether it's very to go out, so that's. That's kind of a a fishing. You say in America, you finished this man. This is. This is all from a point of view. It sort of made up and actually when you figured out what he's doing is quite disgraceful, but here's why Chomsky was worth diversion. Chapter two is it is what kinds of. You are young on an American campus and you get your.

Speaker 3:          42:03          Can you read all his books and you think, well, what kind of society are you aiming for? There is no social vision. There's nothing that the grasses and socialists to run through American history from the 18 eighties were recognized. So just say, this is all just saying Americans, shit me, me, shit, America. We probably would never have happened. The pilgrim files, we probably have churned down at Plymouth Rock and gone back to England. The whole thing is a disaster. Everything it does is wrong. The thing is alive and you think, well actually ridiculous World Vision, funnily enough. Here's the thing. It's really easy to buy into because you didn't have to commit to anything if the regressive left. And so I really liked that phrase, well, let's take the regressive left. Skin left the post socialist left. On the one hand it has very little to say positive and that's, that's kind of easy for everyone to sign up to.

Speaker 3:          42:59          You just have to think that Washington is a pile of shit. But I mean Washington DC is a pile of shit. Well that's sure as you know, the State Department doesn't have, is doing fine. The CIO is wicked. And so instead of having a left wing, you had to make really positive commitments for, you know, 40 years ago I couldn't have come on your program and said, I'm a socialist, right? I'm a socialist. I. And you're already said, oh nick, he's associate if that sounds good, we'll go along and I say I wasn't massively high taxes or I want to nationalize this and that. And people who would it be an agreement? We said we'll back off and say, hell, I don't want anything to do with this. You know, this guy is threatening my Livingston. Now you just have to say that, uh, everything you read is ally, uh, your government's evil unless been, unfortunately, that's actually because the flaking, so few positive policy commitments as Chomsky does.

Speaker 3:          43:57          It's certainly very easy to go along with him. You know, I get into the hands of people here in London, which is a very expensive city for the rich people I know. And that books find them Chomsky on the, on the, on the, uh, on their shelves. And that's big because funnily enough rules, suppose radicalism that kind of left without a positive program with just the critique is no threat to them. It's no fretful wealthy. He's known knowing fractally pamphlets. They were friendly bankers on Wall Street. You know, it's something. Lots of people when they quite justifiably often pissed off at government or because you know, they, they, they've got a conspiracy theory mind though because they will look friendly. Everyone can sign up to that January left wing program is hard. The genuine left wing program make friends and enemies, but this kind of pseudo life, this regressive left. It's terribly easy, easily even too easy I think for any successful political movement.

Speaker 2:          44:56          You know, it's interesting because I was really embedded in it for a couple of years and I guess I hadn't pieced this all together what you're talking about, but right now, but part of my frustration was that we never talked about solutions. We always could talk about problems, right? It was always, you know, the American industrial complex and and bombing and race and whatever, but there were never solution so that, that does get to what you're saying that it's

Speaker 3:          45:19          could as soon as you offer solution, you're going to piss some people off because it's an illusion meat and you're not making a commitment. And as soon as you make a commitment, a little Dave Rubin believed this, well, it's just wrong. It's very easy to just say it's all a conspiracy it so that way you don't expose yourself. You're not making. You're not making a poster program and sticking your neck out there where you sit down.

Speaker 2:          45:47          So speaking of conspiracy theories, one of the through lines throughout the book, and then you do devote a chapter to it in completion, is that in all of these movements, somehow blaming the Jews are always. It always comes around to blaming the Jews. Now the language has changed. Now it's blaming. Zionists

Speaker 3:          46:05          blamed. No one says to us anymore

Speaker 2:          46:08          right now, right? It's not, it's not politically correct to say Jews. So you just say Zionists are you say Israel or whatever it is, but you really did lay out an interesting piece in almost every example throughout time that they were always blame on both sides. They, the capitalists would say the Jews are socialists. Socialists would say Jews are capitalists and every other which way. What do you think that is about? I think you probably just explained it with this conspiratorial thing and the other.

Speaker 3:          46:31          Yeah. Well, look, here's the problem. If you genuinely, you will see I have a person for many, many folks and I'm sure they'll lesion, but if you genuinely think that they, for instance, secretly blew up the twin towers, uh, and then, uh, then all kinds of types of play the adventures away if you go into a or a bomber is replies to the, as much less. A borrower isn't to real American. He's a secret Muslim from Kenya. You know, if you can even believe that you have to believe in extraordinary view of the world where a handful of people can fool the entire population. The sheep poop. Well, while she's thinking about who are those handful of people historically, you know, you started down that road, you ended up the grades. Well, how have you found shocking being called caring? Yeah. And I think some of a liberal American Jews will find it shocking because I say we're five years ahead of you. Uh, when it comes and hits her, is this I how I never expected to find out a few sentences perhaps I was being like and um, but it is quite extraordinary, uh, the extent of it. And it's quite extraordinary how it's tolerated now, isn't cooldowns now?

Speaker 2:          48:07          So do you think some of that when, when I hear people say that the first real quick we should mention. So you just mentioned your last name calling. You're actually not Jewish. So,

Speaker 3:          48:16          uh, no. My, my, my, my family abandoned her religion for Regina was system. So, you know, I'm, I'm going to ask Tommy and his family have about 1900 views. Wouldn't have to pay strict. And Dave, it's not. Yeah, we'll be able to finger cute little said you were curious. But here's the problem. If you look at Anti Semitism, antisemitism has virtually nothing to do with you. Antisemitism became in the late 19th century, early 20th century. And the Nazis, it was some way of fighting progress. It was a way of saying, look, you democracy, human rights, women's rights, all these, you shouldn't believe in them. They were all praying. So fraud, say as a, uh, they will, uh, behind them is a pipe master, pulling the strings in that public mass with acute. Um, so you, you would afford, there's a left, but believes in democracy and human rights will be for its own sake because maps, anything else only alert the whole time for the dangers of.

Speaker 3:          49:23          But actually, you know, going back to trump's aid believes the box. They believe human rights is all full. They believe it's all live. So that's one reason why they ended up doing or not Chomsky himself, but that's why people end up there and they don't understand what goes with it. They didn't look at organizations like Hezbollah or Iran or and say, hold on a second, okay, they're antisemitic, but that's just because of Israel. And then they say, well, homesick, but look, the way they women look at where they treat rules, look at the way that they just miss human rights were dismissed. Democracy in antisemitism absolutely goes along with that. And once you accept antisemitism, you have to not just anti racist, but you have all your progressive principles because historically, antisemitism has always been used by Oprah reactory movement who again left should be against.

Speaker 2:          50:14          Right? So this, I always say when it comes to this, and I was just in Israel last week and at the top of the show when I, when I did my, my piece, I was saying how I saw coexistence there. I was in Jerusalem, you know, I ate falafel in the Arab quarter, saw Israeli policemen helping Muslim women move a box. I saw ultra orthodox Jews. I mean, that doesn't happen anywhere in the Mideast except for Israel. And of course not to say everything's perfect there and there's all sorts of political problems, religious problems and all that, but that doesn't. But the only place that has any progressive values in the Middle East is Israel. And they,

Speaker 3:          50:51          uh, I walked about quarter the boundary on the wrong too. You know, you say someone says, well, as problems on the West Bank, there's problems in gauze. And you said what about Syria? Because actually is quite a good wall. So that the council was about, when you think about it, um, but you know, you shouldn't say that doesn't mean that students shouldn't have to run the state and doesn't mean no horrendous problems with the Israeli rocked and you shouldn't sort of romanticize Israel. I'm a asshole. Um, but, but yeah, but here's the thing is the problem. The problem is, is this is great reasons for, I would say the liberal liberal difficulty understanding radical Islam is. There's very good liberal impulse to assumes the world is rational. You know, there's the assumes that if there is, it's terrible. Terroristic movement that were blow out of the twin towers, the woods. And we knew if they had chemical weapons or nuclear weapons against feeling say words. That must be a root cause for it. You know, that must be some rational explanation that we can satisfy that we can operate these evil goals. I'm thinking they call just be that angry again and stuff is not partly our fault.

Speaker 2:          52:23          Yeah. I saw, I saw a lot of that actually right after the Paris attacks because I saw immediately my friends on the left saying American foreign policy, American foreign policy, even though two days later, you know, Boko Haram killed 140 people and obviously that has nothing to do with foreign policy, but. But there's this rationalization even though at the same time the people who did the Paris attacks were saying this is for religious purposes.

Speaker 3:          52:49          Yeah. But your friends on the left, your source gallery, the history of narcissism, of the history of communism. Yes. There are rational reasons. So you can blame, you know, you could say if, if, um, yeah, bombs go off and actually had an office in Paris, you're friends will have said, oh, it's their fault. They, the peanuts cartoon and Mohamad people slaughtered a, I think every supermarket in Paris, the hypogastric Oh, it's their fault. Uh, because of Israel, because Israel is occupying the West Bank. So okay, you killed us service. That's okay. You kill the cues that say people who are or to, if it's a football stadium started the parents, people who are slow to a rock concert, people are sources of Cambodian restaurants on the Parisians well that's coming is their fault because we're not quite sure American foreign policy be friends for on policy.

Speaker 3:          53:44          Now. These all sorts of rational explanations and there's a bit of true freedom. The problem is every step you change seems rational and liberal, but every step you take takes you away from rationality and liberalism and you ran into. They're very murderous. You're trying to explain because you accepted that whole ideology, but rather turn the standards. You don't understand it. They are not people who are sitting there saying, well, we've got a rational grievance like someone's about to file a claim to as a county. Cool. They have a youtube channel is having an ideology. You go and live freely 20 to central, a last bit of the 20th century, 20th century when you in ideologies to millions of millions of people. We still don't understand that. Someone like Islamic state says, we think we can create heaven on earth week, think we can a caliphate that will govern the holder and this will be paradox. And you do that. What's a matter of 1 million, 2 million, 10 million people are killed. They don't, you, they think they're explained. They don't understand anything.

Speaker 2:          54:50          Yeah. So that actually is the ultimate irony because on one hand you're saying, well, look, if we took everything, if we did whatever it is they want us to do, right? We took all our troops out of here, we stopped bombing here, whatever. Then suddenly they, they'd like us more, but that's not what they're saying. So it really is. It's the most ironic a piece

Speaker 3:          55:10          they want you to do, Dave, is becoming, then yes. I'm. So here you go. I mean, your friends are in California and probably, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm sure they're lovely people. So some of them, um, but, you know, I'm sure they think of themselves as down to you sexist and racist, uh, until you have a phobic. I'm sure they're fine on trans issues, you know, I bet some of them don't even get me, but they will then through thinking that being logical end up defending the most sexist, racist, homophobic in liberal movements on the and you certainly the point made by me, it was a very brilliant French philosopher. Usually they're very narcissistic way, you know, we all. Central is the world, you know, if something terrible happens, it must be down to us. Know the people in the rest of the world have their own agency, not people in the rest of the world. Cup I guess is wicked little as well. You can say our infant say are children who are goaded by us. It's all down to what we do. We are still. Yeah, the narcissist ego, the people, the people that sent for before.

Speaker 2:          56:25          Yeah. I think what I had done with and he illustrated that point, he said, look, the world could go to hell in a handbasket and it'll have nothing to do with America. You just can't. It's just child. It's childlike thinking of. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          56:36          All right, so increasing steadily treats Muslim populations as children isn't. Yeah, I mean it says, he says, look, we're adults. We're wearing these white western Europeans. Yeah, we can handle satire. We can handle all leaders and Godson, bishops, clerics. Oh my God, you can't do those Muslims like toddlers. You're like violent little delinquent children. You've shown them a cartoon and they start blowing the place up.

Speaker 2:          57:04          Yeah. Ironically, that's what George W dot Bush called the soft bigotry of low expectations, which I keep crediting Bill Maher with. But apparently it was George W Bush,

Speaker 3:          57:13          which is mind blowing. That's is a very, very good for. And it's true actually. It's worse than the soft bigotry. Uh, it does keep people down because look, most of the men and women watching your program in California doesn't really help them when they're going out looking for a job, uh, or, you know, looking to get on in life or wanting to create respect. We want to be crazy recalls if liberals all saying, oh, well, you know, that's very, very funny people, these people, you have to be very careful what you say in French car tuned up, blow the top of my head. It doesn't help them. It doesn't help them be full citizens to increase in a totally different way from everyone else.

Speaker 2:          57:53          Yeah, absolutely. All right, so I have one more for Ya. I could do this for five hours with you, so you'll have to. You'll have to come on again. I want you to have your tea and go to bed. So I'll end with this. Look, you wrote what's left in 2007. Uh, that was eight years ago. So let's fast forward eight years from now. It's 20, 23. Give me a little hope if you can find some hope, but if you can't then give me where you think we're going to be at eight years from now.

Speaker 3:          58:23          Well, that was, that was quite hopeful. I'm working on. I wrote that lesson. I hope it will run ally on a liberal intellectuals, feminists, uh, within the Muslim world. Uh, we're in Muslim communities in the west taking on various treatments. I just hope that shame, which has descended on Western liberalism, it's almost shameful periods of history that when those liberals and Democrats and those feminist take home, they're extremist fucking western liberals. They're meant to do. And support them instead of supposedly they are in the mess to make any excuses for that randomness for once lives, their principals or otherwise they'll just give up, get up, shut up.
