Speaker 1:          00:00:02       For those of you keeping score at home last week was one for the Rubin report. Record books are week. Started off by interviewing Senator John Mccain, a war hero, one of the longest serving members of Congress, and a Republican nominee for president of the United States, Senator Mccain and I had a frank discussion on this year's election, money and politics and foreign policy. What struck me more than anything while talking to the senator was whether you agree or disagree with his political opinions. It's clear that he's really trying to bridge the ideological divide and do what he feels is right for the country. The entire time I was talking to him, I kept thinking, what a better candidate, senator mccain would be, the any of the current contenders in the gop rat race. Immediately after interviewing Senator Mccain, I had the chance to interview loopnet. Loopnet is a 23 year old engineering student and an atheist fighting for secular values in her homeland of Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Simply by talking to me about secularism from the confines of her clothes society. She instantly became braver than pretty much every person that I know. I'm honored that she chose me as the first public person to talk to and I'll always be an ally for her, whether she's in Iraq or wherever. Life takes her while I was in awe of her during the interview. The most impactful part to me was when we talked about some of the people that we both admire, including Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins. This portion of our chat illuminated exactly what this show is about. Ideas the same ideas that Sam and Richard sparked in me. A 39 year old guy born in Brooklyn, living in Los Angeles, also were sparked in Louisiana. A 23 year old atheist in Iraq. This shows you the true power of ideas, good or bad. Ideas can transcend nationality, race, or religion.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       My final interview last week was with the former leader of the English defense league and now outspoken anti immigration activist, Tommy Robinson. As I mentioned at the top of the show last week, I was hesitant to even talk to Tommy because people might call me a bigot or a racist. Not only my glad that we did the interview, but I'm really proud of your reaction to it, whether on Youtube, twitter, or facebook. You guys all kept the conversation going after Tommy and I put it down. It was complete and total confirmation of last week's direct message being afraid to talk and no longer be part of the equation. I have no doubt there is a real movement happening right now. People are absolutely sick of being divided. Conversation is the key to bringing us together, and that's why in one week I talked to a man who was almost the leader of the free world, a woman who puts her life on the line to say what she believes and another man who is on a crusade of his own.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       It's totally irrelevant whether I agree with everything my guest say. The important thing is to not be afraid to hear them. As the Internet brings us all closer together, we find ourselves connected with people in a way that we could've only dreamt of a couple years ago. Despite that connection, I still get messages from you or is explaining that sometimes you guys are afraid to say certain things to your friends in real life or to post certain articles on facebook for all to see if lube a 23 year old in Iraq isn't afraid to speak up, then you guys can't be either. There is no time for silence anymore. Yeah, there are genuinely bad people in the world and sometimes talking to them won't get you the results you want. However, you have to be brave enough to have the conversation in the first place. Don't let louder. Voices with worst intentions drown you out. All right. According to Wikipedia, my guest this week is either the former king of Mesopotamia or youtube, or not afraid to speak his mind on controversial topics. That's right. I have Carl Benjamin, better known as Sargon of a cod on the show. Carl Sargon. What do I call you?

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Whichever you once. I get cold both all day long. So whichever one you're comfortable with.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Sargon has sort of overtaken. Carl. There's sort of a Batman, Bruce Wayne situation here. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       You know, like that kind of is actually. Yeah, it's the name song on his definitely traveled before me in many places where progressives, a tense congregates

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       aggressives I'm shocked that you didn't say regressives, but we'll get to that momentarily. So, uh, before we get into all the deep stuff and the, and the topics and the meat of this, I want people to get to know you a little bit because I think it's sort of just recently that you're showing your face more. You're out there more, your name's getting out there a little bit more. So how did Carl Benjamin Becomes Argon? Have a guide.

Speaker 2:          00:04:38       Um. Oh, that's an interesting. It's an interesting story. It's not actually that interesting as well.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       That will just make it interesting. How about that?

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       I'll try, I'll try and I'll try and fabricates let me know. Basically about. So about two and a half years ago. I know you when you know, when you're on the Internet, you ended up just choosing a Monica that you sign into places with and I just happened to like the historical figure of song and he was an interesting figure. I like the sound of the name and you know, I saw, I was just using that and I had signed up to youtube. I'm in 2010 just to upload some videos of myself with an ancient sling, you know, the sort of, uh, I made one call the historical sort of documents and I tested it out and it's that you can see why they're dangerous weapons or thing. And then a few days later I was basically getting really, really worried about lead the sort of political climate in the left eye was starting to see more and more often I'm just my, my own principles being completely violated.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       And it was really, really, really worried and it was thing that was genuinely started ignoring me because, I mean I would see people arguing for arguing against people's freedom of speech or they would be arguing against the socratic system. So some Lama and everyone would seem to be going along with it this, this was it, you know, there was so many people going, yeah, that's exactly how we should do things. Those, those Palak thinking course. I totally disagree and I disagree on such a fundamental level. I have to say something and so I found myself just motivated sort of right around just like under five minute scripts or something and then read them with a very, very bad microphone. It's all about the mic. It really is. It's, it's a, it's a magician's trick on this, but I have just the cheap on microphone. It was really, really terrible quality and I'd read these ideas and they started gaining. Some teams have started. People started subscribing to my channel and stuff and looking back, now I'm thinking, God, they were really. That was a little full bearings there about my technical skill and what I was saying, but I guess some people agreed with what was saying because now I've got um, I've just lost a quarter of a million subscribers. Uh, yeah. Now I do this full time and it's a, it's a wonderful thing to be doing is fighting for my principals professional.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       So I love that. I love that because as I say on the show every week, what I'm trying to do here is make this about ideas. And that's really what you were talking about, you were hearing bad ideas and then you want it to beat them with better ideas and clearly it's working because you got over 250,000 subscribers. And, and when I had my personal awakening because everyone knows at this point, you know, I've always considered myself liberal. Then I was in the progressive world, which I now see as some sort of mental disorder. Um, but when I was having my awakening out of that, uh, everyone online said to me, you've got to talk to Sargon. Uh, so my, so my first question to you before we get into the heavy stuff is, did you study politics? What brought you into the political realm?

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       I didn't. It was, um, it was just watching the news I guess, and just watching you know, popular. I mean, I, I used to be, I used to be a big fan of the young Turks. Um, I used to consider myself progressive until I met progressive's. And like you said, I couldn't believe the things they were saying it, it really struck me as some sort of mental disorder. Yeah. Why would they start saying things like this and. Yeah, and then I, then I, I, I, I still find myself floundering on my own because the, you know, there's, I, I'm not a conservative and I can't, I can't bring myself to subscribe to conservative ideals and they just didn't. They didn't work for me. I don't, I don't believe in them. Um, and so I was basically on my own, you know, everyone I knew was, it was a liberal, was quite happy to ignore the foundational principles of liberalism in order to, in order to push progressivism, furthering. The more I, the more I've learned about progressivism, the more I realize it's really used liberalism as a Trojan horse to they've said, oh, we liberals or progressives and I mean on the, on the subsequent. They're not necessarily our group for different things. It's really the methods, the problem. It's not necessarily the goals. Um, but yeah, they, they, they heavily use the terms interchangeably and they are not interchangeable. That's all.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       Yeah. So let's, let's unpack that a little bit. So I've heard you say you refer to yourself as a classic liberal, and the more that I've been doing this, I mean that's really where I feel at home too. I think now I have some really strong libertarian leanings also, but there's, there's some, there's some play there, there's some common ground there. But what is classic liberalism mean to you?

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       Um, well it's just the instance, the basic values that came out of the alignment, the civil liberties, political freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of association, Economic Freedom, representative democracy, the rule of law. It's always just, there is no argument against these ideas. These are great ideas that universal ideas, you know, everyone is protected under these ideas. Unlike with progressivism web, the first thing they will do is demarcates a group and they will say, right women, black people, gay people, these people need special treatment and special treatment will involve the infringement of your personal rights. And that is where I have a problem because if we all ascribe to these same rights, hey, we're all being treated as equals B, nobody ends up losing their rights. And I don't have a point seat.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       Should I do? I think I've covered the reasons. Yeah, that, that was pretty good. So this is sort of a, an example of the road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? Because this is where I've seen, I know a lot of progressives, a lot of them won't talk to me anymore. People that I that were my good friends only, you know, six, eight months ago that won't talk to me anymore. But I believe that for the most part, and we're going to get into some of the really dangerous ones. But I think for the most part, people that consider themselves progressive, most of the people that are going to Bernie Sanders rallies I think are good people. I think their intentions are correct. So we're really talking about the methodology here, right?

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       Yeah. The, the, there are a few. The problem is you have a bunch of. You have a bunch of motivating factors that kind of coalesce and in mixed in with that, you have the more sort of a punisher aspects of people who can see where this is going because a lot of it involves giving the benefit of the doubts so people who you would otherwise necessarily be skeptical to. People making. I mean, for example, rape laws, one of the big progressive pushes and it is, is to have it so the victim quotes unquotes, the alleged victim is believed and therefore the burden of proof becomes lead on the person who's being accused rather than on the accuser and they do this by the use of statistics. They say, oh, well, you know, I can't remember the numbers, but something like under five percent of accused rapist go to jail or something like that, and therefore they assume that there is a massive problem with the system.

Speaker 2:          00:11:32       That 95 percent of accused rapist also actual rapists and therefore just being let off through a bad system. But the thing is, hey, we don't know. We have no idea how many of the people who are accused are actually legitimate rapists and deserve to be condemned for it and convicted for, but secondly, what we're doing that is reversing the system because at the moment what we have as a system that isn't perfect but can deliver justice in a reliable way, you know, we, we can be quite sure that the people going to jail, probably aunt innocent, you know, we've been through a rigorous rigorous trial. The burden of proof is on the accuser. They've managed to prove beyond reasonable doubt and you know that's fine because that way you're going to get the minimum number of people who didn't do anything wrong, being punished as if they did something wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       Whereas to flip the script on, that would mean that you now have a system that is inherently unjust, that might be able to deliver justice on occasion. The occasion being the person being accused is on camera somewhere else at the time that they're supposed to have been doing the rape or something like that. You know, it's not sort of thing. It's, it would be incidental justice. You know, you couldn't rely on it because you don't presume the innocence of the people being accused that guilt is being presumed and it's being done like say, Oh, good motives. The idea that, you know, well, we don't want to cool the victims lies and it's like, no, I don't want to call the victim a liar either, but it's one of those points where you're on the horns of a dilemma and you have no choice but to take a responsible course of action for safety of someone who hasn't done anything wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       Right. So, all right, so there, there's a lot there that I want to go. I've been preparing for this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, you're jumping. You're though I knew that that's how this conversation was going to go because there's so much to talk about. And then these things are always inextricably linked. That's what I found whenever I'm talking about anything related to sort of regressive ideology. And then when you start talking about feminism and Islam, Islam and all these things, uh, they're, they're all so inextricable, inextricably linked. Um, so let's, let's jump into Gamergate for a second and then we'll get back to some of that stuff because Gamergate, I think is one of the things that really sort of put you on the map. And even by saying the word Gamergate, I've made people crazy. We know this now. I've discussed it with a couple people I've had Milo Yiannopoulos on. I've talked about it with Christina Hoff summers. But you, yourself, you are a true Gamer, correct? Yes, I am indeed a true Gamer. What are you playing these days?

Speaker 2:          00:13:56       I play a game called oxygen level of volt. Most, um, I actually have my own server where I pay for a sub or I get to run around killing the tool dinosaurs. That's great.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Wow. Well thank you for taking a moment from slaying dinosaurs to uh, to join me here. Uh, but yeah, you've really been in the Gamergate thing and I think are considered sort of an expert on it. So can you give me like a two, three minute explanation of what Gamergate is? And I know that's almost impossible because it seems like it's something different to everybody. It is,

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       is it, I can give you my version of what it is, but like you say, it is different for everybody and you're going to get people who are going to say that's not what Gamergate, his and one not. So, um, for me it is, it's a very definite reaction to regressives infiltrating the video game media. Now this is something that we saw. We've still happening over the course of about five years where they were just in criminal, larger and larger numbers of them would be hired at various gaming publications and then they would start writing articles like all these video games, sexist. Why are these video games was soldiers. There are no Trans People Nisa d games. This is racist. This is, you know, the, the standard regressive lines. Yeah. And they would be promoting very famous feminist like Anita Sarkeesian or when people with. And I don't, I don't know, I don't want to sound mean, but very few real credentials in the video game industry mean like Zoe Quinn. When the, the, uh, Franz Ferdinand of game of gates, uh, she made a, a free. Um, did you, did you ever have those choose your own adventure book?

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       I loved, choose your own adventure. I probably had everyone likes, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Yeah. Basically that's what she had made. She had made a digital tutors rent adventure book. It was all old tanks. No, no, nothing else in it. It can take him very long, but it was about learning to deal with depression and I've never had depression and so I can't judge the game on that metric. So I'm on that. I'm sure it's very good. But your average game of this wasn't really a game. It wasn't a fail state, you know, it wasn't, there wasn't really into complaint. It was more like an interactive Nova, which is again, it's in itself is fine, but the gaming press, because she was a prominent feminist and regressive, she got unbelievable amounts of coverage and I mean when I say unbelievable me, any amounts of coverage, but it's more than you would expect. And so people were kind of getting sick of the agenda being pushed on them.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       And it's the same as it needs to appease him when he'd suck easy in. Did a kickstarter, it was everywhere. Everyone knew about it, and yet everyone also knew that the argument that she was presenting where half truths they would cherry pick, they were. She was finding individually examples that didn't really represent the gaming industry or any evil, you know, subsections of the gaming industry. I'm presenting them as if they were a categoric statement on the condition of the entire gaming industry. And so everyone was really kind of annoyed by this point, especially as the way that these people work is by running a pure emotions. So almost everything they say is fundamentally accusatory. They would say things like, you're a sexist or a racist if you like these games. There aren't enough black people in this game, rotten of women in this game or gay people or the sort of thing. And if you're enjoying it, you're a bad person. Whereas most people are thinking, well, just how. Just just make the games you want to make. Right? But no, that's not what these people are interested in whatsoever. And so it got to the point where that Zoe Quinn was colts having an affair with her boss who was involved in video games and also a journalist called Nathan Grayson. And the video game industries presses always been corrupt. I mean that it's always been cropped. It's come out of a hobby press. It's always been really, really bad. Um, but

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       so when you say corrupt, just to pause for one second, when you say corrupt, I mean things like, you know, people paying off the magazine writers so that they'd get better reviews on the game. So they'd sell more games. I mean, real corrupt stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And a hold of it's in your face as well.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       So you go to a video game, a online magazine, I'm the backdrop would be the advertisement for gate then would be reviewed in the sense of color. You know, it's not, it's not even trying to hide it, but for the most part nobody really cared because they weren't being preachy about, you know, they were trying to sell you video games. I'm asked, well, people with death and that full of nobody was that bothered. But then the regressives turned up and started being corrupt in a whole different way instead of instead of being motivated by money, which I suppose is to their credit, they were motivated by ideology and so now they would hire people into positions and promote things that were all based on cronyism. It was all their friends and family members and no, they would. They would push everything to do with our agenda and people realistically, people have just been really, really sick.

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       Then just when they were tied to this phone, moralism tied to being told that they were bad people even though you didn't. Obviously none of these people are actually bad people, you know, nobody knows who all these people and yeah, they're being, they're being prejudged before anything happens. And they got to the point where people like looking at it enough, you know, this has got to stop. And that's what that was. Basically it was called the Quinn spirasi solid. And then the video game press instead of turning around and saying something like, okay, fair enough. We haven't been doing our due diligence. You know, we, a lot of them are professional trained journalists like Steven that's a telephone Kentucky, his master's degree in journalism and he's there saying, well, do we have to be objective? What's the need for objective journalism? And so you can instantly see the problems that were in the air and in the video game industry.

Speaker 1:          00:19:19       Yeah. And I know we can, we can really go down the rabbit hole with this and we could, we could spend three hours with this, but I think that's. I think that's a nice little beginning piece of it. But what I really find fascinating about it and why I've brought it up several times is because the same things that you're talking about, how the regressive sort of infiltrated this and turned something that had nothing to do with sexism or racism or any of these things. They made it about that. And I think when I was on your show, I was saying how I, you know, I used to be a huge gamer. I'm not that much anymore, but I liked the community and I do play some games here and there. But like, you know, I played grand theft auto and yeah, you could steal a car and punch a hooker and people would say, well that's against women, but you could also punch your man. So should they only have it that you'd only punch men. I mean even the logic behind it doesn't really stand to critique

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       and the, there is no winning ignorant. So the point is, it's all in the school. It's either you are this thing or this thing, you don't even realize it, you know, and there's no falsifiability is one of the hypotheses. But the, the, the main problem, if you think about it, like with grand theft auto. So like what are the options? Not include women in the game. No way they'd, they'd freak out if you couldn't put women in the game, right? Or you can have the women not being able to be treated like men again, that'd be freaking out. That's not equal at all. So what I mean, what are you going to have? You're going to have women and suddenly it just can't be damaged or you know, you, you, you, they will not allow you to treat women like men. You know, you can't beat up women, you can't, but you can be tough men. And so you're, you're in this position where you've got no when, you know there's no good answer and that's how they want it. They want you dancing to that team.

Speaker 1:          00:20:55       Yeah. And that's what, that's what's so fascinating about this and why I think it's so related to the political situation with the regressives. And I also think that's why Gamergate blew up the way it did because gamers generally are going to skew a little younger than the people that are solely interested in politics. So because of that, I think it was this group of people who had never been used to being attacked or silenced before and they were young and they were online and they were ready to coalesce around something. And I think that's what made it so, so magical or something,

Speaker 2:          00:21:27       you know, Gamers, gamers actually loan been the demon in the, uh, in the bedroom. Then I felt like the American Christians in the late nineties, early two thousands, there was Hillary Clinton under Joe journeymen actually brought legislation to try and try and sort of sense of video games. So this is another reason I would never vote for Hillary. I mean, I don't think anyone ever should. She's a corporate shell. Don't vote for Hillary, but she, the ending, there were so many reasons not to. Basically

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       we can get into that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Gamers are actually quite familiar with being attacked politically because of that hobby. Even though there hasn't been a single study that's ever really conclusively proven anything about Video Games. In fact, there are, there are dozens that say, well, there is no connection between video games and anything. You know, if you look at the statistics, the rise of video games just coincided with the dissenter violence. So I mean, I'm not saying that connected, but it's one of those things that there is literally nothing to show the video games or doing anything wrong. In fact, there's quite a lot to show that doing a lot of things.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       Wow. Well, I remember that. I think maybe it was around 91 or 92 when Joe Lieberman was leading that, that fight against video games. I think it was because of mortal Kombat. I was playing it on Sega Genesis at the time and I would come home from school and play that for hours with my friends. I never ripped anyone skull out with their spine attached to it, you know what I mean? Not once now. I tried once, but I, yeah, I never successfully did it. So that says something actually, I think you can prove that it probably helps people in a more healthy way than some of their anger and frustration. Don't you think? No,

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       I think the multiplayer games on there, you know, they get, they get groups of guys to hang out and do something that's not dangerous or violent, you know, and I think about it. I mean, when I was a kid, if one playing video games, we were on the streets, it was better for us to be at home playing video games than to not be playing video games. So, uh, I, I honestly can't see where the objections come from. You know, it's the same with anything like dungeons and dragons in the ats or music in the seventies, you know, video games in the nineties and two thousands there. There is always something that we, you know, poke clutching, moral majority or so they would like to position themselves as has got to rail against something. And ironically that was always the religious rights, you know, that was always the highly religious authoritarian. Right now it is the highly regressive authoritarian left.

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       Yeah. And this is the horseshoe theory that we talk about all the time that the extremes on both sides come together. Alright, so last thought on Gamer Gate, you know, the other thing that I think is really nice about the community is that people who are gamers, it doesn't matter what race you are, it doesn't matter what religion you are, what sex or sexuality, any of the little dividing boxes that the left wants to put us in. It doesn't matter what you are. And that's why the community's so strong. So then when, when these people that are writing these articles say, well gamers or sexist or gamers or racist, it actually, it literally has no meaning because it's as diverse a community as you could possibly put out there, right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       Yeah, I mean it. You literally can't tell by playing a video game what race agenda The people you're playing with are because everyone gets to choose their own Avatar, but it gets customized. Their name, you know, that the only way you'd know is by voice chat know. So for the vast majority of people playing video games is not paid to identity politics. And you know, what's interesting is the regressive academics actually did. They spent a lot of times or planning their assault on video games and they spent time doing research and there was an academic feminist academic called Adrian who did a series of studies not based on particularly large sample sizes, but large enough I would say to at least give you the impression that they're going the wrong direction because her conclusions and she was someone looking for a way to sort of, you know, crack open the video game industry with a good reason to attack it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       She found that basically a mini games didn't need diversity. Video Games had diversity, which meant that, you know, and that in itself what, where, where does the regressive begin their plan of attack if the thing they're attacking is already diverse, you know. And so basically it, it led to her reframing the study she had already conducted in a different way. And the, uh, the language is very opaque, but basically she was not happy that there was a plurality of markets. And now I personally think a plurality of markets is a wonderful thing. I think, you know, if a video, if you want video games about the Japanese Hentai great, that's your business. I'm not interested in that. I will. I will video games about killing dinosaurs. That's great. That's my niche. And everyone gets their own niche, you know, whereas the problem that they had is that they wanted hedge ammonia overlap. They didn't want a plurality of markets because then you could have diverse market, you can have marcus on by this. They won't say every market to be controlled effectively by their ideology. And thankfully he's not going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:26:20       Right. So just to be clear about that. So there are people that are probably playing Mario Kart that have nothing to do with the people that are playing the games you're playing. So it doesn't make sense even to lump all those people together.

Speaker 2:          00:26:31       Absolutely. I mean there will obviously be some crossover in every, every game genre, but by and large you get people who have different preferences and they play different things. Like I'm. One of the things I would say, one of the things they, uh, the big, slightly polite as, oh, almost half of people playing video games or women. It's okay, great, but what are they playing? They don't play call of duty, you know, they're not sitting there on their xboxes but the headphones and running around calling each other gay that playing candy crush and Farmville, which all perfectly valid forms of entertainment and more power to them. I want them to play the games they want to play. But these, by, you know, by this point it doesn't justify changing anything about the games I play because of the games they play and vice versa is true. I don't want their games being changed to suit me either. You know, that would be the last thing I would want to impose on. And so this is basically one of the things the regressive left will always do, is use statistics and the most slippery way possible in Atlanta lies damn lies. And statistics really does apply it. You, I mean they, they will use statistics to justify anything. So be be careful about the use of statistics with the regressive left.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       All right, so you've given me a perfect lane through Gamergate to talk about probably your, your other favorite thing to talk about, or at least maybe your most controversial thing to talk about, which is feminism. Uh, so let's, let's go there. Let's talk a little feminism A. I'm going to give you this in the most broad sense. Basically you don't like what the feminist movement has become. Is that fair to say?

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       Yes. And the, one of the dangers of talking about feminism is that it's very often conflated with women and this is done through eight women who exactly you're a misogynist. Last thing you will hear if ever you have any complaint about feminism, um, however, I mean this is just obviously logically, it's not, it's not, it's nonsense. Feminism itself as an ideology and you've got male and female feminists and you get people who are male and female opposed to modern feminism. So the idea that feminism is inherently the same as women is ridiculous. And the thing is, even the fewer and fewer women every year are identifying as feminists at the moment in, in America, only about 18 percent of women identify as feminists. And I knew something about nine percent of men, whereas in, in say the seventies, it was similar as high as 40 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       So the feminist movement is honestly, I think, I don't think he's doing yourself any favors. I think it's gotten full regressive. That's the problem. Um, you know, I, I would have no problem calling myself a feminist if we were in the era of say, second wave feminism. We had some equity feminism to Christina Hoff sommers oh, Camille Paglia would be espousing this whole equal rights, equal pay or the sort of the sort of things that you as any egalitarian would be completely on board with and would find absolutely no objection to. I find that objection to. But my problem is when we start getting into the realms of, well I mean shaming language for you were misogynistic, this you about you the other, when you have any objection and quoters or any, anything like this, you know, and then you, then you get into conspiracy theories, patriarchy theory, you know, and then it becomes intersectional.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       So now involves race and transsexuals and homosexuals and now it's a karaoke. This is an insult linking a series of oppressions and privileges. And really you realize that what you want your luggage, you say seeing is Marxist rhetoric. It's all. I mean if you read the communist manifesto, you understand modern feminism, you know, you were talking about the male bourgeoisie and the female promaths Harriet's and it's the same with black and white, straight and gay and all these sort of things. And I just don't ascribe to that because it implies a shared experience that we know men and women don't have. You know, I mean, and not just men and women, like black people, any of Trayvon Martin did not have the same life experiences as Barack Obama, you know? And so to say that being black is some sort of inherent shared oppression that they have is ridiculous, you know, it just, it doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       And my main problem really is, is that it's become anti individualistic the. I mean, you get famous feminist like any sockies and who will literally say things like, um, individuals, women, individual women's choices don't count. What Matt says is, what methods is feminism of the great, you know, something for the greater good feminism, something. I can't remember exactly how the quote goes, but it was just one of those things where it's just like, okay, I, I'm so totally against this, that I think I would be prepared to fight a civil war against, you know, these are so anti anti liberal principles. I can't stand them.

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       So in a way it's evolved to where it's no longer first off, women are a minority. I think there's something like 50 slash 50, one or 52 percent of the population, but where, where you should be for the minority and a minority. Uh, what you're saying is that they're fighting, they're eliminating the minority in the minority. I think an example of that we could use from the American political space would be someone like Sarah Pailin. Now, I don't like the views that Sarah Pailin espouses spouses at all, but can you believe that? Yeah. I'm not a big fan of Sarah Pailin. That being said, she's obviously a very influential and powerful and a self motivated woman. So in a certain sense, she's the ultimate, uh, goal of what a feminist should be. But feminists hate her, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:57       Absolutely. [inaudible]. She thinks wrong. What's the problem? She, she doesn't spinals she doesn't espouse a regressive ideology. She doesn't. I mean, if she called herself a feminist, fundamentally she wouldn't be invoking Marxist ideas. She would be invoking sorts of libertarian ideas. So the strength of the individual hard work, you know, all these. Honestly I think that, you know, they're not, they're not bad ideas at all, but she wouldn't be in the same camp as say Gloria Steinem Steinem or bell hooks or someone like that. I don't. It's weird talking about Marxism. You know, it's really weird because, I mean almost no, nobody really understands it these days and any people understand it, the academics and universities who teach it, and it is the manifesto is the third most prescribed book in universities in America. Just seeing the communist manifesto. Communism died everywhere. But in the west, it's so bizarre.

Speaker 1:          00:32:51       We fetishize these things, right?

Speaker 2:          00:32:53       Absolutely. People, people who live under communism hates communism, they think is a terrible idea. They know that. I mean, they, they had secure at three in the morning for milk and eggs, you know, they think is a terrible idea, but the people in the west have never lived through being put into practice and so they don't understand it's, you know, they don't really viscerally understand the real true nature of it I guess. And so, you know, when you're sitting in a comfortable house that's been built under capitalistic system and you've got lots of money and you've, you're doing very well for yourself. You thinking, well, maybe we should, you know, maybe maybe it's not such a bad idea and it's, you know, but it's, it's these principles that inform almost everything about third wave feminism. It's all about, it's all about power dynamics, privileged and oppressed, privileged and oppressed, which is why I was watching the young Turks the other day.

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       In fact, Jimmy Doyle, I think it was a, he, he actually had his tongue in his mouth and he was saying that he was for the oppressed in every situation. So he took the example of Israel. So Israel oppressed as a Palestinian man. He's in February, the Palestinian man. And then if the Palestinian amount of presses, his wife, he's a fair for the wife and it's just like, yeah, but you've, you've just said you are and are not in favor of the Palestinian man there, Jenny, you know, that is inherently cultural. You can't, you can't be in favor of the man and the wife, you know, at the same time. Which one are you in favor of? You know, it's that kind of, it's got this inherent contradiction to it and they don't seem to want to acknowledge that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       Yeah, and that's why as we've said for awhile and now this, this regressive ideology, it's always putting narrative over fact. That's really the most when you whittle it down to what it really is, it has to be narrative over fact. So you just pick the most depressed and then you get everybody on the ladder and then that's how you judge everybody, which is the reverse of judging a minority within a minority and those are the people that we should be for.

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       Yeah, absolutely. In the crazy thing about it as well is that these things are inherently racist and sexist and any other issue you want to. But the problem is that normally when people think, oh, you're being a racist, you think you're being racist to the, I guess the oppressed if that's what you want is called the minority who have suffered from racial discrimination past, you know, black people or you know, you're pressing women or something like that. But racism and sexism, despite what the regressives will tell you, I'm not structures or systems of power, their principles, their ideas, they are, they'll, they'll ways of viewing the world and so you can be racist to white people, you can be sexist to men and vice versa. And so it's this kind of, let's say the narrative they've, they've gone out of the way to redefine a bunch of woods and then they have cherry picked data points to arrive, a nice location where they can say you as a white man and not allowed to speak. Why? Because you're a white man and they will literally turn around and tell you that is not racist and sexist.

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       I think it's amazing. You give them enough credit to say they've picked these data points because I think in most cases they haven't even gotten that far. You're, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt that I can no longer give them. But we started here on feminism. So let's not go too far. But. But that's the interesting thing that every time I'm talking about all this stuff, we realize how the Inter. There's this interlink theme between Gamergate, between feminism, all of this stuff. So, uh, as far as feminism, I saw an interesting video that you did where you took the three types of what you said were the three types of male feminists. Um, and I thought it was really interesting because I was, because I defend women, I, I, I believe women should be equal. Uh, and that's pretty much it, so anyone can define me however they want, but I thought the way you broke these three type of men down was pretty interesting. Can you do that for us?

Speaker 2:          00:36:36       Um. Oh God, it was while ago. Did that video. I can't remember it now. Okay. So yeah, it's basically self interest I think. I mean, you get some, you get men who are the, they want to be rewarded for doing something heroic and protective and I think that a change might fall into this category where he's easy. He's a big guy, he's not he himself, that, you know, this doesn't have any particular fears in, for his own physical security. And so he thinks I'm going to use my physical presence to protect women because that would be a, a, you know, a laudable thing to do. And it would be, except that they're doing it for their own self interests that don't get thrown for the, for their own personal feelings.

Speaker 1:          00:37:22       The other end of the day, this is a guy who basically wants to get laid. I mean, in a lot of respects,

Speaker 2:          00:37:27       I don't want to put it that way, but yeah, I kind of Miss. It's, the thing is it's not necessarily getting lady though love. A lot of it is just for just for the sort of emotional reward, you know, because like a social. Yeah. Yeah. And, and just just, um, just to get the pat on the head, you know, it's, it's kind of to feel good about themselves, but requires permission from someone else. This case being a woman. And the thing is you end up, you end up getting ready, sort of, um, really unhealthy dynamics because you'll find women who are looking for men to do things for. And you will find men who are looking to do things for women and you will get this kind of feedback loop where they'll reinforce each other, you know, this, this, this guy stands up for this woman who is using him to fight her battles.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       And so this guy ends up fighting battles on his battles but are being reinforced, constantly buy. And again, this is not like all women in most women are not like this, but you will, you know, women are humans too and you get bad women as well as good women. And you find that this, this is basically one of the problems with the progressive because like we were saying earlier, and I hate to come back to like progresses, but feminism is just one like brunch and under the umbrella of the progressive sort of tree, I guess, you know, it's, it, it all ties together. Um, but you said you get most people when they think they're doing it for the right reasons. You know, they think, well, I'm a good person. I need to be helping women in minorities and gays and Trans and whatever. But the, the problem is that they have this kind of toolbox of rhetoric that virtue signals to other regressives.

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       It shows them say, hey look, I'm using this kind of language, therefore I'm on your team. You can come and support me on twitter or wherever you know, and, and so you will get people who think, okay, great, I'm going to do that because I'm always wanting to be an activist onto something good. And then you'll get the other kind of person who is the more malicious person who will think, great, I can use this to my own advantage. And they are the people you've got to be really worried about. I mean, there's a. In gamer gate, there was a woman called Randy Harper. She wasn't actually pop game gay. She was part of the problem, but some, the, the. I've never seen it most starkly represented than in her example, I think it was 2011, 2012. She, uh, she was on a BSD, which is a programming language, a podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:39:42       And she was literally saying, well, I'm a woman in tech and I don't have a problem with this. You know, I think, I think the feminists have of blowing this problem with ms dot progeny and the tech industry and all this other stuff. I'm a women in tech. I have no problem. Everything's great. And Lo behold, two years later when it's shown to be a profitable business model, she is literally on twitter. Say I'm an oppressed woman in Tech. I need your money, you know, give me money every month through patriots and also, and the, the, just the complete polar opposite of what you were saying before. And it's like really? So either the industry has become massively sexist overnights. You found a way to profit. So you know, and so,

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       so this is sort of something we could find with any movement. So I don't think, I don't think you're saying this, but that this isn't specific to feminism. Any movements can have. It's people who are doing it with the right intentions. It's going to have the people that are being guilted into it. It's going to have the people that are being tricked into it. It's gonna have the people that can profit from it all. Every single movement. And you're just using feminism is one example. I don't want people to say, well, you see, he's, he's trying to mock up what feminism is or something to that effect.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       Yeah. No, no, no, no, you're right. This, this is again, it's not necessarily feminism because feminism is just a subsection of the social justice movement. You know, you've got some, they call it into sectionalism is like, there's bell hooks describes it as the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. I'm not surprising you are. You are a supporter of the white supremacist capitalist Patriarchy date. I actually propagates. I'm, I'm a terrible person. But basically what this encompasses is, is, uh, the dynamics between black people and white people. The white supremacy, a, the capitalism is the poor and the rich and the patriarchy being men and women. Um, I think they probably have terms for gay and straight and Trans and CIS. But I'm not familiar with them off the top of my head, but this is. This is the point at some, they have this toolbox of tubs and they have a academic background.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       All of this comes from academia. All of this, you know, this has all been. And People Think, oh, this is coming from tumblr. It's like, no, tomorrow is the outgrowth of this council. You know, this is coming to the surface in popular culture. This all comes from sorts of, you know, the halls of academia where they, they start with a premise, they confirm their biases, the peer review, that own papers between feminists and then they carry on building from that until they've got to the point where they will, like I said, the redefinition of things. The reason, the reason the progressives are so dangerous is of course, as you said, with every movement, you're going to get people who are profit, Terry Union, people doing it for their own selfish reasons, but I can't think of any movement that legitimately has an excuse to be malevolent to people for any good reason.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       You know, almost every single one he let Christy has been love. You love your neighbor as yourself, you know, and like for very individualistic Zena individual rights in representative democracy, everyone gets to be treated in a universal, you know, the Brotherhood of man and all that sort of thing. Whereas these people have something different. They actually have, and I, I, I can't remember which feminists that is and I'm quoting and they say this, I think it's Andrea. Talk Him when they say that women have the right to hate their oppresses. Now this is for me a particularly scary aspect of it. And it goes, it goes totally for what the black lives matter movement, who all subscribed to this kind of ideology. It's the, it's the way of legitimizing hatred for people based on what is perceived to be social advantages. So if they say, well, you're a white man, therefore you have special lunches, therefore it's not bad for me to hate you. You know I can, I can say all sorts of things to you and it's okay because you have privilege. I'm oppressed. You're privileged. Therefore, no matter what I say to you, it doesn't matter, even though in an interpersonal interaction, if you say some horrible things to me, I'm helped by, you know, I'm a, I'm a regular person. Like my white privilege isn't actually a shield from horrible word.

Speaker 1:          00:43:36       Also, it, it, it takes the distinction away from someone from a male who is doing everything he can to fight for women's rights and equality. And I'm an a man who is against those things. If you just say it's white men or it's just men. And we saw this, a great example of this I think is a couple of weeks ago with those Cologne attacks, and I saw all these feminists writing articles and tweeting saying things are, this is, it's not a, this isn't a migrant problem, this isn't a religion problem. They were doing everything to get it away from the identity of the specific people who did this and try, this is a male problem. Now this is crazy. This is actually crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:20       It's insane. What happened in Cologne was something called Tara rush a, which is just Arabic, the group assault or sexual assaults. Um, and it's something that happens. Think the first instance of it was, I think it was originally recorded in the fifties, but I guess it kind of wasn't something that really came to the surface until about 2011 in the Egyptian Arab spring where I, excuse me, I think it was a CNN journalist, was basically surrounded by a group of guys in, uh, in Cairo and then molested and forcibly be molested by gangs of men. And this, this happened on New Year's Eve all across Europe. It happened in Stockholm, Helsinki, or attempted to in multiple German cities. And it was, you know, the, the, the police chief literally said nothing like this ever happened before. And so when feminists say, well, this is just men, we know that's wrong, you know, we, we know that's when we know that it is probably tied to retrograde attitudes towards women coming from the Islamic world. You know, I'm not saying every Muslim or anything like that, but you know, you, you can't go to the Islamic world and look around and see how things are and say that women are treated the same there as they are here.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       Right. So, so that's a perfect segue to this feminist and is video that you had mirrored. Who was the guy that originally created the video?

Speaker 2:          00:45:44       Right. The video was originally done by a small, a small youtube called Seitan atheist.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       Okay. So He created this cartoon video and it's a song and it's basically a feminist and Islamist singing together about why they sort of see the world in the same way. That was the thrust of it. And I saw the video and before all hell broke loose about it before Richard Dawkins retweeted it, I, I saw it and I thought it was pretty brilliant. It's a great satirical takedown of this regressive nonsense. Now, I didn't realize at the time that apparently the, the female character playing the piano, apparently that was actually based off a real person. Right? I didn't know that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       So the Islamist, the Islamist is a youtuber called dollar man who, um, he runs around proclaiming Islamism, united saying that everyone should bounce with Islam and all that sort of thing. So it wasn't, it wasn't victimizing anyone in particular in these parodies of individuals, but the individuals who have become famous because of their terrible ideas and Massachusetts. Right. Go ahead. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I had, I, I would love to say that I wrote it or something, but I didn't. I literally emailed the guy and said, look, I really like your channel. I want to help promote you. Do me a piece of unique content that I can put my child wouldn't blink back to you. Um, and so you sent me this video and I saw it. I put it up and uh, and yeah, and all hell broke loose when Richard Dawkins retweeted it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       So basically all Dawkins did was retweet this and suddenly his twitter feed blew up and he was deep platform from a speaking event at the. Any CSS, I think it's the northeast conference of secular skeptics, skeptics and secularism. Something close to that. He was the platform from it. They applied for them without even telling him. There wasn't even a phone call. They didn't ask for an explanation. He then

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       he made a public statement to virtue signal. That's the important thing. They were telling you, the regressives look, you know, with d platforming him because he has done something transgressive to us, you know, we won't show everyone else. We're on where we're at the front saying, look, this is a terrible thing. The irony being Richard Dawkins was probably a big draw for that place. You know what I mean? Of course, you know, he, they might get three, 400 people that Richard Dawkins has millions of followers, you know, he, he's, he's doing them a favor. So the, you know, they haven't, they, they've kind of shot themselves in the foot and they've just made themselves with really intolerant because his original tweet was obviously as a feminist myself, this doesn't apply to all feminists, but there is definitely a pernicious minority and low and behold the punishes minority rose up and you know, got in his face and it's like, okay, well you're just proving the point of the video.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       Right? So you're literally proving the point of the video. You're literally proving that these two groups for all the wrong reasons have become partners. That there's one ideology that, that feminist unfortunately or some degree of feminist seem to be okay with. And it's the same ideology that would do the worst to women. Yes. It's hard to. It's hard to believe that we, even as I'm saying it, I'm thinking this is completely bonkers.

Speaker 2:          00:48:51       It is absolutely. It's bunk. I'm without intersection Islam. It doesn't make any sense at all, you know. But when, again, you've got to thinking sexually, so you think Ryan white person than Brown person than men, women and said, okay, what the question is, what is the most oppressive thing, so I'm am oppressed in the woman that's quite bad, but a white person, the pressing a brown person that's much worse and therefore now we're talking about a bunch of Brown people being oppressed by a bunch of white people, and so the fact that men and women are oppressing each other brown winter or pressing white women, that's so important. The important bit is the skin color above the sex, which I'm genuinely surprised that I thought feminist would go the other way. I thought that they would be more concerned about men oppressing women in Lynn Brown. People are being oppressed by white people, but apparently the. No.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       Yeah, apparently not. So in your estimation then, knowing the way the feminist movement has evolved, and obviously I've had Christina Hoff summers on the show and I've talked to her about some of this stuff. What would you say is the best? If you just want true equality for the sexes, you're married to a woman, you, you like women, heterosexual guy that likes women, right? Um, what would you say is the best way for men and for women, for anyone that cares about the ideas of feminism to go out and act on those ideas?

Speaker 2:          00:50:08       Um, I mean, honestly, I think one of the problems that feminism has now, modern feminism has, this is one of dragons to slay, you know, I mean men, men and women have complete legal equality. I can't think of it whenever, whenever a feminist is challenging you to say, Oh, you know, the men are oppressing women. Ask them what legal men have. Women, they can't leave it. There just aren't any. And so we're at the point now where, I mean, I, I don't know what more needs to be done. We seem to be living in quite stable liberal democracies where merit methods. I mean obviously in everything it is a lot of, a lot of what it is is who, you know rather than what, you know, Butts, merit, still massive, you know, you can't just hire someone for that arbitrary characteristics if they can't do the job, but you mean no one, no one thinks that.

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       So, I mean I'm personally, I just think don't, don't make judgments based on racial gender or you know, or transgenderism or you know, or homosexuality or anything like that. The, these characteristics that Germany, I'm very useful to judge people on. I mean, you know, your, your being a white man doesn't in any way inform how good an inferior you are. You know, I, I'm, I'm not watching you because you're a white man. I'm watching you because I like the guests you have on what the questions you asked. I let the ounces you get out with them. You know, none of that has anything to do with you being white or male. A straight. Okay. Or anything about this. They, they completely pointless and arbitrary characteristics that really apply.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       Right? So really all we have to do is just keep hammering the point home, right? If if were for people that want to remove this identity politics stuff, we just have to keep hammering that until it becomes so obvious and I do think that's where, and this is where we can sort of pivot to a little more of the regressive tactics. This is where we can really beat them. They're tough to beat because we know they're going to lie. We know they're gonna cheat and misinformed people and all of those things, but what we can keep hammering them with is we want equality for everybody regardless of borders and nationality and religion and everything else.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       Yeah. The, the, the fundamentals of the fundamental principles of liberalism, a universal mats that, that was the great. The great gift of sort of English liberalism is individual rights and universal principles that you think are wrong. You know, we've not always applied these evenly or anything like this. And you know, initially they were exclusively for white heterosexual men at the very top of the pyramid. But the point is that the principals obviously lend themselves to cascading downwards because as soon as you have some people who are espousing these principles, there is no good reason not to extend the franchise to everyone, which is why we now have universal suffrage. It Yukon. There's no justification to not united. The on all of the justification is given world, obviously faulting, which is why we're now at the point where we are. Um, so yeah, it just basically stay true to your own principles.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       If you think it's wrong to judge by race, don't judge people by race. It doesn't matter what race they are. If you think it's wrong to judge by people, by sex, don't judge people by sex, you know. And, and the, all, I, all I can say is that these are timeless principles that will always be relevant. You know, they will never be a time where someone says, you know, actually it is because I'm black, that I should be judged is because I'm a woman that I should be. And it's only because these people have, they've got a lot of good and very slippery language and techniques to persuade people that in fact, you know, given this context, it's right to do this. Whereas I'm of the opinion that there is no context in which its rights to judge people based on characteristics they have no control over if you didn't get to choose it. It's not a part of your character, it doesn't describe you as a person, it just describes your body or your, you know, your physical characteristics. It doesn't describe what you are like in your character.

Speaker 1:          00:53:56       So does this, do you think this also goes to the feeling part of this? Because that's sort of what I'm thinking as you're saying this, that there is, there is a feeling that I think this regressive ideology is attached to. So for example, I can't give you a, as you just said, I can't give you an example of where systemically in the United States that women are oppressed, meaning that, you know, there are now laws protecting, you know, equal opportunity laws and things like that. Now that doesn't mean that women don't have a harder time related to certain things. If business deals, for example, are being done on golf courses and less women play golf, well then they're going to be excluded and then you could probably think of many, many examples like that. But what that is really more about is, is a feeling not sort of a systemic legal issue. And I think that's where people, that's where people struggle to separate these things.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think like, um, uh, what's the, what's the company that does the sex toys and some. And some of this is a British company. I think it, it sounds sex toys. It's, it was created by a woman and a large portion of the company is run by women. They probably don't do that business deals on golf courses, you know, they, they probably have, I don't know, mass on nail salons or something like, so, you know, and I'm saying stereotypical, but they don't go to the golf courses. So I would have to change my position and perspective and I would have to go to where the power is in that situation. You're right. And you know, they're, they're all going to be cases where you have um, you know, powerful ceos who go golfing and the way to get into the good graces would be to go go from as well.

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       Um, you know, sometimes you've got to make sacrifices. I, I personally hate golfing, but I wanted to be the CEO of this company will get, you know, I went to work my way up the ladder. I would take up golfing. You know, it doesn't matter about your gender, it matters about how well you'd go, you know. So, you know, I, I, like I said, it's not a perfect system either, but it's better than the alternative because one thing that people were out of my quotes is as soon as you start discriminating in favor of someone because of skin color, sex, ethnicity, whatever, you will also discriminating against people on those very same categories. You know, if you say, right, we've got a position here and we need to hire a black woman, then you're excluding people on the basis of their race and sex. So I, I can't agree with that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:18       I think that's wrong. If I'm sure there are plenty of incredibly talented black women out there, therefore we don't need to make artificial adjustments. Surely, you know, and at the end of the day, if we go down this road, then when does it end? Where, where is the eventual logical goal? Eventually you come to a planned economy. What you can't, you can't just have honor. We, you were going to hire by merit, but now you've got 10 different categories you've got to go through, you know, how many, how many trans people, Queer people, how many black, white, Hispanic, you know. And so now you're talking about how good they are at their jobs. Now you're talking about the just operatory characteristics of these people. And what happens when, like if three people leave, once you do three black people, leave your company and all you have applying for jobs, uh, white people, what do you, do? You know, you're in a position where it's, it's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       Yeah, it's really crazy. It's almost like the, the quest for equality is being played sort of on an unequal playing field and that just makes everybody kind of nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Well, I think, I think nature really didn't have it right when he, when he was saying that, um, you know, be careful when you're battling monsters because when you stand along into the abyss, the bissell sustains into you. You're not. And if you, if you stand along into the sort of progressive mindset of the world is terribly uneven, it's an unequal. There are no opportunities for anyone. There's no ed. We need to do anything we can to help them. Then everything becomes justified. You know, the, the, the, it doesn't matter whose rights you're trump alone, you're doing it for the greater good. And that's what really scared.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       So that's actually a great segue to. I want to talk about a little bit about their tactics. So I think in the, in the 45 minutes or so that we've been talking, we've talked a lot about their ideas and obviously we're not fans of their ideas, but I think there's something more pernicious going on here with some of the tactics because I don't think it's a coincidence that many of the main players in this regressive left movement, uh, have been exposed to be liars, to be plagiarists, to be frauds, to purposely manipulate people's words, to create memes that are knowingly misquoted all of these things. I don't think that's a coincidence. Now you may disagree what with what Sargon of Akkad says, or what Dave Rubin says, but I don't think you would find instances where we maliciously misrepresented people. And I suppose they're just their argument if you really got them alone, if you could really get an honest moment out of them, which I don't know you could get, but I suppose their argument would be, well, the ends justify the means and that's just the reverse of how I view the world.

Speaker 2:          00:58:53       Yeah, no, that is honest. Honestly, that's exactly what it is, right? It's about it. They're the, there's a lot to unpack here actually. There's these people are being primed in universities to be activists and part of the priming is to give them a good feeling about doing this activism. You know, it's to make them think that they can emotionally reward themselves by saying, yeah, I argued with a misogynist on twitter, you know, for, oh no, I'm not kidding there. That genuinely is. I've seen feminist, I've seen pictures of feminists courses were on the wall. They have a big twitter activism is feminism and stuff like this and it's just like, really? That's the thing. They're encouraged to be activists. They are encouraged to emotion and reward themselves for being activists and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       Do you know like theory about never argued with a twitter egg. That's what I'm going to put on my tombstone one day.

Speaker 2:          00:59:47       I, I haven't heard that, but that's a good one because I, I, I, I care about ideas and not like people are numbers so I can't wait when someone would like five fullest as your role in this. I've got to argue the case. I've got to stop out. Wow. I might be a little more evolved than you. That's pretty good. Um, what was I saying? Um,

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       that at the schools that, there, there's this, there's an intellectual incentive or there's a feeling incentive.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Yeah, there's an emotional incentive and um, basically it's, they've got to the point where they've convinced themselves that progressive or regressive ism is the only morally legitimate position to hold. And so anyone not holding this position must be a bad person. And that's everything about progressivism in a nutshell right there. If you a regressive, you are a bad person. If you owns sacrificing other people's rights for the rights of a group that you don't know you've got no connection to, but you have been emotionally primed to fight for, then you're a bad person. And so it's okay for me to call you all these terrible labels. I mean, I, you would have to be pretty damn racist for me to call you a racist, you know, it's a bad label. It's a label with a lot of weight and yet these people throw around as if it means nothing. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       You know, I, I always say that I, I think I said this to you when I was on your show that my awakening had a lot to do with that whole Ben Affleck, Sam Harris thing on real time and, and part of what the craziness of was with that was that ben throughout racists so quickly that I agree with you, it would take a lot. It would take a lot. There are obvious racist out there and they should be called out, but if you were arguing with someone, it would take a real special person for them to eliminate that. They were racist within 30 seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       I mean, yeah, I can only imagine. Then that came straight out of the gate with it or something and they were like, yeah, okay. Black people should be under, shipped off the cotton plantations or something. Be like, okay, well you're a racist. And on the blood, well I wouldn't call myself and whatever, but some of these things normally hold a lot of weights and the. And that's the reason they use. They use labels as weapons and they did it for a reason, for a couple of reasons. Actually. The first one obviously is to put you on the back foot. As soon as you're called a racist or homophobic or bigger or whatever. Then you're defending yourself. You're not defending your ideas. You're not attacking their ideas. You're defending yourself as a person. I mean, that's in itself a logical fallacy called an ad hominem attack the person rather than the ideas, and you will find that they do this a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       So basically, right? The answer to this is to just say in your opinion on the end of it, so they'll say you're a racist and you say, well, in your opinion, right? But they'll say, you know, you're a racist or sexist or bigoted. So in your opinion, you know, I'm not lots and I know him and nothing that I've said would make any reasonable person thing, but you other nodal reasonable person and therefore you're going to label me as a racist or a bigot or whatever. And honestly what you've just given me is your opinion. It's not an objective statement of fact. It's like when they use the word programmatic, they'll say, oh, that's problematic. And like, well, can you explain to me what programmatic means? Immoral. Does it mean wrong? Doesn't mean illegal? No. It means transgressive to progressivism with feminism and it's basically the same as sinful in the Catholic church or it's the same as in Islam, you know, it's, it's the, this is transgressive to my ideology is something wrong and it's not an objective statement of fact. It's, I don't like what you've done.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       Right. So that I, I love that because it goes to show that they want in a certain intellectual or ideological purity and that's what the Church would want out of your or any sort of authoritarian view would want an intellectual and ideological peer, not intellectual, purely ideological purity. It's usually not that intellectual, right? No, absolutely. They want an ideological ideological purity out of you. And what that does, you know, I'm seeing this right now in our democratic debate last week between Bernie and Hillary. They were arguing over who's the bigger progressive and it's like, guys, that's not what the fight should be about. It should be about, if you're on the left, it should be about who is standing up for liberal principles, more, not who fits this narrow definition because guess what then all you do, as we've said a zillion times in your hand, the debate over to the right and

Speaker 2:          01:03:56       absolutely, and yet Donald Trump, the steering in their own juices there as well. He's, I know I'm the biggest procrastinator. Salute you. You don't need to. You don't need to worry about convincing people about who's the bigger progressive progressive's aren't going to vote for you. You know, liberals are the people you want to commence on the swing. Voters who are dying, you know, died in the more progressive than the people who, you know, who, who concerned about issues. Okay. Said about policies, you know, who can send about what you're actually going to do rather than, you know, ideological Brownie points. And so yeah, it's, it's just this little circle jerk with a student or an ideology for so long. They don't understand how they're being viewed from the outside. I let you said it's driving people to the right. You know, it's absolutely driving people.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       So then what, what do we do? Because that is not us, right? We're the ones, we're the ones that are trying to defend classical liberalism. I'm sure you get tons of emails and tweets and all that stuff that I get all the time about. I see this split, this has happened. I get people telling me they're afraid and embarrassed to call themselves on the left. I get other people saying they won't post things on facebook because they don't want to get called a racist. So all of these things. So if there's this growing group of people, which there absolutely is, I have no doubt about it. Uh, what, what do we do to keep this message going?

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Okay. Um, okay. So the great thing about what's happening is that the, it's interesting because, I mean, like I said, you had Milo Yiannopoulos on your show. He was a, he was the only journalist who was prepared to cover gamergate initially. And I've, I've grown to become friends with them and people find it really. Oh, because he's a conservative and I'm a liberal and I just tried to explain to them that look, right, we've come to the point where it's not really about political affiliation to left and right. It's about whether we can agree on reality, you know, we can interpret this reality and have our own opinions in any way. I'm sure that he's got a lot of opinions, things that I disagree with, so if we can agree that the numbers are such that the events are as follows, you know, whereas the progressive left will lie to you. They will lie to themselves like that what we said that will cherry pick their narrative. They'll choose several data points, leave out the ones that contradict what they've said, and then if you don't agree with that narrative, they consider you persona non grata. You're, you're, you're, you may as well be, you know, bill o'reilly or something like that in that month.

Speaker 1:          01:06:12       Just to be very clear, you're not just, you're not just saying something for the sake of saying it. I mean, I have literally seen this happen to me just to be very clear. I mean, this is exactly what's happened to me, which I now wear as a badge of pride, by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:06:24       Yes. Well, let. This is one of the things when you first introduce people to this and they don't know anything about sales. I honestly think there's a lot of. They, they protect themselves with audacity and I mean I, I'm a big fan of military history and audacity is one of those things that wins many wars because it's so unexpected and I really think that the things they do are so audacious that it's hard to persuade people that genuinely doing them because people hear it and think, I would never do that. No, do that. You know, I wouldn't do it. I can't imagine anyone doing it. That's not happening your life, you know, and they think that the person relating the information is the one telling the lie. And so the progressives, I think, you know, they really, really take a couple this and say, well that's because he's a racist and sexist and all these things.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       And then the person that has to experience them acting as they act to read. I've had so many people come back and we get mad. I thought you were full of nonsense when, uh, when I first had to, but that was exactly how they are. Exactly how they. And I'm like, yeah mate, I told you honestly, don't worry about it, you know, just. No, no, no, no harm, no foul sort of thing. It's, it happens to everyone because at first when you first hear it sounds like nonsense, you can't believe anyone would act this way. And yet they do.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       Do you sometimes think that maybe the best way to beat them at this point is just to ignore them? Because I think over the last six months between what we do here, what you do, what many other people are doing, especially in the digital space now and what Bill Maher has done a little bit more in the mainstream, there's been, they've been exposed and I think because as you said, they're stewing in their juices now. Part of me is just like, Eh, let, let's just ignore them and then, you know, then there's another piece of me that says we have to keep on the attack. Which do you think would be a better, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:08:04       offering them as a very dangerous tactic? I think the, the, the problem, the problem with that is that you have the initiative to them and you say, you know, I'm, I'm not gonna pay attention, excuse me, to what you're doing. And therefore whatever it is they do and you're not really aware of and suddenly something will come at you that you're not prepared for. I. And also it gives them the ground to continue propagating their ideological position that gets them, you know, there's no, there's no resistance. And so, I mean, it's, it own twists a yeah, she'll eat it. Maybe. Maybe there's little resistance. But like if, if you get a group, a little delegation of progressives who come to a place and they say, oh, we'd like to talk to you about women's equality, or you call it, go on, then you know. And so your boss might like, you know, he's just a good guy.

Speaker 2:          01:08:51       He doesn't know. He's just, Oh, right, okay, well I'll do whatever I can. You know. And suddenly these people are now advising the upper echelons of this company and then they stopped enforcing ideological conformity and then suddenly you're in this position where, I mean this happened to major game studios has happened to like games workshop. It's there, there are, there are lots of people who have fallen prey to the velvet glove of social justice that contains within it the iron fist. But it's just really well hidden. So no, I don't think we can just, I think we have to fight them when we have to show people that there is a better alternative knots, the eternal point you've, you've got to provide a better alternative. And universal liberal principles, in my opinion, are the highest alternative there. There isn't anything better. You can't get anything more fair than normal liberal principles.

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       So I, I honestly think just just pushing these, you know, showing people these are the best way to do things in this not only encourages equal treatment of people into the law and any kind of social situation, but it also, it also pushes people to be the best that they can be. It doesn't encourage them to be victims, it doesn't hurt them to get, to be depressed and to, to milk it, you know, there's no room for fraud when you come to these sorts of meritocratic principles. People have to work, they have to push themselves and become better. And it's about raising the human condition rather than dragging it down, which is everything about regressing.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       Yeah. Well naturally I believe in what you're saying and that's why I'm doing what I'm doing. So I really, more than anything else, I should thank you because, you know, there were a couple key people that helped my awakening and when I had that conversation with you, a on your channel, that was one of the first times that I really started talking about this stuff. Uh, so you were definitely a key piece in that, so I appreciate that. Uh, and I appreciate all the work you do and everyone can find out more of SAR guns. Take on gamer gate, feminism, regressives and plenty more over on his youtube channel, which is youtube.com/Sargon of a cod 100 and Sargon Karl. Or do you have any other names that I need to know about? Let's just say those are the big two. All right, well I appreciate it and thank you guys for watching and we'll do it again next week.
