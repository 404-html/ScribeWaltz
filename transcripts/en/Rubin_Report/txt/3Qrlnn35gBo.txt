Speaker 1:          00:00:02       As I sit here in the middle of February, we're about eight months away from Election Day, 2016. Doesn't that sound completely insane? I mean, think about it. We've been talking about this election for at least a year and we're still over half a year away from it. That is completely bonkers. So much of the election process is just insider nonsense and day to day per so it's hard to focus on what issues are actually important. Not only does the 24 hour cable news cycle thrive on election drama and distractions, but the entire process of electing our politicians seems to be built on getting the people to actually never talk about the big issues in an honest way. We have debates with catered questions and no actual debating. We have town halls which are just forums for talking points and social media campaigns to spread candidates messages without ever explaining how their ideas will actually solve anything.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       You know, there's a strange collusion between the media and politicians to keep us all in the dark about what's really going on here. What I actually want to hear candidates talking about are big ideas. Not Political talking points to explain their economic philosophy and how it came to be, to say how they came up with a moral argument for or against abortion and to let us know why America's role in the world should be larger or smaller. Unfortunately, big ideas don't fit into 32nd soundbites, leaving us with a media that wants views and clicks instead of substantive debate and a political class who of course are all the happier to provide meaningless slogans that sound good in a headline but don't mean anything at all. That brings me to the two people really shaking up the system. At this point. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Bernie says he wants a political revolution.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       While trump says he wants to make America great again, I doubt they'll ever be another candidate like Bernie, a world weary lifelong politician who wants to fundamentally change how things operate from the inside. Whether you agree or disagree with him. It's a powerful message that of course there is trump, a billionaire who's using years of board room and TV experience to give his supporters whatever they want. Even if they don't know exactly what that is, what these two men have in common though is more interesting. They both openly mock the powerful and corrupting influence of money in politics while only existing as legitimate contenders because of its very existence. It shouldn't be lost on us that it's actually the very strength of our democratic system that allows to people who want to totally upend it to be surging in the polls and as warped as our system is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       If the two guys who were the most plainspoken who were being heard the loudest, although the countdown to election 2016 frustrates me as a political junkie, I can't pretend that I don't enjoy the clown show. It's a soap opera with characters you just can't make up. I mean, we've got the ex president's wife, the Socialist Jew, the billionaire and the neurosurgeon. It basically sounds like a spinoff of Gilligan's island. Unfortunately, while Gilligan and his friends were eventually rescued from their island, the only ones who can rescue from this shipwreck ourselves, the citizens to help me navigate these choppy waters this week is my guest, Ben Shapiro, the editor@largeofBreitbart.com. Many of you have asked us to have a sit down to dig into some of his conservative ideas, can have liberal and a conservative coexist well. If thirstin howl, the third and ginger could do it. I have a feeling that ben and I will be able to as well.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Every election year, politicians remind us that their election is the most important of a generation. Usually that's just more hyperbole nonsense, but this time it could actually be true regardless of who wins, whether it's one of these to hillary or Jeb or the skipper. Our system is fundamentally shaking right now, as evidenced by both the sanders and trump surgeries. Can we address real issues in the months to come or will we keep talking about sideshow nonsense? Can we get a fair election system or will big donors always run the show? Can we elect officials who will compromise to make the country stronger or will partisan points always win the day? These are just a few of the huge issues we have to discuss and that's not even touching on immigration, healthcare and terrorism. A lot of people mock the idea of American exceptionalism, especially on the left, but I actually do believe in it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       There has never been a country in the history of the globe that is taken more people from across the world and help them make a better life for themselves, their children, and their children's children. Even now with all of our problems, people still want to come to America for a better life. We have massive issues, but underneath it all, there's a bedrock based in democratic principles which still makes our position in the world truly unique. It doesn't mean America can or should tell the world what to do, but it does mean we have a responsibility to be fairer, freer, and more functional whenever we can. All of these reasons are why I've made this show about ideas and not my new show. There is an endless cycle of noise designed to keep us distracted and divided. Our politicians will only be better if we demand they be better. Will only demand our politicians be better if we are better ourselves. As you guys know, I love to say the two things can be true at the same time. Maybe we can have a political revolution while at the same time making America great again. This change doesn't start with trump and sanders though it starts with the government of the people, by the people and for the people. Just as the great Gilligan once said,

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       my

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       guest this week is editor in chief of daily wire.com, editor@largeofBreitbart.com, a syndicated columnist and radio host and in New York Times best selling author. You want me to throw in anything else and then you've got a serious resume. I mean, I was doing some research on. You pretty much do everything. Yeah. All right. Well I'm. I'm very happy that you're here because I had all of twitter basically saying to me for about six months you've got to talk to this guy. This is the guy who will either convert you to conservatism or you guys are just going to hate each other. Turned into flaming Bernie Sanders. Socialist. Yeah, that's, that's pretty much pretty sure.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       That's not the direction. It'll be a conservative by the end of the conversation. So. Well, let's see. Let's allocate territory. Yeah, let's see what happens. But, but a lot of people also said that even even liberals that, that. No. Have you said I don't agree with this guy and a lot sometimes I don't even like him, but there's some principle based around what he does. So that's pretty much of what I do here. So that's why I wanted to have you on. Thanks for having me. I got a lot of requests to come on your show. Somebody invited me. Yeah. All right, so let's get to it. So first off, you were actually born in La and brought up in La. I thought there were no conservatives in La. What the hell are you doing here? So my parents were both. They voted for Carter and 76 and they were Reagan Republicans.

Speaker 3:          00:06:35       And then because we're orthodox Jews, religious Jews tend to vote Republican and be culturally conservative and so that sort of the million in which I grew up, so I became conservative basically from birth I, I'm not, I'm not a new convert. Right. So how is that growing up a conservative as a kid? Because what's that saying? You know, if you're not liberal in your twenties, you have no a heart and if you're not conservative and you're 37 or something like that, how is that as a kid? It's hard. So it works out beautifully. Well, how, how does, how is that as a kid growing up, your conservative as a kid? It doesn't, it just doesn't sound. It doesn't sound right. Somehow, again, growing up in religious communities a little bit different than growing up in a nonreligious communities. Religious communities tend to be more conservative. And in La, conservatism is all about social issues, right?

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       When it comes to economics, there's kind of the, the LDLC, the people driving around in the Mercedes Benz with a Bernie sanders sticker, but everybody knows the full of it. So it's a lot of that in beverly hills right now. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And it's like, okay, you can just drive down to cars for kids. I think any day now just give it away and you enjoy yourself. Like I don't understand why you need my money. You clearly have some of your own. So anytime. But in la it's all a cultural thing and conservative versus versus leftist. And I like to distinguish leftist from liberals because I don't think they're the same thing. A conservatives versus leftists in La is very much about kind of a character assumption if he or if you're a leftist, you're a good person and if you're a conservative that means you're an uptight John Lithgow type from footloose.

Speaker 3:          00:07:57       You don't want anybody to. That's what it comes down to. Right. So I definitely want to dig into the difference between liberals and leftists, you, because it's something you focused on a lot from the right. And it's something that I've focused on a lot in the last year from the left. So we're going to dive into that, but let's just do some election stuff. Sure. First, let's get the easy stuff. Fun stuff. All right, so this election seems completely insane to me. Uh, let's start with trump. You're big on trump. I don't think so. How you feeling? I think that. I think trump's a loud mouth. I think he's a braggart. I think that, that trump is bad for American politics. I think that there's a couple of things that I like about trump won, is that he says things that are not politically incorrect. The problem with trump is that he fails to distinguish politically correct from just being a jackass.

Speaker 3:          00:08:39       So there, there is a difference. I mean there's a difference between being rude and being politically incorrect. Right? Being being rude is telling Megan Kelly, she's bleeding from her wherever. Being politically incorrect is saying that some immigrants across our southern border are criminals. That's politically incorrect, but it's not rude. But saying that Megan Kelly's bleeding from her wherever, that's not politically incorrect. That's just being a jerk. So, so it was part of it that his people mistake the two. So because. Because the, the reign of political correctness is so strong, people have now interpreted being politically incorrect as just anything you say that pisses someone off, that means you're politically incorrect. And that's not what political incorrectness is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       Sure. So it's this conflation of just saying anything and he's really good at that. I mean, I've noticed the more I watched him, it really, you can whittle him down to some pretty basic stuff because he just says a lot of circular logic stuff and this person's great, that person's great and they love me and they hate me and that and that. And he was actually never really saying anything. But that is sort of the genius,

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       what I don't like about him. And it is the genius of him because we live in a me culture and to me time and uh, me media. And so trump is all about trump. I mean, that's, that's really the only thing that matters to him. So if latimer potent insults him tomorrow, that matters more than a flat, unrepentant invade a country because all that matters is trump. And so he speaks about himself in third person and everything that he talks about is, I'm going to do this, I'm going to build a wall, I'm going to fix it. I'm going to make a great deal. I'm good for the blacks. I'm good for the Hispanic. Nowhere in there do I hear as a conservative? Nowhere in there. Do I hear anything about what's the proper role of government in my life, which is the part that I care about, right?

Speaker 3:          00:10:07       The part I don't care about Donald Trump, right? I don't think he cares about me. I don't think that we should care about each other, but I want him to leave me alone. I want Barack Obama. I want all these people to leave me alone so I can live with that for a conservative principle. They're just. Yes. Just just leave me alone. Like the government was not meant to do this many things. End of story. I mean read the Constitution is very explicit about the things government is supposed to do and pretty much nothing on trump's list except for maybe border security is really something that the government ought to be doing. And, and again, what that comes down to, and this is the problem, is I think that what the danger of trump is that the left for 100 years has fallen in love with the idea of the strong man.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       I mean, you go all the way back to Woodrow Wilson and Woodrow Wilson is writing about the president should be the strongest man possible. The only limits on his power should be his vision basically, which, you know, could come straight from Mussolini and Woodrow Wilson was actually as close to a dictator is America has ever had, that's carried through to FDR is credit to Lbj, to Obama on the right. At least they made overtures toward. We're not going to have the strong man who gets involved in your life and fix all your problems. Trump is the strong man and I think after, after so many years of a lot of Americans on the right feeling emasculated by President Obama telling them that they're racist, sexist, bigot, homophobes, and by Hillary Clinton and telling them that we're there to kind of testosterone in orientation toward the world. Basically. I wrote this yesterday. I think that the response to trump from the right has basically been he's the biggest swing instead of balls in the race and because that's what he is. I'm forum and you hear that from trump supporters. Well, he'll do something. Maybe he will. Maybe. I don't know. Will it be good?

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       My question is a conservative though. So as a truth, this must make you feel crazy, right? I mean you must be really enraged at your own party because it's looking more and more everyday like he's actually to.

Speaker 3:          00:11:52       Yeah. I mean, I don't know to be most pest out honestly. I mean, have you got. You've got the gop establishment, which can I get off the Jeb Bush, ran for the life of them and then just unify behind somebody like a Marco Rubio and hate Ted Cruz. So much they would side with trump over Cruz, probably cruise to them as too far right crews and they think he's unelectable and more than that cruise actually I think believes the things they say they believe so he says, I believe in small government. I think that we should cut the government. I think the government shouldn't be important in people's lives and the RNC, which makes its money off government being important to people's lives. I mean, how much money would you give to a political party if the government didn't matter in your life or the RNC would raise $0 if no one cared what happened in Washington DC and so Cruz scares them from that angle.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       I don't think trump scares them. I think trump, trump annoys the establishment, but he doesn't scare the establishment, so I'm annoyed at the establishment. I'm annoyed at. You know, Cruz is, is a very good constitutional conservative, but he's just an unfair. He's not a great candidate by any stretch of the imagination, and then there are the trump people who are so populist and in love with the, the, the feel of trump that they forget that they are, that this guy could actually be president and like if he's president and what is that going to look like? So it's, it's, it's frustrating. Definitely all the way across the board. And I think maybe the most frustrating thing of all is that beating trump is actually not that hard. Trump is a school yard bully and somebody needs to just say to him in the last debate, it was so clear.

Speaker 3:          00:13:10       If you actually want to stop trump, you can't do a job dead, whichever. I mean, Jeb stood there and he said, you know, Donald's, you know, you're, you're, you're bullying people. And also stopping me and my mother really. I mean all trump is. If my thesis is correct that basically trump just represents the balls of American politics and the only way to beat that as to kick him in the balls. Right? I mean that figuratively speaking, it's the only way to do it. And he can't really or could work through and it might work literally. I mean, um, but, but the only way to really beat him is for somebody on the stage to say to him, Donald, you're, you act like a big tough guy. Your Papa gave you $40, million dollars to play with. You've never had anyone say no to you and your entire life, you're a pathetic week specimen.

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       Every time somebody takes you off, you turned as red as the background on that stage. The other night. I mean, he actually faded into the woodwork during that debate. And if anybody on the stage really needs to shut the hell up and just listen for a second, it might be used since you clearly know nothing about anything. So what does that tell you about the rest of these guys? That nobody does it. I get it. It's not in Jim's character, right? It's just not there. I don't think it's in any of their character. What does that say then about this, this group of people? This is why they lose. I mean, it isn't Obama's character upon would do it and I think it's actually in Hillary's character. I think these. I think that folks on the left understand that presidential politics is a knife fight and people on the right are constantly engaged in this game where it's a discussion over policy.

Speaker 3:          00:14:28       So Jeb Bush this morning, for example, he's on, he's talking about trump and he says something to the effect of, you know, my, my goal as president of the United States is to grow our GDP from a two percent growth rate to a four percent growth rate. I thought, yeah, that's going to be trump. That's solid argument. Like they don't understand that most politics comes to. It's unfortunate. This is the way it is. Most politics comes down to character arguments. Once you get the character off the table, then you can have a good policy argument that most people on the left like to turn and say to people on the right that you are just bad people. You're a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobes, so we shouldn't listen to you. And, and that's what trump does so well. And so what you see on the right is, yeah, but you're not a conservative. That's, that's an argument about policy. It's not an argument about character.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       Right? So for a guy that obviously doesn't like Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, do you at least envy the fact that in their debates, it seems to me that it's much more substantive. There's at least, you know, they're really saying I'm the progressive on the progressive. Now you may hate all progressive ideas, but at least there's a, you know, your, you, you got the d plus from the NRA and I got to see her.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       So a little more of that. So I think that they stay away from the character attacks, which, which I appreciate that. That's good. Although I think that, you know, in, in Hillary's case, some character attacks would be necessary if Bernie actually would like to win and not just run a campaign. At some point he's going to have to say your corrupt, because that's sort of saying it though right now, and it's a little late, right? I mean, and, and by the way, she's vicious. I mean, attacking him as a racist, I, I'll say a lot of bad things about Bernie Sanders, but calling Bernie Sanders is racist, is absurd. And then she's so set on I have to win the ethnic minority vote that I'll send out my surrogates like David Brock to suggest he doesn't care about black lives, which is absurd. You know, I, I think that I'd like to see a little more character attacks on the, on the left in between them anyway. And uh, and as far as policy, I've watched a couple of their debates. I have yet to see a significant area of disagreement. I think they're just coming at it from. We agree on everything. It's just a question of how we talk about it to Bernie says, let's talk about it honestly. And Hillary says, let's lie about it a little bit so that people don't really figure out what we're up to and then we'll do it and it'll be too late.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       Right. So I sense at least with them, there's a, there's a hillary's trying to hit burning on this that you're a big idea guy, but actually I can get some of this stuff done now. I don't know that the Republicans would be any more inclined to say that birth order.

Speaker 3:          00:16:41       I mean they say that, but it's boring. Right? Kristy was saying that in every debate, right? You'd have Rubio and Cruz go at each other and then there's Chris Christie doing the La Jolla shores. Governor. I don't understand what you're saying. What are you talking about? Other. Yeah, because. Because it's because it's a, it's a dumb thing to do. I mean he sounds like a, he, he acts like a hick when he does that. Christie, like if you're a governor of a major state acting like you don't know how the political game is played or like you don't know what the Senate does. I just don't know what these people are arguing about over here. Exactly. Here I am, you know, I do real things like hug Obama. Is it? Come on. So it's all the politics. Everybody is playing politics right now. At this level, and nobody's playing politics like we're the real ideologies are, which is why I would like to see what I would love to see.

Speaker 3:          00:17:20       I think it'd be good for the country is a sanders versus Cruz raise. Right? That would actually be a fascinating race because at that point may, if standards can stay away from the whole you're a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobic thing. We could actually have a discussion about whether socialism is a good idea or a bad idea. Is income inequality something that we ought to worry about or is it just ramifications of a free market system in which people make voluntary transactions happen? It's that these would be interesting conversations, but we, we just don't get to them.

Speaker 1:          00:17:48       Right. So the real of ideas

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       though, be if it was sanders and had rand Paul not dropped that, you know, my, my problem with Rand Paul was always on foreign policy. I'm not an isolationist and so ran sort of is, but it's. But yeah, I mean that, that it would be a battle of ideas that would be worthwhile.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Yeah. So the Republican Party in general, and I hear this a lot on the left, you know that it's this group of homophobes and racist and all this stuff and I've been fighting against this. I've been fighting from the liberal side against the regressive left. What I, you know, the people that are on the far left to me and I saw something interesting that you retweeted it and remind me who said this, but somebody made a point of saying that this morning Nikki Haley and an Indian American is a and Tim Scott and African American have both endorsed Marco Rubio who is Latin. These are all Republicans. So in Indian, a black person and a Latino and these are Republicans and Tim Scott is a black Republican from the south. Somehow that messaging doesn't really make it through, does it?

Speaker 3:          00:18:48       Well it doesn't because they're not real black people are real Latino's or real forerunner of, of, of foreign extraction. I mean, Nikki Haley was born here, but her parents are from India. The, that never

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       the point. Isn't that the point of America?

Speaker 3:          00:18:59       That's what I would think. Right? But we, we've, we've broken down into this identity politics that really is quite sad and traps people in, in a group identity rather than you're an individual go out and make something of yourself. Go out and do something, and this is a message that it's not popular in, in certain quarters. When you say to people, look, your life is in your own hands. There's a lot of responsibility that comes with that, which is you don't get to blame society for your problems. This is why the. I think that the Bernie Sanders argument, the Hillary Clinton argument is wrong. You know, Bernie Sanders, he's ever, ever other tweet from Bernie Sanders is something like we live in a world where there's, where there's massive income inequality and we need to do something about that. And I think to myself, well, that's called a world of reality. I mean, every society in history has had income inequality, including communist ones. And you're not showing me a villain, right? You're saying reality is bad. Blame Society for all the problems. Show me an actual villain and I'm happy to fight them. Show me some, some ghost villain. And I can't fight goes, I just can't.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       Right. So when you hear that stuff though, do you acknowledge at some level that there's some level of crony capitalism that keeps making the big companies bigger and crushing all of the small companies and I still think he's striking to that point, but I guess he's not doing it in a really direct.

Speaker 3:          00:20:10       Right? If you were attacking crony capitalism, he and the tea party on the same page. The problem with with the occupy Wall Street movement, which was supposedly ripping crony capitalism, is they were saying crony capitalism is bad. Therefore the government should pick more companies to help or it should nationalized companies outright, which is not the solution, right? If you used a crony capitalism is capitalism is bad. First of all, I don't like the term crony capitalism because it's not capitalism. It's corporatism, right? Capitalism is not being. Being a, a person who operates in business does not make you a capitalist business. People take loans and subsidies from the government all the time. That's right. Capitalist thing to do. Right? So it's, it's a, it's a self interested thing to do, but self interest in capitalism are not identical. Yeah. If you wanted to actually fight crony capitalism, then cut off the tie between government and the private sector completely.

Speaker 3:          00:20:55       Which I would certainly prefer, and this is part of the Republican Party that I dislike. I think there's a certainly corporate trust side of the establishment, Republican Party that is very much in favor of government involvement in the economy and I don't like that in the slightest, but that's not Bernie's real critique if, if could, because if it were a full of free market system, if the government weren't reaching out to people, and by the way the government, if you're going to argue against crony capitalism, you also have to argue against government subsidized loans for people who can't afford them for houses, right? Which causes massive economic crashes, which Bernie apparently doesn't oppose. Redman. He would like more of those things. You would like all of us to subsidize bad. You know that folks, bad credit taking out loans. If you actually, if you got rid of all those things, if you got rid of government involvement, Bernie Sanders would still think that something was wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:21:42       If Bill Gates is earning a lot of money and somebody the bottom is earning none, he see somebody in a room with $5 in somebody with one and he immediately says the guy with $5 must've stolen something from the guy with $1. Whereas I say, I have no evidence of that until you show me that evidence may be the guy with $5 produced more than the guy with $1. So I'll follow you up that line of thinking. So then we're, where do we get to a point where it seems like to me at some level there should be some sort of progressive tax. It shouldn't be necessarily. You know, when they talked about the one percent, the studies were sort of all over the place, but it sounds like if you were in about 400 grand a year, you're in, you're in the one percent. I'm not in the one percent I am.

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       You're in the one percent. I agree. All right, well good. I bet it took me a long time. They got some money. No, that's why I'm in the one percent present that had to take care of their money, but okay. So either way I'm proud of that fact. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna. Act like everybody asks ashamed about how much money they earn in this country. I think this is the only thing that's charming about Donald Trump is that I think that you should be proud of how much money you earned in this country because if you worked to get there, I mean I spent a lot of money to go to law school and then I spent a lot of times slogging in the trenches and now I make a really good living and I work a lot of hours to make that really good living and my wife, you know, we had to pay her entire medical education out of pocket and she's gonna be a doctor and she's going to make a really good living.

Speaker 3:          00:22:52       Good for her. Good for me. Good for good. For anybody who earns a living in this country. That's it. That's it. That's a good thing, but as far as the progressive tax, no, I think the progressive tax, a bunch of crap. I think I know. What about at some point, so you get to $10,000,000 a year that it could be progressively, you know, you just don't believe in that. No, because I don't see why you deserve a bigger percentage of my money because I make more money. The all taxes are is a is a gangster shakedown and so when, when and that's all they are. And so we can all agree that some gangster shakedowns are worthwhile because we have to pay for police, but the idea that here's the problem with any sort of progressive tax. There are three, and this is just the general problem with progressive taxation.

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       You have three people in a room, two of them are not bill gates in. One of them is they vote two to one, that they should take half of Bill Gates as well. Okay. This is a simplified version of American politics. Yeah. Here's my basic rule for all legislation and all taxation. If you pass this law, are you willing to shoot the person who disobeys because that's what the government is. The government is just a big shooting people machine, right? That's what the government does. The install in, whether you're talking national defense or the police, there's certain laws or you pass them and you say, if you just obey this law and if you resist me with a gun, I'm willing to shoot you. So what laws are you willing to shoot somebody over? This seems to be a pretty good measure of am I? Well, so for example, so for taxation. Yes. So the question is, are you willing to shoot people who don't pay taxes? If those taxes go for the national defense, the Ta that protects us all. The answer is yes. Because if nobody pays that tax, then presumably everybody dies in some sort of terrorist attack. But if you're going to ask me, you know, are you willing to pay a progressive tax for whatever stupid government bowl they're pushing today? And am I willing to shoot somebody over that? No, I think the purpose of the tax is just as important as the percentage.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       So is that really the problem that we have no idea at this point where our money goes? Absolutely. We just don't. Even now I'm hearing, you know, Bernie will say I'm ready. You know, he talked to that guy at the town hall and the Guy said, I earned $41,000 a year in Bernie admitted your taxes will go up, and then he explains, well, the health costs are going to go down or whatever. That may or may not make no sense. He says, I'm going to tax you $5,000. You're going to get $10,000 back in medical service. What magic, what magical box did you make that happen and is there. Are there doctors in the back room there? When he said that, I was thinking, well, if you're healthy, if the government that say I wish left to solutions work because they're the easiest solutions in the world, right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       It's a recession tax. Everybody at 100 percent redistribute the wealth in tomb days. The recessions over there, they're crap by the way. They're also a moral, you know, the left, the left talks about these things as though it's moral, it's not moral to steal other people's wealth just because you're poorer than they are. All right, so let's dive in to the left. So as I told you before we started and I hinted at here, so I came from the progressive world. I've been, I now view being progressive basically as a mental disorder or something, but I consider myself classic liberal, which really, really is conservative in a lot of respects. It's libertarian essentially. Yeah. It's technically defined. It's conservative or libertarian as I'm somewhere in there. Um, and it seems to me that the Republicans, if they would stick with what are supposed to be there principles that you were talking about, they would have a much better argument than what they have right now. And that they don't stick to their argument. That's part of the problem. Well, I think that what's happened is

Speaker 3:          00:26:03       government has gotten larger. It turns into this giant grab bag of cash. And so what you have is a bunch of constituencies in the United States who are dependent on these. Grab bags of cash. I remember I was, I was down in Palm Beach, Florida for a, for conferences, must've been five years ago. And uh, and Linda lingle who was then running for Senate in Hawaii, uh, was former governor of why Republican, she was, she was speaking at a, at a synagogue and I was there and this little old lady, Palm Beach, a very rich area, this little old lady titles up to her Pearl Necklace, diamond earrings, and she walks up and says, what will you do to keep them from cutting my social security? And I thought to myself, who are you like you paid $50 into social security when you were 35 and you're probably getting out $3,000 a month now.

Speaker 3:          00:26:42       But because people have been made that promise, they're now dependent on the government. So what do Republicans do? Republicans say, no, no, no. I would never do away with social security, right? We would transition it or we would save it. Once you get into the business of the government takes care of you and your old age. Now we're just arguing over methodology. We're not arguing over morality. My view is that people have been made promises. We have to keep those promises because otherwise we just have too many people who have no source of income. You make a promise, you keep a promise, but if you are under a particular age, no social security at all. Take. I want my money back. Okay. I'm getting 15 percent of my salary taken every year to be put in a fund that I will never see again. Again, I have. I have one child and I have another one on the way. I would much prefer to put that in a Sep Ira and just let that grow with the stock market. By the way, you want stock market, the boom, take all the money out of social security and put it into companies on the stock market. You want to see an actual economic growth curve that would do it as opposed to pretending that it's in a lock box somewhere that doesn't exist when they're just rating it every two days for

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       the lockbox never existed. Never. Gore said he had the lockbox. There was nobody. There was no lock box. It's, it's a Ponzi scheme. All right, so to the left though, because I'm with you, I'm with you on that, that they're not. They're sort of just not holding to their principles. So what I've seen in the left is that most people went from being liberal and then somehow over the last couple of years they've become these social justice warriors and they've divided everybody by what all our differences, our skin color and religion and all that, and they've picked a pecking order of who's the most aggrieved and that the victim is hierarchy, the victim hierarchy. And because of this, uh, it seems to me that it's just, there's no end to it, that that's what scares me the most about the ideology is there simply is no end game with it because ultimately it has to eat itself because then one day you'll fight for everybody else and then they'll come around and they'll come back.

Speaker 3:          00:28:26       I mean, is what's happening on college campuses. College campuses are about as left as it's possible to be, except that the leftists are now eating their own right. They're going to the administrators and saying, you're all microaggressing us and we need trigger warnings and it's white privilege, and they're ousting people who who were protesting in these buildings 40 years ago on the left, and they're. They're getting them fired now. I mean, Larry Lawrence Summers was, was Clinton Secretary of the treasury. I was at Harvard when they throw them out, right, and they throw him out because he made the politically incorrect statement that maybe there weren't that many women in the high reaches of science because women didn't want to be in the higher reaches of science or it's possible there weren't enough women who are qualified for that and they throw him out for that. I mean, the.

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       What's happened I think, is that we've reached a point where the wealthiest society in the history of the world, the people here are the wealthiest that any people have ever been, and we've also forgotten that there's a. If there's any sort of ideological existential threat. I was four when the Soviet Union collapsed, so people my age and younger don't remember the Soviet Union. They don't. They don't recall it. It's not important to their lives and when they think of socialism, they think of kind of the happy dappy socialism of Denmark. They never look at the tax rates, but they think, okay, everything is going okay in Denmark. They forget, forget the fact that we've paid for Denmark's national security for the last half century. Forget the fact that they're now having to cut their taxes. Forget the fact they just elected a government to keep out the Islamic wave that's now swamping and all those things go by the wayside.

Speaker 3:          00:29:46       So what happens is that all these people kind of live off the fat of the land we all do and then rip away at the foundations because when you're living in such a rich society and you look at, for example, income inequality and you said there's some people who are earning millions of dollars and there are some people who are earning tens of thousands of dollars. What we forget is that in human history and in human society, the difference there, there's literally millions of dollars and tens and tens of thousands of dollars and then there's where people have been historically which is here, right? And when you rip away the foundation's, everybody's going to end up down here. You can't just take all of the founding principles of small government and free markets and rip them away. But what's happened is when young people are always looking for a reason to fight, I mean we, we want to change the world.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       That's our thing. Changing the world. One of the world's pretty good. What do you change? We've basically changed a lot of the external circumstances and now the question is, you're rich. You live a pretty free life, right? So what's wrong? Only what I feel is wrong, what's in here is what's wrong, and so it's become very feelings based society. Anything that said to me that hurts my feelings is now no longer just something hurtful. It's a microaggression, right? And I can actually reach out and I can harm you. I can. I can ban you. I can call the police if you hurt my feelings at University of Missouri. There was actually when, when this whole thing was going down, there was there, the University of Missouri Police Department put out a notice. If somebody says something to you that's racist, call the police department, right? Seventy percent. There was a poll that just came out that 70 percent of college students are comfortable with hate speech codes on campus. Forty percent of college, student of millennials, people aged 18 to 34, 40 percent of them believe that speech that's offensive to women or minorities should be banned in the United States across.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       So some of this though that young people are just kind of dumb, like the world is going to teach you some stuff and when you're at college you're going to be kind of dumb. I had a guest on a couple of weeks ago, Michael Shermer, who said that they're all this microaggression stuff and all of this free speech, as horrible as it sounds to us, right? He sort of was arguing that in a way you could say, this shows the progress because instead of having to fight for actual things, they're fighting for these feelings and not that he was for. That shows you that we've progressed and that you know that black people aren't fighting so that they have separate water fountains. They are now fighting over things that may, that are just about feelings and that's obviously

Speaker 3:          00:31:58       awesome and you're right. It's testament to the progress, but I mean ted, to golf, what you were saying, 50 years ago, black people were fighting to not have separate water fountains and today they're fighting to have separate water fountains, right? I mean they actually want separate black housing at USC. They actually wanted a separate black safe space at University of Missouri. This is dangerous stuff and what's more dangerous is an entire political hierarchy. The benefits from this because now you've got candidates who benefit by telling particular interest groups and racial groups. You're a victim. We're going to help you out. The way we are going to help you out is by specifically calling the rest of the society racist. You're a victim forever and the longer we can make you feel like you're a victim, the more you're dependent on us. Right? Well, what? We'll just go. I mean, Hillary Clinton was doing this in in Harlem the other day. She was saying, yeah, we haven't cured racism in the country and that's why I'm going to take hundreds of millions of dollars poured into Harlem is though nobody's poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Harlem before the only dollars into Harlem that are actually going to matter are police dollars to clean up high crime areas so that investors will go in and the reason that businesses aren't going into high crime areas is because they're high crime areas and just dumping money in there and get help.

Speaker 1:          00:32:59       So you would agree that racism exists. Of course there are people that are legitimate reasons.

Speaker 3:          00:33:05       It would be idiotic to think otherwise. Of course there are legitimate racist and we should target them and we should find them and we should hurt their careers because racism is unacceptable. But what I don't agree with is this. I don't like fighting phantoms. As I said earlier. Institutional racism is a meaningless phrase. Libraries are not racist. Schools are not racist. You have to show me a law, a policy, a person who is racist. You can't just say American society is racist because that doesn't mean anything. Show me the actual problem that we can discuss because when you just throw tautologies out there like that, what am I supposed to do? I mean there's no way to fight that. There's legitimately no way to fight it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:38       That's right. So I discussed that with Larry elder who's conservative, but on the, on the libertarian side, and he basically said what you just said, and I think some of my progressive friends would say, well, it may not be institutional anymore and that there are laws that existed, no longer exists, but they would say, well, a certain communities will get less because of racism just because of the idea of racism will get less qualified people to teach and that they will be treated differently by the police and all of that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       Well, by by income level, that's true, but it's true. By income level, it's not a race and income level tend to correlate. Unfortunately, but that's, but that's, that's more to do with income level than it has to do with race. It's not like there's somebody sitting in Sacramento today in California growing up black community. We're not putting anybody in there. I mean the real, the real gap in the country, especially between rich and poor is two parent households, not race. I mean the poverty rate in the black community for two parent households is seven percent. The poverty rate in the white community for, for a single parent household is 22 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:34:32       So Larry said that to middle, so that same thing and he got a lot of hate for it and then I got lumped into the because people. So I'll just go with you on that for, for the purposes just so I'll trust that you're giving me a fair statistics statistics. So fair enough, but that, that enrages people. There's something about that concept I think that really upsets people and you would say that that's really because of the feeling.

Speaker 3:          00:34:54       Well, yeah, this is my catchphrase goes facts don't care about your feelings. I mean there were. The reality is, yeah, exactly. This is as, as we move forward and American society, the only thing that's going to cure the ills that we have is looking at some of the real problems straight in the face. I mean, the fact is that when welfare was instituted in the sixties before it was instituted, the black single motherhood rate was 20 percent. That is now in excess of 70 percent and it's not just. It's not just impacting the black community. It's impacting the white community. Right? The white community used to have a five percent single motherhood. Right now it's in excess of 40 percent. The fact is you are going to get higher crime, you're going to get more poverty. It's the Brookings Institute, which is a left institute, right? I mean, so it's a liberal institute at the Brookings Institute and they kind of straddle that line between liberal left.

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       They say that if you don't want to be permanently poor in the United States, you need to do three things and three things. Only graduate high school, get a job in hold it. Don't have a baby before you're married. That's it. And by the way, those things have nothing to do with racism, right? There's not a white person there. Let's. They're very fee. I would be hard pressed to find a black person in America, almost straw man yourself there, right? I, I'd be hard pressed to. Maybe there's one. Maybe there's one. I don't know how many single black single mothers got pregnant because a white man was holding a gun to a black man's head and said, I want you to impregnate this person. Then leave. Okay. Be Single. Motherhood is a decision that's made by the people who are involved in the sexual act and what happens afterward. And it's the single best predictor of, of gender, intergenerational poverty. So make good decisions.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       So, so is really the issue that when the left doesn't deal with these things, honestly, that then they're just handing it to the right. I mean, I see this, we've been talking about this a lot related to all this stuff with Islam, Islam that because the left calls everyone a racist. So anytime me or any of my friends that are talking about this, there's not many of us on the left. Every time we bring it up, I mean I'm getting called a big left and right and now and yet they can't say, well, can you point to something bigoted I've said or something racist and they can't, but it's a feeling. Feel offended. They feel offended. But is this where if the left doesn't deal with something? So you know, you can talk about Islam is or if the deaf, if the left doesn't deal with the roots of income inequality as you've laid out that you just hand it to the far right ultimately, right? I mean, doesn't this sort of explained trump to you?

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Well, to, to a certain extent, I think that that's right. I think that what happens is that there is a, in A. I would never justify people reacting and racist fashion because you know, you can react in a reasonable fashion to stupidity. People say silly things like single motherhood doesn't matter. And I say no single motherhood absolutely does matter, but what people tend to what some, a certain segment of the population, and this is true both on the left and the right, is when they, when, when somebody says something they don't like, they immediately go to racism. I mean, I can't tell you the number of tweets I have received after, after I said that I don't like Donald Trump. That's when the antisemites come out of the woodwork and it's in. It's bizarre to me. Like it's, it's like what is, what is my Jewishness have to do with not liking trump?

Speaker 3:          00:37:40       And as far as I'm aware of his daughters natural convert to Judaism. So it's, it's, it's weird, but it's. But um, yeah, and I think that it's, it's polarizing the debate in a way that need not. We're not, we're not trying to solve problems anymore in American politics. I'll, we're trying to do is demonize the other side and turn them into the bad guy. And so my goal is to demonize the people who try to demonize, right? The, the, those are the people who ought to be demonized. If, if your goal in politics is to make character attacks without regard to facts, then I'm not interested in, in debating you on on facts because you're clearly not interested in debating on fact.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       Yeah, so that's a. that's a good segue because I read your 11 rules for debating leftists and I just read. I read the entire thing this morning. Okay. That's pretty good. It's pretty short, but it's on my mind and basically everything you said. I was struggling when I was reading because I was like, oh, I'm agreeing with all of this because I still consider myself liberal and there is a part of me that I don't want to read something by a guy that's conservative and go, I agree with this stuff, but a lot of what I saw in there are the exact tactics that I've seen this regressive left use on me and use on Sam Harris and all these other relentlessly. So you really gave the antidote to some of these things so you don't have to lay out all 11, but you want to pick some highlights because I think there's some really.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       Yeah, I mean a lot of them kind of turn into, okay, so I'm trying to remember all 11 off the top of my head or at least give me a couple. So. So the. The first one is that you have to embrace the fight. You have to understand going in that you're in a fight, usually any you have to sort of determine the purpose of the conversation that you're having is just base and this is true if you're left or right, actually determine what your goal is. Is your goal to convince the person on the other side, is the person open to being convinced? If not, you're wasting your time. Are you on a show and there's an audience, in which case you're not speaking to the person you're speaking to the audience, and once you determine that, understand that, that if there's hostility, you have to be ready to punch back twice as hard. You have to and be preemptive in that attack,

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       which by the way you say that's a left idea.

Speaker 3:          00:39:31       These are all left ideas. These punch back twice as hard. I mean, it was President Obama who coined the phrase, right. He was the one who was saying that his supporters Audit Punch back twice as hard and I've sort of hijack dad because I think that it's actually an effective tactic and necessary. I've also said that one of that is important at the very outset to ensure that the framing of questions is proper because one of the ways that the left is succeeds and you see it in the Republican debates particularly is they'll ask a question and then the Republicans won't even bother to try reframing what the question is. So John Dickerson, the other night and in the CBS debate, he opens up with any tries to brow beat Ted Cruz on. You say that nobody should be confirmed in the last year of a presidents have a presidents run. Isn't it true that the constitution says the president gets to pick the nominee and Cruz instead of just saying, John, I don't care about the timeline.

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       I don't know what you're talking about. We're not going to confirm anybody who doesn't agree with Scalia. Right? Instead of just saying that, and it's not our obligation to do that, the constitution has many provisions. John, you know, instead of just reframing the question, he sort of bought into it and you and you see that from a lot of these, from a lot of Republicans, they just accept the question as it comes to them rather than thinking there's, there's a second question that's usually kind of embedded in the first question that's being asked in most in most debate. So those are a couple examples. There's also, you don't have to accept the, uh, you don't have to accept the kind of hero worship the that so many Republicans do. One of the frequent ones that you do is somebody will say, well, Ronald Reagan was for amnesty.

Speaker 3:          00:40:55       Why do I care? I was, I was too. When, when, when you did amnesty and what it will look like. You want to talk about regular or limb. When people try to misdirect to Bush, you know, they don't, like you were saying something about Obama. So they say something about Bush. So a proper answer should be FDR, Woodrow Wilson, William Howard Taft. Like, well, you want to talk about Bush, we'll talk about Bush Obama, we'll talk about Obama, like let's stick to the topic at hand. So a lot of my basic rules for debate can basically be boiled down to two, two, which is get the character assassination off the table if they were going to call you a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe. The proper response is not, no, I'm not a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe. Here's all the proof that I'm, it's no, you're a jackass because you have no proof of calling me that and accusing people of things without evidence is the mark of being a jackass. Right? And that's that. That is the proper response. And then once that's all off the table, then we can actually have a policy argument.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       So what do you do about people that don't stop doing that? I, I had some leave and I just let it be.

Speaker 3:          00:41:50       You leave. I mean you say this is not a worthwhile debate. You're an asshole and I'm leaving. There's, there's no, there's no purpose to it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:57       Think not picking up the fight. And this would be whether you're on the left or the right, whatever, whatever fight you're in that sometimes by not picking up the fight, you actually are strengthening them.

Speaker 3:          00:42:06       No, I mean, because I think you're strengthening here. Here's the logic, right? If somebody calls me a racist and you say, no, no, no, let me explain to you why I'm not a racist. You what you're really saying, what you're really saying is you're irrational fellow. Let's have a conversation about why I'm not a racist by even granting the predicate, your rational fellow, he just called you a racist, right? If you say to me, I'm a racist, and then I say, well, you're a rational thought. Well, I'm saying to you, you're right. I'm a racist. You're rational fellow calling me a racist. A rational person could theoretically think I'm a racist. No, the answer is that's an irrational thought. You're being irrational. What you're saying is, is ridiculous, and you're a bad person for dropping charges on me without evidence. Only bad people do this, right? If you're going to drop a charge, make sure he can back it up.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       Well, that's the thing, I find that there's an incredible lack of being able to back it up and there's a constant, I don't know that you address this specifically, but I find it a lot of these debates when I had these debates with people, there's a constant moving of the goal post, so you say something and you sort of get the point across and they they can even if they don't outwardly accept that it is being intellectually do and then they just move what they say and then they just keep moving and moving it and then you're, you know, you're back in Sir Circle.

Speaker 3:          00:43:11       I do say in that pamphlet that arguing with people on the left is sort of like trying to nail Jello to the wall. The minute, the minute that you finished one argument, they're already onto the next and they're usually swiveling to places the demo comfortable like same sex marriage or social issues because that, that, those are, those are issues closer to the heart so they're, they're more comfortable for them to argue. And so if you're arguing economics, invariably you find yourself talking about why Republicans are mean to gay people or something. It's always a shifting goalposts because you can't get an if they. If the left. This is what I like about sanders. I think sanders will actually give honest answers to questions. If I say to Bernie Sanders, Bernie, what constitutes income equality? Forgetting income inequality? Like what gradation would it be? Income equality. Does everybody have to earn the same?

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       Because there's a name for that, right? I mean if everybody earns the same, the only way to do that is to confiscate all wealth and redistribute it. That's called Communism, right? I think that sanders would, would actually answer that, but most people on the left won't. They'll just move the goal posts. And what do you think you would actually say? I think that would, he would probably say is you would say the sort of income inequality that we see in Europe is, is, is more beneficial to the, to the United States. And you say, well, okay, that requires a 60 percent tax rate. It means that the car, literally the prices of your car will double because they have massive excise taxes over in Denmark and you know if, if that's something that you want to do, you're also going to have to raise taxes on the poor, raised taxes on the middle class.

Speaker 3:          00:44:28       You're going to have to gauge the fact that every in America is going to leave, which is not going to be pleasant for you. Are you willing to. Are you willing to build? Here's the thing about Bernie Sanders, his economic policy. Donald trump wants to build a wall to keep people out. Bernie Sanders will have to build a wall to keep businesses in because they will leave. They actually have to chain them to a stake in order to keep them here. All right, so we've talked about a lot of stuff that we sort of agree on. I haven't agreed with everything, but I'm letting you talk. People always yell at me. They say, you don't. You don't yell back at your, well let's, let's do it. Let's do this by. So let's, let's get into some other stuff. So the gay marriage, let's talk to a marriage or you're not big on gay marriage?

Speaker 3:          00:45:01       No, I'm not at a. not on a social level. I think the government ought to be completely out of the business of marriage. I think the government sucks at everything is my. Is My short message for today. The government is terrible at everything. If the government's goal is to forward traditional marriage, utterly failed obviously. As you don't mind to being out of the business of traditional marriage at all. No, I think that. I think the government should be out of all marriage. I think the government stinks at this, you know, now I will say that. Do I think that the. I think the idea of the government subsidizing gay marriage is silly because I don't think that there's societal benefit to gay marriage. If you're going to make the argument that government should be involved in marriage at all, just not even an argument with which I agree at this point the way it is right now.

Speaker 3:          00:45:38       Let's go from that. Okay. So before I get there, one quick point. The reason I want the government out of the business of marriage is because now that the government has enshrined gay marriage, the next step is going to be going to religious people and telling them they have to engage with same sex weddings. So as a religious person, this is problematic to me. I want a society in which I can do what I want and I don't have to care what you think and you can do what you want and you don't have to cover it. I think it doesn't mean you get to come into my synagogue and get married. It also doesn't mean that I have to go to your gay wedding. That's an interesting place to have the discussion because I would argue for gay marriage for the exact reasons. I don't want the government involved in all of these things.

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       Right, and that's exactly why gay marriage should exist and I think it ran Paul. It hit that point harder. It would have made a sensible libertarian argument of limited government and you know what, dude? Go ahead and you want to smoke weed on you and your bright. Well, I tend to agree with both of those things. I agree with, and by the way, I find people who smoke weed, unbelievably irritating, but that's not my business. I mean, this is the beauty of America is you don't have to give a crap what I think we said this is what you end the show by taking the bong hit. Oh yeah. Well that's going to be awkward then. But, but the uh, the, the uh, as far as the secondary argument about let's, let's take the predicate that government is now involved in marriage. Should government subsidized gay marriage and straight marriage the same way?

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       My answer is no, because the only purpose for the government getting involved in marriage is the procreation of the next generation and the raising of that generation. And it's my belief that a man and a woman to a better job of raising a child and producing children, obviously biologically than two men or two women. What is it isn't the child. Part of it is sort of secondary. I mean, there are plenty of people that get married, gay couples and straight couples that don't have kids. There's a siren in and of itself is in just about, but at a governmental level, I don't care about those people are meaning like I care that I'm happy that they're happy, but I don't, I don't really care what they do. Like it didn't, it doesn't. The government theoretically has an interest in the production of the next generation, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:25       That's the only interest in marriage. So in fact, you could even make a case to government ought to be giving, you know, basically tax benefits for, for having kids, um, and no benefit for marriage, right? But, but the truth is, the reason that this was created in the first place obviously is because before the advent of, I mean, long before the advent of modern birth control, the, the fair assumption was that if you were having sex, then you are going to get pregnant, right? At least if you were having straight sex, you're going to have pregnant, you were going to get pregnant. And thus we wanted to incentivize people to stick around for that because single motherhood is bad for the community. And so we're going to subsidize that with tax benefits. By the way, there is no, there is no marriage benefit. There's a marriage penalty.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       My wife and I pay a significantly higher tax rate because we have a combined income. Right? So you're not against still despite coming from some sort of. It's not a religious art, religious art. That's what I want to distinguish because of court, because we should be for a separation of church and state. And I think you are for separation truths. So the separation of church and state means that I just want to make a quick distinction or separation of church and state doesn't mean that I can't bring my religious values to bear and how I vote. It just means that I can't leverage Jewish ritual on you. There's no establishment of Jewish religion, Christian religion. But I should be able to make a secular argument for why what I'm saying is right is my general rule because otherwise we're operating in different spheres. If I cite the Bible, it makes no difference to you.

Speaker 3:          00:48:43       You don't care about the Bible. So. Right. So I'm, I'm a secular Jew. I would consider, I mean I'm an atheist so it doesn't. Judaism is ethnic and irrelevant every other respect. I like her. You like her? Who Curb your enthusiasm? Oh, well, hey, I mean that's cultural Judaism like bagels and Matzah balls and I don't care, you know, I feel pretty good it. Okay. Okay, so let's not get hung up with that, but you're making the distinction between. This isn't coming from a religious place now. I think part of the problem when it comes to gay marriage is that a huge portion of the Christian right is trying to impose their religious values on this. So it itself isn't religious, but the Po know the rationale for the policy can. This is one where I'm making the distinction. The rationale for people voting can still be religious, but if the policy is not religious, if there's a secular rationality is what Scalia said about it actually, if there's a secular rationale to it than the motivations of the voters don't matter.

Speaker 3:          00:49:32       Like I don't care what the motivation of the voter is in virtually any circumstance, I matter what the vote is. Right? And if somebody wants to vote for lower taxes, I don't care whether they're doing it because they're on principle for lower taxes or whether they personally want lower taxes on their income. I just care about the outcome of the vote, the outcome with a boat. Okay. So basically you don't care about gay marriage as the contract ends right now, you simply don't care. You're one concern though, is that ultimately this will lead to the government forcing gay marriage on synagogues that don't want to have it, or mosques that don't want to. Not Ultimately. Like now in California, they've already passed laws that you have to teach. Same sex marriage in public schools for example. Like it changes the nature of the teaching. My view on that is, I don't know why the.

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       I went to public school for elementary and junior high. I don't understand why the government is teaching me anything about this stuff. This is for my parents to teach me like this. This is a values thing. So I guess that's sort of where it's just values just get completed with what we're taught like well as sort of a to know. I mean there are no values to math right there no valid Matthew Bright, but there are no values to biology there. Their, their values to history, which is why it's dicey and it's. And it's disingenuous what the left has done with the education system. There are multiple perspectives on history and the monopolistic takeover of the liberal arts is a real problem and you can have multiple perspectives on that. But we're not teaching marriage in the context of history or English. We're teaching in the context of science which has nothing to do with anything.

Speaker 3:          00:50:51       So when again, you a PC comes in. I mean when I was, when, when they're doing sex ed, when I was in junior high, they're making a big deal out of the idea that everybody, you know, everybody is equally likely due to get aids for example. Not True. I mean it's just not true, but it aids is a behavioral driven disease or if you don't, I will never get aids. Right. Barring a barring a blood transfusion that that has aids, I don't, I don't do an intravenous drugs and I don't have promiscuous sex and I was a virgin when I married my wife and she was a virgin when she married me. So we're, so we're, we're safe, right? We're, we're, we're good. We're about to save as you can get on this and so. So I don't like the, the again, the facts being trumped by what we wished the facts were so that we can push certain political agendas.

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       Right. So how do you then taking this argument from a secular place? How do you then feel being in the same party that have so many people that are taking it from a right wing Christian place? Because there isn't there. There's a seemingly odd alliance there that I think is a.

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       I agree with them on the end point. I even agree with them religiously. I just don't think they're good spokespeople for their cars. I mean, I think that if you, if you, if you are, if you're a chief citation to your opposition to gay marriage, is leviticus 18, 22? I don't think that that's a solid argument that's going to convince a lot of people. Right? Uh, I think that, you know, there are better arguments against gay marriage than that. Right? Um, and so, you know, this is something I talk about at religious schools and I've been asked by pastors and rabbis and priests to talk to students about, okay, you have these religious principles. Is there any justification outside of the Bible says, so for why this is correct. And as a religious person who actually thought through his positions, I tend to believe there is, like I see it as a religious person. I believe that God didn't create stupid rules. So if you believe that God didn't create stupid rules, then you have to come up with some sort of justification for the rules that are being expressed. Like there's something you can understand that just an article of faith, but, but the, the, the big ones about human behavior, there should be a decent rationale. You can explain to people who don't buy into revelation.

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       Sure. So there I would just say, well, you're basing your belief in God. It's just a belief, not anything that can be proven, so relative. So no, no, no, but anyone that's basing anything on religion is just based on some unproven thing that is, I would say I want that nothing to do with my life

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       that which is, which is fine and that's why we live in America. Good. Yeah, but, but, but I will say this, every belief system is based on something unproven. All of them. Human rights means nothing. Where do you get that? Your basis of human rights

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       from a feeling. How about that? Exactly. I just get you to subjective. Well, right. But that's a, that's a blend. So you're saying basically where the liberals would say, I'm for this because I'm for gay people. I want gay people to be able to do what want to do and

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       pursue happiness. Like anyone else you would say, well this has nothing to do with government and whatever. So I can't. There's not a lot of. Not a lot of conflict here. Yeah. My governmental policy, because I'm basically a libertarian is, is I don't care about that. Again, the government, what do we strengthen that group of people so clearly we don't agree quite agree on this thing, but I understand your rationale and you're not trying to stop gay people from getting married. I think right now, I think right now the next conflict is not going to come from the right. It's going to come from the left pushing the ball, meaning that it's going to come from the case in Oregon with this Baker who, who, you know, doesn't want to service a same sex wedding, doesn't want to actually have to cater it. Uh, as uh, you know, I think that good hearted people should say, fine, you do what you want.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       Go across the street to the bakery. Like, okay, that's what I would say. And this is the difference, you know, liberal and leftist in a nutshell, this is the difference between liberal and leftist. Liberal says your business, I don't care. I left. It says, no, no, no, no. I think it's imperative that you will be made to care. Right? And Erik Erickson's phrase, you'll be made to care. Somebody is going to, a man will come to your house with a gun and he will tell you that if you do not cater this wedding, this is what they were forced by a hundred $75,000, fine for not catering, lesbian wedding or there's a bakery across the street, you know this is, this is really an a farrier stuff, so this is where you're asking where the momentum comes from. This is where the momentum comes from. So when I make an argument to conservatives and religious people that the government ought to get out of the business and marriage.

Speaker 3:          00:54:47       I'm not saying that because I'm pro gay marriage, very much anti gay marriage in the social sense. I don't think that that, you know, as as a religious person, I think homosexuality is a sin. I think lots of things are sentenced that people engage in. I think they should be free to engage in them, but as a religious person, that's not. That's not my thing. I don't think that gay marriage is a great, massively good thing for society on a social level, but on a governmental level, if you guys don't just get out of this business entirely, the left has no end point. They're only endpoint is using the government as a club against you. So now that they've got gay marriage, it will go to, it will go to. We're going to stop accrediting schools that don't teach gay marriage or higher homosexual employees.

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       Right? And you've got Catholic churches say, I don't want to pay the health benefits of somebody gay partner that's a Catholic church. Why should it have to write? But the left would say, no, they have to be. You will be made to care. This is why you're a bad person if you don't do this. And so if so, what am I arguments? The rightest sensible liberal. Right? Exactly. So this is. But, but this way you'd actually get heavy argument from the not so sensible liberals probably including all of the democratic nominees. The the fact is that what I'm saying is the best argument for the Libertarian position on the right here is gonna be a rear guard action. It's not going to be. It's better for straight people be in. It's bad for gay marriage to get it out of that realm. It's I think that if you want to fight against gay marriage, do it on the social level with your church, teach your kids what you want to teach them, but when it comes to, when it comes to making this argument to conservatives, the real argument is if you don't take power out of the hands of government, if you don't take that ring away from Gollum and throw it into mount zoom, then it will be used against you.

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       There will. The government is just government is the rate.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       So does this. I my direct message at the top of the show, I was talking about just how stupid our election system is and how everything's down to soundbites and everything in our debate is so nonsensical and all that. So everything you just laid out there is a much more clean and clear explanation and where you actually are separating church and state and doing the intellectual rigor to, to make a sensible argument where if they talk for the little bit that they've talked about gay marriage, which I'm glad because I don't think it should be talked about that much. It let it be and that that will be fine in my opinion. Um, but nobody, you know, Marco Rubio, we'll talk about the family, but he's purely doing it from a religious perspective.

Speaker 3:          00:56:56       Well, there's an identity politics that's been created on the right in response to the identity politics of the left. So if we're going to be attacked as religious people, we have to talk as religious people. I have to go preach from a pulpit and if I don't cite, you know, if I don't say genesis to talk about a man shall leave his, a man shall leave his parents and cling to his wife. If I don't. If I don't cite that, then I haven't spoken to the incode that shows that I care about the values of people. Like you and the, and this is the way the political game is played, so again, I sort of wished that Americans would see through the political game on all sides, meaning I wish religious people would just say, I agree. I understand you're anti gay marriage and I also understand what you're doing here to protect religious people and you don't have to cite Bible verses at me to prove it and it and you end up with idiocies like Donald Trump on stage waving around a bible, pretending he gives a damn what's in it, ms dot two after two marriages and several adulterous affairs and all the and bragging about having his experiences with married women standing up there with the Bible and going, this is an even better book than the out of the deal is if this is, this is how you vote.

Speaker 3:          00:57:53       If you're able to be pandered to that way, that's a sad commentary on American politics and in its way. It's really no different from Hillary Clinton going to the black community and saying, you're the victims. You're the victims, and now I'm going to speak the language. You understand? Here's, here's how you know that I care about you. I'm not big into caring, you know, I'm not, I, I think that people who presumed to care about you are generally people who want the power to control your life. The only people that, that I want power in their lives and they want power in my life or my immediate family. That's it. You know, my parents, my sisters, my wife, my children, and their independent human beings too. Right? So caring, caring is the, is the way that caring is the way that the left controls. Like they never, they don't come with the Jack boots first. They first come and they say, we care so much about you. We have to do these things for you. And by the way, we brought some guns to help out.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Right? So it shows sort of the beauty or the scariness of identity politics because it sounds really good. I guess what they always say, socialism will come with a big smile, right? Yeah, exactly. This is John Goldberg's point in Liberal Fascism. Yeah. Yeah. Um, all right, so we only have a couple minutes left, but let's do it. Let's just knock out a couple of other things. So I saw when you were on piers Morgan with that whole gun thing way back when and I watched it again in preparation for this and I never liked piers Morgan. I thought he was doing a talk. Show you the wrong way. I hope people don't view me in that way, but what you did with him in the argument was really kind of brilliant and it goes to, it goes to some of the 11th before. But before even ladies, anything, I don't really agree with your, with your stance on guns. Um, so can you sort of recap happened and then we'll show

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       her? Well, first of all, like trump, now that you've complimented me like gluten free person, now you're a good person. I read the, it's all good. So what, what happened in that debate is that piers Morgan had basically been doing a lot of the things we're talking about for weeks. You'd been saying after Sandy Hook that anybody who disagreed with him on gun control, the only possible reason to disagree with him is because you don't care about what happened on gun control and you saw Barack Obama do this, you know, after the, after the last mass shooting right after Umpqua community college and he got up there and, and he, he did the teary eyed routine and I don't like tears. Stop. Like just, just give me your policy. So what. So what I said to the tiers, I think design in a weird way. I don't.

Speaker 3:          01:00:02       It is tiring out over here. Bama, and I think Obama is an unusually skilled politician and I think he worked himself up to tears. I think that I think that good actors can. I think that, you know, the, the idea that the emotion is fake is that I don't think they motions fake, but the emotional factors isn't fake either. If you talked to actors who work themselves up to tears, they actually feel sad when they are crying. That's how you get yourself to cry. Right. I think Obama worked himself up there because otherwise you'd be fine. Otherwise you'd be crying every other press conference. I mean, he's talking about all sorts of crap that goes on in the country. That's terrible. Like how many. Every time he gets out there and you talked about the economy be crying. I mean, you'd be completely emotionally unstable.

Speaker 3:          01:00:36       It's one of the two. So it's. So, uh, so what I said to Piers Morgan is I said you're a bully and the way that you bullied people as you stand on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook to push her political agenda. And he didn't know how to come back from that because that was his entire strategy and now it had been unmasked. And actually during the break he had planned to bring in a kid who had been shot and was in a wheelchair and say, well, you've said it to me now. Say it to the small pool, a child. And he couldn't do it because if you've done that, I immediately would have said, first you stood on the graves of the kids and now you're standing on this poor guy's wheelchair. It's terrible. But it's so. So that was sort of the content of the argument he tried to. He tried to throw the. The Ronald Reagan was in favor of banning assault weapons at me. I don't care as I've said what Ronald Reagan had to say. He was a guy. Sometimes he's right. Sometimes he's wrong. So he wasn't a God. Is that? Yeah, exactly. That, that has a religious person. I only have one and got him. Yeah, exactly. So that's not the one we knew that I knew there was more. Right. It's just not Reagan. Reagan. Okay, got it. And I know, cause he's not back. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       He could be, he could be weird. But. So. So my feelings on the gun thing is that basically, because I believe in the second amendment, people should have access to guns. As you clear. It's clear after an hour together. I'm not a huge fan of the government, so I do believe people should be able to protect themselves and all of those things. What I think is that we're. We should be able to control it a little bit more than we are a. I think that the NRA does wield too much power and then I would say at the same time as I always say, two things can be true. At the same time. We have a massive mental health problem in this country and that's the part that we're not talking about because every commercial for every cable news channel is for some other drug that it turns out that some crazy percentage of these shooters are on.

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       Right? So when it comes to gun violence, there's two problems. There's an inner city violence which really is, is a matter of gang violence and and people shooting each other unfortunately because they're. Because they're involved in gangs and it's happening every day in Chicago, but we've never actually. And Los Angeles and Washington DC and all the major cities. I mean this is all the heavily gun controlled areas, democratic areas. These are the places where people are getting killed on mass and then you have the mass shooting issue and the mass shooting issue is largely because in the 19 sixties, in 19 seventies, this is the one area where I think the government actually should be involved in the 19 sixties in 19 seventies there was a decision that was made basically all across the country to empty out all the mental facilities because there was an idea that went around the country and gained a lot of traction.

Speaker 3:          01:02:52       That mental illness was basically one flew over the cuckoo's nest. Nobody was seriously crazy. Everybody was just eccentric and this is why you have a mass growth and homeless people. In 1960 there are. How many people do you think in 1960 were in mental institutions in the United States? I mean, I can't imagine. I would guess half a million or half a million. Half a million people. Right. And we had half the population. Then right? Today there's 25,000 people in mental facilities. So you've got a lot of violent people on the streets and so you have a lot of island people on the streets. You're going to end up with more mass shootings and that's why every time there's a mass shooting, almost invariably it's somebody who is crazy and we've known they're crazy and involuntary commitment laws are really, really difficult because you have to show that the person is a threat to themselves or others as opposed to the old standard which was they're incapable of caring for themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:03:35       One of the big problems with paranoid schizophrenia, which is flooded a lot of these shooters a is that you have the. You have a condition where you literally can't even recognize that you have the condition, so you won't take your drugs if we let you out and you'll just go off the drugs and you'll go right back to doing what it was that you were doing in the first week. And the drugs often is part of the people that are off the drugs and it's people that are on most of the. Most of the people who are committing these acts are not on heavy medication. Most of the people who are committing these acts are people who have gone off their medication and they have significant mental illness and they need to be medicated. So you know, this is an area where the, the mental health system is dramatically underfunded.

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       The laws are complete when it comes to people who legitimately cannot take care of themselves. I'm talking and I'm speaking as somebody whose grandfather was, was a schizophrenia who went into a mental hospital. They gave them lithium and then he spent the rest of his life as a happy, productive human being, right? The, these, these are things that might not have been possible now. And then. So this is, you know, this is an area where I, I actually think that there's, there, there is a role for the government in this because this is John Locke would have thought the same. John Locke said this in, in, in his writings, he said that, you know, the problem of mental illnesses. One that sort of falls on society as a whole because you have a group of people who can't take care of themselves. That's the real problem with mass shootings, you know, taking my guns away from me or taking another law abiding person's, gotten away from them, that's not going to stop the mass shooter.

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       Uh, in fact it's probably going to create more mass shootings because now I can't defend myself. So would you say the NRA is a problem at all in, in, within the thing, the NRA is incredibly valuable organization because it's pushing against people on the other side. I don't have to agree with everything the NRA says to think that they are an incredibly valuable organization that's channeling, uh, the, the, the, the legal hopes of a lot of Americans to protect the second amendment. And we're about one vote away on the Supreme Court from the Second Amendment disappearing entirely. So let's just do some stuff in that. That's how it, that's how we can add this. So with this whole thing with Scalia right now and this spot, where do you stand on this? It seems to me that Obama has to nominate someone that's his job. He's the president, he's the president right now.

Speaker 3:          01:05:31       He can, he doesn't have to, but, and if it was a republican, of course he was okay. And now that it's up and I don't care if he does, as you say, he has the capacity to do it. It's one of the things that he's actually allowed to do as president that he's doing as opposed to all the other things he's doing, which she's not allowed to do, but we've got to finish up so we have to focus on this one. So. All right, so we're in agreement on that. And then they say it will be up to the Senate to either confirm this person or not. They don't have to give him an up or down vote though, right? You can do whatever they want. So what do you make of, of the, you know, Mitch Mcconnell and the rest of these guys that are like, ah, you know, he shouldn't even nominate anybody and all that.

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       I think it's an idiotic line of argument. I mean, I think it's a really dumb line of argument was I wrote my, I went to Harvard law school and I wrote my third year paper at Harvard law school on the idea that Marbury versus Madison was wrongly decided. I don't think that the supreme court should have the capacity to decide for everyone, like for conservatives to think that the entire future of the constitution restaurants, skulled one guy not dying is really sad. Right? And, and, and the reason for that is because the supreme court has now been seen as this great moral arbiter. I don't think it is. I think that the supreme court has been responsible for some of the worst decision in, in human history. I mean, the supreme court is responsible for row, which is a disaster. The supreme court was responsible for plessy versus Ferguson.

Speaker 3:          01:06:38       Everybody always wants to talk about Brown versus board. If they'd gotten plessy right in the first place, you don't need brown versus board and segregation ends in 1900. So this is. So the, the supreme court is a, is a serious problem there. Nine unelected people, which I don't even care about the unelected, but their their nine people who are given the power to control everybody's life in the name of a document that most of them don't even take seriously. Is that the irony with the Supreme Court that they're supposed to be above partisan politics and yet the whole system to get them there is part of and then they're part of seeing themselves. I mean a lightening. Kagan is a hardcore Democrat. Elena Kagan was the solicitor general for, for Barack Obama. Come on, right? I mean I. I went to the. She was the dean when I was at Harvard law school.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       She was a hardcore leftist. Then you know the idea that people are free of politics and what they call legal realist. I believe that that means that virtually everybody is, is, has their perspective on life and that comes out in how they and how they adjudicate a and you have to work very hard to remove yourself from that. I think most judges don't. I think most judges rule based on what they feel like Anthony Kennedy, you can't tell them regardless what you think about same sex marriage. You cannot tell me that the constitution of the United States or the 14th amendment there too, which was ratified in 18, 68, was demanding that the state's not passed laws in favor of traditional marriage. That's absurd. It's absurd. No, but he but equal protection. He was using that or protection or that we should all be treated equally. It's a bunch of crap because equal protection does not mean that.

Speaker 3:          01:07:56       That, that everybody, that a law should have an equal effect on everyone. No law has an equal effect on everyone. The question is whether the law itself, whether the law itself discriminates against someone on the basis of an immutable characteristic, and one of the problems with, with the whole gays are blacks, is that gays are not black. I mean the fact is that a gay person who has sex with another man is not going to manifest their homosexuality in a way that society cares about. They may be gay, they may have sex addicts to shoot up a place. Well maybe, maybe he will. Maybe he won't. I mean, I assume that there, I assume that for the last couple of hundred, a couple of thousand years when gays were not treated well in Western society, that not all the scrutiny gay people were going and killing folks more capable than that.

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       I think that, you know, the, the gay people have the same selfcontrol the straight people do. I don't think there are any better. I don't think they're any worse in terms of their sexual self control. And I will say that I think men in general are less good in terms of sexual assault control than women's. So, which explains why, which is why gay men have sex with more people than, than straight men because women don't want to have sex with men as much as men. Wanna have sex with men have strong sex drive. So yeah, but that's well off topic. Back to the Scalia for a second. The the problem here is that the Republican Party, when they say things like, it's the timeline, it isn't the timeline, okay. If somebody replaces Justice Scalia who off the left and I don't care one, this is if hillary gets elected, if we're, if we're 20 years from now, one more vote on the Supreme Court and the left is on the court, do not see the constitution as a piece of law, right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:21       To be interpreted like the Sherman antitrust act or obamacare. They see the. They see the constitution as a piece of poetry to be interpreted as their feelings dictate and this is the point that I'm making about Kennedy through line, through everything we're talking. That's right, and this is the point that I'm making about Kennedy specifically in the gay marriage decision. There is not one iota of evidence that the law that when it was written meant anything to this effect or that it meant to leave an open space for the Supreme Court to come in and leverage down on states. Same sex marriage laws mean what they mean when they're written. They don't mean what they are, what they mean to a hundred years from now. If somebody picks up this interview in 200 years and starts to read into my perspective that I'm super pro homosexual behavior, I would be a little bit surprised, right?

Speaker 3:          01:10:01       But that's essentially what happened in 18, 68. He's taking a clause that was written by a bunch of people who were very much not in favor of even forget homosexual marriage who criminalized sodomy, right? And saying to them, okay, well those people really meant what they really meant here was pro same sex marriage. If you want to make same sex marriage, legal make illegal, you know, that's. That's what you can do through the ballot box is the beauty of a republic, but you don't get to have nine unelected judges. Who are these special moral people who've been dinged by the hand of God? I don't believe. I believe all human beings are capable of good. I believe all human beings are capable of evil. I believe all human beings are selfish and all of our are capable of altruism. I don't believe that there are nine perfect human beings who sit on the supreme court and rule us as a magical angelica oligarchy.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       I think that's a pretty solid ending to this. What do you think? Sounds good to me. Yeah. I mean, well, I think what we did here was exactly what I want this to be, that we don't have to agree on everything, but I do sense a sort of new center coming together with people that are on the right. That was my left, but it's there people that are on the left and on the right that there's a way where you can be moral and it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with religion or you can be moral and it has to do with religion, but that's not how you want to be governed and I think that's gonna be my takeaway.

Speaker 3:          01:11:09       I think that's exactly right. I mean, as I say to people who disagree with me, the of the countries that you don't have to care what I think the minute you bring the government into saying that I have to care what you think, then we're at odds. So as long as the government is out of it. We didn't have these discussions all day long and it's just good fun. The minute you bring the gun to the party or the fascist, more importantly than any of that, Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be so jealous that we sat here for an hour anyway. I want to thank a band and you can check out his work pretty much all over the place, but I believe it's Benjamin Shapiro doc and go to daily wire is probably the best place to get a wire.com and he's doing the breitbart thing and all that. Thank you guys for watching and we'll do it again next week.
