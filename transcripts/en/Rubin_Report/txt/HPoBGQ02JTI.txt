Speaker 1:          00:00:05       I'm pretty sure you all know that I'm a small government guy. What's small government means to me, at least economically is that you should keep most of what you earn and that you yourself are the best arbiter to decide where your money goes, whether the money you are and goes to fixing your house or buying a new car or to funding planned parenthood and supporting Lincoln Center. I believe that should be up to you. You've worked hard for your money, I assume, and I believe that you're a better judge of how to spend it rather than giving it to a wasteful government, which will often spend it on programs that you don't even care about. At the same time, being for small government isn't only about taxes and economics at its root. Being for small government is also about being for the individual. I believe that your faculty to understand how you want to live is far better than anyone else's faculty on how you should live your life.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       At the same time, I understand the need for the government is different depending on whether you live in a rural area or an urban center. For example, in a rural area with less people, there is most likely less of a need for regulation than there is in an urban area. Take something as simple as a noise ordinance. If you live in a remote, rural area in the middle of the country, there is most likely no need for a law to stop people from doing construction in the middle of the night or blasting their music too loudly. But if you live in an urban center, Say New York City where people live in small apartments on top of one another. A noise ordinance might be important to you. You can't have construction people knocking down walls at all hours of the night and you might not want your neighbor blasting music at 3:00 AM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       The next piece of the limited government puzzle is whether or not the government needs to be involved in so many facets of our lives at all. Even in the case of New York City with it's cramped conditions and tiny living spaces, is it the government who has to tell companies not to do construction in the middle of the night or tenants not to blast music at ungodly hours? This is where an interesting discussion can happen. Is it the job of the government as laid out by the constitution, which I think we're still governed by to regulate these interpersonal issues, or is it the job of individuals to deal with these issues themselves? Should a building in New York City have a policy about noise instead of leaving it to the government? Should it be incumbent on you to talk to your neighbor about the volume of their music rather than leaving it to the government? Can issues we think of traditionally being dealt with by the government actually be dealt with in the private sector or is the government already too deep into controlling us that we could never scale it back without burning down the system?

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       While noise ordinances aren't the most pressing issue out there? Obviously I use it as a simple example of the battle between the private and the public and how sometimes we assign power to the government when perhaps there could be a better option based in our own capacity to reason for ourselves. With all this in mind, we're continuing our partnership with learn liberty this week and me is best selling author and economist at George Mason University, Bryan Caplan. Brian is in a narco capitalists, which in simple terms is an extreme libertarian who wants government pretty much out of everything. We'll talk about taxes, healthcare, rent control, and much more and see if there are places that the private sector can actually do a better job than what the public has been able to do. Now, according to us, penal code four, two nine. Pursuant to the laws of the state in which you are governed, you are hereby ordered to click like and comment down below. We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty this week, and joining me today is a professor of economics at George Mason University, an author and a narco capitalist. End a pacifist Brian Kaplan. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks a lot for having me. Lot of good buzzwords in there and we're going to get to all of them, but first, what's it like being a professor on campus these days that doesn't identify as a progressive? Is that tough? Are you getting rocks thrown at you every day? How's that gone?

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       My life is perfectly fine. Nothing's ever had. Nothing bad's ever happened to be. I don't even know. I've never gotten a negative comment on a student evaluation. To be fair, I'm in the Economics Department at George Mason University, which is a very unusual place. There's a lot of libertarian and free market oriented people there, but also what I say is that the stories that you hear on the media while generally true, if you remember how many people are on campus, how many professors there are, so if every week you see some horrible thing happens to one professor that still leaves the 99 point nine, nine, nine percent of all professors who had a perfectly find week and so far so good for me.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       Yeah, and you make a point of saying you're in the economics department, which is probably insulated from some of this stuff's because you have to work with facts and figures and numbers. These are sort of outside of the realm of where social justice can hit. Right? Right.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       So just know economics says a long history of field where you can say really controversial and shocking things and people are curious and want to talk about it in a civilized way rather than get really mad at you. So I'd say at least half of the controversial ideas in academia have come out of economics and economists get Nobel prizes for these ideas. It's, you know, Gary Becker and Milton Friedman. It's not like people are waiting around for you to say the wrong thing and jump on you, uh, you said to me then you have the real difference is just people who are very dull. There are. Economists were very boring, but it's not like they're angry at people for doing other stuff. They're just not doing really exciting work. But there's plenty of room in economics for people to say almost anything really. And not only get away with it, but to succeed, meaning I mean, mean, I've long been telling people like, if you really want to be a professor, tried to figure out how to repackage what you're, what you want to do with economics, and then just get a Phd Phd economics, you'll make more money, you'll get tenure or you'll get an email, you'll get a job easily and you'll be in a very supportive atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          00:06:02       We can say you want, I can tell you truly believe in the free market because you're welcoming people to take your job right now. That's a, that's pretty good. Ten years. So I'm not that worried in that way. But um, and also remember that the more people in order for in order to become a vestry first have to become one of my customers and go to Grad school. So naturally it's not as on self interest might seem. Yeah. Do you find that professors of economics, either George Mason or you were just mentioning a debate, you're doing it in a couple of days, that generally professors of economics from whatever, uh, you know, whatever pathology they believe in, uh, are able to debate and it doesn't get personal and it can really stick on the issues and that kind of thing. So, uh, in general I'd say yes.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       Again, the main problem is just people who are not interested in bigger ideas and only want to focus on their research topics. So people like that are not touchy. They're not hostile, they're just apathetic or they use. Sometimes they'll have the idea of, you know, what you are doing is not science and I don't really care about that and you don't belong here, but it's not that they disagree with what you're saying as they disagree with people taking on bigger questions of any kinds. So that, I mean, again, that's sort of what I've dealt with in my time in academia is just I want to do big exciting ideas. And a lot of economists frown on that, not because they disagree with the content because they disagree with anything. Begging. Exciting. Yeah. So before we get into some of your big and exciting ideas, do you find that generally outside of the universities that just the American populace really doesn't understand anything about economics because this is what I see all the time, you know, I can only garner so much information from social media, but I see people saying things about trade all the time and immigration all the time and all these things that are tied back into economics and I'm like, you don't really seem to know much about anything.

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       Yeah. So I have a whole book on this called the myth of the rational voter democracy issues, bad policies in the book. I just go over all the evidence on what does the public actually believe about economics compared to what anyone who can explain the textbook. Thanks. And yeah, it's terrible. Why do you think about it is so mean. Right now we're in la. I grew up here, so I will say that until I was 17, I never heard any argument against the minimum wage. I never heard any argument against regulation of pharmaceuticals. I don't think I ever heard any argument against the welfare state ever. And again, I was not growing up in Berkeley or some some left wing haven. I've just growing up in a normal, boring middle class suburb here in Los Angeles. But the kinds of arguments that economists make and are aware of are just not even on people's radar.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       So that's an important distinction that you just said there that you didn't grow up in Berkeley. You grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles. That's somewhat blue collar. Elliot middle, middle class, the middle class, middle class, yeah, it was, it was, it was probably could easily been half Republican in days and still like I'd never heard any of the very basic economic arguments critiquing standard popular regulations. You Indian. So it's like everyone really like, you know, talking to my parents about rent control and you know, they didn't understand anything about the economist critique of rent control and how it caused. How it causes a shortage in housing for them, it's just like, well we own a rental property so we're against it. It was sort of all that they could come up with. Right. Uh, so you know, so you know, this is, this is very, very standard for the, you know, not just the American public but the global, but the global public and throughout history is just like the very basic ideas of economics that are in every textbook are not known and when they're heard this is this regular thing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       So it's one thing to never heard them, but northern normal reaction is just anger. So I say, well they're so insulated from any other idea basically. Right. And also it just like, it just like, why are you saying this while? Can't we have the minimum wage? It's a program to go and help poor people. And then an economist comes along and says there's a downside. This could cause unemployment. And people's reaction is how could you say something like that? So that's so terrible. Or only what kind of like you hate, you hate poor people. And again, this seems like a parody, but I have experienced this firsthand plenty of time. What have you do with that? What do you do with that? When you try to lay out something and you say, well, here's data to support it, but it's so emotional to somebody else. Something like minimum wage or you usually I try to connect it to versed and experienced because the only time I talk about, uh, uh, talking about the data, then someone could say, well, it's your data.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       Like how do I do? There must be plenty of other people have other data. So trying to say, well look, when you fill out a job application, you get to the line on salary requirements. You put a million dollars an hour. No, why not? Well, because, uh, I think if I put too much money then I'm less likely to get the job. Ah Ha. So it's not just me that believes that if wages are too high, that unemployment result, you believe it too. It's just that you don't want to connect what you know from your own experience to the world of policy because it doesn't sound good. Yeah. I think it's interesting what you said about your parents. They had a rental property so they didn't like rent control because obviously you don't want it if you're the owner of the property and how we, how we all apply our own life might be separate from what our philosophical principles are.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       Yeah. Because I lived in New York City for about 12 years in an apartment that was rent stabilized, so it's slightly different than right. Controlled, but they could only increase my rent. I think something like, you know, would change every few years, but about two percent a year, which for me as the tenant was great and they, you know, over the course of 12 years, my rent when I started at 1650 for a two bedroom apartment on the upper west and I think it maxed out at about 2000. So as the tenant on my side, that's pretty great. Make the argument why I'm wrong about that. Yes. Uh, so in terms of your own self interest, you might, might be perfectly right. I mean they're, I mean I would say, well there are some downsides. Things like quality tends to go down with rent control, so know like the heating, the heating breaks down and you can never fix a couple things.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       So, so there is that, uh, so you know, this, this is just, you know, very standard result with any kind of price controls. If you can't adjust on the price then you can adjust on all these other and all these other ways to adjust unquality a bot or are you going to, you can try charging people for extras, things like that. But yeah, I mean, so like you know, there's always going to be people who do benefit from the policies and if you happen to be that person then it's very elegant. Like you might say it hard to know the saving grace is that in general people are not comfortable arguing for political policy or policies on self hearsay. The grounds some, you know, when you were saying, look, this is very bad for society. People normally want to dispute that that is bad for society. They don't want to say, well sure it's bad for society, but I'm one of them in the minority of people are benefiting from this, so I like it and we should have it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I think the point that you make there about, well they're going to have to cut in other ways if they can't raise your rent. So for example, in my building in the winter, every winter there would literally be, if, if we were in the middle of a storm, there would be three or four days in a row where we would not have heat. It was an old steam heat, four story building and there was a couple days when I was single back then that I literally was under the covers with my dog because I didn't want her to freeze either and I went to the, to the management building, which is a couple blocks away and I was basically reaming them out and I remember the woman was sitting behind bulletproof glass and this is what's wrong with this system. This woman, she works for a big company, they own 500 buildings were stuck under this. I never fully connected that to rent control or rent stabilization, not inclined to move out to a full plate price place that had good heat. Yeah. So that does show how we all sort of negotiate these strange things. So let's talk about a narco capitalist. All right? Because I haven't done much on it. I think I've had one in Norco capitalist, my friend that guy t on on youtube. You should check out if you don't know him. Great guy in Atlanta. Um, what is a narco capitalism.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       So enter. Oh, capitalism is the idea that these so called minimal functions to the states are actually more than you really need. And it's, it is not only imaginable butts, you know, it could, but it really could work to prioritize the last lingering functions of government like police courts and the law itself. And this is it. This sounds really crazy. So the way that I usually like to explain it is, well, right now people may say, well government clearly sms, monopoly over police, monopoly, overclock over courts, monopoly over law, and I say government has a monopoly over these things right now. Right now there's actually more private security guards and police. So is that. That's true. So you know there are, there are more people hired by business and communities to go and do policing. Then there are police in the, in the official sense.

Speaker 2:          00:14:36       And then you know. So for courts there is a huge area of private adjudication. There's arbitration, there is anytime you have a problem with your credit card, do you sue the company? This involved? No. You called the credit card company and they have their own internal adjudication system for handling things like this on facebook. If you have problems on facebook, do you go into facebook? No. You Go, you go and you, when you complain with them and they do something about it, and then essentially they really do something about it in the case of facebook, but maybe we'll say, well, it's the minimum. They give you a bunch of options to solve your own problem. You can block someone, you can unfriend them, you can make sure that they never contact you again. So you know, they give you a bunch of remedies that you have, which are, you know, they've worked out exactly what it is they want to do about it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       And then, you know, similarly for your, for learning a lot self, there are many private organizations that have their own rules that they apply. So again, mentioning I'll be up. So private arbitration, you know, one of the main reasons people use private arbitration is that they don't use regular laws. They use their own laws which are designed to work better than the government's law so that you can get your issue resolved in a few days instead of weeks or years. Uh, so, you know, like usually with a pro, with private arbitration, they have the arbitrator. Actually be someone who knows what he's doing, so they have someone who is in fact an expert on this area of business ceos rather than giving it to a generalist and 12 people who were, who were too dumb to get out of jury duty. Uh, so just, just sort of beginning realizing, wow, this.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       So there's a lot of private, more private alternatives that already exists right now to, you know, to government providing these services that at first glance, a lot of people just have the reaction of it with justice society, which is burned in flames. If there were private police or private cloud or private courts are private law. Look around. It's not burning now and there's already a very large role for the private sector. So. And then we will. What I think, you know, what I think about anarcho capitalist and I always just say, all right, well let's start when we got you realize that that is not going to lead anything bad. And there's very good reasons why people are using these private alternatives right now, which is they're better, they're worth the money you get, you know, you actually get a, you get a better quality for all four of, you know, not only for a lower price, but remember, these are private companies competing with free government services and they're still carving out a big market niche for themselves because so many people are so dissatisfied with these services, they get provided free by the government.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       And then just thinking about like, how much further can we take these? So, you know, very easy with, with, uh, with private arbitration, right now, one of the big limits on private arbitration is that even if you sign a so called binding arbitration clause, in fact, if the, uh, have the person that is, if a person doesn't like how the binding arbitration turns out, they can go and they can, yes, they can take it works. So for example, if you sighing binding arbitration saying, know in the event of any of any employment to dispute, it's going to, this will be handled by private arbitration. Uh, you know, like that contract in general isn't like while it might get a forced, there's no, there's no confidence that would be. And again, if you think about it, well yeah, I mean like suppose that you could sign this binding arbitration.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       I could get my brother in law to go and be the arbitrator. He always rules in my favor. You could use this to get around a great many government laws so you can understand why government doesn't want to do this and yet clearly you could go and allow a lot more room for private arbitration and, and I, and actually it is likely that there is immense, immense pent up demand for private arbitration that is right now being stifled by regulation. Right. And then Uln, once you start thinking about how could there be even more ideal, you know, so like one, like one obvious one to me is you go into government courts and they say, well actually if this, if this is a private contract, we just just required, you just have to have an arbitration clause and it's not our problem, you know, so like, no, they're like you're so if you want, if you want adjudication, put an arbitration clause.

Speaker 2:          00:18:19       And all we do, there's this butte is so it's the contract that says this is the arbitrator rubber stamp. That's it. Yeah. So maybe as an intermediate, intermediate step you would keep criminal stuff exact. Exactly. Exactly. Move some of this stuff that's purely mentally bay. Exactly. So then when you just start thinking about all the things that you can hand over to the private sector to the private sector, you know, it is much larger than what pf and went through the what, what occurs the first. And then the anarcho capitalist idea is really once we, once we have privatized all the things that at first it seemed like you couldn't, but we just keep going further and further and further the end. You're left with almost nothing. And then the question is, could you just get rid of that last bit's. So let's, let's pause on the left side for a second because you mentioned a few different areas there.

Speaker 2:          00:19:06       So I think the arbitration one's really interesting. I'm wondering when you see cases of arbitration now, uh, it must self select a certain type of person to go ahead and do that. What type of things are being fought in arbitration? You know what I mean? Like you'd have, I guess you'd probably have to have a certain amount of money you would not want to maybe know that the person across the table from you is in a similar situation or has similar views that they'd be willing to accept it because you just said right at the end they could probably figure out a way to get this back into the courts. I mean, it's fairly common actually. Just add it in as boiler plate into a contract saying it will be arbitrated, but the people who really wanted I think, or people have been burned by lawsuits in the past, people who've seen business deals as collapsed before their eyes because the dispute came up and they didn't work it out and then it took years for them to go and resolve it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       And by then the business was bankrupt. So the OCR or course if you've been sued by an employee and you think you and I didn't even think it was bogus. That's another thing. Like I never want that to happen again. So these are the, like some obvious cases and putting it in. But you know, chorusy like no employer is thrilled about the idea of getting sued. So like yelling and like if it were the kind of thing that you could really rely on, then you know, I say I think it's very likely that it would be like totally standard to put in private arbitration and just to avoid or like all like all the hassles that are involved with hiring people right now. Um, you know, of course, if you think these laws are good, then this is very distressing to you. On the other hand, to someone like me, the fact that almost everyone would probably happily sign away the right to sue their employer shows there's something very curt, very bad about the system we have.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       It's like, look, it's the kind of thing that you have the right to sue employers. That kind of right. The people will sign away for a small amount of money, which means that it's probably not a very valuable right to begin with. It's the kind of thing that you're stuck with and it's in so many ways it's a burden because then you have to convince an employer, I'm not going to sue you. I'm, I'm cool. And well, isn't it also that the average person who works for even a small company, not just a giant corporation, we don't have lawyers on retainer. So I work for myself now, which is a pretty beautiful thing, but I've worked at plenty of companies where the day I got hired I had to sign some crazy book of all the pressure and of course I didn't read all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       So it's like I'm not walking around with our lawyer and most people are. So many people are just signing stuff without even knowing what they're saying. Which I would say is thank goodness for that because if people were actually, people are actually taking it more seriously and you'll see where you are right now. I think, you know, firms are taking advantage of that to get to go and diluted as much as the law will allow. And again, I think there's a sense. I think the regulations are bad in the first place. I'm all for people diluting the regulations as much as possible. So there's an old saying, thank God we don't get as much government to be paid for. I say also, thank God we don't sue people to anywhere near the extent that we legally could because it would be a hellish world. Yeah. This may sound like a very amateur question, but when people go into arbitration, are you bringing a lawyer with you or is it just that the arbitrator is just looking at what was signed and deciding?

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Like is there an actual argument that's taking place? So I think it varies a lot so sometimes you might bring a lawyer so you know, so we'd like. It may actually depend upon the rules of the arbitration, but you know, I think a lot of the ideas just to cut the expenses down so the. A lot of times you don't have a lawyer, you just have an arbitrator there who generally is well versed in the industry that you're working in so he actually knows what you're talking about. And then of course you know part of what they're doing. So there's something more moderate called mediation where the arbitrator doesn't matter where the person doesn't really get to decide anything but just tries to get the two people to talk. It's kind of like counseling and then arbitration is stronger where he listens to both sides and then he tells you about what's going to be.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       Is there a set time frame on how long that lasts? No, no. Certainly not always a. Since this is private, there's, you know, there's a wide range. There's a beautiful rainbow of all possibilities so we know which are all done. So you know, there's, you know, sometimes there's an arbitrator who just says looking at like we need tomorrow. That's it Robert. And that story, here's what's gonna happen. And even part of the beauty of that is once you get the dispute resolved, a lot of times you can go back to working with each other. We may not be that happy about it, but it's like there's no longer an ongoing dispute and so it's settled and then he can get back to business and you haven't paid and insane amount to lawyers. Lawyers aren't thrilled with the. Yeah, yeah. Probably not immediately. So of course their sob who are entrepreneurial enough to see, well this is an opportunity for me to branch out, but yeah, I think it would be very bad for lawyers in the, in the long running.

Speaker 2:          00:23:19       And of course, for litigators particularly, which is a small minority of lawyers in the first place, but uh, you know, assuming like, you know, like for a contract lawyer, this might be awesome because then people, then there'd be a bunch of people who want to rewrite all their contracts to go and putting by putting binding arbitration that's truly and utterly binding. Right. Uh, so you mentioned earlier that even policing could be pressurized, but what would happen? So I can understand that a place like beverly hills people got a lot of money. We're going to prioritize the Beverly Hills Police Department. Beverly Hills Cop. Okay. I saw the movie that wasn't what the movie was about, but I had to get that in there somehow. But what wasn't a place? What about in a place where they're at, where the economics are terrible, where people have no money, we're probably crime is the highest.

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       Who, who's going to put in money to. How are you gonna make a profit off that. Yeah. So, um, you know, keeping, you realize. So those places work where crime is terrible or ones where the current police already don't work very well. So we're just, we're stepping back and realizing the current system is quite grumpy to begin with now. Like you know, who would pay for it otherwise. So again, the obvious place to start are people actually are landlords. So like in a more suburban area, you're talking about homeowners associations are some of the obvious people to pay for it, but you know, even now in that area is very common for landlords to pay for some kind of security. And if they know that it's their job to do it in a high crime area, you'll even someone who is poor is galliano values their life values protection.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       So you know, like sort of like a, like an economist joke has been like, you know, you see a lot of really expensive sneakers and bad areas down, but why is this? Well like when it's a priority, people will come up with the money in order to pay for things that they really care about. But you know, the other thing about policing is, I mean I think it's also better to think about it and in a broader category of just enforcement of all kinds. So there's many kinds of enforcement besides actual police. So one that's become very common with the Internet is the all kinds of reputational incentives. So you know, like, you know, just like bad reviews, things like this, you know, these work far better than like the FDA. So you like imagine you get a bad meal, do you go and call it the FDA and complain about it or something like that or like local meat inspectors know, like much more likely to go and put in a bad yelp review.

Speaker 2:          00:25:23       And this is the way that we are probably getting most of our actual enforcements. You know, like you like how, what is protecting you from food poisoning? Is it the government now? The government's hardly doing anything about it. What's really protecting you from food poisoning is always word of mouth, which is now amplified because there's no. Now it is word of the Internet. One, one complaints. So you're like, my dad runs an internet business, like one disgruntled customer is terrible for you and is really a much more effective enforcement mechanism than anything in the government is doing about it. So some of it that it just, the messaging has to be clear because that concept seems very obvious to me in a day of the Internet where you're right, people care now more about what a yelp review of a restaurant says than what either a written review in the La Times says or what, uh, you know, what it says at the restaurant, what they're telling you themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:26:11       So we, that this is really about messaging in a way more than economics because I think people can get there economically. Yeah. Yeah. And then again also just thinking about ways that you can get a contract between people that you don't ordinarily think of as a, as a contractual relationship. So right now we also like, if you get an accident with someone you'd only car accident. You don't have, you don't have a contract with the person who got an accident with. But if you both have insurance, your insurance company has a relationship with their insurance company. So when, you know, of course, most auto accidents never go to trial. The insurance companies have a system that they work out where they negotiate with each other, they've got standards. So again, that's, that's already going on. And then just think about anytime you're in a public place, anytime you're in a mall, so you, like you are right now, of course, if there's a dispute there, the police will handle it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       But it is very easy to visualize a world where when you go to the mall, there's actually a sign saying like, Yo, so when you enter this, you come under the jurisdiction of this arbitration company and Alice. And then any dispute that happens in them all then is no longer actually needs to be handled by the police. Uh, so, you know, so, you know, and, and of course people saying, well, I mean, they're just ran a cops, you know, they don't even have, a lot of them don't ever really have guns. I mean, of course if the taxpayers will pay for someone to be shot at than pe companies are not going to pay or not going to pay the extra amount to have their employees. So the whole system of economics, we sort of flipped if we. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, you know, the amazing thing about all of the kinds of private of private law that we see right now, isn't that how little it does, but how much it does given that the government provides these services free of charge and people still, I will take money out of their own pockets to go rather than go and get the free stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       Which yeah. All right. So you know, of course, you know, and so you know, it's always the incense, it's not free because you have to pay taxes, but in another sense it is free. Namely you can use it without any additional charge. So that's the sense in which this stuff is free. Like sometimes they'll like, you'll get charged for a false alarm, although that's pretty unusual. But like the fire departments sometimes you call them for no reason. They'll sit, they'll give you a, a bales. I like, why did you go and waste valuable services? But normally that's not how it works. You mentioned a car insurance. Where does health insurance fall on this? Because how the Germans right now is making everyone completely insane. Uh, no matter what side you're on, everyone is crazy about this. So, so what is then the answer for health insurance in your view?

Speaker 2:          00:28:26       Right. Uh, well I guess that's probably the last question I'll ask you for the interview. So no health insurance. So you know, I like, I have the extreme view that there's no reason for government to be involved in this area at all. And what's very striking is that while most economists officially sell will disagree, but when, when, when I've actually got an argue with them, usually when they argue for regulation, they're arguing for regulations to fix other regulations. And when I say, well, what if we just didn't have the first regulations are trying to fix, then the reaction is kind of like, well I never really thought about it that much. So just for example, the, you know, the whole idea of Obamacare, is that all right? Well first we're going to have a regulation saying that you can't turn people down for insurance. And secondly, we're gonna have a regulation saying that you can't charge them higher prices and then people normally realize, well, wait a second, you a system like that, that a lot of people just wait around until they're sick and so then we're going to require people to buy insurance, to avoid the problems created by the new regulations.

Speaker 2:          00:29:25       And then we're gonna. Then there's people too poor to afford it. So then we're going to subsidize those people to deal with the other three regulations. All right? So, um, you know, my view is there's really no reason why you couldn't have scrapped all the regulation and just said, look, here's your incentive by insurance. If you wait until you're sick, you won't be able to afford it. But then what do you do for those people? So, so I guess I get that, but isn't, than what, what happens as a result of that is that x amount of people, and it's going to be a lot of people simply will not do it because they'd rather spend their money elsewhere and hope that there'll be healthy or, or they'll just get a broken leg playing basketball or something else or whatever. Uh, and then we still end up paying for them.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       Right? Don't address them, will automatically end up paying for them. Not automatically. Again, if you get rid of all those regulations, then then for service and then you have to rely on charity. And of course charity includes family includes everybody else that might want to help you, but that you'll say, well that's terrible. I wouldn't want to have to deal with that. Yes. That's why you buy insurance and advances because you don't want to be put in that position. Right? So of course then you started late start thinking about the horrible cases. Like what about a child boards, they're responsible parents and the child is a lifelong congenital disease. I say that's the kind of thing that charities are going to be very well equipped to handle. They're probably not going to be so equipped to handle someone who's 25 and was earning a middle class income.

Speaker 2:          00:30:44       It didn't feel like buying insurance and then they come down with a horrible problem. Those are ones where I think you're likely to be very low in priority and it's world like you're an adult and it was your responsibility to take care of yourself. Uh, but sort of in the background is the issue of like, how can you be so callous as to say if you went and did something really dumb that it's just your own tough luck. And so I have this old blog post called tough luck, right? So you know what every political philosophy ultimately says tough luck to people. It's just a question of where they draw the line. So you know there's the, well, what if there's a conservative go conservative government power and they can skip my son and he sent to another country and you get Eddie dies. What happens then?

Speaker 2:          00:31:24       And of course the conservative answer is ultimately, well, tough luck. That's the system like in my system, you can be conscripted if I didn't worry, you don't want to. And sometimes when that happens you get put into a lethal area and you die. And like, well my life has been ruined and what are you going to do about it? Nothing. And they'll give you a plaque or similar yellow or the yellow like, you know, similarly like, you know, like, you know, like even someone who is these a supporter in the world of socialized medicine. So what if a person goes and cuts off their own legs and then. And then whenever you go and send someone to help them, they throw things at them. What are you going to do then? Well then I guess tough luck all and that person, is this going to be alone and be suffering because they wouldn't go along with the system.

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       All right? So given that every single philosophy ultimately says tough luck. I don't see why people who believe in the free market should feel, especially embarrassed to say, well yeah, my system. This is where we draw the line and if you have failed to do all of these things than that, it's here. Then it's your problem because there is no perfect system based. There's no perfect system and and again like would it be a perfect system if someone could be completely irresponsible 100 times in a row and would still get treated like everybody else? Have they done any studies that you know of where they've shown where in cases that the government pulls back that

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       charity does take care of this stuff so that in the case, which I think is a legitimate. Like philosophically, I fully get what you're saying there that if we just pulled back a little bit that people would give more. Is there evidence of that? Because I just

Speaker 2:          00:32:53       so well so it's all. Almost all the evidence is the other way around where it's. There used to be private charity and then government started doing it and then people measure what happened to the charity that was involved. This is called crowding out. There's a whole field economic charity when they study this, and this is a totally standard result that there are many areas that private charity used to take care of, like helping out the poor a demand now. And as government expanded its role, the role of private charity shrank down and eventually, eventually private charity moved into other areas. The government wasn't doing very much about. So yeah, so you like in the thirties, I was really only really use the thirties or sort of when there was a big transition because there were many private organizations are things called fraternal clubs and organizations that were private clubs that did a lot of things that the modern welfare state does.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       So if you lost your job that he, they take care of you. If there were sickness, they go and take care of you. Uh, the thirties was single. It was such a protractive depression and depression that fight, that partly started breaking down the end. But again, a lot of it was government. Taylor took over and once government took over, there really wasn't much point to belong to the organizations anymore except to go and put on funny hats and have one once a month. But you know, like a lot. A lot of these groups they like, you remember your grandfather being part of like the elks or the odd fellows. These actually provided these welfare state functions privately in the past.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       So do you think that something like a government funded planned parenthood, which I'm sure regardless of your feelings on abortion, I'm sure you're not for the government funding that I can accept that part. So for myself, I'm pro choice, but when I see all these people talking about public funding of all of these things, it does seem to me that if the government stopped funding these things, not made the illegal abortion but stopped funding that this seems like a case were so many people are so passionate about it. Oh, all these people in Hollywood who are constantly tweeting about this and screaming. Right. But they would start funding these things. So is that a great example?

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       I think if anything, it is a great example. I mean you're the here, you know, here's the main thing that is troubling about the economics of charity is there's a bunch of cars of the people that they care about and those. I'm not worried about those. There's gonna be plenty of money for them. There's a bunch of other terrible things happening in the world that private charity, manifestly Evans hasn't solved. It, hasn't gone unsolved. International refugee problems and you know, it's doing something but they're still terrible things going on. Isn't solved a hunger in other countries. You know, the thing is that these are, these are problems that taxpayers don't care much about and that charitable gave her some care very much about. So not you'll say we can, you know, Bill Gates cares and you know, he's, you know, he's making a single handily making a noticeable in the problem. But again, so will sort of like the issues that people are really concerned about. The ones that have a lot of support for taxpayers to do something about it, about them are also very plausibly ones were private donors. We care a lot as well.

Speaker 1:          00:35:33       Yeah. Is there any situation where you think regulation is necessary? Is there, you know, someone will. I'm sure someone watching this is going to comment. Well, what about the rivers? They're going to pollute all the rivers or anything. Is there any instance where you see it as.

Speaker 2:          00:35:46       Yeah. So me, what I would say is, I don't know. I would say so then, you know, the again, so there's a lot of areas where given the, given Gary, given the current setup, it's very hard to see how, like, how, like how either a for profit or even a shared a response to it. Uh, again, the question in my mind is always, if we imagine going into privatizing things that government to government, Ngo, government now does, then what's left and then what's left the charity can't handle. So I mean, and again that's to me like, you know, part of being an advocate of capitalist is least saying, well let's privatized and see before saying there's no way that private action are you going to handle this problem. Let's go and take and take a look. And of course all the private solutions may take a while to emerge, but then again, like, you know, like there are many problems the government has dealt with very poorly so far.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       So I don't think it's fair to say after a year, you know, private sector hasn't solved this yet, so therefore clearly governments as theory will let me give it some more time. But again, like the ones that I think are the clearest cases are, you know, air pollution. So that's one where it's very hard to exactly see how the privates, like how for profit for profit sector would handle it. It's one where because air pollution moves across the, they're bullish moves. Like there's like you, you're not walking around in a bubble. I get, it's one where, well again, you're suppose that government didn't do anything about it, but there's private charity involved, right? Private charity to go and say subsidized lower l, lower polluting technologies or offer prizes for lower, lower polluting technologies and then give away the patent so that these, the new technologies are really cheap. I'll get in. So like us to like, like how well that will work. I honest, I honestly would have to say it's so far from where we are. I don't know. But I think we, I think we should give it a try.

Speaker 1:          00:37:23       Yeah. So most people watching this know that I'm a limited government guy. I believe in states rights. I would always rather be governed by the, by my mayor and my local representative. And then February will be governed by the mayor of Los Angeles. All right. So you know, he's a little, he lives a little closer to me than the, than the people in DC, let's put it that way. Regardless of my feelings of the mayor of Los Angeles. But generally speaking I want, I believe in local, local control. So are there instances where local control has done this better? Like is there a, is there a town you can point to or is there a state maybe that's doing some of this a little bit better?

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       Let's see. So given that there are so many states and localities, I'm sure that there are, I don't know off the top of the head which, which one, which ones they are, but yeah, so like

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       is that partly just because the feds now have so much control over everything? It's hard for states to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       There is, there is. But again, blank, like you know, so states do manage enormous amount. I'd say the main issue actually is just that the federal government provides so much of the money for state governments that a lot of the competitive pressure that you think would be operating is it has really been neutered by the fact that states are just receive a bag of money from the federal government for certain purposes and if they aren't allowed to and use it for other purposes. And so they have very little incentive to try to figure out a way of saving taxpayers and the taxpayers money on it. And often the money of course comes a lot of strings attached. If you don't want this rings and you have to give back all the money. So very few places want to do that. So what would you do in a case when, uh, you know, when we hear about federal money being used and everyone says, okay, so like for example, like, you know, Hurricane Sandy Hits in New Jersey, the Jersey shore is destroyed and then Obama was probably hundreds of millions of dollars.

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       I don't know off the top of my head or, or a hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Do you again this would be the same thing. I think so like probably on private insurance, there's no reason that you couldn't have private disaster insurance and of course there is a lot of private jets or insurance sold. Normally the feds get in where this area is so high risk that the insurance will be really expensive and people will be chomps don't feel like having to pay for it. And so either the Fed, the feds take care of it or they subsidize it and again, like, you know, so we, especially to me the idea that someone with a beach house to get some subsidized insurance because it's a high, it's a high disaster area around. I like the disaster. I'm always baffled by that. They're limited in a beach house.

Speaker 2:          00:39:40       Why can't they? Why can't a person in a beach house be expected to buy their own insurance? Well, a lot of them do have insurance, but they pay full market price for the insurance. So ultimately in a case like that would, would people then be forced to move from a place like. So either you, well, here's what we want to really be forced to move and tell the value of your home. False now. Yes, but eventually maybe a self select out. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like really? Like really what would happen given the beach homes normally are very valuable, is that those homes would just be worth less because people realize if I move into this home, I'm gonna have to buy some really expensive insurance. So that doesn't sound very good. So ultimately of the like, you know, like subsidizing disaster insurance is a subsidy to people who develop in high and high and disaster prone areas, especially the on land in those areas are ultimately the people who really benefit from it because it raises the value of that real estate's I guess I never really thought about it in those specific terms, but you know, I drive by Malibu here which is gorgeous and all these rich people living on these cliffs right on the water and at the end of the day if something horrible happened, which of course we meet horrific government would be then giving money to people who chose to live there in a high risk thing because their insurance didn't go above and beyond whatever the necessary of government requirements.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       Okay. So me and my family lives in this area, so are laborers a couple miles from the North Ridge earthquake and back in 1994. And I know relatives who were just calling up fema and say and give me money, give me money. And they got money. Like yell. It didn't matter like how rich you are or like what you had done or whether you had built your home safely. It's like, like the, like just the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Really all you have to do is pick up a phone and so is that the real problem with all of this that ultimately by doing all of this regulation that you punish people who do the right thing. In a case like this, there's someone who built their house, earthquake safe, bob invested their own money and all of that. Maybe had some, maybe didn't. Northridge

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       was a massive earthquake, but then they're getting, they're not getting government money because they did the right thing and put their own money in it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:41       Yeah. So like. Absolutely. So it's not, you know, it's not fair. It's not just economists would also point out is that it's highly inefficient because you're giving people incentives to not do not do the right things. The other thing, you know, the end, the final point is worth making is, you know, so I'm, I'm the kind of person who defends radical and extreme views, but I never want to alienate people who are a little bit less radical, a little bit less extreme in all these cases. Uh, like, you know, I still say, look, you know, if you, if you're very concerned about small minority of very poor people who really couldn't afford afford insurance during this time, that aren't fine, have a government program that, that, that, that, that subsidize it or provides insurance for orphan children, for folio, for kids who have terrible diseases for people who are very poor but happened to be struck by disaster.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       You know, you can have a program that costs five percent as much as what we're currently doing. We could ride, get rid of 95 percent without really bumping into any of the complaints that role people have. I'll say like, well, what about, what about the poor? What about kids? What about people that they're responsible parents? And still, you could go 95 percent of the way to the libertarian policy. And again, so know I'm the kind of person who says what about the last five percent, but I don't want to go and lose people, lose people because who were willing to go the first 95? So it's worth saying, look with health insurance. All right, well maybe we'll see how government could still subsidize it for, you know, for kids, the poor parents, for people that are, that we're born with a, with a, with a, with a terrible congenital disease. Like it just make a few exceptions and then stop making the exceptions. Say like this small area, this is where it's so terrible. Government's going to pay for it out of taxpayer money. Everyone else though, Saker swim usually all like you're an adult. You should take care of yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       Yeah. You Must Bang your head on the wall every time people in public demand that the government throw more money at things, right? Because this is like, it's always the easy answer. It always see it feels right to people, throw more money at it, throw more, and especially in the thrill and the throwing is a great image because it's just a lack of accuracy, lack of lack of interest in actually targeting any specific

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       no problem. So, I mean, I've just wrapped up a book on education called the case against education where I argue for defunding education. Right? So, yes. I also like, isn't that bad for you? Well, yeah, it wouldn't be bad for me. People listen, but still my conscience says this is the right thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Okay. So, so sell me on that. I come from, I went to a public elementary school, public junior high public high school. I went to State University of New York at Binghamton, which was hugely subsidized by the government. I think it was around $9,000 a year and I got a great education.

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       Uh, why am I. So I went to public schools right in this neighborhood actually. Um, but yeah, like the heart of my case is something called the signaling model of education. So you know this, this is a fancy term for a common sense idea, just says that a lot of the reason why education pays is not that as teaching useful job skills, but rather you're jumping through hoops to show off for employers. Right? So just think about all the classes that you ever had to take and then how few of them are actually relevant to the job that you do. You actually probably have a job where you do use more of a, more, more of what you studied. You know, I was a political sense. Yes. But yes. But you know, thinking about just think about all the classes that were required were you would not where you would not have been allowed to graduate without going through all of them.

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       So I mean I always have this example. Imagine you're like one aristotle class, shorter college graduation and yet you want to finish that class. Why? Because you're going to use the Nicomachean ethics and on the job probably not. Rather because you want that diploma and employers are like, like many employers will just throw your application right in the trash unless you have the diploma, but do you lose something doing it your way because of just a certain breadth of knowledge. Now I'm not saying that every class should be mandated and of course they stick you in things that shouldn't be necessary, but just that in terms of college specifically that that's where you should get a broad sense of knowledge. Would that be at risk then? Well, here's the thing, it's not at risk because almost no one gets it. Now. That's the. So that is the harsh truth is that you just go and look at what graduates of the current system.

Speaker 2:          00:45:46       No, it is next to nothing. Right? So there have been some great nationally representative surveys of what American adults know about government, about history, about economics, and the answer is they know next to nothing. So if you were to defend the system saying that people need breadth of knowledge, well it's not a defense of the current system because they have this current system is not giving it to them all. The way that I like to think about it is that typical American college graduate is lucky to maybe answer half of the most basic questions you can imagine on civics. Now you might say, well, they then they. That was still worthwhile. I say it's not worthwhile because what, what do you call someone who knows half their letters? What do you call someone who knows half their letters and eating it? It literally, after letters, you are illiterate, illiterate, even know what have your letters.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       You are illiterate because you cannot read similarly saying, if you know half the basic facts about, uh, about us history or about American government, you don't know half of what you need to know. You just don't know it at all. If you don't have a clue, if you think there are one and a half branches of government, you just don't have a clue about what's going on. And that's what the current system has given us. So when people say like, wouldn't this be a disaster? And say, well, you might say the current system is a disaster, but what I'm proposing wouldn't be worse. Uh, now there's always the question, well, but why not go and redouble our efforts so that people really do learn the stuff. Main thing I'd say is like the resources that it would take are so vast. In fact, I go, I don't know of any actual sign that, that, that it, that it could be done.

Speaker 2:          00:47:15       Uh, and I, you'll have, I also, I do have a way cheaper. So a alternative to the current system for actually getting people to learn this stuff. So this is, this is one of my most reformers proposals. So it does involve, it doesn't involve government money, but it's still, I'd say a way use the government money than what we're doing right now. Okay. So here's the proposal. Every year there is a government test of your knowledge to civics. And if you get a good score, you get some money. The end. Alright. Now what's the point of this? Well, two points, first of all, it gives people an incentive to actually learn the material by how in whatever means actually works best. So in the end you get something. Yes, Angela? Yes. Yes. So like, you know, you could learn it on the Internet, you can just read a book, you could learn it in school, like any possible method of learning.

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       The material is equally rewarded so it doesn't go and throw money to high school civics teachers who have manifestly failed to fail to actually generate a, a knowledgeable public instead of just opens it up. So and so say there's a war for knowing stuff. However you learn it is fine. But the other reason why you do it every year is because there is enormous evidence and educational psychology that people generally forget what they learned very quickly. So on test day, actually I believe that most of the students in this class probably actually kind of knew their stuff, but what's what, what psychologists called fade out is so enormous. Just the way, like in one year out the next, if you don't keep testing it, you'll keep using it. You lose it so you have the test every year. This would actually lead to retention of knowledge over time where people would not immediately forget the material as soon as they learn it because like wow, I need to know what next year and the year after that, every year I can get another hundred bucks off of showing that I know my stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       So. And there's no, you don't think there's a way to prioritize that then. So you can do with charity. I'll be like, this is legal and no charity has done it for so I'm not too optimistic about that happening. But yeah, like if some, if some donor right now is interested in doing this, this would be great. But anyway, this will be so much cheaper than high. Then all the high school social sciences classes that we offer right now, whatever you bros will ask, people often start freaking out who's going to write the test? And I say, well look right now a key part of civics is knowing the answers the teacher wants to hear. So like even like as long as you know that there's a certain bias on the, on the official civics test, you just vacate and like in order to do well and it, you still have to learn a bunch of stuff. So you know, I mean I had so many college classes where I disagreed with the professor. I still learn, I learned what the answer is they wanted to hear, but I also learned the material the same time and there's no reason why you couldn't do that. Do apply the same thing. So I don't, I don't see that it's really such a. Such a terrible deal.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       Yeah. I'd love to see the fadeout rate for kids the day after the sats because I remember studying for that thing and go united tutor with a group of friends. But I remember thinking, man, when I'm done with this thing, I am going to let go of all this. And I had taken the test probably a week later. I, I'm probably to have the scores on that.

Speaker 2:          00:50:05       I mean this is some of the most interesting research in psychology. So there's a lot of research on fade out in school where you go and you teach the kids something and then you go and measure it one or two years later in school. But the really scary, really scary fade out is from school to adulthood because of the kids in school. At least they kind of know I'm going to have to learn this again. I might get tested on again. But once you finally graduate, that's it. That's the end. So there's a fantastic study, a retention of higher mathematics throughout life and like Algebra and geometry, like were they. Within a couple of decades, most people took those classes just know or back to where they were before they even actually started the classes. The only people remember their Algebra and geometry are people who go all the way up to calculus to go all the way to Canada.

Speaker 2:          00:50:46       Then you go and retain Algebra and geometry for the rest of your life, but you have to go way beyond a subject to actually retain the, retain the basics. Any of that. This all fits with like, like, like say, like use it or lose it or a tiger mom. Amy Chu has a great slogan like everyday, everyday, everyday you don't practice as a day you get worse. So you, this, this does go with well. So why bother teaching people things they're just going to forget. Anyway, so I mean this, this is part of my critique of like, like what's wrong with throwing so much money at education? You have to say we'll get like now of course none of this denies that schools do teach them useful material but again, my view is already again, so like for the useful material, like you're like most people can pay for it probably like most people's parents can pay for it and then if there's going to be any role for government, let it be for the small minority of kids whose parents are not able to take care of them or shared.

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       He's not taking care of them. And then for just that last sliver of people let you know they don't like it. There's going to be a role for government. Let it be that. So don't throw money at a problem, there's going to be money, let it be narrowly targeted to give, to be mindful that you are taking money from taxpayers without their consent and at minimum you owe them responsibility to spend the money. Well, I think that's seems like a really basic thing. I think we've given up that that minimum a long time. Yeah. But even like, you know, so it's one thing to say, look, this is so important that we're going to that where that you have to pay whether you like it or not too bad, but then go and spend that money. He Leslie, that seems like it's really a true. Like honestly, like that seems like a true human rights abuse. To take someone for money at gunpoint and then just blow it. Like without saying, well maybe this will do something. Who knows? Maybe if that's your attitude, you shouldn't have taken my money. You shouldn't be like, maybe you should have asked me, but you shouldn't have made me if that's all you've got.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       All right, let's shift slightly from economics. Which, by the way, I want to tell you that I think most of my audience I think is classically liberal or Libertarian, I think is the, is the big chunk of it. So I think they're going to be with you on a lot of this. So let's get to some stuff that I think that they may not be with you as much. So let's talk about borders and immigration for a second. So are for a couple minutes at least a year. An open borders guy. I am. I am. Yes. So with everything going on in the world right now, give me your best pitch for open borders, which I am not. All right, let everything go. I didn't know

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       y'all going on in the world. So first step is to say the stuff you see on the news is so statistically rare that no sensible person would even worry about it. Very much. So like terrorism, like on the news all the time, it is one of the smallest problems on earth, right? So if you just go in and look at the data and you'll. And you will see alright, so deaths from murder is like under one percent of all deaths and terrorist murders under one percent of all murders. So why is it that people are so worried about it and we have spent over a trillion dollars in the war on terror because it has vivid because it is emotionally effecting. So I'd say like the first thing that we have to do is calm down and apply numeracy and just like say like here's a problem. Everyone's worried about it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:47       Is it really a serious problem that we should be concerned about or not? Right. And you know, I say like terrorism is probably the most, the strongest, most emotional critique. People have immigration and yet it is not actually a sensible thing to be able to be worried about it, but how much and how much of it is because what we're doing is actually working so that we know we're keeping a certain amount of people would love to come in here and blow things up and murdered. What I'd say is there's, you know, there's a lot of ways that we could go and test whether the stuff that, that, that, that, that, that we have is working. Uh, so there's, there's, there's a great political scientist, John Mueller as a book called overblown, going over all of it. So one thing we can do is just look at where called near misses so you can go and see you, right?

Speaker 2:          00:54:26       Like how many terrorist thoughts are that failed, which gives us an idea how fast, how much is they go, what we're currently doing actually working. So like the shoe bomber for things like that. So you know, when you go and expand the sample to all, to all, to all the failed cases and especially when you go and look carefully, not just the things that the government classifies as terrorism so they can go and get a photo op. But things that actually when you really look at was an actual terrorist plots where they had gotten, where they had done something more than say we should have a terrorist plots again, is still. It still remains incredibly rare. Now another test, uh, this was actually one of my favorite ones is for all the people think that it's really easy to get into Mexico should mean that it's really easy for terrorists to get in from Mexico.

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       And yet the actual number that had done this is exceeded extremely small. Uh, so in like, in fact, I'm not sure there's been any case of, of any, of any terrorists coming, you know, cross crossing, crossing from Mexico and doing anything. So again, like, you know, so if you were someone who thinks that the border is port is poorly guarded right now, then it doesn't make a lot of sense to think that current anti terrorist policies are preventing a lot just because it's so easy for them to do this. Now, I would say that our actually our, our, you know, our borders guarded very well in the sense that people pay about five, about $4,000 to get smuggled across. So for the kind of people who are, who are smuggling or who are coming across the border that several years income, it's a big deal, but it's, you know, it's a big deal for a rural Mexican farm worker, but it's not a big deal for a serious terrorist.

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       You're serious terrorist and you can't come up with 5,000 bucks for your plot and then like you, like you're a joke. So, I mean, I'd say that. So like the idea that there, that there really is a serious problem or that we have done much about it as I think just wrong. Uh, this is like they're very, you know, so again, that'd be going to settle again, the stuff on the news and stuff that people really care about now. What is the case in favor of open borders? Again, it's the kind of thing that you almost never see on the news, but. So yeah, so I mean there, there's the others, the economic case and, and the human rights case. So yeah, like the economic case is very simple to just says that the most, all the very best way that we know of, of, of you increase in the production of mankind is to move people from poor countries to rich countries.

Speaker 2:          00:56:31       I, yeah, it is almost like magic. You take a Haitian was making a dollar a day and port-au-prince moved to Miami and suddenly he's making $40 a day. Alright. So I was like, his productivity increases by a factor of 40 and you're like, how is that possible? Right. You know, so you'd probably doesn't even speak English at first. He speaks French and the, the answer is his Labor is extremely unproductive and Haiti and extremely productive in the United States. Even very unskilled workers produce far more in rich countries. And they do in poorer countries, poor countries are screwed up in so many ways. So like, you know, this is one of the most amazing things that you can do about poverty is to move people from poor countries, rich countries. Then overnight, what they can accomplish multiplies and not by like 10 percent or 20 percent by five times, 10 times, 20 times.

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       It is amazing and of course radiology know if you understand the basic trade, this doesn't just benefit the immigrants, it benefits everyone who's consuming that product, so the benefit benefits all of the stuff that the immigrants make mead right now, Haiti is pretty much irrelevant to the global economy. If you were to move those Haitians to Florida, suddenly the global economy would be Richard by a very large amounts and in a lot of the actual production will be consumed not just by the Haitians, but it would be consumed by, you know, by the people that are eating and Haitian restaurants by the people that are hiring Haitian nannies or rh variation gardeners. All these things that right now currently are not happening now when economists have just tried to get an estimate, like how much are we losing from these border restrictions from trapping all this valuable labor in poor countries.

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       You know, a pretty good estimate is that we are, is that immigration restrictions are having the, the production of the world we would be with the world will be twice as rich if anyone could take a job anywhere and again it's things like what could you accomplish in Haiti? So you are actually, you might be able to have to reset up the revenue a hell of a show in Haiti, although you'd have trouble getting your guests so, so cheap. I could find. Maybe I said it will be, but in general, most people when you picture what could I do in Haiti, it's very little. I guess the main difference between a you'll be, oh, so between Haitians and Americans is that Haitians are stuck in Haiti and yes. So it's true that their skills are low by American standards spots. They can do so much more here than they couldn't come.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       They can, they can do back at home. So what now? So what does act when people say open borders, what does that actually mean? You mean that could people just wander in from Canada and Mexico? Are we shutting down the places that they walked through? So I would say that means that I would call that no borders. Okay. I'd be willing to defend that too. But that's not my main pitch. My main pitch is open borders where the way I think about it is if, unless someone belongs in jail, he can go. He can move to any country wants. He lived there and he can work there. So unless blood. What does that mean though? So you. Okay, you're a Canadian, you want to come to. And as you walk through the sanction border, even though you said you might potentially but the other thing, but you walk through how you are you a citizen, they knew they would get, like I said, so you can live there, you can work there. It doesn't make. It doesn't make you a citizen. Right. So maybe you're never miss out again. And so like to me the heart of under orders isn't citizenship. It's the right to live the right to end the and the right to work. Right? Which of course, things, you do this

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       for an unlimited amount of time because then in effect, you're probably going to get all the rights of a citizen at some point.

Speaker 2:          00:59:40       Uh, you might. But, so, you know, I, I'm not, I'm not against that, but to get that is not to yell, but I, but I also not strongly for that. Uh, what I'm strongly for is the right of any human being. It doesn't belong in jail to live and work in any country that he wants. So again, I already mentioned the economic case. I mean, do you need the human rights case is basically what it look like. This though, this is a human being. He wants, sells like there's someone who wants to rent them an apartment right here. There's someone who wants to hire him here. What business is any stranger f saying no. So maybe. So we know. So I, I have, uh, I've, I've compared immigration laws to Jim crow laws. I said the main difference is that immigration laws are worse. Jim Crow Law said that there are some areas where blacks couldn't live in the United States.

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       There are some jobs blacks couldn't take. What our immigration law say is that if you are a Mexican citizen, there is no place in the country you can legally live and no job in the country you can legally work, right? That seems way worse than Jim Crow. And again, what's the difference? So it will be, will you have to become a citizen? And then uk? Yes. Well, but the only citizen is almost impossible for someone, for someone who's worn a Mexican citizen, unless of course you have a close blood relative, you are generally out of luck. I mean sort of the idea of why don't they just go and get in line. The answer is for most people on earth and want to come the line last hundreds of years, they could never legally come like the conditions for legal immigration. So they really all four, if you are a low skill worker, it's pretty much limited to having a blood relative already the US or marriage, right?

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Uh, then, you know, there's a couple other way on, a couple of other ways of doing it, but those are extraordinarily rare. So for most people in Third World Right now, there is no possibility they'll ever, they will ever be admitted no matter what. Right? And in, to me it's like, well, why is it that because the person chose the wrong parents, they were born in the wrong country, that they have to be stuck living in Haiti their whole life and he and you know, so people can very easily see the injustice saying because someone is born black, you are stuck living in black areas of black areas of the United States and you can only be a janitor. You can only go and, and we're uh, and uh, you can, you can only work as a porter on a train or something like that. And it's like, why is it that he has to be treated differently just because he chose the wrong parents? And to me this, this argument is a very powerful one. And St. Well, how is that different from choosing to have Haitian parents? Of course, the point is no one chooses parents. You're just be all yell like it's something that had happened before you were born. Why is it that a person, if you can go and find a way, a will, a willing landlord find a willing employer, why can't you say yes to those jobs and come and live here and work here we are.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       So would there be an inherent problem that if, okay, you let all these people in now they're not citizens per se, so they don't have the right to vote, but they're here, they're using our economy, they're contributing to our economy, all that. All the good stuff that you said that eventually we could get a situation where you might have parody of the amount of people

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       that are voting and the people that are living here that seems like it could become a problem. Right? So I mean again, I would say it's not clear why they are not clear why that's a problem. Me and like one of the main things about immigrants as they tend to be a political. So when you moved to a new country normally like your concerns are, I got to find a good place to live. I gotta go, I gotta go and get a job, take care of my kids, and getting involved in the politics of the country is usually the last thing on people's minds when they, when they first, when they first come. I mean one of the strangest complaints about immigrants to me is that they have low, low, low voting rates and I say, well, you know, some. I have some. I think I've heard people say, well first they got the wrong way and second of all they don't vote.

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       It's like you pick one of the complaints at least. So I'm yelling in terms of what the, what their kids will do. So again, so on your under current US law, there's birthright citizenship. So their kid, their kids would be alive. Say there is. United States has a long tradition of assimilating the children of immigrants. It is. Well, it's worked very well for a rev American history and people often think, well yeah, it worked back then back when we really tried to assimilate them, but it doesn't work anymore. Where I can say is for the things that we measure, things are the things are as good now as they were in the Ellis island days. So especially for light, for language competence, it was never through. We have something special here in America that they don't have in Europe. So for example, I, I agree with you there.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       I think there's a lot of evidence of it that people still do assimilate more here, but where Europe is having a problem with assimilation, which is a culture problem and that's different, right? Right. So two things. First thing is I'd say that a lot of the problems that people talk about are primarily problems on television. So there's an enormous amount of simulation simulation going in Europe, but that's not TV. You don't go and have a TV show saying you know, enormous number of Pakistanis now like soccer and root for Manchester United and speak with British accents and had British jobs and do regular stuff. That's not a story. Whereas you'll hear is here's a neighborhood is a no go area. Where were the regular British police dare not travel for fear of what might happen to them. Sharia law, my kid, I'm gonna. Come on at any moment the seminar might come out.

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       That's a story. All right. So first step is always to separate scary stories from Cisco reality. And what I say is it is true that Europe does a worse job of getting assimilation of the US. They still have a lot of assimilation. I remember the, like the last time I was in Paris, I was just amazed at all these simulation that I saw at his work and walking downtown and seeing people from all over the world, but they're looking and acting French now they, they're smoking cigarettes in a French way. It was like wow, she's drinking. Right? And it's like wow, that guy looks like he's from, from, from, from Chad or something like that. But, but he's, you know, he has like the turtle neck. So I mean like, you know, like you actually see a lot of assimilation on. Yeah, I was truly have blessing simulation.

Speaker 2:          01:04:59       But they're a, you're saying like, is there something special that we have? So there's nothing special we have is a more restrictive welfare states so you know, so Europeans, you know, so again, it varies a lot by country. It's important important to it to realize that. But you're being. Henry's in general do have much more expensive welfare states especially to make it easier be on welfare for your entire life. Right? And I think this does, this does great harm to their assimilation because one of the best ways of assimilating is to go to a job and to go in or interact from Po with people that aren't from your culture. You know, even if you know, of course a lot of the workers won't be even if all the workers, if you go in and work in a, in a, in a chatty and restaurant, even then a lot of your customers won't be from Chad.

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       And so you will get to know them, you'll interact with them. Of course you need to go and let you learn the language. But also you get to know people. And so this is the kind of assimilation that has been greatly undermined by your, by European welfare states. Again, it's important to realize that there's actually two kinds of things going on. One of them is a lot of free government money. Another one is labor market regulations that raised the price of labor that make it hard to get a job. And he put those two things together. That's when you have a recipe for people living their whole living their life on it. So again, it's. So you'd say, well maybe they'll. They might like to get a job, but if it's really hard to get a job because regulation and you get enough money to stay alive, that's where you are likely to say, fine, screw it. I'm just going to go and live in my ghetto and I won't and I'll never even learned French and it's going to stay here and I'm going to be bitter.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       So people think that those things are at odds with each other. Open borders and a welfare state in a way. But basically you're saying if you, if, if you open the border and you took away the welfare state at the same time,

Speaker 2:          01:06:32       you actually forced assimilation. Yes. Yes. So, you know, so you're not literally forced to create conditions, but the current system, especially in Europe has heavily subsidizing not assimilation. Right. And I think that's a mistake and you get, I think it's a case where people so naturally scapegoat immigrants for the problem when you didn't say, well, we have some really crummy laws which actually would lead soil a lot of people to go. And of course plenty of people who are native born free France who go about who, uh, have their ancestors were galls. Uh, you know, plenty of people like this are also in France sitting around being supported by the welfare state for their entire life. Which again, you know, so important. Remember, it's not just people being lazy, it's also being very discouraged that the regulations make it so hard to get a job.

Speaker 1:          01:07:18       Yeah. So I, I get your point a about the, you know, forcing once people are here and then we put them on this and then they're sort of stuck in that creates resentment and then people in present them for that and all that stuff. Um, what about the culture part of it that there's, we do have to acknowledge that cultures are different, that they respect different things. They honor different things. They not every culture is tolerant and that we could eventually start bringing in people who are intolerant of our freedoms.

Speaker 2:          01:07:48       Right? Regardless of whether that's overblown on the news or not. I get your point. Yeah. So I think it's overblown. So I mean, so again, theoretically possible. Yes. Uh, but um, you know, here's the striking thing all over the world and the most progressive countries. What is it that they feel about culture that you feel like America is destroying their culture? So in Iran, they've long had this word they call West toxification, west toxification. It's the idea. There's all these horrible western ideas flooding into Iran, alienating your child read and destroying Islam. And here's why I say they're right. Because when like La Western culture is awesome, people around the world love it, especially young people and if governments around the world want to stop it, they have to do the resort to extreme measures in order to keep it out. Right. And what does immigration do at weddings and brings the people who brings people straight to the western culture where their governments can no longer get between them and the culture.

Speaker 2:          01:08:40       And the main thing that happens is that people go native, right? So again, they may, they also get, there's always some people on the news who were refusing to do it, but there are, but there is a much larger group. People who moved to the West and they made, you know, they may pay lip service to their home culture, but they actually go and assimilate to the new culture. Meaning here's my favorite test. If you want to go and find out how much a simulation is there, talk to any immigrant parents and what will they tell you to immigrant parents. So they are, they say, Oh yeah, my kid loves us, loves Romanian culture. All he thinks about is Romania. Romania, Romania, all day being remaining is so central to his life. No. What, what, what, what do you know? So yeah, my wife, my wife is from a radio.

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       So the normal thing for your Manian immigrant parents, it's like almost any immigrant parents is to say, I thought we could preserve our culture, but my kid just doesn't care about it. I talked to my kid and Romanian and they answer me back in English and my grandkids don't speak a word Romania and they have no interest in this stuff. Right. And again to say over the old video, so I'll just do basically Americanism where western is in. Will actually wait. Yes. Yes. So I. So I have a blog post called Western civilization is a hardy weed and says, look, you know, I believe in Western civilization much more than most of the people who say they defend it because I think we're gonna I think we are winning right now. And I think with open borders we will win sooner, right? We'll, uh, and so many of this is the kind of thing where someone, someone watching it in rand might say, ah, he knew Kaplan had a plot by plot.

Speaker 2:          01:10:08       So yes, I mean some, I do think that Western civilization is the better civilization in most ways. I'm always happy to learn from other cultures and to have a cosmopolitan combination of all of the best things. But nevertheless, I think that when we compile all of the best things in the world, I think 80 percent of the stuff is going to come from Western civilization. Uh, so maybe we'll pick up the work ethic from China or something like that. And we revitalized the work ethic. So I think they've, they've got something to offer there. But what do like that about? So again, my plan is to go and spread Western civilization more quickly and effectively through immigration. Right? And I think I'd say it is working right here, right now. I get to say like even Los Angeles where people look around and say, I don't see people assimilating.

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       You always look at, well, what is the generation of the immigrants it? It's a first generation immigrant. Then sure they have an assemble aided. They never did. It was never true that first generation immigrants became fluent in English if they can't, if they arrived in their twenties. Right, right. They always had trouble. They always stuck to the old ways. Assimilation is always worked on the second generation. If you go and talk to a second generation, Mexican American in La, the automobile speak fluent in English or 90 percent. Right? All y'all so and even for even like kids who were first generation, as long as they came with their young, so fluent English by far the norm. So again, I just been going, going, going, been going over this data so we can like the main reason why we feel like Hispanic immigrants aren't assimilating and just because in the past it was normal to have like one generation wave of Germans and then it stopped. One generation wave of Swedes are Italians and then it stopped. So then in a couple generations there's no longer any Italian. The Italians in America who don't, who don't speak English, but it's not because the first generation learned English, it's because the first generation died and Italian stop coming. So you know, I don't again, I don't see that again, like when you understand what a simulation is about, it's about changing. The second generation is still going on at enormous levels. So we are already the sizing Latin America right now.

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       Yeah. The wave part of this is interesting because I think when people talk about the Ellis island thing and they think of, you know, like the lower east side of Brooklyn in New York City, Brooklyn, you know from 60 years ago when all these Irish and German and Jews and all these other people came that yeah, it was that first generation that had, that worked incredibly hard, barely spoken language, lived more sheltered and then. And then the rest of what you said basically happened and they move throughout the face. All right, let's do one more thing before I let you go. Passive, isn't that my policy on this by the way? Did Not look at the notes once, which is a good interview. Alright. Uh, so you've already done well passivism my particular policy on this is that I believe in a strong defense basically so that we don't have to use it. I don't want to nation build, I don't think we should be all over the place creating empires and all that, but I do believe you need a strong defense so that people won't mess with you. Yeah. So how do you like that? Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       so if you want peace, prepare for war anyhow, ancient, ancient Roman saying. Um, so, uh, just so we just want to sit back and say, you said what are you? Oh, so what is passivism and then what's the art? What is the argument for it? So again, my passion is my don't. I don't mean never resisting violence. So I don't mean that if someone is coming in with an ax you shouldn't fight back or anything like that. Um, so and so, and I'll rather, what I mean by passivism is opposition to war, right? And so they'll stay organized, violence organized by governments. And again, so what exactly, how exactly is that different in any of the answer is that war is actually almost never defensive in the sense that all of them were almost always involves either deliberately murdering or recklessly killing innocent people. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:13:39       So this is really like, isn't it theoretically possible that it wouldn't be that way? Sure. But in practice, anytime you fight any kind of a serious war, you either wind up deliberately murdering, murdering a whole bunch of civilians, or you wind up recklessly endangering them where you go when you drop a bomb in the general vicinity of a whole bunch of civilians and you killed them as collateral damage. What's the big deal? You know, if the police thought crime the same way that the US government wages, wages, war on the USB, oh this would be way bigger protest than anything that we're getting right now because you need to go in. So I would say you're now, I, so I mean like so literally a minimum just seems to me like there is some moral problem with war. So which again is glossed over by the, uh, yeah, well, it's, we're just defending ourselves.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       We'll normally, you're defending yourself by sales, by murdering a bunch of innocent people. So, you know, at first glance, this seems like it's a problem. People often want to say no, there's no innocence on the other side. It's like there's no innocent babies in the other country. There's no one who has never done anything. It seems like this is a pretty flimsy defense. And then there's also the, well anyone we kill is totally on the hands of the bad guys that we're fighting against. It's like, so really. So like what if you went in like bomb people in the neighboring country with that beyond the hands of the bad guys to like, why exactly is it that like, is there some limit to what you can blame on the bad guys? I mean, it's one thing if you've got someone holding a hostage right there and they're shooting.

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       But again, what if say there's just a bunch of, there's a school next to the next to a criminal. Can you go and bomb the school? Because. Well, it's, that's on him, you know, the fact that we killed that to all the kids in that school, like the light sad, but you know, we were just trying to get that one murderer St. well, anything that seems like a very flimsy defense now again. So like I am actually never an absolutist. Uh, so I'm always willing to say, right, maybe we have to do this terrible thing for the greater good. Right. So I always want to be open to that argument, but that's where I say, all right, well let's actually go and carefully look at how much, how, how great is this good and how certain can you really be the audits. So, uh, you know, so then you know, just to back up.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       So you know, so anyway, so like you know, the, you know, the argument for bassmans first APP is just accepting the harsh reality. That war is not really defensive. It does involve actually going and murdering or at least man slaughtering a whole lot of innocent people. And like no matter the nicest country wages, war, the most careful one does this, that with modern weaponry will be hard to do otherwise. Can that, can that be in and of itself moral though, like so in case in the case of World War II where we weren't our homeland, well Pearl Harbor, but our, our homeland wasn't threatened by the Nazis per se, by we killed a lot of people and the allies firebombed, Dresden and all that. But we also have been saved a lot. Again, that's one of the like. So that's that next step. But again, first step is just accepting that the, that the United States government murdered a lot of innocent key.

Speaker 2:          01:16:31       A lot of Sun innocent people. They murdered in the United States government murdered children, right? They did the kind of thing that we attack terrorists for, which is like, which is murdering a bunch of innocent people for the grill because you think it's for the greater good. And again, normally when we, when we, when we attacked it, when we say terrorists are terrible people for this, we don't have some big factual argument about how what they're doing isn't really for the greater good. It's like you murdered innocent people. That's a terrible thing to do, right? So you know, it's just like there's at least a moral presumption against this, which maybe it can be overcome again for the greater good. But that's where I say that ceos. So there's this great philosophical example involving a doctor who's got five patients a week, you need a different organ donation, and then a guy walks by who happens to be perfectly healthy and the doctor thinks maybe I should go and murder that guy at harvest his organs, and then he searches and he has no family, no one's really going to miss this guy.

Speaker 2:          01:17:22       I can save five lives by murdering one person. Seems like a good idea. All right. Now people's normal reaction to this is horrible. And the den. And if you start brand new guy, start ramping up the numbers. Maybe it's a million people already, but anyway, at least that five to one ratio seems to really bother people and say, no, you can't go and deliberately murdered a person to save five other people. All right, so it is this. It is this premise that I bring in, in my case against war saying, look, all right, now maybe that there's a, there's a war for the greater good, but are you actually getting something like this five to one ratio, right? And furthermore, how confident can you really be? And that's right. Bring in the last body of evidence, which is that people's predictions about the results of war are terrible.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       So again, the whole idea of prediction is you have to say what you think is gonna happen before it happens and then you look at what occurs and see how accurate your prediction was. Alright? So, uh, there is a fantastic political psychologist named Phil tetlock who ran a big experiment along these lines. So in the 19 eighties he went and asked a bunch of foreign policy experts their predictions and then 20 years later came back and weighed their predictions against the actual results and they did really badly. Right? And so this is experimental evidence on people's, but people's ability to forecast the actual long run benefits of war are very poor. Of course we don't really need to do experiments. We can just go to the views about what happened would have happened in Rwanda. Rwanda were all sides are saying out of the trenches by Christmas.

Speaker 2:          01:18:46       No one is saying I think this will end in communist revolution. And certainly no one was saying, well I think the long run result of this will be a communist regime in North Korea. A country doesn't even exist right now. And yet if you know your history, that is what it costs. What would that is the key events in why there's communism North Korea. So now if you snap these pieces together, so moral presumption against more five to one ratio or something like that, minimum in order for it to be justified. And then finally, great uncertainty about what the effects of war are. That's where I get my case for passivism. It's like anytime there's a war, anytime there is someone proposing more by accident. All right. So like first of all, so he's even, isn't even a plausible that the, that you are going to say five times as many lives as you are going to murder here. And, and is it reasonable to be that confident given how bad most people's track records are? Right. And if you put that together that I say that for almost any actual war is really hard to make the case and the case in his favor.

Speaker 1:          01:19:40       So let's say there were some terrorists in Tiawana firing rockets into San Diego where you're writing in a couple of days and they keep firing these rockets or they're sending people in to shoot people in San Diego or something. You would be, you would be for doing something.

Speaker 2:          01:19:57       Sure, sure. You're taking police action. Absolutely. Like normally it's actually not bombing Tijuana. I mean, I think that's a case where as long as they were Muslim terrorists and Ilana, I don't think most Americans would bombing tijuana even if the Mexicans were floundering around and couldn't figure out what to do. I don't. They also, as long as the Mexican said, you can go and send in America, American troops to deal with this, but don't go bombing us. Don't go machine gunning whole villages of people. Also, again, some of you, again, so I've no objection to anything like that, but anytime someone starts talking about waging war with modern weaponry, where you're going to start murdering a lover, you like Bernie inevitably murder or manslaughter, right? Again, salesforce and be murdered, or you'd have to be trying to kill them. Manslaughter is just when you recklessly endanger them, a buddy at anytime you're talking about something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:20:42       That's where my past, this group is getting in the way and I think, and this is another case where when someone fights award and ends really badly, then it's like, well, what can you do? But if someone opposes a war eventually badly, it's like, ah, passive. It's a terrible idea like this one, but like you have caused all these problems, you know, so you know, I would say, look, you know, I think think it is a, is a, is a fair historical point to say almost every, almost every story and, or anyone who knows any facts about the world and say, look, just would have been better if any one of the major powers to just rendered, if any one of the major powers will robot it just said, look, we give in you when we'll do what you want and that would have prevented so many terrible things.

Speaker 2:          01:21:22       Most obviously world war and yet people. And yet people will say, well look, passivism would've led to disaster world war two, if we'd been this, it wouldn't. There wouldn't have been in world war one. So maybe we should get credit for that. Right? It's almost like the actions lead to other actions. Actions lead to other actions. Now again, notice what I'm not. I'm not claiming that we have like no clue at all about whether we're. We'll do so. So the uncertainty by itself doesn't really argue for or against war. It's the uncertainty combined with this high threshold. They're saying you've got to actually know that you're saving five times as many lives they're killing before we should even be thinking, even be talking about this. And that's where the uncertainty is hard because it is a barrier to war because you like, like saying it's a close call. Well like say with Sandia passivism has all close calls, go to peace. You don't doubt fixe if it's a close call because you're murdering innocent people. So there's a very high threshold responsibility. Again, you know, so a higher even than the one of you for spending taxpayer money, you ought to know you're really doing something good with it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:19       Right? Well, I have thoroughly enjoyed this. We barely got into half of what I was going to talk about where we're going to do this again. How about that? Awesome. Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah. I really enjoyed this and I hope you guys did too. And for more of Brian's work, you can check out be Kaplan.com and it's Caplan with a c. So it's B, c, a p l a n.com.
