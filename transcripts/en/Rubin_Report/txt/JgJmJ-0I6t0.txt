Speaker 1:          00:00:05       With six days left to the election, it's incredible how little public discourse this past year has had do with the actual issues. Immigration has become a meme fest revolving around trump's proposed wall. Abortion was basically relegated to one three minute exchange in the final debate. There's been virtually nothing on legalizing marijuana, the war on drugs or reforming our prison system. Foreign policy has been reduced to trump saying he can't tell us what he's going to do so that he doesn't tip anyone off versus Hillary promoting her experience, much of which was a disaster. There's been pretty much no talk of infrastructure or education, but a whole lot on genital grabbing and hacked emails. My hope is that this is the last election will ever have were seemingly every major issue is neglected, and the minute he said she said, get center stage. Out of all of this anger and frustration in general lunacy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       I really do believe that something good will rise from the ashes. The majority of us want to talk about the real issues. We don't want to demonize everyone. We don't want to be pandered to and we do want to find solutions. We got in this political mess this year because for so long we've allowed the system to let the lowest common denominator rise to the top. Maybe we needed this freak show to happen so that the masses, the silent majority, would finally wake up and realize that it's actually our lives, our welfare, and our families on the line. Every generation has something new to fight for and maybe for this generation, the fight will be to recreate a system by the people and for the people. That's why the next few years are going to be an incredibly important piece of history where we sit back and let the worst of us continue to take control or will we fight back?

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Will we find allies where we used to find enemies and what we stand for principles even when it's not popular to do so. I really believe that will do the right thing, but the only way we'll do it is by really discussing issues and not the side show. Let's demand that our leaders explain why they believe in what they believe, why they vote, the way they vote, and why they deserve the right to speak for us as citizens. Let's step back from the scandals and the screaming and focus on education and empowerment. Politicians in the media aren't going to magically just become better. We have to demand that they do and the only way that we can demand it is if we demand it from ourselves. We can start by being outspoken instead of just outraged. This week we're continuing our collaboration with learn liberty. We're teaming up with learn liberty once a month to talk to professors, thought leaders and authors on a wide variety of topics all related to free speech and classical liberalism to things we could certainly use a little more of these days. Joining me this week is Dr Steve Davies. Dr Davis is head of education at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London. He's also a lecturer and a historian whose research includes crime and criminal justice, the history of ideas and political thought, comparative economic

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       history, and much more. In short, this guy knows his stuff and we're going to get into all of it or at least as much as we can in an hour. So sit back, take a break from the sound bytes and distractions and open your minds to the issues that matter. Your brain will thank you and your country will too.

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       We're continuing our monthly collaboration with my friends with learn liberty. This week my guest is head of education at the Institute for Economic Affairs in London as well as a historian and lecturer and he flew all the way across the pond to be here. Dr Steve Davies. Welcome to the show. Thank you very much. Glad to be here. I heard you got held up by President Obama, so we did. We just got told that a vip was going through the airport and so they have just shut it down for half an hour. So we were held up. I guess he must have been really important. Yeah. After 11 and a half hour flight, you don't even want to hear that it's the president or there's nobody really that. Absolutely. So. All right. There's so much that I want to do with you and I watched a ton of your learn liberty videos, so I'm. I'm pretty well versed in some of the stuff that you're well versed in.

Speaker 2:          00:04:05       First, did you want to come to America just one more time before our election? Well, absolutely. There's something really strange going on here in the United States. I think it's fair to say, although maybe not that strange because I actually think that what's happening with Donald Trump is pulse for more widespread phenomenon in most western democracies, which is the rise of a kind of politics. It's commonly described, I think misleadingly as right wing populism and what it actually is is a politics that combines left of center economics, strong support for the welfare state with an extremely unpleasant kind of nativism and she globalism and nationalism, and that's pretty much where Donald Trump is coming from. It's straightforward Hamiltonian economic nationalism combined with a very unpleasant kind of identity politics, I would say, but he's not alone. He's possibly much bigger phenomenon. Okay, so let's unpack a couple of those phrases.

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       So you'd say this isn't a right wing phenomenon because his politics are kind of are kind of lame, right? Uh, and that it's that, but he is using nationalism so that, that is more of the right side. What, what were the other parts that were the source of support for the welfare state support for the strictly national basis, I mean, the correct name for this kind of politics I think is nationalist collectivism. You could call it national socialism, but the kinds of being claimed already that might be a little too scary, too scary. It's nationalist collectivism basically. And it's on the rise across most Western democracies. Few exceptions like Spain, Portugal, Ireland, but otherwise this is the kind of politics that we see on the rise everywhere. I'm afraid Marine Le Pen in France get builders in the Netherlands, Donald Trump here pretty much everywhere. Canada is another exception.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       So what is happening globally that has caused that? This isn't just a fun. I mean I think everyone in America thinks everything is about us all the time and this is just our phenomenon. It has nothing to do with anything else, but what's happening? Well, there are two things. I think one of them is that a lot of the support for this kind of politics comes from older working class voters in what you would call the rust belt, a decade x industrial areas where life has not been good for quite a long time and these people feel that they're ignored by the political establishment, that the system is not working in their interests and that kicking back. Yeah. That's one reason. And some of that you think you would argue is legit, right? Yeah. It's legitimate. Yeah. Dude, they're quite right. You know, life has been pretty hard for them for quite a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       The other thing though, which I actually think is more important is it's to do with the politics of identity. Uh, it's to do with a feeling that a certain kind of identity is under threat from the process of globalization. Cosmopolitanism, maybe political correctness, a whole bunch of stuff like that. So there's a very powerful cultural reaction, a reassertion of a certain kind of identity. Uh, and I think that is what is really potent and really driving this kind of politics. So how much of that is just a reaction to some of this stuff happening on the left? That's, you know, I, I come from the left, so that's the part that I've been focusing on and I do see a certain element of the rise of trump and the political correctness stuff and you know, the social justice warrior stuff. I see it as a natural reaction to what has happened on the left or maybe maybe in Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       It's more because of immigration that these marine Le Pen for example, et Cetera. I think that there is an element of truth in both of those things. Actually. Undoubtedly the push button issue, uh, as we saw in the brexit referendum in the UK for example, uh, and with Marion Le Pen is immigration, particularly immigration from the Middle East, but also from other parts of the world as well. But that's in a way is not so much because of immigration per se. It's because the way in which large scale movement into people is seemed to be transforming and changing the nature of a settled and established a national community. And now I think that in terms of particularly the United States, yes, there is quite a lot of pushback against, uh, the kind of a social justice warrior as you alluded to a pc politics on the left and in particular the politics of identity.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       If you're going to push a politics of identity where apparently the only group who aren't allowed to have an identity are white working class men. Sooner or later those kinds of people are going to say, well, hold on a minute. You know, I have this identity to which you are not respecting your own terms. So there's a lot of pushback coming on and I think that shows how really the response that liberals need to have, and I would include many people on the left in that category should be one way. You were certainly importance of individualism and the identity as being something that to a great degree is personally chosen and formed rather than being something that's given to you. And fixed in some way. Yeah, I mean I love that and that's exactly how my own evolution has happened over the last couple of years. Coming out of progressivism, which is more about the collective to ultimately realize I would only want to be judged by my own thoughts and my own actions, so let's circle back a little bit to to Europe and then we'll do our elections. Now we're getting some big stuff. So when it comes to the immigration situation all over Europe, I sense what you're saying is there's a certain natural reaction to people coming in and not assimilating properly or whatever else.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       There may be the economic strains and all that stuff. What? What is the proper solution for all these countries now? Because the cat's out of the bag already,

Speaker 2:          00:09:03       right? Well actually a lot of the responses misguided in my view because for example, there was a widespread perception feeling that immigration imposes costs on the countries that the immigrants go to. All of the research I was actually. This is not the case. Immigrants are actually extremely good news because typically they are younger than the host population. They are almost always in work. They come to look for work, they want to do productive labor, how can that be a problem you might say, and so typically they are tax payers rather than tax consumers. They typically make a net contribution to the budget. They do not depress wages because typically they do work that the indigenous population either can't or won't do usually because they lack the skillset. They do have a marginal depressing effect on the wages of the bottom 10 percent of the income range, but that's about it, but there's a widespread misconception or misunderstanding of what the economics of immigration is actually a balance and that's a failure of public education really.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       So that's part of it. I think the more profound thing though is a feeling that there's a threat to an established indigenous culture and I think the response here is to simply be more confident. I have enormous confidence in the Assembler to power of the culture of a free society and I think the thing to do is not to say, okay, here are people who are asserting a particular collective cultural identity. What we need to do is assert our own one in response to that and aggressively against that verse one, the thing to do is to emphasize individualism and the degree to which are modern free society is one where people are free to form that shape their own identity through the choices that they make and that should be true for everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:10:38       Right? So in a way you're. You're looking at it in sort of the macro sense of are we should deal with all this a certain amount of the people on the ground, they just don't see it that way because they see where you are. These people coming in, even if the job thing is incorrect, they feel that their jobs are being taken. So when I, when I read stories about things like in Germany that I saw something that it was going to cost one point 4 billion euros to give the refugees or the migrants dental care, I mean these things are just not true. Basically

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       that isn't true. If you look at the areas where there are problems, these are all areas where it's the state that is in boulder as a major provider. You do not see grocery stores panicking because they suddenly have to find food products and other products for new customers on the country. They look at it as a business opportunity. The private sector everywhere actually sees large scale movement of people as being, as I say, an opportunity. Not a problem. It's the areas where the state is involved that you find problems. And what that shows us is actually the incompetence inefficiency of modern governments as compared to the private sector.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       So even if we viewed everyone as the, as the individual that we're going to talk a lot about the individual here, um, do you think there's possibly something different with this wave of immigration related to terrorism and we know that there's a certain amount of people that isis wants to infiltrate and cross borders that there is something different about this. Because even if all of us in the west say it's about individualism and let's judge people individually and by their actions and all those things. If a certain amount of people don't want to assimilate what, what do you do then?

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Well, in in in one sense, not assimilating is not in and of itself a problem where I live in Manchester then so well established Jewish community, been there since the 18, eighties and nineties. These people are Hacidic Jews, very strict, ultra orthodox. A lot of them are lubavitch has actually, and they're not assimilated in some sense. It's totally never watched television, for example, against their beliefs and sold, but nobody I think would regard that as a problem. From my point of view. It just means I've got a wonderful bakery in May, was fantastic bagels, right? The problem is, as you say, the Association of a certain category of migrants from the Middle East with Islamic terrorism. Now what's the best way to respond to that? That is a difficult issue on my own view, very much is that the. The ultimate solution is to try and sort out the complete mess at the Middle East has become a, but in the short term, essentially this is a policing problem. What you definitely don't want to think about is dealing with this as a problem of military security is essentially a law enforcement problem.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       Right? So as someone that doesn't love state power, does it make you nervous that you have to sort of give a certain amount of state power to the police or to the border controls or whatever to actually make sure that they're doing the right job?

Speaker 2:          00:13:24       Yes, I am nervous about that. And what I would say by the way is that the kind of increase in state surveillance which has been put through in the United Kingdom, for example, by our current prime minister when she was in a previous job as home secretary, is actually counterproductive in that regard because basically if you think about the trust of the security services of golf, they're looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. So if that's the case, why do you then make the haystack even bigger? By intercepting virtually everybody's email. That actually makes our job more difficult, not easier. And so I think that actually what really you need is good old fashioned undercover intelligence work, which means penetrating organizations. Identifying key people, you basically try and keep an eye on and good old fashioned spy work really. It's always going to work, but that's the way to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       It's interesting because you're making a real argument for limited government and the slim trim government through, through a prism that a lot of people don't think of it. They think we need big government to protect us from things and, and have surveillance and all of these things that people that are for it, but you're really making an argument for if you actually took a lot of that away, might be a more efficient way of killing me. It will be much more effective in my view. Huh. That's really interesting. So let's, let's talk about brexit a little bit because I did a little bit of it on this show and uh, you know, I'm constantly talking about how our American media doesn't give us much of anything. So we didn't hear about it at all. Then two days before everybody was freaking out about it. We saw it on twitter, then it happened that we don't talk

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       about it again. Yeah. So for people that have no idea what happened, can you just give me a little history of it and then, and then where we're at now, Britain's relationship with the European Union has always been, I think, a bit fraught and difficult. It's been like one of those unhappy marriages, if you will, were outside just wonder why all those two people together. Uh, the reason being that British politicians on the British public ever since we first joined the European Economic Community, sees that then was in 1973 have always seen as being basically about economics. It's all about getting economic advantage on the constant after they'd been equally clan right since the Messina conference in 1954. But this is all about building a political union. So they see it as part of the kind of grand political project. And the British politicians always say, oh, they don't really mean that these continentals this is just rhetoric, which of course is actually quite offensive.

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       And not surprisingly, the continentals get a bit irritated by this attitude. So essentially there's a growing mismatch between what the British public think the EU should be. And the actual nature of that project, and that's got significantly worse since the Maastricht treaty, so it caused all kinds of internal political reactions and David Cameron in what I have to say. It was a grotesque act of misjudgment from his own perspective called a referendum to try and sort out his internal politics. And now in that referendum, everyone thought the expectation was that the status quo would win. I must say I expected that. So that's basically why he called it because he was empowering, figured out, call it, they'll agree with me and that'll sort out my party problem. That's because generally speaking, referenda normally go for the status quo. And in this case, the overwhelming majority of members of parliament, most of the respected pundits, most economists, virtually all of the big business firms that were asked the Bank of England, pretty much any authority figure you care to mention said, yes, you need to vote remain.

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       So what took place was a popular insurgency and in which the ordinary British public thought, well, no, we don't agree with this. And they basically went against the advice of the bulk of the political media business leadership. Now the vote that came together to a vote leave, if you will, was basically a coalition of three quite distinct groups. I think on the one hand you had what you might call Brexit Shyer. A older conservative voters, typically a middleclass, slightly older, living in the countryside, living in the affluent suburbs, and that's one block. So that's a little bit of the people that you described voting for trump. It's a little bit, slightly more moderate. The second group, however, Arlette people who voted for trump, this is older white working class voters in the traditional labour heartlands of the northeast of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire, the voting, some constituencies that like Sunderland, which is our current of say scratch and Wilkes Barre.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       That was a 69 percent vote for leave, an absolute landslide. And that was, it was that block of what you might call a populist voters working class that put leave over. The third very small group, which I belong to, is what you might call radical classical liberals who are very small group. But again, you could say we made the difference in some ways because what we wanted to us to be able to have a greater range of options for the British government by being outside of the year, use controls and constraints. So there's those three blocks of people that voted for leave basically.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Yeah. I like radical classical liberals because I've been saying classical liberals. It sounds too to benign or something. Radical has a little something extra there. So. Okay. So when it was happening and you, you say you were part of this, uh, did you expect the vote to go that way? Because as you're saying, the entire establishment was saying, don't do it. It's not going to happen. The polls were showing it wasn't going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       No, I always thought it was going to be tight. But my own expectation was that it was going to be about 51 percent remained to 49 percent leave because normally in referenda like this, the undecided voters who make up their mind at the last minute split to two, one for the status quo. Now, I actually think they did here. But what happened was that the polls d underestimated the leaves share of the vote by about five percent. The reason being a lot of the people who voted leave are people who did not normally vote, and pollsters always discount people who say that they don't vote, so they got their sampling wrong, and so they underestimated the, the, the share of the vote that leaves going to get.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       So looping this back to trump, because I see such parallels here, I suspect the exact same thing is gonna happen. I'm not saying trump's going gonna win, but I do suspect there a depression in the polls because a certain amount of his supporters now either aren't being pulled for whatever they're in places that they're not polling or they don't want. They don't want to be publicly shamed or admitted or something like that. So I sent that. What you're talking about here, this groundswell of support that was not spoken of, I, I suspect that's happening right now. Do you think that's fair? Right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:40       Do think so? I think there's two things going on there. One is what century here in Los Angeles needs is known as the Tom Bradley, if people are not honest in the answers that gives the pollsters, uh, but also I think that actually the pollsters samples are probably slightly wrong. They're probably a, not counting the correct number of trump voters because one of the things he did during the primaries was to bring a record number of people into the primary process who had never voted before. Now, what I suspect that means is he's going to be much more competitive than it currently appears to be in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, uh, maybe even Michigan and Arizona where I think there's a significant number of people who have not voted before who will vote.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       Yeah. What do you make of when you see Nigel farrage come here and speak at trump rallies? W, what do you make of the connection between the two of them? And, and is this really, you know, if when I click on info wars, a link or some of the other things, the more right things, Breitbart, that really they're fighting the globalists, the globalists are coming here. I think there's some degree to a one world government thing that's trying to formulate, but like how much it feels so conspiratorial. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       I that that's exactly the kind of alignment that I was talking about these books, but Nigel farage and Ukip in the UK, Donald trump hair, that part of the nationalist reaction against the increased cosmopolitanism globalization that we've seen in the last 20 to 30 years. Uh, there's a feeling that this transnational organizations that are pushing an agenda they don't like, but basically it's more a kind of localism or hostility to cosmopolitanism and to globalism. And you see that on both sides of the Atlantic. Now. That's a politics I strongly reject. But you can't deny the reality of the existence of it. Yeah. And that's what makes it so hard to talk about because it's not fun to talk about something you reject, but no, to be honest, to be a classical liberal, you have to acknowledge that something's happening, which is it's no point in ignoring this.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       Maybe if you disagree with something, with a belief that a lot of people have, the thing to do is to engage with it when you have to do is to actually talk to these people, respect their views, but show them that you think they are mistaken and here's why that mistake. Yeah. Okay, so now brexit happens. Yeah. Everyone said the next day the markets are going to crash, the economy is going to crash, everything will be over. We're going to be fighting for bread or have you had red light? No, no, no problem. The. I think we're still the funding goal stage right now. I think this going to be an enormous and quite serious political route with the United Kingdom the next few months. The big question that was, okay, what do we do? And there are really two routes that the British government can take quite simply to simplify it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       One is they can go for what's a membership of what's called the European economic area, which means that we would be a bit like Norway. Now. That means we would have access to the European single market regime, but we will still be bound by lots of EU regulations while no longer having any say in how, what they were or how they were formed. So that's sort, sorta like, that's sort of like staying in the EU but light. Exactly, exactly. And the, um, uh, the thing, the other alternative is to say, well, we don't want to do that. We basically wanted negotiate a free trade deal with the Aau. The trouble is that wants to resume my triggers, what's called article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which is the withdrawal process. It's got a strict two year limit and it's not clear that you can negotiate a two year, a free trade deal in just two years.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       So that would throw us back a pot just membership of the World Trade Organization, which means that will then be a six and a half percent tarriff between Britain and Europe. Now, that's probably more than compensated for by the decline in the value of the pound that's taken place, but it's still not, not very welcome. Now the the critical political thing is the city of London, a seven percent of British GDP would lose its passporting rights. It would not be able to do euro denominated business unless we're in the European economic area. The problem politically for Theresa May and the government is that the Europeans have been very reasonably in what you're saying, look, if you become member of the EA, you have to accept free movement of Labor. That's part of the deal. You don't cherry pick your conditions, which seems perfectly reasonable to me, and the problem is that for political reasons, because so many of the people who voted leave did so on anti immigration grounds.

Speaker 2:          00:23:43       She is not all of them, but a significant portion of them. Sure she's not prepared to do that, and so the result is that they have, it looks like we're going to actually not applied to join the eea effectively and that's going to cause enormous political ructions. Now in the longer term, I think the British economy will do fine. There may be some, some will be some losers, probably the city of London. There'll be some gangers though, a manufacturers in particular, an export as consumers because the price of goods like food will go down, it'll even out it's a bit of a wash ready, but in the short term is going to be quite a lot of political fireworks, so all that being said aren't those subtle reasons that brexit was actually the right decision because you guys still have to sort of negotiate things with the EU in a weird way that allow them to have power over you and that was what the whole purpose of leading way.

Speaker 2:          00:24:33       So in a way it's like better to do it now than 10 years when a lot of this stuff has even been tight. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean the point is what brexit does, and this was my main reason for voting for. I wasn't passionate lever, but I did vote leave the end. The main reasons for doing it is that it increases the range of political possibilities open to the British electorate and the British government for both good and bad. Right now they're highly constrained because a whole lot of radical policies on both left and right would fall foul of the EU zone rules and regulations, so there's actually a very narrow range of what is allowable politically now that we have left the a year or once we've left a year ago. It becomes much wider. Whole range of options are opened up now. The job for me then is to argue for the right wants to be really bad ones.

Speaker 2:          00:25:17       Your, your, your job just started. Exactly. Yes. But that's, so that's my main reason for doing it and I think there are much greater options open to us now in the future. Yeah. Do you sense that the EU as a, as a entity is really in trouble? I mean, everything beyond what just happened with, with you guys. I mean they've got grease basically in a hostage situation, right? I mean is that, am I being too? No. Greeks would agree with. Yeah. I mean, so what do you think the future here is you have, you have, you know, Britain leaving, you've got grease in a hostage situation. I mean, ultimately the borders that are crumbling people aren't happy with. Well, the real problem that the EU faces is the incredible act of Hubris they did at the master treaty, which is to create a single currency when they don't have a single government.

Speaker 2:          00:26:00       Now, interestingly, pretty much every economist on the planet at the time, regardless of their politics, said that this was a really bad idea and they all thought it was a bad idea for the same reason, which is that there's no historical case ever have a single currency area that doesn't have a single government surviving, and if you do have a single currency area in countries that are not economically aligned, if you will, and you don't have a single government, all kinds of really bad stuff happens. Paul trible and Milton Friedman in the same way, made almost exactly the same point that they ignore the advice from all the economists as portraying when rather which Lee put it. A. The good news is we know now the optimal currency area theory is completely correct. The bad news is we've had to bugger up the economy of a continent to figure it out, figure it out, approve it, so the point is they.

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       They still haven't resolved that problem. Now, Greece is a small country. They can handle Greece. What if Italy goes under, which is quite likely the Italian banking system is in really, really bad shape. If there's a major crisis in Italy or maybe in France or some other larger country, they won't be able to resolve it, so they're going to have to either create something like a government for the euro zone or they're going to have to allow the euro to be dismantled and either of those as a huge event. Plus there's an election next spring in France and there's a pretty reasonable chance that marine Le Pen will win the election. If she's up against one candidate from a center, right Alan page, she will lose if she's up against the former president, Sarkozy, the polls show, it's very, very close and I would actually take her to beat him, right?

Speaker 2:          00:27:36       Because that could be one of the situations where the Poles are going to hate her. Plus also these polls now before campaign, she's a very effective campaigner and so I think she could beat their rival candidate if it's Sarkozy. Now, if she became president mean the odds are still against that. But if she did, she said she'd immediately call a referendum on France leaving the EU. Now all the Poles there indicates 65 percent of the French public would vote leave. Now if that happens, the Aau is finished. That's it. It's done full. So it's in really bad. It's an a very tricky situation right now. The EU. So for someone like yourself, again, classical liberal, and you want this to be about the individuals. So I can understand the separation. Why you think ultimately this is good. It seems like in a weird way, you then have to align yourself with the Marie Le Pen's, with the, uh, you know, you end up by default falling into a category with the people that want to leave the event with the nationalist street.

Speaker 2:          00:28:32       But it, but I don't sense that you have. So how does that, how do you negotiate that with yourself, with great difficulty? This is the big problem. The problem for many classical liberals in the UK was if we vote leave, will this not give a big boost to precisely the kind of politics that you most dislike? That was the argument desert. My colleagues for example. Uh, I think that, uh, basically you have to realize if things like this happen, you are going to be alongside a bunch of people that otherwise you totally detest. And what you then have to do is to argue the case very, very strongly against them. Now the crucial thing here I think is for liberals both left and right of you, well classical liberals and social liberals to come together and to realize that they have a common photos, if you will, in the shape of the national collectivists.

Speaker 2:          00:29:17       And on the other hand, the radical radical left. And so here in the United States for example, I think it's quite likely that there may well be a kind of a proximal in the next few years between the kind of moderate part of the Republican Party. So called, which is actually many ways the more libertarian part, fiscally conservative, but socially liberal you will, and on the other hand, the mainstream of the Democrats, uh, and this will be aimed at both the kind of people who are now voting for trump and also the kind of people who were supporting Bernie Sanders earlier on. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       The primary. So I know this is this political realignment is one of the things you've been talking about lately. And I love that because that's exactly what I've been trying to talk about, that I no longer as a, as a classical liberal, I don't really see conservatives as my enemy as maybe five years ago I might have thought that they would be where now it's like, yeah, we can have some disagreements about taxes and maybe we're not in the exact place related to abortion or a series of states rights or whatever, but there has to be a new center developing here. Otherwise a lot of classical liberals will end up going this, you know, the Libertarians will end up going further to the right. Classical liberals may go further left and that that's not good for. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       well indeed. The way to think of is this, I think since about the 19 seventies, the big argument in politics on both sides of the Atlantic, but particularly here in the US has been between one group of people who are economically interventionists in the gala Cesarean, but socially liberal versus another group who appropriate market, but socially and culturally conservative. That's been the big division. What I think we're now moving towards this is a situation where they divide is between one group of people who are broadly free market, broadly individualists, globalist, perhaps a bit more egalitarian than the classical liberals would like, but broadly liberal versus another group which is the national collective. It's I mentioned earlier who are actually economically interventionists, pro welfare state, but very culturally conservative, quite authoritarian, anti globalist, a anti cosmopolitan, and that's the new division I think we're seeing in politics everywhere and what that means is that all a lot of the existing subgroups are going to split up, so conservatives are going to have to decide, well, okay, what is more important to you?

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       The cultural conservatism and the nationalism or the free markets and the individualism and if you're on the left you have to decide, well, okay, what am I really more interested in a. and if you're one of the kind of identity Marion anti globalist left, you actually may find yourself thinking, well actually right now I've got. I've probably got more in common in some ways with this kind of new emerging Hamiltonian nationalist politics. If on the other hand you really value individual liberty and globalism, openness to the rest of the world, then you're going to find yourself making alliances with these other people who were forming your opponent. So I think this is kind of big shuffling of the deck going on in most Western democracies.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       So as a historian, what can you think of another time where we had such a, maybe not on a global scale because we're so connected now, but where you saw just these real fractures happening in real time. Like when's the last time you saw something?

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       Well, the last time it happened in the UK, certainly it was in the 19 sixties in 1970 and I think something like that happened over here in the United States as well, where you had this sudden reversal where the south went from being solidly democratic where you know if you found two Republican votes that countered it must have voted twice to the situation we have now where the south is solidly Republican and Democrats will become the party of the north entirely. That kind of switched took place then in the sixties and seventies. Similarly in the UK, back in the eighties and nineties here in the United States with William Jennings Bryan, the cross of and the famous Democratic convention in Nineteen Ninety six when the populous basically took over the Democratic Party, major change in the nature of the Democratic Party landslide victory. Republicans again, big realignment of votes and interest in the states. Then so this kind of thing has happened before.

Speaker 2:          00:32:53       It's not unprecedented, but what do you add about the global element where now it's like we're so connected. We're all on twitter. We're all watching TV and on the Internet and that these things are happening at once and that were 100 years ago. If something happened across the pond, it mattered, but we didn't know about it for awhile versus now. It's all happening in real time. This is true. I mean there were more connections in you might imagine in the 19th century, but as you rightly say, the much slower, so now there is much more global phenomenon. In fact, what is interesting is that very few countries where this kind of realignment isn't happening. Canada is one not happen. That sofa a Spain is another Japan, but generally speaking you can see the same thing happening everywhere and I think what happens is that what now because we're so interconnected, what happens in one part of the world tends to feed into what's happening elsewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       Hence the great interest that Donald trump and his supporters have shown in Brexit and Nigel farage coming over here and making all these talks. That would not have happened 100 years ago because I don't think that would've. I don't think that would have happened 10 years ago when I saw Nigel farrage out there at this rally. I thought this is really unprecedented. When is the last time that a, that a leader from another country, even in a, you know, an ally, whatever it is, it doesn't matter. Came and with supporting the opposition and presidential candidate. I thought this is. They probably is true. It's a function of note cheaper and travel and things like twitter and the Internet. Yeah. Um. Alright. So let's shift a little bit from the politics of the data is sort of the broader stuff you describe yourself as a classical.

Speaker 2:          00:34:20       Yes. Yeah, correct. So now what is the difference so that I can explain it to my people properly when they say, Dave, you've become a libertarian. How would you describe the difference between a classical liberal, liberal and a libertarian? I don't think there is really such a difference. The word Libertarian, strictly speaking means an analyst. It was originally used to describe communist standard kits. So the, he took her Pumpkin Bronte. The problem here in the United States is the good word liberal has been hijacked by Social Democrats and so unlike the European continent where liberal still means a believer in private property, limited government, little government intervention, individual liberty, pluralism, a, it's now in the United States come to mean something slightly different. So the word libertarian came to be used here in the United States to mean basically what everyone else would be called a classical liberal or a liberal full stop.

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       So I don't think there is that much difference. There is perhaps a slight difference emerging now in as much as increasingly the word libertarian does mean something more radical, a bit more extreme. So if you say you're a libertarian, you probably imply that you're either an anarchist already close to it. If you say you're a classical liberal, you imply that well you'll, you know, you'll not advocates. You do think there was a necessity for government. So you're slightly more moderate. So I think that's what it's like. So I. So I like that distinction because that's definitely where I fall. I think there is some use of the state and then as I said, I watched the Libertarian party, you know, their convention and it was like they're screaming about, you know, a driver's licenses and it's like, guys, you're really missing the ball here, you know, like if we can't just let that go because there were not going to.

Speaker 2:          00:35:58       Even if you're 100 percent right, there's no way to really deep construct an entire system like this. Is there. Like even if even if the libertarians were purely purely right, is there a way to actually take a functioning somewhat functioning society and really well the whole thing through the political process. No burning down, but yes. But no. Well No, the wage, if you won't do on change science in the longer run, the thing to do is to do with the grassroots level to create alternatives to governments, which I think is. Well you shouldn't be doing. Uh, but I think with the kind of policy you're describing is rampantly self-indulgent. I would say this is the kind of politics of a certain kind of person who is interested in being more pure than everybody else. Yeah. Having an identity that is not compromising completely pure. It's the same kind of mentality that leads people to become religious fundamentalists of one variety or another.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       Uh, it's a desire to be the person in the group who is right when everybody else is wrong, and so the more of the people moved to yours, your position, the more you're going to insist upon these really extreme peculiar things that still make you distinct. So I'm afraid I'm not at all sympathetic. Right? I mean it just seems like a nonstarter when they're screaming about legalizing heroin, which we could talk about the war on drugs, which you talked about a lot and I'd be happy to do that, but when they're going there to start and drivers licenses to start, it's like, guys, this is not where it is. Go for issues where you can persuade a significant part of the public to come to your position. That's what politics is about. Politics. It's all about striking a pose and trying to show how morally pure you all.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       That's just pure virtue signaling. I say self indulgent nonsense. What do you want to do is make clear what your ultimate position is, but then say, well, okay, on you go for issues where you can persuade the significant part of the broad public that you are right on that yours is the way to go for and that's where you go from mainstream issue is not a fringe. Issues like that, which may be interesting for small number of people, but then there's a fun discussion to be had I suppose about that stuff, but not really a broader comes limiting. Um, all right, so how do you decide how much state power is? Okay? How do you make that distinction between pure anarchy and I want something to keep the wheels on here. I think state powers, that's part of what it is, but it's not really just that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:12       The real distinction is between what parts of your life do you want to be driven by individual choice or choices made my voluntary collectives versus what parts of your life do you want to be determined through some kind of collective decision making process through politics. It'd be like your governance and I think the answer that if you're a classical liberal you would give is that you want to maximize the scope of individual decision making because that means greater scope for individual discovery and the also means that most people are, you would argue the best judges of their own interests, so if you allow people to follow their own judgment is what their interests are collectively, you'll end up with the best outcome that maximizes human welfare so that that leaves though certain number of areas where there may be structural problems. It's very difficult to act collectively in these areas.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       If you want to use a technical economic terms, maybe there's a public good aspect to what you're talking about. National Defense and in these areas, it probably does pay to do things through a collective decision making process. There's something about these core areas that means that they are so important that they have to be on universally. You can't have a situation where say 90 percent are covered by the law enforcement system and 10 percent or not, uh, that would have all kinds of major negative effects for the 90 percent who were covered, nevermind the 10 percent who, who weren't. And so there's a kind of limited range of areas where, yes, you do definitely need the government. Now I know there are people who will say, oh no, no, you know, you could, in theory, yes you can do with that government, but my own view is that, well, if that's the case, why isn't everyone going to Somalia? I know people say Somalia is better off than some of its neighbors. And it's true that if the choice is anarchy or Pol Pot, you will go for anarchy. But that doesn't mean that necessarily a stateless state of affairs is your first choice.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       Right? So for all the people that would say, well, you know, for the, for the pure libertarian or whatever you want to call them at this point, that would say no, remove the social safety net altogether. Don't, don't help the poorest under any circumstances because if the government gets out, then private entities and private people will fully fill that void. I suspect that's not. You don't believe that that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       Well, no, the thing is I would ideally like to see a situation where you don't have the government providing that function, but the trouble is how'd you get from here to there? Yeah. And the difficulty is that if you do simply withdraw government safety net provision, this fundamental social welfare transfers, it's going to take a long time probably before you get something that takes its place. And in the meantime, a lot of people are going to suffer quite severely. And I don't think that's acceptable quite honestly. So the argument should be that, uh, you should a through private action develop nonstate forms of welfare. We should revive mutualism, friendly societies, fraternal orders, all the great institutions that we used to have, which delivered a huge range of welfare functions very, very effectively, particularly here in the United States, so we should be looking to do that privately revived flat, but at the same time, but we got rid of those as the state.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Well, what happens as the state groups, the plus also though it was due to quite concrete legislative measures, particularly ones urged by the medical profession which were designed to drive, um, friendly societies out of healthcare provision to what was called lodge practice. That that was a purely legislative function also crowding out by the state. It was just a lobby group. The doctors got legislatures to pass laws which made it very, very difficult for a private volunteer operation. But the other thing you need to do, I'm done by two original point, is to say that, well, yes, there is probably going to be a kind of bottom level, a provision provided by government through the political process to ensure that nobody falls below a certain minimum level. That nobody's starving the street. People do have a minimal amount of, uh, resources, uh, so that they can actually survive.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       Now, what you can then do is get into hydrostatic log about what the best way of doing this is and certainly the way we're doing it now in many western countries is not the best way of doing it, but that's a minor argument. The major principle I think is you do concede if, if, if you're in my position that there should be some kind of residual state function of that salt. Singapore probably has the best way of doing it, I would say amongst which is why well, they have a system of forced savings where essentially you are obliged to pay money into a series of accounts, one of which covers your healthcare costs mainly in old age, one of which gives you a pension. Another one gives you protection against sickness or unemployment. Now the crucial difference between that and the system we have is that the accounts have your name on it, so it's your money and you make these for savings into these accounts, right?

Speaker 2:          00:42:41       Your working life, you've drawn them when you need them and if you die, that's a, you know, you fall under the proverbial bus, all the money you paid in it becomes part of your estate and goes to your heirs. That's incredible. Now that's a much better system than the one we have here. That's incredible. So it doesn't just get pulled into something else and it's your property. If you die, let's say you have a large mountain, you'll be happy with this. I'm not sure what that is. Very effective. You've got a large amount in your health savings account to cover the really expensive part of healthcare which is looking after you in the last six months of your life. But let's say you, you die suddenly from a heart attack. You don't like that, that you weren't drawn in that fund and it's there for your heirs.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       It's part of your estate. I mean, I'm completely for that. I, I suspect that the left, you know, they would say, well no, the state should be able to take that. Now you're gone and, and give it to somebody else. Well, maybe, but I mean the point is I think that's. I would argue against that for a whole number of reasons, but I think that that's a much better system and saying that's the system they have in Singapore, which is what do they do for the people that are outside of the system that really, really poor the government actually makes contributions on your behalf. But Singapore is such a successful economy and society that very, very few people are on such low incomes that they can't make some contribution and the ones who have very low incomes to say either the state's contribution is entirely the minimal level or at tops them up.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       But that's actually a very marginal, very small number of people. And so if we wanted to change to a system that was a little more like that, and we've already hit on this a couple times about how incremental change is tough, but you don't want to burn it down at the same time. How, how beyond just making the case for it, and I hadn't even heard of that Singapore thing. So now some new people are going to hear about that concept. How do you actually start making that happen? I mean, is that you have to start doing it at the local level. I mean, just get, he knows probably that probably would require a change at the national level because you're talking about something which would replace the way social security is currently run. They will switch social from a pay as you go system to a fully funded system of this, this kind that would require action by Congress or at the very least maybe by state legislatures for some of the other forms.

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       Um, I think we just need to make the political case written. The difficulty of course is that you have a whole bunch of people in the existing system who can't simply be switched over to the new one. So you're going to have a period of about 30 years, certainly 20 years where there's an overlap where you have the new system in place and you have people who are, uh, under the old system. That's inevitable. It seems to me. And that means in the short run, this could be quite possibly, but I think in the long run, well worth doing. Yeah. Interesting. So I heard you in a video that I saw you do yesterday. Talk about how, how Libertarians are generally thought of as not interventionists. Yeah. You think there, although I don't think you prescribed to it, you think there is a situation where a libertarian could be for some intervention.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       Basically the, the for any kind of libertarian, classical liberal, the question with foreign policy is, which course of action is going to most maximize liberty both in the country that is potentially doing the intervening in this case the US for example, and the part of the world where the intervention might take place. Now. That should be the guiding principle behind what your foreign policy is. Now, what I would say, and I agree with friend of mine, Randy Barnett on this, is he's been on the show. There's nothing inherent or necessary about libertarian principles that means you must be a non interventionist. What I would argue on they're here, perhaps I disagree slightly with Randy, is that, uh, the number of cases where the benefits of liberty will be so great that you would support intervention is actually very, very slight. I would apply something like a just war principle.

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       You have to show that really the benefit is bound to exceed the cost, uh, and that the, this is knowable and that the intervention could be done in a way that doesn't systematically violate human rights. So that's quite a high bar. Yeah. Wait, let's pause there for a sec. How much does the benefit have to be for you and your society, not just the people that you're potentially doing? Well, I think it's more a matter of the cost because if you think about intervention in foreign parts of the world, the, one of the main arguments against that from a libertarian or classical liberal position is that it actually is bad for liberty back home in the country doing the intervening to the extent that the United States becomes an empire and it is an empire that's not pussy foot about this. That undermines republican institutions. And Liberty back home, and this is not a new phenomenon.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       Many of the things that led to the growth of the state in Great Britain were because of British intervention outside the rest of the world. The India office, which ran the Indian empire, was our first big modern department of States and then transformed the rest of government by its example. Same things. You do these things over there, wherever there is, and then you actually need more state power at well under that is provides an example. So in order to have, for example, you need to read large military if you're going to have a kind of global interventionist role that inevitably does things like increase the role of military domestically, increases its purchasing power, its clout, builds up the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned against, has all kinds of bad effects. It also leads to growth of a surveillance state. It leads to the growth of the police power of the state, which we spoke about earlier, which you might say is necessary in certain cases, but certainly not to the degree, but he now. And it just also generally gives our rulers ideas above their station because if you have the mindset that, oh, we can go over and be this benevolent despot and transform the lives of these people in other parts of the world, this tends to naturally create a mindset. We think, well, there's these people here in our own society they could do with our benevolent interference as well. And that's a very dangerous mindset.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       Right. And somehow we always have money to do those adventures, but we never had money to help what's happening. Yeah, what a surprise. Yeah. What could be happening there,

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       you know, it benefits all kinds of people that mean. The other quite shameful thing is that this typically involves sending young men from often poor backgrounds into harms way when the children of the people making these decisions are certainly not joining the military. And if they are, they're probably not going to be sent into harms way in that way, which I think is seriously disreputable. So I think I wouldn't rule out that there are certain cases where an intervention could be on balance, beneficial for liberty both at home and in the place where the intervention takes place, but I think that's vanishingly very low probability. There are very few cases like that in my view.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       Right. So let's, uh, let's just take Syria for example, because that's obviously the big one that we know over 400,000 people are dead. This thing is not ending anytime soon. It's hard to know whose side we're on, what's going on with Iran and Russia, all of that stuff. Now. I think the main, the mainstream libertarian think would be even if we partly created this mess, we just got to cut our losses and let it be. How do you, how does ethics and morality get involved as a classical liberal where you see, okay, we don't want to be killing more people, but maybe we could create humanitarian corridors or maybe there's a way to do some good there, but it may not be cost effective for us.

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       The question is who are the actors in this thing? Because people always say, okay, we got to do something, or what should we do? Who is the we in this sentence now I think people get two things confused and conflated. One is what should civil society do? What should or can we do as individuals and they're all kinds of things we can do depending on what you think is the right course of action, but the other thing of course it means is what should our government, the government of United States, the United Kingdom, wherever do now in terms of what governments should do. Governments in this context are basically the purveyors of deadly force, which is that core function and so the question therefore I think is slightly different and really you want to minimize harm. It seems to me now I would argue that actually the course of action that will minimize harm in most cases is classic foreign policy realism.

Speaker 2:          00:50:29       Because what you want to do is to minimize the chances of war in large scale conflict and I think actually channeling bismarck is probably the way to go. Strange thing for liberals say, but I do think in foreign policy, asking yourself the question, what would bismarck do is probably a good way to go because foreign policy rail is slight bismal do not generally calls large scale walls. Uh, and that's what you want to do. We'd be looking at what the government should do. You're looking to try and minimize the amount of armed conflict that happened.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       Sure. So what do you, what would bismarck do in a situation that's already begun? Oh, it's too late for us now, but is there, is there a moral cost, I guess is what my question is. Is there a moral cost of knowing that something horrible has happened

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       happening and that perhaps you could do something again? It's who's the, you think it's this? Yeah. The question is, is if you're saying there's something terrible going on there, I feel a kind of moral responsibility as a human being for the suffering of my fellow human beings in that part of the world. All kinds of things you can do, you can give money to a non government organization or a charity. Some of that medicine. So I'll prompt, yeah, you might even volunteer to work with MSF as adoptive you're a doctor, a paramedic, you might support things like the creation of a lobby. The government in Syria, the competent is to allow people to lead noncoms civilian sullied the combat. Don't cease fires you might argue for if you. On the other hand you might say, well, I think that this is the right side in this conflict and if you feel strongly about him, pick up a gun and go and fight that.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       That's the honest and vulnerable thing to do or give money to help people acquire mysteries and things of that. Now the other hand, the government is what you're talking about. My argument is that typically government intervention, military intervention by states in conflicts of this kind is almost always going to make the conflict more intractable war, bloody, more extensive, more long lasting, and it's not going to be ultimately use the interest even of the outside parameters. So much of this is driven by the desire to avoid the other side getting on top. And so you know the realist view there as well. Usually steer clear of it, unless a vital national interest is at stake. You do not get involved because both on pragmatic machiavellian grounds, but also on moral grounds because if you intervene, this is very likely to make the whole conflict worse than the otherwise would be.

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       Syria. I mean, let me show this work. In the case of Syria only predicted when the Arab spring was going on that it became serious. It would be a bloodbath. Now, this didn't require great prescience online. My part, because the whole point about Syria is that the government is dominated by a cleanse, stroke, religious sect. The News Irys, the Alawites is what asset comes from who come from the mountain regional Latakia virtually all of the other people in Syria, particularly the Sunni Orthodox, Sunni Muslims, regard them as rank heretics. That means that a democratic regime in Syria is probably not feasible at the moment because if I sat on the alibis, give up power. You're dead. Yeah, and they're not so not going to do it. So I knew there would be armed resistance to any movement to have for the state. Now wants the civil ward started. The question is what do you do?

Speaker 2:          00:53:32       The problem I think as far as western policy goes, is that a large part of western policy has been to try and overthrow Asad, but they have willed the end without willing the means they've intervened, but the intervention has actually been of a kind that has simply made the conflict more intractable and gone on longer and it's provoked countervailing intervention by the Iranians and the Russians who for their own strategic reasons, don't want to see ever overthrown, so that shows how government intervention can actually make a conflict that probably would have ended one way or another. I'm much more intractable. My own view, actually 40 it's worth is that the only really effective way of resolving that conflict is to partition Syria into three or four states. I think that's the only way to actually do it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       Yeah. I mean incredibly. Joe Biden, when he was running for president, when he ended up being a Obama's bp at eight years ago, there was a moment in the debates where he said, we have to partition Syria and partition Iraq and there should be an actual Kurdish nation and this is the sooner you should have an agent in the sheet and all that, and people laughed at him because it sounded, it sounded very academic and we're not going to split these countries, but at this point, Syria is not really a nation state by anybody. That's a perfectly rational solution. He was completed much about that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:43       Who looks at that part of the world and it's a political realist is going to say that partitioning several of these states that were created totally artificial. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       By the British and the French during World War II, even on geographic lines, really unreduced just lines in the sand as the famous book calls it,

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       you know, those states not viable. They should really be broken up and that's, that would be a rational, humane response to the situation

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       you now have. Um, I don't want to spend a ton of time with this because we don't have that much more time, but how much, how much of what's going on in the Middle East is just because of the guys that were drawing the map. And if you look at a country like Jordan, it looks ridiculous. The shape of Jordan is absurd. It looks like a puzzle piece that got mangled. I mean, how much is just that the people actually drawing the map had nothing to do with what was happening on the ground. By the way, I don't blame you guys solely for that because the Ottoman empire ran a lot of it for a long time. Actually.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       What mean? Seriously, we, you don't most terms what they will say a pretty quickly is that things were working a lot better. They, when they run it for you, if, if, if France Britain had followed the ultimate anz and use the ultimate local government units, things might well have worked out better because those units actually reflected under underlying realities. Many guises, but know that that's part of the problem. Part of the problem in there as in large areas of Africa is that you have political units, which do not make demographic sense, but it's not just that I think there are other factors as well. There's been a collapse in the, in the government, in that huge area of the world, central Africa, up through the Middle East, places like Libya for example. What has happened is that the state, the political order has collapsed and what we're seeing is lots of violence caused by nonstate actors, basically clans, gangs, tribes, terrorists groups.

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       We call them church people, so we might as well call them criminal gangs. That's what they are basically, and until some kind of stable political order is recreated in that part of the world, I don't see that state of chaos ending anytime soon. The problem is that the existing political order, and this is where those guys sykes and Pico come in, is simply not sustainable because it's based on an irrational thing. The other thing that's going on there is that basically you've had very, very rapid population growth in that part of the world in the last 30, 40 years. Uh, probably more than that region can sustain ecologically and you have an economy in large parts of that region, which is a very badly run because it's corrupting of incompetent government and be as very dependent upon oil and what you have now is lots and lots of unemployed but overeducated young men and that is always and everywhere. A recipe for trouble. Right? It's fertile ground for terrorists.

Speaker 2:          00:57:18       Yeah. Is there a little saving grace in that because of the Internet now and that information can spread so fast that these people are learning. There's other ways of life and that may be that ultimately will be what allows them to, as they get older, to create societies that'll be a little more egalitarian. Yes. I think. I think I am optimistic in the longer term and the short term. I'm a pessimist. I'm afraid in the long run medium term, I'm an optimist for that possible design for most of the world because I do think that things like that mean that the world is going to become more interconnected. People are going to be more aware of different ways of doing things too. We're back to what we spoke about earlier. Uh, they'll realize that their identity is not something that they're stuck with, that they can actually shape their own life more, but I think it's going to be awhile before we get there, my friend.

Speaker 2:          00:57:58       All right. There's a whole slew of other things I want to talk to you about to finish. So we, but we only have time for one of them. Should we talk about drugs or is there something that you want to really discuss that you feel like we hit? Whatever, whatever you. Whatever you want, you know, they are. I always say a good interview is when I don't look at the cards as well. So we did it here. All right. So let's talk about drugs a little bit because I think this is an interesting place for the libertarian or classical liberal. You basically think that our war on drugs, it was completely ridiculous. It's one of the worst policies ever. Yeah. Uh, what would be a better policy related to drugs? I think there are two things to do. The first thing is quite simply to legalize drugs, period across the board, across the board.

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       What people do not realize is until the 18 nineties, any drug was freely available. If you were in a chemist in Great Britain until 1922, the United States until the age of 90 days, you could go in, you could order opm, you could order morphine. Arthur Conan doyle could go to the chemist in London and get his weekly supply of cocaine serious coke habit, which is why Sherlock Holmes has a coke habits in the stories, so this regime we now have as being created peace mail since the 19 twenties basically, so it's not inevitable. It's a specific policy response and the results would have been catastrophic. It has led to incredibly high rates of incarceration here in the United States, which means countless lives ruined and severely damaged if not destroyed. It means it's given enormous amounts of money to some seriously evil and unpleasant people and led to the growth of an enormous network of international organized crime, which would not otherwise exist.

Speaker 2:          00:59:34       In terms of geopolitics, this is one of the major ways terrorist organizations get money. It's a catastrophe in terms of that. It's undermine the stability of large parts of the world. Like Columbia for example. Increasingly that's one of the reasons why Venezuela was in bad shape quite apart from the incompetence of the government of Mexico. We all know there's like a war going on in some parts of Mexico. Them, okay, so this is an altar and it hasn't even done the thing is meant to do, which is reduce the use of drugs. In fact, actually this has gone up. Not only that, but an inevitable result of this policy is that the suppliers and the users both go for harder drugs because he wants to get more bang for the buck. You want also to sell and to use products that are less bulky, easier to conceal.

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       Same thing has happened with prohibition during the 19 twenties were the Americans went from being a beer drinking nation to being a hard liquor drinking nation, which is not what you want and what you want to do is control alcohol trick. So I would say that this, in terms of its own goals, this is a catastrophic policy failure. Now, having said that, I'm not one of these people who is channeling Timothy O'leary and thinks that drugs are good for you. There's no doubt there is a problem with widespread use of drugs. It's worth saying, by the way, that the real problem anyway, not least here in the United States, is the massive increase in the use of prescription drugs. The number of people who are psycho truck, big mood altering drugs is staggering and it has grown dramatically since the 1966. So there's a more general problem of drug use in advanced countries, particularly North America, of which illegal drug use is a subset.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       Now that, am I mistaken? Are you guys in Britain? You don't have the commercials we have, right? Are They not legal there? We get every commercial on every, especially on cable news for all of the prescriptions.

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       It doesn't, that's all out now. That's best. That's not allowed under the, uh, you know, advertising regulations in the United Kingdom. That might be a regulation I'd before. It is strange when you're watching television in the United States to think just everyone this country suffer from in large.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       Yeah. You got that on a cartoon, a cloud following you. Anyways, so

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       the thing is, what I think is that what you need to do is to have a social movement to address the undoubted real problems with the drug trade in which you could do. If the government got out of this and my model would be temperance were in the 19th century at the start of the 19th century, on both sides of the Atlantic. Pretty much everyone was in a drunken stupor most of the time. The amount of drinking was nominal and binding. 18, eighties and nineties. Most prediction, the great majority of Americans have become seriously sober. People who maybe drink very occasionally, they're not heavy drinkers the way their grandparents had been. That is not due to government. It's due to the enormous social movement of temperance, which unfortunately also wanted to use the law to stop the residual temp central and drinking. Even think about smoking.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       Okay. I'm not keen on all the antismoking laws we have, but on the other hand there's been a huge change in social attitudes to smoking, just made socially, just not the thing to do to smoking company. That's the way to address the underlying problem that we have with drugs. It's through social actual bank kind of war on drugs is actually making that kind of effective social action less likely and causing a ton of other problems. Right. Is the smoking one must be a tough one for you though because on one hand at least here our taxes are incredibly high and smoking, so this is a government so they sort of tried to price it out of the market, which I guess you wouldn't really well or I don't think the ultra price sound market quite more. They're trying to maximize their revenue, which is something different because our theory of these taxes is they're meant to stop.

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       You and I are buying cigarettes, but actually I don't like the US government. The British government would have a panic fits if people stop smoking because they get 7 billion pounds a year of revenue from smoking taxes. Right. So in a weird way, they need it. Exactly. Plus also, um, they really ought to encourage people to smoke because if you smoke you're likely to die younger. You won't be claiming a whole bunch of healthcare benefits. But no, the point about that is that that is actually a very bad policy because the demand for cigarettes and tobacco products is highly inelastic. And so what you're doing actually is hurting the poor more than anybody else. There are other ways of doing it. Like I said, social pressure. Yeah. So what about for the person? So I'm pretty much with you on the philosophical part of how the government should deal with this and the, and the actual tangible part of drugs.

Speaker 2:          01:03:50       I would have some concern if they just say if, if heroin was lead with legal tomorrow and, and kids could just get it at a border. So you look, we're here in La, there are pot stores on every corner. I have a law license for it. So I'm not doing something illegal, but what, what do you do for the real. I'm not even talking about the Timothy leary mushroom stuff, you know, I would have met them really addictive stuff. Well actually meet some of the drugs that are on. I'd be much more worried about things like sedatives or cocaine. The level would be heroin actually. Interesting. But that's another matter. Um, the thing is to say that drugs should be sold legally, does not mean that to be a complete free for all a, they would clearly be regulations, for example, saying that people cannot buy them below a certain age just as we have with alcohol and tobacco for good reason.

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       Because you, you'd think that somebody under a certain age, which you set arbitrarily, it does not have the judgment to know whether or not they should do this. And you should enforce laws on that very, very strictly and very, very firmly. You might well have a system where certain categories of drugs or substances, you basically say, well, uh, you could do with the Swedish government tried alcohol and have a rationing system. There are various ways around that. The point is it wouldn't be just a case of, oh, you can walk into any store and just buying your your shots of morphine and heroin over the counter, like almost certainly there'll be a whole array of a legislation. The point is it will be sold by a legal retailer who would have strong incentives to have high quality product, not to sell it to people who are going to be problematic in one way or another because they would have a vicarious liability under the law, for example, and unlike the situation, the where that being sold by seriously dodgy people, criminals of the worst kind who actually have an incentive to not care about who they sell it to sell it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       So actually if you're concerned about protecting vulnerable people, which is what we're talking about here. Yeah. Then actually making the sale of this substance legal is the way to go because it means that you're much more likely to be able to look out for their interests and the sellers are much less likely to have an incentive to screw them over, to be blunt.

Speaker 1:          01:05:45       Right. And interestingly, it gets back to sort of what's been the through line here, which is that a little government involvement in a certain way. It could be. Okay. So I almost think, I almost think that my new phrase now when people say classical, what's a classical liberal? I almost think it's a realistic libertarian. Do you think

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       that's a good way of putting it? Yes, absolutely. And I mean the thing is say very often limited government and small limited government even more so is a lot more effective at achieving the ends that big government liberals wanted to have. The big government is very good than here.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       I think that's a perfect way to end this. It's been a pleasure. I didn't look down lines. That's how I know it's a good one. Uh, for more.
