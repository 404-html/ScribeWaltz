Speaker 1:          00:02          One of my favorite aspects of the Rubin report is the feedback that we're getting from viewers literally all over the world. Just last week I have viewers from countries like Egypt, Denmark, Mexico, Spain in Australia. Reach out to me just to name a few. I'm truly humbled at so many of you. Take the time to share your feelings with me and although I don't have time to respond to everyone, I do try to at least read the messages that you're sending. To me. The most amazing part of this is that the conversations we're having on the show are transcending race, religion, sexuality and nationality. The fight for free speech, the importance of not giving into the authoritarians and the awakening against the regressives are all ideas that bring us together. The power of ideas is universal. When we discuss free speech, free thought and free expression, it's vital that we mean it equally for everyone, not just in an identity, politics based pecking order.

Speaker 1:          00:55          This device, this thing that we all have in our pocket is bringing us closer together in ways that were literally unimaginable only a generation ago. Right? This very second one of you is watching this direct message while on the subway in New York City. One of you is listening to the podcast while at the gym in London, and one of you is streaming this while on your couch in Moscow. Not only are you all tuning in on a variety of platforms, but you're furthering the discussion of these ideas on facebook and twitter or just by talking with your friends and family. That expansion of our conversations makes me want to do better work even if talking about difficult topics comes at both a personal and professional cost. As the world has gotten smaller, it has never been more important to hear voices that challenge our thinking and give unique perspective based on their own personal story.

Speaker 1:          01:45          My guest this week is enough ship Chanko. INA is the leader of the women's Movement Feminine International, a columnist for the international business times and a free speech activist. She was born in Ukraine in the same year that the USSR fell, has been kidnapped by the Bellaruse Kgb, and in 2013 was granted political asylum in France. She has lived a truly controversial life and paid the price for being outspoken more than once. This is not someone who only talks about the news. This is someone who actually lives it. There are many issues I want to discuss with INA from women's rights and free speech to Islamism and political correctness, but I also want to talk to her about life in France right now. Has it changed since the Paris terror attacks? What's the political climate? Has the regressive mentality steeped into the mainstream, thus weakening free speech and helping the authoritarians.

Speaker 1:          02:37          The only way we can find answers to questions like these is to be connected with people who aren't afraid to share their views. You know there's a catch 22 to all this connectivity as it brings us closer and transcends cultures and borders. It can also make everyone else's problems seemed like our own. On one hand, we can see how others live and have empathy for our fellow men. On the other hand, sometimes it's hard to gauge just how much something across the globe should affect us in our day to day lives. I try to do this show each week in the spirit of finding balance between those two concepts and I hope you know, we'll provide perspective on some of the big questions I've mentioned here. The more we focus on our common humanity, the less chance we'll be able to be ripped apart. Initiative Chanko is the leader of the International Women's movement, Feminine, a writer, a speaker, and a fearless free speech advocate. You know, welcome to the show.

Speaker 2:          03:33          Hello. Hi. Thank you for invitation for long I should say.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Well, I'm really glad that we connected. I, I've known about your work for awhile and then I saw a piece that you wrote in the International Business Times last week about the regressive left and the racist right. And that basically most of us are in between and that's very much what, what we've been talking about here on this show. So I thought it would be a perfect time to talk to you. So you're, you're in Austria right now, is that right? I'm right now in Australia. What? Can I ask what you're doing there? Or is this a top secret mission?

Speaker 2:          04:05          Yeah, no, I'm, I'm here for a conference about free speech of course. I hope that this time it will not be interrupted by a terrorist. We will be speaking and enjoy this topic. Discussing this topic.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Alright, well we're going to talk about some of the interruptions that you've had a by terrorists when you're giving talks on free speech. But first let's do a little bit on your biography because I think it's pretty amazing. I mentioned at the top of the show you were born in Ukraine, not the Ukraine. You were born in Ukraine the same year that the Soviet Union fell and I think that had a lot to do with sort of your, your path right now because of things that you saw in a sort of newborn country. So can you talk a little bit about your history first?

Speaker 2:          04:47          Well, I was born the year my country was born actually. And um, of course the situation, you know, for me as a child, for me it was just, just a childhood, but for adults it was of course a rough reality. Then later I understood that I had a rough childhood. However, you know, for me to make a homework under the candles because all our electricity in the city was shot for the sake of the economy. You know, we didn't have, we didn't have a national currency. And uh, uh, my parents were a receiving salary with sausages or was breads, you know. And um, yeah, I mean, poverty. I'm powered to a spot that, you know, and uh, I think that this is not something special for yeah to, to tell you about because still until today, many people live in poverty and 25 years after Ukraine, um, well actually right now in a similar situation and uh, you know, already my nephew, a small child who is eight years old, he near in this similar situation and has similar childhood to what I had so situation is that really changing and progressing.

Speaker 2:          06:05          But of course it had a really a huge impact on me. And, uh, I think when the old generation that was born after the collapse of the USSR, because we saw what we saw that, um, you know, as adults, we're saying our country was ruled by 450 idiots. This is, I'm quoting particularly, yeah, my grandma and my mother, they were calling them all adults. We're calling politicians always, you know, there was always this clear gap between society and those 450 Egypt's again, as they say. Um, there was always a gambit between government and citizens and, um, you could, you as a child, I never could imagine that it could be any connection between those people, between this small group of people that we could call one percent and 99 percent of the population. There was all this an impression as if we were living in different countries.

Speaker 2:          07:04          I saw, of course, you know, I grew up in a very traditional society where woman has to work and uh, well to have job and also of course take care of everything at home. And even though my father was not a particular patriarch, but of course all the while my mother was a housewife. Um, as well as I'm working full time and in nineties, um, during, well during this time of, you know, trying to create a government in the country, have to collapse a few ceasar parents had to work on different jobs and uh, my, my mother was working on three different jobs and of course taking care of us at home, which of course gave an impression, um, and kind of, you know, well yeah, we had to paint a picture of what woman is supposed to do and what her mission is and what men is supposed to do. And even in such a hard economically time, my father was of course earning much more and had access to more jobs and could, could have possibility to find different jobs. More interesting than my mother.

Speaker 1:          08:12          Women really were doing two jobs because they were working and they were taking care of the home and the kids and all that. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:19          I don't, I, yeah, I think it's incorrect to speak in the past because as I already decided, remains the realities still a exactly the same. And maybe sometimes we have an illusion, you know, expect in a different cover and we can see more women who do not do that. However, still a majority of women live that life. And My mother's still continues to work in two different jobs today. And uh, well she doesn't have children anymore. We're going.

Speaker 1:          08:48          So I don't think you think there's anything wrong with that in and of itself. You just sort of want people to acknowledge the role of the woman, right?

Speaker 2:          08:57          What do you mean? I don't think

Speaker 1:          08:58          well that they're doing that they're doing both these things that they, it's not bad to take care of your kids in and of itself, right?

Speaker 2:          09:06          Oh, too bad to take care of your kids. But it's bad if you're the only one this post to take care of your kid. Right?

Speaker 1:          09:12          So the role, the role.

Speaker 2:          09:14          Well, yeah, exactly that you have to follow the role and you have no choice. And uh, um, I think, uh, I think there's a lot of things that are wrong in this, in this concept and in this reality. And therefore, uh, we are, we started a movement in Ukraine as a women's movement, feminist movement, even though at the beginning I should confess when we started our activity, we didn't really have a clear understanding what feminism was about because for example, to give you, um, yeah, to give you an example, I was studying in the Best University of Ukraine. I was studying journalism and uh, four years of my studies, I never had it been even one hour lecture on what feminism is. Wow. I didn't even hear the definition of sanctuary ideology because that was something which is not close to Eastern European society again, where women have to be at home and take care of who have family but not go into street and demand their rights.

Speaker 2:          10:14          Um, actually it's not concerning only women's rights, but generally I grew up in the country where people do not until 2008 and 2004, sorry. Uh, the moment of orange revolution. The first revolution that happened in the history of independent Ukraine. Until that moment people didn't have a, you know, to, to protest was a, you know, an activity of a bad taste, you know, it was something that you wouldn't do. It was something that you would do only to, I'm probably earn money because political parties in Ukraine pay you for I'm sending was the flags in the streets and protesting supporting one or another politician. So when we started our activity we were of course accused accused for being paid by someone and being political project or also being named by our parents or relatives who knew that we don't get money for that. We were just simply named either witches or psychologically sick girls.

Speaker 1:          11:17          Right. Okay. So I don't want to jump too far ahead yet. So we're going, we're going to go into. We're going to go into all that, but just to sort of wrap up the Ukraine part because I think a lot, you know, there's so much happening with Ukraine and as you said, it is a young country. It's only 25 years old in terms of independence. What do you make of what's happening in Ukraine now? Because it, it sort of seems like the quest for true independence in a way has failed because Russia is, is back in Ukraine. Right. So is it, do you feel like you're part that Ukraine is really an independent state at this point?

Speaker 2:          11:49          Well, Ukraine is an independent state and I think that nobody should it. Um, well, of course putting questions in Russia is questioning it. Yeah. But, so Ukraine is an independent state, of course, even though our territory, we're already taking an occupied like Crimea, um, work presently occupied in Ukraine last right now and still there is the eastern part of Ukraine occupied by a Russian military troops and I will say bravely, uh, I will claim that their Russian troops as it was proven, um, well, Ukraine is an independent state, which is definitely at the stage of its development and creation and, you know, choosing the path a while 99 percent of population today, a screaming, oh, for your integration and for wish to join European Union or a dream because I think it's quite a remote possibility yet. Um, there is still, um, the garments, the one that I mentioned about 450 agents remain.

Speaker 2:          12:56          They remain those people because, well, I should say that the problem of my country, what my country, the country where I was born, um, because I don't feel like I have a country. Um, I think that the problem of this country is that a, for 25 years at least I observed the same faces in the parliament. I hear the same names of politicians. It's the country is ruled by the same. If you want, you know, methia oligarch who, unions fractions, for example, today's President Poroshenko, who's, you know, supposed to be and he claims to be the one who is for your integration. Um, he was a minister of foreign affairs in the, uh, cabinets in a parliament of President Yanukovych who was recently the dictator against who people went out recently. I'm at the square in my down and key up. So definitely I, I should say that this sort of evolution, you know, I think that it's, it's a, uh, intellectually unfair and wrong to think that after people go out and destroy the evolution is when people go out on the street. Well, no, it's beginning of it. It's, it's beginning of the protests and I think that the protests started in 2004, the first orange revolution 10 years after people again went out in the street because the changes didn't happen today. Again, many people are deceived because don't see rapid changes. But, uh, I think that's a mistaken and wrong to expect changes right away. I think that's, I think that Ukraine will have to. We'll have to have few more revolutions.

Speaker 1:          14:34          Yeah. So speaking of that, do you, do you think, what does the average person in Ukraine feel about how the rest of the world views them now? Because I sensed that the people of Ukraine want more help from the west and that, you know, in America we talk about it, you know, we talked about it for like the two weeks that Putin was moving troops in or whatever. It was a, there was a two week window where we talk about it now. It just, we just completely forget about it. Is there a disappointment on behalf of the people, sort of how the world has reacted to what's happened there?

Speaker 2:          15:06          Well, of course, yes, there is a disappointment because, um, you know, people feel that people know that their government is actually unable to do something to change thing. And since people give, you know from this square and my, there were giving the messages to the world, of course they do expect from other states the more powerful or so called democratic, who already reached a certain level who could help and support and especially those who support it verbally, but do not support support practically. Uh, of course, many people are, as I said, deceived and disappointed today. And even some come to the point when they say that a younger core image was the dictator, it was better because at least what to eat. And he did, his government didn't touch.

Speaker 1:          15:58          Yeah. So, so last thought on this and then we're gonna move on to some of the feminism stuff. I mean, wasn't, am I correct me if I'm wrong, but I think didn't Ukraine have nukes, which they gave up as part of that they would get NATO protection once they were an independent nation and basically that just didn't happen. Right? So they sort of gave up their protection that the weapons that would have protected them and then they get this invasion or whatever you want to call it from Russia and now the other countries right there doing nothing. We're doing nothing. So it was, it was really like, uh, an unfortunate decision I suppose.

Speaker 2:          16:30          Well, uh, I'm in, uh, if we will go right now in discussing about a decision or NATO, I think it will be too complex. Okay. Fair enough. Or because, uh, well there are a lot of sides of this question, but yes, this is what happened. And, uh, of course, many people today thinking back and think that what kind of mistakes we're done, but at that moment it seemed to be very correct to a decision because, uh, you know, nobody could expect that Putin suddenly I'm decides to occupy the territory is proved the world that he's even bigger dictator then into the world. Perceive him.

Speaker 1:          17:08          Okay, well, I know we can talk about that political stuff forever. So let's, let's move on to this stuff that you're really passionate about. And it's funny because at the top of the show I do my direct message where I give my feelings of the week and I wrote my little piece about it yesterday. And then right after I wrote it, I watched your Ted talk and basically your Ted talk was a 20 minute sort of much broader version of exactly what I happened to write about yesterday by, by total coincidence. And I know that the things that you talk about are the things that I'm incredibly passionate about and that I've made the show that. So you had a great quote in your, in your Ted Talk, you said that feminine is a movement that is trying to rebuild society without permission. I love that line. So can you just expand on that a little bit and what, what made you start feminine and where do you think it's going?

Speaker 2:          17:56          Well, particularly by that statement, I should say that anyone who is dreaming to rebuild the world should come. That you know, you should not ask for permission because nobody will ever give it to you. So if you dream to change something, you should not ask for permission or weight when someone will give you that impression

Speaker 1:          18:16          waiting a long time.

Speaker 2:          18:18          Right? And it will never happen. Yes. Because, well, in Ukraine as, as I said, we started in Ukraine a movement in 2008. I'm aware existed movement already exist for eight years and um, I should say that's the one we started. We didn't have any particular knowledge of political knowledge or didn't know how to work with media. I told you already did that. We didn't really have a clear, uh, understanding what feminism is about. Um, and, um, I don't feel embarrassed or shy to say about that because I think that this should show and reflect the society in which we were growing up. Um, I remember joining this little group about, which nobody knew at that moment yet. Um, we were when we had the meeting in a very Soviet style cafe in the center of Kiev, sharing two cups of tea, a on 50 for 15 of us because we were all young students coming from small cities to keep dreaming that this will be the, the, the place where we will have is women opportunities.

Speaker 2:          19:28          And the only opportunities we will propose even in this big city in capital that looked for us, you know, huge, tremendous, uh, place. Um, we, we only had the opportunity as well similar to those that I saw, um, the opportunities that women had in my childhood, you know, to serve someone. And of course, very often Ukrainian women are, uh, because, uh, mainly claim that they are beautiful. But what is true, they're not educated and poor. And this becomes a reason to involve, usually involve women in sexual exploitation, prostitution. And of course, um, you know, on my way to university everyday, all right, I could be here, first of all, harassed second, received many flyers, uh, from, uh, what pimps or brothers who would propose you to go to work and many women, many girls did a goal and you know, applied for such a job because you don't have other disabilities because you're not horrible than anything else.

Speaker 2:          20:30          So for us to first reason to start the activity was to fight this disease, this illness of Eastern Europe. Oh, considering women as sex slaves, this prostitute. And we were campaigning against prostitution and sex tourism, which is a really widespread disease in Ukraine particularly. Um, and we were competing against that wearing pink clothes and carrying pink balloons and pink flags, believing that was this pink color. We will attract attention to, um, to this problem. However, of course we failed and, uh, uh, organizing protests with hundred, 200 female activists and nobody was even stopping when they were passing by to read our banners. And, uh, we were in search of tactics of the waste, how we can attract attention of this very political. Um, again, desperate society to something very essential to the rights of women, something that the whole world is already talking about, accepting, changing, you know, adopting laws.

Speaker 2:          21:36          Um, and uh, yeah, well, for two years we, uh, we, we were in desperate search and uh, um, in 2010 we saw that the situation in Ukraine was changing because I'm the dictator, which we understood later, dictator Yanukovych was elected as a president and distribution was changed. You could immediately feel the sends ship in media could immediately feel the change of political situation and the more than the country. And we understood that, uh, we'll probably have to go as a female activist as a female. Voices would probably have to complain about something broader or something that brings us to this problem, you know, more limited problems such as prostitution and sex tourism. Um, something that is to the root of the problem, the political situation, the economical situation, those people who bring the society, uh, in such state. So we did our first topless projects, 2010, to be honest. Uh, it was more, as an experiment. It was also sort of a scream from inside and as I said it was, it was a decision made during this, you know, being in a very, in a desperate search of how to let people hear women's voices and their problems.

Speaker 1:          23:01          How did that first moment feel for you when you did the topless protest? Because you guys, even if it hadn't picked up much traction, you were already talking about things as you've said that we're sort of not accepted in society. So you're already going against the grain, but then, yeah, you realized, all right, we've got to do something that's going to really get us publicity the right way and all that. How did literally that first moment when you took off your top feel?

Speaker 2:          23:23          Well, I should say that I didn't do that that moment because I did it a year after because we had a huge discussion in the, in the group, um, well, sort of in the fights about whether to do it or not. Uh, uh, because so, and I was one of those who were against topless protests, so that came later for me. But I'm definitely had a huge effect because we have now, we not only had the unpopular speech, but we also use them very unpopular tactic. We were showing something, any job, a woman, which is very important to learn this society. The image of a woman which was popular in Ukraine was the, you know, a nice, smiling, sexy, a cleaning lady. Um, but so we were showing a screaming and grape bare breasted woman. What was the message was slogan written across her chest, uh, which was something that was breaking completely the definition, you know, the, the, yeah, the definition or imagination that the contexts in which people could see that the woman and the definition of woman in generally in Ukraine.

Speaker 2:          24:32          And uh, of course it was a, it attracted a lot of attention or different attention as well as some support. There is support from Ukraine. And of course, uh, we felt a huge support from abroad. Um, and a lot of criticism, of course, of course we would have been named a prostitutes immediately because we were naked, which again revealed something that, um, for people, you know, naked woman is equal to prostitutes. And I'm actually, I should say that it was this topless project, what we are reaching, I think that we're committing sort of a test for democracy. We commit a test, we test the society and uh, uh, with this tactic was the messages and speeches that we have with test society and will reveal a lot. Um, we reveal a lot on the reaction on those projects. So I should say that what we actually do very often people say feminine are violent because we are aggressive because we're screaming.

Speaker 2:          25:36          I'm so, which immediately makes the fear that for people, you know, a woman who is angry is the violence is something violent. We, you'll find to see angry men, but with women, which is not smiling or keeping silent, but who's screaming is something violent. Really, a we probably killed were probably feeling some people buy our messages. Um, I mean, of course literally we do not harm. We do not, we do not interact, you know, we don't touch anyone physically. We can touch and attack ideas. We buy our ideas, but what actually do is we appear take off our top and strip. Our ID is written and our buddies we create. I think that we transform our bodies in the political messages, in our manifesto, in posters if you want this. These are posters on which we write our slogans. And uh, I think this way we, I think it's kind of, yeah, there are a few functions because the first function of course is to provoke, to attract attention.

Speaker 2:          26:45          Second is that we change the meaning of what naked budget it is. It's not. There are so many. You can see women, naked women everywhere on covers of magazines, on billboards. They opposing smiling, sexy. What we're showing, we're showing woman who's not sexy, but uh, you know, she's political her by this political. She's not smiling, she's screaming, she's not inviting you to use her. She's refusing. She is showing her anger. She's showing that she's demanding something. And of course this is something that breaks a lot of stereotypes and rules. And traditions in particularly in society like Ukraine have generally in many countries, we received a very different reaction of such protests and I think it reveals a lot. It mirrors a lot.

Speaker 1:          27:36          Well, what's interesting is you're really talking about the true roots of what feminism really is. You are demanding to be accepted as an absolute equal to a man, which really is what you first wave feminism here in the west was. It's now changed and morphed into something else. But all you're demanding sort of is equality. Um, I've seen you described as a sex streaming. Do you like that word? Do you guys, you've used that word a little bit, but I've heard it about you more.

Speaker 2:          28:08          Alright. Well this is the word that we created actually, and we're done.

Speaker 2:          28:14          It defines itself is sex drummist. Um, because we use our sex, the fact that we have female as our weapons. Our God is our weapons. And I think this is also sort of a not unser to fundamentalist terrorists who use the gun, who actually killed people. We showed them our, my buddies, my weapon. Because first of all, you are scared of it as if it was actually a weapon who, which could kill you in a second. We see that this budget really can destroy, um, you know, can destroy bad ideas or at least challenge them or provoke them a great discussion. So yes, we call it ourselves is because we use our sex, sex as a weapon, our bodies, our weapon.

Speaker 1:          29:00          Okay. So as I mentioned at the top of the show, and as you've illustrated here, quite obviously, it's not just that you talk about these things, but you literally are putting your life on the line. I mean, just by taking your shirt off, the amount of people who you've angered, it's, it's incredible. It's crazy. But you've also had very close brushes with the law, with actual terrorism and violence. Can you go into a couple examples of the KGB example in boundaries and just, and, and you were literally an event that you were speaking about, free speech was shot up. Uh, and there's some crazy audio of that. Can you just talk about those two examples?

Speaker 2:          29:36          Well, yes, I think, I think this is what I was talking about that will reveal a lot of things with this protest, but to be honest, we didn't expect that we will, you know, just topless woman was the worst written across the chest, could um, you know, could invite the garments and secret services to chase them, arrest them, kidnapped them and torture. We have been literally tortured in bellerose after one of our projects that we staged in December 2011, which was an anniversary 19 December 2011 anniversary of a one year anniversary for huge German stroke patient in the co where during which many people have been arrested, mainly disappeared and some reportedly have been killed. But the information is always hidden there. And we stayed in ironical protest, mocking a dictator. Luca Shen come in front of a KGB office, which is officially official kg be, um, a service there.

Speaker 2:          30:38          And during the protests, journalists have been grabbed by the staff, a kgb stuff. The man who came out of the office of KGB and we, we were ignored so we could leave the place. They certainly knew that they will be able to catch us before the, what was important, but in that moment for them to stop the journalist from releasing the images. Um, however, some journalists managed to do it. They left before I'm having an experience, obviously working in Belarus and later, a few hours after when we were at the bus station in Maine, Cisco on our way back to Kiev to Ukraine, um, we have been grabbed and thrown into bus in which we spend the whole night of being questioned by men. Um, well, we saw their faces. They didn't hide themselves, but, uh, they were clearly saying that they're kgb and they were asking us who paid us for this protests.

Speaker 2:          31:34          They were saying that, uh, would they know that Europe pays us, which is ridiculous, you know, who is Europe? I was trying to ask them as well. They did sir. Um, because they were the ones asking questions. So, um, yeah. And uh, after that night we have been brought to a forest, uh, uh, in which we changed the buses. We were taking the bus and there was another group of men, a faces of who we couldn't see anymore, uh, because, um, the plastic handcuffs and our hands and we were not allowed to move and had to keep our heads down and looking on the floor. Um, well we heard during I think five, six hours drive, we heard that we will be killed. We heard the description, you know, different description of how we can be killed at and uh, um, we will ask to, to breathe loud because they wanted to hear us breathing saying that in few hours we will not be able to breathe.

Speaker 2:          32:36          They were saying that they will send our core parts of bodies to our mothers and so on and so forth, which was of course done very professionally. Um, you know, you could feel that this man do this everyday. It's their job actually to retort to people like that. Um, we received a few hits, but they were not beating us severely, but later we were taking out of the bus in a forest and they're, um, what they were. They were doing a horrible things such as putting the blame on us and playing very, you know, coming with a fire very close to the body. So you feel like you would, they will burn you alive right now. They made us undress a turn and so they were creating situations when you feel like next second they will rape you, they will burn you, they will kill you, they will cut you a, you know what they did, they cut my hair was knife, they were, you know, they throw some uh, know green antiseptic and my face, which I couldn't wash away or like things that were somehow at some point with some, it's ridiculous, but it was, it was tortured, was psychological and physical torture.

Speaker 2:          33:57          They were filming everything on to video cameras. So it was supposed to be reported to someone, uh, and uh, we, so 15 men around us and masks and the fact that they were wearing masks made me think that they will not kill us because they hide their faces. Um, however, I didn't know how far they will go in their action and uh, they after this torture, they throw us out of the forest and, uh, we spent another five hours, six hours to find someone and we found a village, what village? It's a big word probably for seven houses, and we were in the middle of the forest. We found them. We were lucky enough that at that moment there was someone who came from the CT and had mobile phone and of course for 24 hours already all at least Russian speaking world researching for us and information was spread everywhere and we easily contacted our colleagues and journalists. And later four hours later, the embassy of Ukraine arrived to police station, which we were staying for some time. And it took us back to Kiev. Um, well this is one of the experience, uh, um, you know, in Ukraine, um, also we constantly were falling over by secret services, threatened and uh, um, well they opened for criminal cases against us for hooliganism. This is some thing that they use in Ukrainian Russia against political activist. For example, right now the reserve artists pop landscape who burned the door of a Russian secret service,

Speaker 3:          35:38          um, and he's also redundancy hooligan. Well, they treat us as a whole against, because this is something very vague, you know, you could, um, you could pull anyone who like and, and uh, yeah. And then Ukraine, uh, uh, after our first and very loud protest against union of Church and state, um, I had to flee. I had to leave the country because, uh, uh, well, literally I had to jump out from the window of my apartment a jump in the car and run away. Um,

Speaker 1:          36:13          when this stuff has happened to you, I mean, I know you can, you have so many examples of this which we could, you know, we could spend hours talking about, but when these things have happened to you, I mean, what happened to you in that forest? It sounds horrific. You survive, but obviously their goal is intimidation. Their goal of course, is to silence you. And then by silencing you they silence your followers and that's how they end you guys. They don't have to actually kill you. So I'm curious afterwards, after something like that happens, do you or did you feel all right, maybe we've taken this as far as it should go or did it, did you immediately double down and say, now we're getting somewhere with this?

Speaker 3:          36:53          Well, of course I'm not going to play a superhero. And of course you have older fear you feel you'll feel that I will not right after you. I will never do it again. Um, but then, you know, after some time thinking about it and really spending time on repeating in your mind what really happened? You understand that it's not, it's not us who went too far is their reaction goes too far, probably because we do something which they don't want to happen. And so it means that we do something very right. And I think, of course, again, I will never deny that we have fear. We do have fear, but I should say that the fear of the fear of giving up to those people is much bigger than fear of being taken to the forest. At least you already know how it feels and what it is. Um, and again, your fear, it's a choice, right? So we'll probably make a choice not to fear but to who to deal with the fear and to continue the activity because again, just think about how ridiculous actually this all is. There are girls who take off their tops and write slogans and for that had taken to the forest, KGB staff, I spending with them 24 hours torturing them and doing all the insane things. How ridiculous this is. How ridiculous is the fact that there are people blending terrorists, attacks, taking guns, blowing themselves up because they want to stop those who drove her car

Speaker 3:          38:32          but caricatures do, you know who drove very funny or not funny for some cartoons, but something so peaceful. So somehow very childish as well. You know, it was something very simple. So I think that it also reveals a lot of shows, um, how it shows the. Yeah, how crippled our society is, how the, how we, we replaced the fight or the. Yeah, the fights a of ideas by actually divide between people. And uh, I think that this is the reason to continue. And, and, uh, you know, sometimes people say, well, you're ready to do it for six years and you're only 25 and you already have been nearly killed at least three times. What, what makes you go on? But this actually, this is exactly the reason that make you go go on because you understand that just because you say, you know, you write three words in your body or you write an article or you draw a cartoon, they went to kill you for that. Isn't it ridiculous? Doesn't make sure that I leave in six society and because I don't want to live in society, I continue, I go on, I know that the history of my time is written right now and, uh, well to let fundamentalist, a dictator's misogynists to write history of my time. Well, I don't agree with that. I want to participate writing the history.

Speaker 1:          39:53          Yeah, I mean, listen, I love everything you just said though. The whole spirit of everything that I do is exactly that. You're at, you're at the front lines of it. So that's a good segue actually to, in 2013, uh, you got asylum in France and you live in France now, and that must've been an interesting time to move to France because shortly after that a was the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Now you, you knew some of the cartoonists, right? You had worked with them a little bit. Um, so can you talk about that?

Speaker 2:          40:22          Well, I knew all the Darnest, um, those who died and those who survived as well. Um, we had to, well, we were friends, we were really friends and we spend a lot of time just together debating, discussing and sharing what was shared. A lot of ideas and to be honest, when I arrived to France and after few of protest that we organized in France and clearly stated our direct message, not message, which is following all these demands of political correctness. No unnecessary political, correct. It is. And you rope. I'm Charlotte. We're the only one who were really on the same line with us and we became really friendly and it's very, very soon. And we even made a, a, one issue of Charlotte though together with feminine. Um, and uh, well yeah, and of course we will sometime we were spending ridging to each other, the threats that we were receiving and laughing and making fun of the, of the fanatics who were spending time for writing those threats and uh, you know, writing this pitches which they were a recording

Speaker 3:          41:34          now. Voicemails. Um, yeah, and of course losing your friends, not only friends, you know. Yeah, not only friends, but I do a logic ideological friends or brothers if you want was of course was again something which of course it's personally very hard and have a, a lose, but also is something that reveals the Lord, shows you again, shows you that if you stop, then you will fail and new ideas will fail. I believe that maybe it will be, it will sound a bit old, but even those cartoonists who died, who were killed, they didn't lose and their ideas, they are not, the ideas are not failure. They, they will always remain as a nurse and it, those who continue to do what they believed in and that what they believe in is the right thing because they will not harm anyone. They were contributing to a very important, since things such as freedom of expression and they were contributing to this to keep and save the values of France as well, which is a liberty equality fraternity, which is, you know, sometimes today you think that it, it, it remains only on the buildings written on the buildings, but not actually in life, not actually applied and life of society anymore.

Speaker 3:          42:59          So Charlotte Heroes, part of being friends, they are heroes. Uh, however, I should also mention that just the months before they, they were killed, they were racist, Islamophobes, uh, you know, they, they will always named for being too much for going too far, for, for offending. We all know that.

Speaker 1:          43:21          Right? And just to be very clear, I know this has been said a thousand times over, but they were not racist and they were not Islamophobia, which is a made up word by the way, but they were not. They were pointing out the, they made fun of everybody and I think something like it's three percent of the covers were about Islam, but they equally attacked Christianity and Judaism and all the religions. It was about power. So they were making cartoons about the exact things that you were protesting in the streets. It was really kind of amazing.

Speaker 3:          43:51          I mean, I think what you mentioned just now that only three percent of the covers and they're all material in newspaper was about Islam also shows something that we were also discussing with them often and you know, as we talk about France and things that happened in France, maybe to make sense to quote a voluntary gain here. Um, and this words attribute it to him. He said that if you want to find out who rules over you, simply understand who you are not allowed to criticize. So even this three percent, you know, of the, of the information or the, the, the topic, you know, I slept, it was just taking three percent of the, of the whole information off Charlotte door really shows a lot. So that of course is the youngest from three minutes they stick religions, the most ambitious probably today, the most demanding religion. It really reveals its face to face and reacts in a different way.

Speaker 1:          44:50          Right. So I know you've talked about the regressive left and it started for me, Charlie Hebdo was the beginning of my awakening which happened over the course of the next year or so. Um, but what do you make of the group of people and we had plenty of them here in the United States and I'm sure you had plenty of them in France as well. People on the left, people that are for women's rights and for gay rights and for minority rights that suddenly when it came to what happened with Charlie Hebdo at, ah, you shouldn't have, you know, you shouldn't have made fun of the cartoons. You shouldn't have done these cartoons. Talked about the profit, whatever it is, people who otherwise are totally for free speech and free expression. Suddenly they're not in this case. Uh, so what do you make of those people and how pervasive is that idea in France these days?

Speaker 3:          45:36          Well, um, you said that it all started for you off to Charlotte. Do I think that it became so visible in France as well after Charlotte recently also after Cologne attacks in Germany, uh, which we can also discuss not only lectures but also feminist reaction or feminist non-reaction. Uh, so I think that's a, yeah, it's after these events we could see this, you know, fraction of leftists who would deny the ins the essential problem, who would be scared to talk about the roots of the problem, who will, who will be willing not to talk about Charlotte killers as people with guns and not discuss their ideas and not discuss what they were screaming wild shooting our friends, what they were in, in the name of who they committed these atrocities and what made them could believe. And then they have to do that. So, um, I think that this is something, again, which of course brings Europe in a very big danger and especially the values of Europe in a very big danger.

Speaker 3:          46:51          And therefore, I say that sometimes working in Paris, I read this three words that the slogan of French Revolution, and I understand that this is very far from reality today from the society, and of course you hear the leaders, the leftest leaders here who tried to, you know, make speeches to defend freedom of expression and make of Charlotte door a heroes, um, because they're, you know, John List who fell down but they do not, will not want to discuss for which ideas they, they found that for which ideas they were killed. So many of them, you know, of course do it. I'm out of fear, but very different theater. There is a very big fear to be a, to have similar speech too, right wing, similar speech to actually xenophobes and racists such as Japan here in France, therefore left is decided to take this very ridiculous, again, intellectually dishonest position such as denying their roots. And they did the real, the, the central problem in the situation. And I think this way, the betrayal. So the ideas of Charlotte and of course, yes. So at the end, the result is that it's only or extreme right wing, the racists, the xenophobes who are speaking out actually.

Speaker 1:          48:24          Yeah. And this is, this is what I've said repeatedly here, is that we on the left have to deal with this because if we don't, and this is exactly what your peace in the international business times was about. If, if the, if we don't deal with the regressive left, then who do we hand it to? The racist, right? That, that was your, your term. And I couldn't agree more. So when you say that France in terms of free speech and uh, people getting along, would you say Francis in a worse position now, do you think that there was a net loss in free speech after Charlie Hebdo? Because there were a couple weeks after where the whole world united and, and you know, all those world leaders came to Paris and it sounded like something good was going to happen. But I sent you think it's probably the reverse now.

Speaker 3:          49:07          Well, again, there are so many aspects to discuss here. This manifestation that happened after the 11th of January was ridiculous. And, uh, the, the, the cartoonists who survived a lose, for example, who made the next cover, uh, was Muhammad was prophet, uh, I'm crying, we were laughing with him again. Parity. It's true. Rebel, laughing because in front of him there was a line of all the enemies of ideas of Charlotte and they will marching, you know, again, if this event was so full of hypocrisy because fact they were marching at least this front line. Well, marching, not for the, not for the right ideas, you know, they were pretending they were. Yeah, it was, it was fake. I'm not talking about the million of people, but I'm talking about this front line, which was totally ridiculous. And what happened after there was so many events dedicated to discussion of free speech, which we were, which were cancelled by the government, by police, uh, in order to, you know, for, for security reasons or events in which me, myself was supposed to participate.

Speaker 3:          50:29          So many of them were canceled. Again, the event that happened just one month, often Copenhagen during which I was speaking, was interrupted by another terrorist. And, uh, again, uh, one person who had been killed and injured. So this way, you know, again, I think that we failed after Charlotte, do we failed with all this ridiculous thing such as inviting, actually the, the representatives or those of those who are feeding the terrorist, um, those who feed the ideas that are well actually cannot go exist with ideas of freedom of speech. Inviting them to Paris to March for ideas of Charlotte is something that already showed that we will fail in this discussion. And I don't want to make your conclusion that we did fail, but I feel we are failing. I'm here in Europe. The Europe is fading. European society is failing because they're not ready to weld to face. Very uncomfortable, very unpleasant, but truth, they are not, they are not able to hear. Unpopular speech and freedom of speech is really about something. If liberty is really something, it's definitely about unpopular speech. It's about hearing, accepting this unpopular, uncomfortable speech and to Europe is failing of doing that.

Speaker 1:          51:54          So we only have a couple of minutes left and I know we're just getting into the meat of this, so we're going to have to do this again where we can talk for much longer, but uh, I, I hear you on the Europe part and that's, I get so much email now from the same people saying the same things in Denmark and in France and in Germany and Finland, all of these countries, people are saying the exact same things that you're talking about and they feel that there is no faith in the government that the governments are going to do the right things and all of that. So, uh, so let's end on this. So the Cologne event that, that happened in Germany with this, it sounds like a thousand men were running rampant throughout the city and it's unclear if they were all immigrants or migrants or whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          52:33          The reaction to that must have been particularly upsetting to you because he dealt with sort of the free speech stuff and bringing all these people in. But it also directly. This was in a direct assault on women. So it really went to everything that you care about was the reaction to that because I saw a feminists that were not defending the women. I suddenly saw a feminist online, well known feminists that were saying, oh, this is just an excuse for the xenophobes and white men do it too. And all of those things. Uh, so that was one must have been particularly upsetting, right?

Speaker 3:          53:06          Well, it was, um, yeah, of course it was not only on, not only upsetting, you don't. I think that's, yeah. Today we use, you look around and you see the, those who were supposed to be your allies, those supports to share with you with a very fundamental values. And Stanford them either keep silence or try to support. Actually you are aggressors. The of women, just because of the fact it was reported that among the aggressors were men know who looked like Arabic man or north African region feminists, silence. They didn't want to discuss, uh, what actually happened just because of fear of again being, you know, having the speech of extreme right wing and at the end who appeared to be actual defenders of a women, you know, who were raped an aggressive after prolonged what extreme, right. Wait again, the platform was giving to them.

Speaker 3:          54:08          So I think that to those people who write you emails and to people who write me as well a lot and put support who feel very feel betrayed, the sad, uh, by the situation with that is going on today in Europe by leftist reactions, by the reaction, some of a reaction of the feminists. I think we have to understand that to be sad is not enough to be sad, you know, makes people cry and a stay at home and feel low, you know, alone. But what we have to be, many people don't like to face it, but what we have to be today, we have to be angry. I think anger brings people to action. Not Hate, but anger. Anger for defense, for the fact that you ideas are attacked, that something very essential for your life and joy of life which people have today here. Opportunity to enjoy life today, here in Europe, you have to defend it and for that you have to feel anger. Don't feel sad. I feel angry. Act and defend your ideas and don't let the extreme right wing ride your own history. Let's write it with our own beautiful liberal ideas. That's my message.

Speaker 1:          55:21          Well, you know, I don't even have to ask you a final question because you couldn't have ended this any better. You absolutely have an ally in me and I'm sure and much of my audience so everyone can find more of his work@InaDashShevchenko.com. I thank you for joining me and we absolutely will do this again because I feel like we just, we just touched the surface of all this, so thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it.
