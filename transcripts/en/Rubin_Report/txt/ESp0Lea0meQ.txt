Speaker 1:          00:00:05       It's president's week here on the Rubin report working with learn liberty to bring you five shows in five days on five different presidents of the United States. And joining me today is professor of history and economics at San Jose State University and author of the book emancipating the slaves and slaving free men, a history of the American civil war, Jeffrey Rogers. Humble. Welcome to the Rubin report. It's a pleasure to be on the Rubin report. We have already just in the few minutes we've been sitting here, we talked about almost every other prison right now. I guess we're going to have to get to this Lincoln guy. Yes, definitely. Let's do it. So first off, the obvious question, was he actually a vampire hunter? Uh, I doubt it. It's not a show that I watched was a movie. I forgot it was a movie. I thought it was a documentary, but apparently not.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       All right. There's a lot I want to talk to you now. It was obvious when we were selecting our five presidents to do this week, we wanted to do some of some of the big ones and some smaller ones. And hopefully we'll do this for many years to come and get to everybody. But Lincoln was the one I was like, all right, we got to do it because I think if you polled most Americans, they always say that Lincoln is their favorite. I think probably George Washington comes in second, but I think Lincoln is the big one. Um, so I want to do a little bit on his bio then I want to do obviously on the political stuff and civil war and freeing the slaves. And I want to talk about some of the interesting criticisms that you have of him in this book. Uh, but first let's just start a little bit about

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       childhood. Where should we start a. well, Lincoln was born in Kentucky, a 18. Oh, nine. Um, and grew up in a, in a very poor frontier household. Uh, his mother died when he was very young. It was partly raised by, uh, by a stepmother. They moved to Indiana and basically, um, he educated himself, uh, and um, and it was a humble background as he would have, as he, as he described it himself.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       How is that possible to educate himself? Back then, I mean, it was he just grabbing books where he was just grabbing

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       books and reading them at every opportunity he could get. Um, uh, and um, uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       basically that's basically the story. Do we know anything about his further education as he got a little bit older?

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       Uh, I don't know anything about his further education and I don't think he was university educated. Um, he obviously went on to get a law degree, but in those days, getting a law degree was you clerked under a lawyer and then, um, you hung out your shingle, right? Uh, uh, so, uh, as far as formal education is concerned, uh, he didn't have very much of that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       Yeah. Was his real ambition at first

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       to be a lawyer? Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       I don't know whether he had a real ambition at first. I mean, you know, he, he, he, he had a lot of other kinds of more frontier oriented jobs. Right. That's how he got the nickname, the rail splitter. I'm working on the rivers, uh, and uh, and those sorts of things. And so, um, I think he just sort of fell into a law. Yeah. So he's alone, but eventually, I mean, eventually politics became his passion.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       Yeah. So he's a lawyer and then politics became his passion. Yeah. I would say

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       two are interrelated because remember at that time, uh, um, many of your politicians, if not most of your politicians, uh, we're either came through the military or through the profession of law.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Yeah. Was there a seminal moment for him that he realized this is when and why I have to get into politics?

Speaker 3:          00:04:03       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       no, I don't think so. I don't think so, uh, you know, it's like a life happens and opportunities open and you take advantage of them. Yeah. Um, and uh, you know, he, he, I had a legal profession, uh, in Illinois and then he was elected to the Illinois legislature, uh, eventually elected to the House of Representatives, uh, for a short time, uh, and um, and became very prominent, uh, in the Illinois Whig Party.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       Yeah. What were his politics like in time and what was the whig party like? Okay, well this is one of the places,

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       if, if you, um, look at the two parties, ideologically at that time it was the whigs versus the Democrats and the wigs or the intervention intervention is party. Uh, the wigs were in favor of high protective tariffs. They were in favor of spending a lot of money, government money on internal improvements, what we call infrastructure today, uh, and they were in favor of a nationally chartered bank and a lot of these policies were the outgrowth of one of the most prominent wig leaders, Henry Clay and what he termed as American system. Whereas by this time, the Democratic Party had become the party of a laissez faire, a low tariffs, getting rid of the national bank and in fact actually trying to divorce government from any relationship with banks, um, and at least trying to keep the federal government out of funding internal improvement.

Speaker 1:          00:05:53       Yeah. That, that's very interesting to me because in a modern sense, that seems to be bit of a reversal on where we're at right now. Was, was Lincoln really in line with.

Speaker 2:          00:06:03       Oh yeah. I mean, he really admired Henry Clay. Henry Clay, what was his hero? Uh, and he, uh, he supported all of those policies down the line when he was in, uh, the state legislature in Illinois. He was crucial and passing a very expensive internal improvements program in Illinois that subsequently almost drove the state into bankruptcy, a financing of canals and railroads.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       So fiscally at the time he was, he was spending a lot and did the, the infrastructure deal actually makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       Uh, well, I'm uh, no, in other words, in other words, if, if what happened is that the states went through sort of two phases in terms of infrastructure. The first phase was canal building and the second phase was railroads. These are often referred to as phases of the transportation revolution. During that period, uh, the canal building or GE was actually set off by a New York building, the Erie Canal, which is one of the few examples of a socialist enterprise that actually made a profit. And so this inspired a lot of other states to build canals, almost all of which lost money and created financial problems for the states that, uh, uh, uh, built them, which is suggest that they were not economically justified. Uh, and then as a result of the state's losing so much money on the canals, um, initially they were heavily involved in railroads and they continue to subsidize the railroads, but at least, uh, by the 18, 40 [inaudible] and 18 fifties, they weren't owning outright the railroads the way they had owned outright the canals. And therefore, um, uh, even the, the, the, there was a little bit too much railroad expansion, a subsidized by the government, but it wasn't as significant as the problems created by the canal building.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       Interesting. Because this is a part of Lincoln that I don't, you know, we mostly think about the civil war and freeing the slaves, but the economic party sort of interesting. What do you think has sort of overriding economic policy was because it sounds like it was, it was.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       Well, he carried this policy into the presidency. The first, a subsidized transcontinental railroads were during Lincoln's administration during the civil war, and that resulted in many other trans continentals and being subsidized by the national government and a whole bunch of a pork barrel legislation and in the post civil war period, and a lot of scandals, corruption involved as well. So, um, uh, so, so his economic views continued throughout his entire career. And these were, this was the main dividing line between the two policies to the, between the two political parties, uh, because up until the civil war, uh, both political parties tied to straddle the issue of slavery, so they would both be national parties. Um, so they tried to keep it out as best they could out of the political arena. When did he start talking about slavery? Really? I mean, when he was in the Illinois legislature.

Speaker 2:          00:09:33       No, he doesn't really start talking about slavery. Um, he, uh, he, he had a visceral dislike of slavery, uh, from his youth, but he didn't really start talking about slavery until, um, after the Kansas Nebraska Act. And slavery becomes a, a prominent issue and it causes a, the death of the whig party, um, and the collapse of the, uh, of the wake park. Can you explain that a little bit more? Why, why that actually? Yeah. Well, see both parties initially try to straddle the slavery issue, but as, as it evolves over time, um, the whig party being more interventionists tends to be stronger in New England. I'm a, whereas the Democratic Party tending to be non intervention is, tends to be stronger in the south and the West. And so, uh, the both parties feel the strain between northern and southern Democrats, northern and southern wigs, but the whig party is actually blown apart by that strain after, uh, the Kansas Nebraska Act.

Speaker 2:          00:10:50       And one issue that causes the demise of the whig party a is slavery. So you have the split between northern whigs in southern wigs. Um, and then also another issue that comes to the fore during that period is immigration. Um, uh, there is a, a nativist movement, uh, that, uh, um, uh, some, uh, wigs, uh, end up embracing. And that also is a, plays a role in the, in the demise of the whig party. What was his policy on? Well, actually Lincoln was fairly good on that. I mean, he was, in other words, there was a debate within the councils of the Republican Party about, um, you know, between those who were more nativist and who, those who are less nativist and Lincoln was definitely on the side of the one he didn't want. He didn't want the Republican Party to be able to take a, a platform stand on, on nativism opposing, uh, uh, immigration or actually they, they, they weren't proposing restrictions on immigration so much as restrictions on acquiring citizenship.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       So when the whig party fell apart and then basically the remnants became the Republican Party. What, what, what was that like, what, like where did they literally just. Well, actually the people are, well initially, initially the Republican Party as a coalition of antislavery wigs and antislavery Democrats. So it, um, it's exclusively a sectional party. It's almost exclusively. So, just to be really clear on that though. So the Republican Party actually was the original antislavery party. It was taking from both sides, and we're taking, now we need to be clear about this term antislavery, um, uh, because being antislavery was, was a, a broad tent. I'm at one extreme where the abolitionists, um, and at least in America, the term abolitionists refers to a antislavery, a advocates who favor immediate emancipation of all slaves and full political rights for all African Americans. So, um, there's a whole range of antislavery, uh, positions. And so the Republican Party, uh, the abolitionists are always a minority and the Republican Party, I'm succeeds where the abolitionists don't succeed by reducing antislavery to its lowest common denominator, essentially one issue which is opposing the spread of slavery into the territories.

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       And so you have a, and again, the Kansas Nebraska Act, uh, in which, uh, in which, uh, Kansas and Nebraska were opened to slavery, uh, in violation of the Missouri compromise is what sort of inspires this, a concern among antislavery northerners. So just to, just to be clear, at the beginning of the civil war, there are a lot of Democrats involved in former Democrats involved in the Republican Party. Lincoln's secretary of State Solomon chases a former Democrat, um, several Republican governors, uh, and send it, pardon me, yet, Republican senators and governors are former Republican. So in Lincoln's election, that Republican party has to sort of straddle these economic issues to keep both sides of the coalition Together. Where did he fall when, when he was running for president, where did he fall on that scale of abolitionists? To what, what would you call you? Call that other group. They were sort of, well, they're just a, they're just anti slavery and, um, but what, what that approach that they had, what would you refer to?

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       Is that pragmatic or what did they base? It was a. well, gradualist pragmatic. Basically, again, this is where Lincoln follows Henry Clay. Henry clay was a favorite. W W was in favor of colonization in other words, uh, not just, uh, having a, a plan of perhaps compensated emancipation, um, in which freed slaves, um, are, uh, move to back to Africa. And Lincoln was a big advocate of colonization. And in fact, he continues to pursue colonization. Um, even after the outbreak of the civil war. Um, by the end of the civil war, he's probably given up on that, but during the civil war, uh, he, uh, sponsored one, a disastrous attempt at colonization in Haiti, uh, that, um, it just didn't work. What happened? Well, what happened is that they, they, they got the, um, I'm a little bit hazy on the details but, but um, some land was acquired in Haiti and they got some African Americans who agreed to move there and then it was not just economically unviable, but, uh, does had problems with disease.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       And so the whole colony collapse. In other words, he wanted to do it. He was, he wanted to push it in Latin America, something similar to Liberia. I'm in, I'm in Africa, which also was also a colonization, skiing a set up by the American Colonization Society of which Henry Clay was a participant. Right. So there's a couple of interesting things there. So you referenced that the Whig Party itself had a sort of internal conflict between their northern representatives and that would be someone like Abraham Lincoln had their southern. If you are a local representative in the legislature in Illinois, did it ever come up to talk about, I mean, why would slavery even really, it was only within the national discussion, right? Like was it something that people were actually voting on in any way or not at the state level? No, I'm. Th, they're hard to think of party politics into 2018 lens without everything being a national and everybody affected by every little thing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       Yeah, yeah. No, the only sense in which it was it the only sense in which the state you got involved at the state level was with respect to the fugitive slave law. So if you look at the history of slavery, there's always this tension between free states and slave states, um, even at the constitutional convention, uh, but it, um, is usually kept below the surface except during, uh, these, uh, instances where it, where it erupts and then it's resolved. So you first have a Missouri coming in as a slave state, which leads to the Missouri compromise and then, uh, things calmed down and then you have the tariff issue, which is partially driven by South Carolina slave. Um, and then you have a things calming down with the annexation of Texas and California coming in as a state. Slavery becomes a big issue again. Um, and it's partially, um, uh, I'm, I'm calmed down by the compromise of 1850 and then after that you'll have the Kansas Nebraska act.

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       And then, uh, then there's no calming it down anymore. And the compromise of 1850 is responsible. Part of the, part of what southerners got out of the compromise of 1850 or more precisely slaveholders was the slave, was the fugitive slave act of 1850. I'm now one of the, one of the constitutional deals, I mean, right in the constitution, there's a fugitive slave provision in which, um, it's the obligation of free states to return runaway slaves. And The Washington administration actually passed the first fugitive slave act. But the fugitive slave act of 1850 was one of the most draconian laws that Congress ever enacted. And, um, uh, in other words, it set up a, a bureaucracy of commissioners who would hear, um, uh, cases of fugitive slaves. They got $5 if they decided that, uh, that the, uh, a person wasn't a slave and $10, if they decided it was a sleigh, uh, they, um, the slave had no right to represent j station.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       I'm a jury trial. No right to testify. The legislature and, uh, the uh, uh, the commissioners could, um, uh, um, uh, require the cooperation of individuals, um, uh, to apprehend runaways. And if you violated a that you could face a jail sentence, $1,000 fine, a $1,000 civil penalties for each escaped slave. So it was pretty. So many of your northern states began before this, but began after this passing what were called personal liberty laws. I'm trying to make sure that state officials did not participate in the apprehension and return of runaways. And so that's, that's, that's the, that's the big slavery issue in northern states. Yeah. It sounds like such a crazy thing because they were incentivizing the northern states that may not have wanted to send the slaves back. They were literally financially incentivizing and then as you were saying, there were other people, there were just citizens that were going out there, but also also also made it easier to engage in kidnapping.

Speaker 2:          00:21:03       I'm free blacks. Yeah, bringing them south. Who was fighting this the most? I mean, I would imagine there must've been some states rights people in the north that maybe you didn't even care about slavery per se, but must've said you can't tell what this is. This is one of the things after the compromise of 1850 that brings slavery, starts pushing it to the forefront. And of course this is when a heli, Elliot, a uncle Tom's cabin, um, Henry beat. What's her first name? I'm drawing a blank up. It'll pop up and say I'm a Harriet Beecher stowe rights uncle. Tom's cabin, which becomes a best seller and it's about the fugitive slave issues. So it sensitizes a lot of northerners to the fugitive slave a question. And so a Illinois doesn't pass it a personal liberty law because southern Illinois is actually settled by, um, uh, from the southern, uh, the eastern southern states, uh, but some of your other states like Pennsylvania, uh, and states further north do pass personal liberty laws as a result of either before the fugitive slave act or after the fugitive slave act.

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       So before we get directly into the presidency and the war, is there anything else we need to know about Lincoln's politics at the time or what else was influencing him besides obviously there were states' rights issues, there was obviously the slavery issue. Uh, it, was there anything else that we think of as really the moments that kind of shaped him before the president? I think, I think we've, I think we've covered the important issue. Those are the big ones. Okay. So he runs for president. What do we need to know about that platform? Well, as I say, it tries to paper over the difference between former Democrats informer wigs. It has a, it has a plank about, um, uh, about the tariff, uh, that, uh, can be interpreted differently. Uh, but the primary, a plank is a, his opposition to the spread of slavery into any more territories. Uh, and uh, what's interesting about that plank is that it's essentially that plank has essentially been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the dred Scott decision in the dred Scott decision. The Supreme Court says that I'm, uh, has, uh, the territories are the common property of both nor northerners and southerners, and therefore the national government cannot restrict the property rights of southerners when they move into the territories by preventing them from bringing their slaves. So that,

Speaker 1:          00:24:05       so you have, you have a platform plank that was, that was literally unconstitutional, a declared unconstitutional. I mean, most Supreme Court, uh, most, most, uh, legal scholars today think it was a very bad decision, but yes, it was, had been declared unconstitutional. What do we need to know about the tenor of the political infighting at that time? You know, these days, everyone always says, never has never been worse. Everyone's meaner than ever before. And you know, trump's tweeting this and all that. But, uh, there were some pretty serious fighting. Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       And those kinds of claims or are exaggerated, I mean, you, you can find a campaign rhetoric and campaign literature that, uh, if not vicious version of verges on being vicious throughout this, the period leading up to the civil war. I wouldn't say that the civil war, uh, are the 1860 election is particularly unique in that respect. Um, but what happens is that you end up having a four candidates, a Lincoln as the candidate of the Republican Party, um, and then the Democratic Party splits. So you have Stephen Douglas as the candidate of the northern Democrats. I'm John Breckinridge is the candidate of the southern, uh, Democrats. And then some of your, um, uh, upper tiers, former southern wigs, um, form a constitutional union party. So to oversimplify only a little, it becomes really to elections and election between Lincoln and Douglas in the north and in an election between Breckenridge and John Bell and the Constitutional Union Party in the south.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       Yeah. So the next obvious segue is the Lincoln Douglas Debates, right? That's. No, that's before the 18, 60 election. It was for that election though. No, no, no, no. This is, remember this,

Speaker 2:          00:26:10       I'm, when I'm, senators are still chosen by the state legislature. Uh, so that's one of the things that makes a debate unique because it's the 1858 Senate election in Illinois. The legislature is going to choose who is going to be the senator, but the Republican candidate is, is Lincoln, the Democratic candidate is douglas and then they go around and have these debates, um, at various throughout Illinois. That's funny. I mean, I like to think that I know a lot about this stuff. I had no idea that, that wasn't on the national scale because they did run against each other just two years later, two years later. So this actually propels Lincoln into the forefront of potential candidates for the Republican nomination in 1860, even though the legislature chooses douglass as an Illinois senator. So when I want you to explain what the Lincoln Douglas debates are and why there's such a richness there, but was nothing like this even done before that when we, everyone talks about it like it was so revolutionary or we so desperately could use it these days.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       I wouldn't, I wouldn't go so far as say it nothing like it, but in terms of how extensive it was and the draw, it was unprecedented. Uh, can you explain the basic tenants of sort of how it would work? Um, well, basically they picked out various locations in Illinois, I forget the number of debates and they would travel there and then they would, um, a face off each other and the big issue with slavery and Lincoln, his position was prohibiting slavery. The extension of slavery into the territory's Douglass, his position he was trying, he was, the Democratic Party hadn't split, so he was trying to maintain the unity of the Democratic Party. So, uh, his position is known as popular sovereignty and his view was that, um, uh, we leave the territory's open and then let people in the territory's decide whether it's going to be a slave territory or a free territory, but that creates a certain amount of ambiguity because when did I get to decide?

Speaker 2:          00:28:47       Do they only get to the side? I'm a, at the time of statehood, I'm also a, uh, if they decide before statehood, aren't they violating the dred Scott Decision? So, so that was, but there was also a racial element to the debates. Um, because you brought, you brought up the issue of viciousness in the campaigns. I'm, the attempt is to paint Lincoln as an advocate of, um, racial amalgamation because even in the north, uh, despite the northern states being free states, um, in most of the northern states, African Americans face legal disability, um, uh, and uh, and significant social discrimination. So, so, so at this time a Lincoln would make the distinction between, um, between a civil equality, political equality and social equality and civil equality is being means being equal. Before the law, political equality would involve giving African Americans the right to vote and then we know it. Social equality is about. So his position at this time, he did not advocate political equality was not in favor of giving African-americans. Right. So, but he was firmly in favor of civil equality and that's where he and Douglas Different. What was that

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       part? Totally pragmatic in that he felt if he said, well, I am,

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       it might have been programmatic, but remember he, he's, uh, as I said he was, he was in favor of colonization, [inaudible], uh, even if he, even when he began to entertain views of political equality for pragmatic reasons, not politically, but for pragmatic reasons. He wasn't sure if the country was ready. Um, in other words, he would use arguments which I think are sincere, that, that, um, that, that, you know, uh, that the two races are not going to be comfortable living together and that it would be better off for African Americans once free to, uh, move elsewhere. Yeah. Now he, eventually, he eventually dropped that and eventually by the end of his life was a favoring a limited franchise for a freed African Americans in Louisiana. So his ideas are changing. They're progressing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       Yeah. That's what's interesting is that there is an evolution here, which really we find out really in the presidency. Did the abolitionists basically hate him at that point? I mean, did they think he was sort of a sellout or that he just because he was doing the pragmatic thing? Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       abolitionists did. Some abolitionists did ever. Uh, and um, uh, uh, so there was still, there had been before the creation of the Republican party, there had been the liberty party in the free soil party, which were slightly broader antislavery coalitions, but minor minor parties and there still was a radical abolitionist party that ran in 1860, but it garnered very, very, a few votes

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       [inaudible]. Okay. So we started touching them, the beginnings of the election. So basically for candidates running, right, because of the split in the Democratic Party. What else do we have to know before he gets elected that, that happened?

Speaker 2:          00:32:23       That's pretty much it. I mean, he didn't win the popular vote, but even if you combine the vote of all the other candidates, he still would have won the electoral college. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       Interesting. So what was the beginning of his presidency? Right?

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       Uh, well, um, the beginning of his is a dominated by the, a succession of the deep south. So soon after he was inaugurated, um, well after he's elected, um, the deep south secedes with South Carolina being the first state, and then you have the cotton states, I'm succeeding was even inaugurated now. No, that was right after the election is incredible by the way. One interesting detail that, um, a lot of people are unaware of and South Carolina's ordinance of succession and they're the first state. They're the, they're the most firebrand of all the, a secessionist, um, uh, in their ordinance of secession. Um, they do not, uh, the, the issue they give the largest play too in terms of justifying secession is not Lincoln's election, but northern failure to comply with the fugitive slave clause of the constitution. Now, partially that's a rhetorical ploy because it allows them to argue that the northerners, um, ha ha had divided the constitutional contract first, but it also reflects a deep concern about I'm a fugitive slaves.

Speaker 2:          00:33:58       And, and one of the, one of the points that I make in my book is that I think most historians have underestimated the economic significance of the, of the fugitive slave issue in terms of bringing on succession. And maybe we can get to that. No, I, I do want to get to that. So, um, so, so you have the deep south seceding and they're seizing all of the US military basis except for a few that are holding out and the prominent one that's holding out his fort sumpter and Charleston harbor. Uh, so James Buchanan has to deal with this. He's the lame duck president. He tries to reinforce a sumpter and a South Carolina fires on the ship. And so, but the garrison is still there when Lincoln, it becomes president. So that's the big issue that's dominating a Lincoln's presidency is what do you, what do you do about Fort Sumpter?

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       And I'm a Lincoln. Um, you know, he's getting all kinds of advice. Uh, some people want him to try to. I'm back down on the Republican position about slavery in the territories, but he absolutely refuses to do so. I mean, he's, he has agreed to enforce the fugitive slave act as president, so this is the only antislavery issue and he decides to hang onto it. Um, and uh, someone, a more aggressive policy, someone the more passive policy, basically I'm Lincoln essentially follows Buchanan's policy, although Buchanan gets a lot of criticism you that and what happens is we'll Buchanan's policy being what being a, trying to reinforce the fort but not using military force to, um, to, to uh, um, hold on to the fort. Gotcha. All right. So, uh, Lincoln sends 'em reinforcements and supplies to the Fort, uh, uh, telling the uh, South Carolina that he's doing.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       So by this time the confederacy is formed, the confederacy fires on Fort Sumpter, right? And, and that's the, that's the nine slash 11 of the civil war. It polarizes both sides of it. Polarizes northerners because up until this time, there are a lot of northern resou saying, well, we should let the south going piece. Many of them think, well, if we let them go and piece, they'll come back. Um, and at the time of Lincoln's inauguration, there's still more slave states in the union then out of the union. Um, but Lincoln responds to the firing on Fort Sumpter by calling out troops and immediately Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas all joined the confederacy. So it, it, it, it's the great divide. Um, with a stroke of the pen, he's, he's doubled the size and the material resources of the confederacy. Yeah. What do we know about his thought process at the time?

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       Well, he really ready for the fallout that was gonna happen. Um, yes and no. And then the escalation. Yes and no. Let me back up a little and explain why he had to do this. All right, uh, why it was politically necessary to do this. Um, many of your abolitionists, particularly William Lloyd Garrison, who is one of my heroes who was advocated immediate emancipation, full political rights for all African Americans. He was also a pacifist. I'm an anarchist, a classical liberal and favor of free trade, free labor, his opposition to slavery. A lot of the radical abolitionist framed it as man stealing. Um, and, you know, in terms of a property rights and he was also in favor of northern secession from the union because he saw the constitution as a pro slavery document. Uh, he, um, denounced the, uh, constitution. I'm a publicly burned a copy and on the masthead of his, of his paper that liberate or no union with slave holders.

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       I'm grace throughout, uh, from 18, 31 on to the civil war. And, and this was true of many of your most radical abolitionists. So basically what you're abolitionists and one of the reasons they were so unpopular is because they were saying you can't have antislavery and union. Um, uh, and uh, people are committed to the union, right? So they're not happy about the Appalachian. The Republican Party, by reducing the antislavery issue to its lowest common denominator in the territory's is telling the public, you can have a antislavery in union. Alright, well, once the unions threatened, the Republican Party is going to have to suppress succession or face political oblivion. And in fact, even if Stephen Douglas had been elected president, he's an old hard line Jacksonian if he had been elected president and the south had still succeeded. Now that's not very likely, but if he had been elected president and the staff, it's succeeded, he probably would have moved a military force against the south even faster than Lincoln

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       [inaudible]. It's, it's so interesting because I think one of the themes as we do this whole week is looking at these people through 2018 lens and when you hear that somebody didn't want full rights for people but wanted to free them or they couldn't vote or some of the other issues you're talking about. And yet at the same time you're saying, but the abolition is actually weren't that popular, right? It's like to give, to view these people through our lens today is, is really, it's a very slippery slope because Lincoln had to do some things that perhaps, uh, in our lens now would have been viewed as very unfair to the African American. And there he was. So. Okay. So the, the war begins and he said he's a new president at war. A, who is he getting advice from? Were like, did he really understand how to.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       Okay. Well, the other part of the answer to your question is that I'm a Lincoln and many of the Republicans in many northerners in general underestimated, um, the enthusiasm for succession on the part of southerners. They believed, initially believed that it was a southern elite of slaveholders, almost a conspiracy that had brought about succession and that, um, and that's why they weren't prepared for the extent of the resistance of a southerners. Uh, once Lincoln, uh, calls out troops. And so once he calls out troops, then, then you have the problem of managing the war.

Speaker 1:          00:41:32       So there was really, he could have done at

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       that point, even if even if there were voices, even if he internally felt, well, maybe we could just let them go, or if he had voices around him that were saying, Oh, you know, seed, it was too late, really, right. Yep. Politically, politically. I mean, by that time I'm in the north, at least not in the deep south, but in the North Liberty in union had become mystically identify as inseparable. Uh, and uh, and so that's, um, and, and in fact, right, this leads to the question of, uh, the, a more basic question of what caused the civil war. Right? And there's now a current trend to argue that slavery caused the civil war and not only that caused the civil war, but it was all about slavery. Uh, and that in fact, slavery, um, the entire history of the union up until that point is all about slavery.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       You disagree with it? I just get away. I think that asking what caused the civil war is the wrong question. And even some of your new abolitionists, historians like Ken Stamp and Eric Foner have pointed out that they're really two separate questions. Why does the sow seed and why does the North refused to let the south go? And the answer to the first question is definitely slavery. I mean, the evidence is overwhelming for that. There's probably hardly any historical causal explanation at that level of abstraction for which the evidence is more overwhelming. So the south secedes in order to protect slavery. Okay, so that's easy, but I'm ending. Slavery is not what motivates the north, what motivates the north is preserving the union. And in fact, Lincoln, I'm, uh, in the Er before the firing on Fort sumpter endorses a original 13th amendment which has not passed in which he's still holding to the position of opposing the extension of slavery in the territories.

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       But this new amendment would protect slavery in the existing slave states and be unamendable in the early days of the war. Uh, some of your union commanders were returning runaway slaves. So, um, so the, so, so the war from the union perspective, the suppression of succession is designed to preserve the union. And Lincoln even later says, if he could preserve the union by freeing all the slaves, he'll do that. If he could preserve the union by framing some none of the slaves, he'll do that. If he can preserve the union by freeing some and leaving others enslaved, he would do that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       What was his real belief in the union based in did he, did he just truly believed that we had to remain one country otherwise would be perpetual

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       war? Is that. Yeah. Yeah. He thought that the disillusion of the union would lead to anarchy. Yeah. It's interesting because now one of the things that's one of the things that's interesting about historians is the, the, even historians who don't seem to be explicitly nationalist than nationalist bias with which they, um, approach that issue. Uh, so, uh, for instance, the US, I had made several attempts to an ex Canada, um, in the early history, uh, first during the American revolution, then during the war of 18, 12, and then, uh, between and after those events, uh, by sponsoring the kinds of a revolutionary movements that, uh, brought Texas into the union. All right. If any of those had succeeded historians, would it be writing great historians would be writing the history of North America as if this was an inevitable in any other result would have been catastrophic. Um, my view is that the north, uh, that the North American continent has gotten along fine with, to Anglo American republics.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       If it had been three or more history would have been different, but would have been, it wouldn't have been catastrophic, different. And, and speaking of the example of Canada, you know, when Canada was looking at the, at this session of the peaceful succession of Quebec, its population was about the same size as the union at the time and the population of Quebec was greater than the Gulf coast confederacy that initially succeeded and slightly less than the confederacy once a Lincoln had called out troops. Did Lincoln have any advisors or anyone close to him at the time that was just saying, forget this, you know, just let them go. No, we're going to do, we live by our laws here. So he really, well, there were some, um, there were some newspaper editors prior to Fort Sumpter who were in favor of a peaceful succession and letting us out south, at least temporarily go in peace.

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       Uh, there was even a secessionist movement, uh, in New York City, but I'm meaning they wanted New York City to see. See? Yeah. Yeah. Even though geographically you've got really make any sense. And uh, um, and uh, uh, Lincoln's, um, I'm a secretary of state, um, toyed with the idea provoking a war with Great Britain in order to bring everybody a steward. I'm back together, but, um, but nobody really, at least within Republican Council's excepted, um, uh, once, especially after Fort Sumpter, uh, the preservation of the union a becomes upper most God, so most of his presidency, which obviously was cut short and we'll get to that shortly. Um, was, uh, it was about the civil war is there. What else do we have to know? How sort of towards the end of the war, what other decisions did he make that were sort of pivotal? Um, well, he starts a reconstruction program, uh, which, um, is relatively lenient, um, compared to the congressional reconstruction, uh, that is eventually implemented after a whole Lincoln's assassination.

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       Limited in what regard? I'm lenient in terms of allowing white southerners a free hand in terms of, of, uh, as long as they allow, had abolished slavery of reentering a, the union. And how is that different than what happened? Well, basically, um, uh, well, this is a complicated story. I'm going to try and make it really simple. Okay. You have this first phase presidential reconstruction which Lincoln initiates and then becomes really lenient under his, um, uh, uh, a successor, Andrew Johnson who was from Tennessee. I'm a very racist, um, but antislavery southerner. Um, and what happens is that the southern states essentially set up, I'm under a, um, uh, a lot of the former confederate leadership, an apartheid regime with black codes that are very restrictive, uh, on the, on the activities of the freed African Americans and this outrageous, um, northern republicans. And so you have a period of congressional reconstruction where none of these governments are there.

Speaker 2:          00:49:49       They're all disbanded. You have military occupation, and then you have the creation of new Republican governments in which a lot of southerners are disenfranchised and African Americans are given voting rights. And so you have a period of Republican regimes, I'm in the south, and then that creates the resistance of organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and other violent organizations. And uh, by 18, 76 northerners have gotten tired of trying to maintain these regimes with military occupation. And so you have what's euphemistically referred to as redemption where you have the restoration of a, of white rule, um, throughout the, uh, former slave states.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       Yeah. So I, it's just hard to imagine what a messy time it would've been. Yeah. During those years, just healing all those wounds, literally family members having killed each other, especially in your border states like Kentucky and Missouri. Yeah, I mean, it's really just hard to imagine what it was like. So the north obviously wins does not succeed. The union is maintained, uh, what was happening just in the weeks leading up to his assassination?

Speaker 2:          00:51:06       Well, Lisa rendered, um, a same month, I believe. And so it was clear that, um, it, it's, it's, it's clear that the, that the confederacy has lost the war. Um, uh, and, uh, you have the passage of the 13th amendment, uh, by Congress. It still has to be ratified by the states, um, a abolishing slavery, uh, and, uh, those are the, most, the two most important, uh, events leading up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       Yeah, through the end of the war. So to talk about the assassination for a little bit, I mean obviously just from everything we're talking about it and it was wartime and everything else. Obviously, you know, tensions were high and all that. Was there any reason to believe that anything like this was gonna Happen? I know that may sound like a very open question, but you know, like we're, we're there as attempt attack assassination attempts. Before that, anything,

Speaker 2:          00:52:10       I was always concerned about Lincoln being assassinated, particularly at the outset of the war. Uh, I mean, pardon me at the outset of his administration. So when he initially comes into Washington, um, he comes in disguised because of concern about, uh, an assassination of rumored assassination attempts. And then during the inauguration, um, uh, you have, uh, a sharp shooters. I'm stationed at the tops of buildings and, um, uh, and other provisions made by General Winfield Scott to make sure that there is no assassination attempt because remember, Washington DC is south of Maryland. Maryland is a slave state. Um, it's a slave state that doesn't succeed only partially because of union military force interfering with elections and throwing secessionists I'm in jail and Baltimore, uh, is at least at the outset of the war is a pro southern, um, hotbed. Uh, so there were concerns. Yeah. Uh, but we don't have the secret service. In fact, the secret service has created during the civil war, mainly to track down counterfeiters. It's one of the many government agencies that we've come to.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       All love emerges during the civil war. That's why I started to track down counterfeiters. Now it's clearly gone beyond that scope these days, but that's a whole other topic. So I assume that the day, I mean, if we had to look at Lincoln the morning he woke up before he went to the theater, he had to have been feeling pretty good about things. I mean, he had to be accomplished. The thing that was most important to him, and he certainly was feeling relieved. Yeah. What should we talk about related to the assassination? Um, well, give me the basics for people.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       Well, I, I don't. I mean there's now evidence that there was more involvement of a confederate, um, counter intelligence, whatever you wanna call it. Then we previously. In other words, it wasn't entirely. I'm John Wilkes booth and, and his confederates.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       Is there hard evidence on that? Yeah, they, I've heard little things. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:43       Um, and, um, uh, but I don't really have a lot to say about, about the assassination of Lincoln. I'm in so far as. Okay, here. One of the big debates is if Lincoln hadn't been assassinated, would he have continued, um, his lenient policy towards, uh, the southern states and um, and I go along with the historians who say no, that he was trying. I'm leniency in order to try to reestablish the whig party. I'm in the south, but it wasn't turning out that way. And a congressional reconstruction may not have been quite as harsh under Lincoln, um, as it turned out to be without Lincoln. Uh, but, um, but Lincoln's views have evolved to the extent that he would not have been, uh, would have been willing to tolerate the black codes that, um, uh, that the states were setting up,

Speaker 1:          00:56:01       do you think, certainly by his second term where he would've had a freer hand, he would have done a lot of the things that would, that happen during congressional reconstruction? Yeah, that's my speculation. Yeah. What was it like after the assassination?

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       Well, it's like any assassination, you know, they're, um, there, there is a man hunt. Um, there is an attempt to track down the conspiracy, uh, and uh, you have several conspirators hung including Mary Serat who, and there's a lot of controversy about whether she was actually involved or not involved and uh, uh, so it certainly hardens northern attitudes. Uh, but remember,

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       was there really a feeling that he was the one keeping it all together at that point? Still are, or what was the feeling that the war had been won? It was, it was going to be okay either way, you know, he was such a symbol of what had happened.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       Um, I mean, he, he had already, uh, that's an interesting question. Um, in some circles, um, he had already become deified but not to the extent that the assassination dfi. Um, so, uh, he remember he'd already been elected for a second term, so, so he did not face a significant political opposition there. Was there before the fall of Atlanta, there were, there, there because the war dragged on so long. Um, it wasn't always clear that Lincoln would be renominated by the Republican Party and there were elements in the Republican Party, um, uh, who wanted to replace him and rivals who wanted to replace him. So, uh, a really, um, uh, you, you have, you have Andrew Johnson being president, you know, for most of Lincoln's second term and uh, he's impeached or almost he's impeached and almost removed, um, uh, from office because of his disagreement with, uh, the Republicans who are in tight control of Congress because, uh, the southern states have been kept out, are still not in, um, except for Tennessee. Um, and the slave states that didn't succeed there. They're still not, um, uh, in the union or are permitted to have representatives in Congress so the Republicans have a free hand irrespective of whether Lincolns in office or Andrew Johnson's and office or grant is an office.

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       Interesting. So one of the reasons that I wanted to do this youtube week was to help frame things around how politics are right now. So to sort of wrap all this up first, um, what, what do you think Lincoln's politics would be today if you were to try to take the things that you think he believed in the most within the sort of modern context? Is there a that you can make sense of it because I see he gets used by everyone all the time. Lincoln would have been a Republican for this. He would have been a Democrat for this. Is there a way

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       like playing that game? Yeah, I mean, things have changed so much. Um, uh, um, it's really, it is. And the context is so different. Um, it's really hard to say. Uh, one of the, one of the interesting things about Lincoln, and this is one of my, one of my sort of reservations are criticisms of Lincoln, actually criticisms of the people who deify Lincoln as president is the whig party, had this ambivalent attitude in terms of government versus the presidency. Um, they were in favor of a lot of government intervention, um, but at the same time they had emerged in opposition to Andrew Jackson and his very vigorous, often high handed presidency. So they tended to favor the legislature as the dominant. Uh, I'm a mover, a forest in the government rather than the presidency. And I think Lincoln had imbibed this wig attitude, uh, about, uh, administration. And as a result, I think I'm being a wartime president. He had to ignore it to a large extent, but I think that it created some of the administrative problems that emerged during Lincoln's presidency. So I think Lincoln would be, we'd have very ambivalent feelings about how powerful the president has become a within government, irrespective of what policies are being implemented.

Speaker 1:          01:01:27       I will accept. I will accept that as an answer that that really was what I was trying to get to, not that he would have endorsed this policy or that policy, but just his general take on what power was the opposite of the presidency and, and things of that nature. Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you. I think. Are we done? We're done. We did the whole hour. That was a pretty quick. Our. Do we miss anything made doing this? A lot of major things. Alright. Give me something major that we missed.

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       Um, well I, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll give you a couple of things. One is, I mean my book, you didn't mention my book.

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       Let's talk about your book. Well I think you've sort of hit on it there. Your more critical, more critical altman in the war then some of the people who.

Speaker 2:          01:02:05       Yeah, the book is a narrative history of the civil war, but I have about half a dozen provocative thesis where I disagree with trailing views and one of them is that I argue that if I'm northerners had been interested in ending slavery rather than preserving the union, there is a set of policies they could have adopted. I'm allowing, uh, the lower south to go in peace, uh, which would have brought down slavery, um, within, um, an independent confederacy, certainly by the turn of the century and possibly within four years. Why letting them go would do that. Um, well letting them go didn't necessarily do it. It just means that you didn't have to kill 750,000 people in order to bring about the end of slavery. In other words, I think there were, there is there a set of policies that could achieve the same goal at less cost.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       Um, and, um, and in other words, I think you can, like the, I was actually t I'm tuned, don turned onto this alternative by garrison and the other radical abolitionist. In other words, you can be a rabidly antislavery instill procession. Um, the second, uh, important argument I make is, has to do with, uh, the growth of government. Um, um, uh, I think it's a commonplace observation that government today is a lot more powerful and a lot more intrusive than it was earlier in our history. And whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing, uh, there's the question of what changed and what brought about the change. So I'm the popular story is that it's the new deal, right? That made the big change and I'm in the growth of government and I think that's mistaken, it's mistaken, uh, in part because of the new deal was essentially a recreation of Woodrow Wilson's war collectivism.

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       And the impact of the new deal on government was dwarfed by the impact of World War II. Um, now there's some elements of truth. The new deal gives you social security, um, and along with Medicare that's become government's biggest expenditures. More sophisticated, um, commentators would push the change back to the progressive era in the early 20th century. But I'm arguing that the civil war is the crucial watershed in American history that prior to that, prior to the civil war, the longterm secular trend had at all levels of government for government to become smaller, less intrusive, less involved in people's lives. And that the turning point is the civil war that leaves him with a complex legacy from the government. Yes, yes. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Because during the civil war, I mean, national conscription, I'm a US moves from free to high protective tariffs, uh, the first Western country to do. So I'm a massive subsidies to railroads, uh, for subsidies to higher education through the land grants. Um, and I've already gone over my time. I could go on.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       You got one more, one more big, big point that's in the book related.

Speaker 2:          01:05:41       Yeah. One more point that's related to Lincoln. Um, uh, I think that one of the reasons it takes the union so long to defeat the confederacy is because of Lincoln's bad administration of the military. Uh, there, he tended to micromanage. I'm the war. Uh, uh, like Lyndon Johnson tried to micromanage the Vietnam war and historians want to place all of the blame on Lincoln's generals. Uh, whereas I think that really the source of the problem is Lincoln. Um, consider the eastern theater. All right, so, um, you have a succession of commanders. Irvin Mcdowell defeated the first bull run, replaced my Mcclellan Mcclellan is almost supplanted by John Pope, who's defeated the second bull run only to bring back McClellan then to replace him with burnside who admitted to him emitted that he wasn't ready to command the army and then hooker and then meet right now normally. Right? And this is within a period of two years, two, two and a half years. Normally this doesn't work. Earn administrators high marks in terms of how they're managing things. Right? And, uh, I think that, um, I mean there were problems with all the generals. Uh, the advantage that the generals in the West had Sherman and grant is they weren't micromanaged by Lincoln and therefore they could make their mistakes early in the war and learn from them.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       Yeah. Well, I liked that you gave us a complex view. I mean, that's really why I wanted to do this, that, you know, we picked certain ones. Lincoln is one that we all sort of view in this lens of the perfect being Lincoln of course. And of course he did a tremendous amount of good. Uh, but it's interesting hearing what the little imperfections are a and all sorts of things. So on that note, it has been a pleasure talking to you and for more, uh, Jeffrey Rogers, I'm all check out his book, which we're going to link to write down below.
