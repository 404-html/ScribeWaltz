Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey guys, Dave Rubin here. That's right. I'm still a Dave Rubin. This is Rubin report. As you guys know, we are making the move to Aura TV. They are building meet an. An unbelievable set right now, so Larry King was nice enough to let me use his studio today and the reason we wanted to do some stuff with you guys today is because I have Dr. Gad Saad here. He is, professor of marketing at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada and he's the research chair in evolutionary behavioral sciences and Darwinian consumption. I normally don't use a teleprompter, but I needed it for that get. How are you? Very good. Yourself? Good. Good. How? First off Gad said, how is my pronunciation of your last name is Arabic and Arabic as well? God is a Hebrew name and sad as an Arabic name, but most people can't say the guttural sounds and so it just gets an extended ace.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I'm sad. Well, I've heard you do it on your own videos on youtube and you don't even do it with the guttural sound because I don't want to intimidate the viewers. That sound so a Hebrew first name Arabic last night. That's right. So you must be very conflicted. I'm not, I'm not. I'm from Lebanon, but of the Jewish faith. Okay. So the reason that I wanted to bring you in and the timing of this really is just perfect, uh, is because we connected sort of in the last year and a half or so on twitter. We find ourselves often in the same twitter wars with people, uh, the atheists and the new atheists and the far left and the people on the right. And everyone that's always battling on twitter and we're usually on the same side. Right? And really what started this whole thing was when Sam Harris was on real time with Bill Maher and he and Ben Affleck and bill got into a big frack is a. So let's take a look at the clip and then we'll go from there. Sure.

Speaker 2:          01:45          So the other thing, we want to talk about the courses that you and I have been trying to make the case. I think I have any way that liberals need to stand up for liberal principles. This is what I stood on last week's show. Obviously I got a lot of hate for it, but all I'm saying is that liberal principles like freedom of speech, freedom to practice any religion you want without fear of violence, freedom to leave a religion, equality for women, a quality for minorities, including homosexuals. These are bit

Speaker 3:          02:12          principles, applaud for, but then when you done

Speaker 2:          02:19          say in the Muslim world, this is what's lacking, then they get upset.

Speaker 4:          02:23          Yeah, yeah. Well, liberals have really failed on the topic of theocracy that they'll criticize white theocracy. They'll criticize Christians, they'll still get agitated over the abortion clinic bombing that happened in 1984, but when, when you want to talk about the treatment of women and homosexuals and free thinkers and public intellectuals in the Muslim world, I would argue that the liberals have failed us and the crucial point

Speaker 3:          02:51          confusion. Yeah. Thank God you're here. I mean, the crucial point of confusion is is

Speaker 4:          02:57          that that we have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry toward Muslims as people. That is intellectually ridiculous. Even. It gets so hold on who that person who understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam. You say, well, this is actually well educated on this topic. I'm asking you. You're saying if I criticize the. You're saying that Islamophobia is not a real thing, that if you're critical of something, it's not a real thing when we do it. Right. It's really is. I'm not denying that that certain people are bigoted against Muslims as people and that's a problem big have you. But the gross, it's racist and it's not. It's but it's so. It's. So. It's like saying those years shifty. You're absolutely not. We are saying you guys are saying if you want to be liberals believe in liberal principles, rights, freedom of speech, like you know, we are endowed by our forefathers of the low trek. All men are created new fan. We have to be able to criticize bad ideas.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Okay, so that clip goes on for about 10 minutes and I showed you about two minutes right there and I think Sam hit the point right at the end that we have to be able to criticize bad ideas. And to me this, I've seen a real schism and people on the left, now I'm obviously on the left, I stand for liberal principles, um, but this schism and this idea that you can't criticize ideas without somehow condemning a whole group of people. I know this is a big point of contention for you. So can you walk us through that? But I don't, I don't think that people have difficulty criticizing ideas. I think it's a specific idea, right? So I see it everyday in my exchanges on facebook. If I criticize some Jewish practice, I get many, many likes on facebook. If I criticize some Hick, a Republican senator about his, his position on evolution, I get tons of likes.

Speaker 1:          04:46          But if I dare criticize something about Islam, I'll give you a very quick example. I put up a clip of a Iraqi scientist, an astronomer who was arguing that the earth is flat because it says so in the Koran. So I received, of course, one of my facebook friends are academics I received from a white sort of guilt within academic from, from California. And a note saying, well, how, what, why are you ganging up on these folks? So she wasn't offended by the fact that this Iraqi scientists was holding an astonishingly outrageous view. She was annoyed that I would actually point to that. So why do you think people have trouble making this distinction? It's very obvious to me as as an outsider of this. I look at, I'm Jewish, but I look at the book, you can say whatever you want about the book and all the awful things that are in the Old Testament and the new testament or the Koran.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Frankly, I haven't really read any of them. I don't know their, their books, their ideas. Why? Why do people seem unable to detach those two things because I think they're. I think the, the misinformation associated with the idea that if you criticize Islam in particular, you're bigoted because Islam is a religion of Brown people and so therefore there are simply unable to decouple the criticism of a set of tenets from the people who may practice those tenets. So to me, Bill Maher sorta hit the maybe the bigger point here, which is that for people on the left, for liberals, we have to stand up consistently for liberal principles, which is certainly what I try to do. I stand up for women's rights and gay rights and freedom of religion and economic equality and all of those things. So it was this weird, liberals have really failed and the way they fail is by invoking cultural and moral relativism, right?

Speaker 1:          06:31          So who are we to judge that? Women in some far away land there Clarissa's are being cut, right? Who are we to impose our cultural hegemony on other folks? And so that's how they're able to still be liberal and yet not criticize these one particular sets of beliefs by invoking cultural relativism. Right? So there's a real disconnect in reality there because in a, in a weird way, liberals should be the most for helping these pieces on, right? Because these are the principles they believe in. So how much of this actually I really hadn't thought until just now, but I guess a lot of this we could sort of blame the footsteps of George W Bush for going into the wrong war. We're now, there's this feeling in America like we shouldn't do anything ever because we did the wrong thing. Clearly interacting now it's a, it's a far worse mess than even before.

Speaker 1:          07:17          Uh, so some of the blame is on us, right? But I mean, how far do you go back unfolding history until you find the villain of your choice? Right? So for example, when you talk about the Israel Palestine issue, people are always able to unfold history until the starting point that they feel happy about. And then that's the point where we start the clock, right? So where should we start the clock on that one? On the Islam issue in Israel. Palestine. Yeah. Well that's, that's a whole other thing. It's a whole lot of effect if we could get into it if you want. Uh, uh, I think the problem there is that you've got to abrahamic religions that hold very, very rigid positions. And as long as it's going to be les than would religion, it's never going to be resolved. So in a weird way.

Speaker 1:          08:02          So what you're saying is that, uh, that liberals don't want to criticize Islam because there's this idea that a lot of Islamic people have brown skin, but there are plenty of Moroccan Jews. You're, you're Lebanese Jew, right? Uh, there are plenty of Christians that are Iraqi. There's not that many anymore. But. So even that, in a weird way you could say that that's actually bigoted, that, that, that concept is big. And how do you, as, as a dark skinned a Jew you feel about that? Well, I usually am able to get away with more stuff precisely because I invoke the fact that I have dark skin. The fact that I'm from the Middle East and I, I use this victimology game against the social justice warriors basically saying, Hey, be careful, don't you criticize me? Because then you'd be engaging our football, our phobia, fattism. I actually did the privilege score and I scored off the chart and my non privilege.

Speaker 1:          08:56          So I'm untouchable. You were completely unimaginable. So the next part of this that I think is particularly interesting, and this is really where we met because of the twitter thing that I referenced earlier, is there has been sort of an endless onslaught on Sam Harris since this. Now. Sam is a philosopher. I think he's a neuroscientist. I've read this. I've read some books. He's not a political person per se. He writes a little bit about politics, but not really, but there has been this endless onslaught and I think slandering and smearing him, coming from the left from people that in some cases I admire partly some people that I've worked with, I'm talking about from, from Glenn Greenwald, who obviously has done great stuff with the NSA and Reza Aslan, my former boss, Janky younger people that are really distorting his views. And I wanted to show a tweet that I got last night that I think kind of sums up the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          09:41          So let's, let's take a look at the tweet. Okay. So this had nothing. I wasn't tweeting about this. This has nothing to do with anything. And someone tweeted, Zap me questioning for Ruben report, how exactly are we better than Isis? If we knew the Middle East killing millions of civilians like Sam Harris suggest. And then Sam Harris later wrote back and said, you really believe that? I've actually suggested that. Okay, so that tweet right there. The reason I wanted to use it is because I feel like it's a perfect example of how this discussion that we're talking about has been so far derail. Now of course Sam Harris doesn't want to nuke them in the Middle East. He had one page in his book that's mostly about philosophy and religion where he's talking about how in the Cold War we had a mutual assurance is basically with Russia because you had rational actors basically that wouldn't nuke each other because then they were afraid they were going to get new.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Now this has nothing to keep. Never said nuke the Middle East or any of this stuff, but these people keep implying it. They keep retweeting memes of selective quotes. What do you make of that? I mean these. These are pretty respected people. Some that I know personally, which is why I struggle with this so much, you know, in the battle of ideologies that people that you want to go after are not the people who've got big muscles, but the people who have big brains, those are sort of totalitarian ideology. Ideology is always go after the intellectuals first. They want to purge them because they don't want anybody to counter their narrative and so this is exactly what happens to guys like Sam Harris. He has a huge following that he can't be literally beheaded because we don't live in the Middle East, but I could certainly try my darnedest to be head his reputation and I'm going to do that by engaging in endless miss information so that people can distance themselves from him and he's just a crack.

Speaker 1:          11:15          He's a, he's a warmonger, he's a Nazi. He's part of a Zionist conspiracy and hopefully you'll kind. Don't forget Neocon, right? That's new economy part of Halliburton and so on and, and, and the way I behead him, the way I silence him as by smearing come. Right? So isn't that really the crazy part of this? When, when they're saying, well, you know, Sam Harris is in the same neo-con group, or Bill Maher's and the same neo-con group as Dick Cheney. Bill Maher has never talked about all the time he wants our, we have 30,000 trench or something in Germany. What are they doing there? But this is literally the reverse of a neo con. Um, but these, these slurs, these are slanders, right? Really, I mean is that while these, these false equivalences are everywhere within this discourse. So for example, if you take some feminists, they'll argue that, uh, the bikini is a patriarchal tool of oppression.

Speaker 1:          12:08          Whereas the Burka is a liberating thing because it removes the male gaze from the picture, right? So while the Bikini clad women is being visually raped by men, uh, once you, once you don the burka, she is liberated. So these types of equivalencies are astonishing, but they're everywhere right now. As backwards as I may think that is, I would say, you know what? You can believe that if you want, but it should be up to the woman to decide where in most of those countries where women are wearing burgers, they don't really have the choice not to wear. Of course now I'm more critical at this point and where I'm at of the left because I'm part of the left and I want the left to be better. I've long given up on trying to fix the right right here. That's that know I'm not going to fix the tea party, but I can at least I think try to change for the better.

Speaker 1:          12:51          The part that I'm with. So that's why this is so disappointing. What do you make of this idea that the, that the far left is attacking atheists have of all groups of people? It's astonishing. I mean what? I guess one of the reasons why they attacked the atheist is because they might be some of the most philosophers, a group of of people that are critical of religion in general, but Islam in particular, and so to the extent that the progressives don't like criticism of Islam and to the extent that many of the most famous atheists are quite vociferous in their criticism of Islam, then we have to go after them and I guess this goes back to what you were saying earlier, but they don't seem to be able to make the distinction. When Bill Maher relentlessly attacked Christianity, nobody calls him a Christian of. Right, right.

Speaker 1:          13:32          I mean he, I, he made a documentary where he attacked the big three religions relentlessly. Nobody had prompts. So like the processing of information is a big cognitive bias, right? So I will only pay attention to information that supports my position and that's exactly what the progressives are doing. They're ignoring the endless times that bill Maher attacks other religions, but they only tune in when he criticizes Islam. I would bet, and someone can check this for us, but I would bet that Bill Maher has spent far more time attacking Christianity because he attacks things in this country far more than than attacking Islam or Judaism or whatever. What do you make of how much hatred there seems to be towards atheists at the moment because I see all these poles and on the show, many times we've done how atheists are the most underrepresented group in everything.

Speaker 1:          14:16          Barney frank, who was in Congress for 30 something years, was able to come out as gay in the eighties, but not as an atheist until he retired from Congress. Right? What do you make of this? Because atheist hold no power. Have not. Our people are atheist, killing people that I don't know about my. My feeling is that there is a coupling of atheism and immorality in the minds of most people, so most people believe that. It doesn't matter which religion you follow, as long as you are religious, then you somehow have a moral compass by which you live your life. By however atheists go around beheading and then raping them for in the minds of those folks. And so an atheist is not to be trusted because how else working he get his morality if it's not from some Bronze Age book. So I think what you just told me that it's complete nonsense.

Speaker 1:          15:03          It is complete. Unless I mean it, could it be anything other than that, right? I mean, because atheist simply aren't doing any other things. No, it's good. It's complete lunacy political correctness, which I think is completely running rampant across America right now. I live within it as an academic, as an academic, so we're going to swim in it, so, you know. All right, so let's start there then. So to the college part of this, uh, you know Jerry Seinfeld about a month ago. Jerry Seinfeld, who is the most apolitical comic. Yes. I know everything about Jerry Seinfeld. I don't know any of his political beliefs. I have no idea if he's for abortion, for the death penalty. Nobody has any idea what he thinks he now is saying the college campuses have gone too politically correct. Politically correct. Chris Rock has backed him on this. Um, you know, a whole bunch of comedians have said this, what is going on on college campuses.

Speaker 1:          15:49          I'll give you a powerful personal anecdote. A last year I gave a talk at Wellesley college and all women's college about the thought police and how it regulates the free exchange of ideas. After my lecture, a student came up to me and said, I don't think there's anything wrong with the idea of a professor at the start of class pulling 100 students about how you should address them. So even though, for example, Dave Rubin is my student, I clearly see you as a male at the start of every lecture I should say, do you do gender identify as male or female because that will deter. So I looked at her and in true astonishment I said, do you really see this as a viable way by which society would be organized? Where every single time we interact we should first preempt any, any greeting with what do you self identify as?

Speaker 1:          16:34          And she said, absolutely, because that way you wouldn't be hurting anybody by placing them in the wrong category. That's astonishing. Right. Okay. So what's the most dangerous part of that? Because to me it seems like, let's say you went ahead and did that. You taught this class exactly as sort of the social justice warriors would want you to teach it. Well the world doesn't operate like that. Right? So then are you actually then setting up these kids, these college kids for a huge awakening where the day they graduate college, but they're not well trained to face that real world, right. There are so tentative and the way they express themselves, right? They're so afraid to step outside the herd. I mean if you look at intellectual diversity on campuses, which is very much related to what we're talking about, it's breathtaking. Right? Look, I'm Canadian so I don't care.

Speaker 1:          17:21          Republican or Democrat. I don't have a dog in that fight, but there are. I got to get this straight. Jus Heron, Canadian man, atheists, atheists and brown skin. Oh my gosh. You really do have a lot. All right. Sorry. So, so there, there were studies that were done looking at the political affiliations of professors at Major American universities, whether they're republican or Democrat, and the numbers are just astonishing and they get worse and worse in terms of the ratio as a function of the softness of the field. So in the humanities and sociology and gender studies, it's something like 40 1:44 to one ratio of. Now for some issues, political, a political lens doesn't matter, but for others, uh, as the death penalty appropriate, what should be our fiscal policy? Should we be? Should we be foreign policy interventionists? Well, your political lens effects these discussions and to have all academia being represented by one side of the political spectrum as horrifying.

Speaker 1:          18:22          So what do we do about that? I mean, even though I may in most cases agree with that end of academia, not certainly not the political correct side, but I might agree with him philosophically on a lot of the points. How do you balance that out? So Thomas Solo, who's a very famous conservative economists, a set, and I'm going to botch the exact quote, he said, a intellectual diversity is diversity on campuses as great as long as it's sexual orientation, diversity, ethnic diversity, racial diversity, but the one diversity that should really matter, intellectual diversity, we condemn it. Well, what we need to do is just a thought, which is thought exactly. And what we need to. It was to find ways to create greater diversity on campus is to allow both sides of any position to speak. Do you think a lot of this has to do with the way our culture has changed in the last couple of years?

Speaker 1:          19:12          Like where are you can't bully a kid now. I'm not for bullying of course, but that this concept where we keep making everything that no one can ever be offended by anything else. Uh, you know, they took after the confederate flag, after the shooting in Charleston. Now they took dukes of hazzard off television. Do. Those guys were not, they were not somehow southern white supremacists. You know what I mean? But they, they took that off television. Again, I'm not going to defend cosby who was one of my comedy heroes growing up, but they took the cosby show up. They're like, we're starting to censor ourselves. I think in a way that's going to lead to everything. You know, every time I watched Seinfeld now, every episode, I think in 10 years they're gonna say this was racist and massage every literally every single episode. Salon did a piece a couple of weeks ago about trouble.

Speaker 1:          19:57          Some episodes, episodes of Seinfeld. What? What do we do to combat that? Well, progressive's pray at the altar. They self flagellate at the altar of non offense. I mean that's, that's their, their motto. A, we need to find a way to break through this thought. Police. I'm not. Give you an example. When I used to be a very competitive soccer player, if I were to today, look at the trash talking that went on the soccer fields between players, which is part of the ritual. Then everybody would be arrested today. Everybody would be sent to a hate speech. Try again. Right? Because you mean because of racist stuff and homophobic on everything under the sun. Exactly, guess what I heard camel jockey grow growing up playing soccer and I lived to, to love again, right? I mean it's called life grow a pair. So, so how do we, what do we do about that because that I really like what do we do to grow a pair for the country or for Canada or.

Speaker 1:          20:50          I mean there are many different ways. For example, uh, the culture of narcissism is, it's certainly not helping the kids. The culture of entitlement, right? Everybody should get an a plus. Everybody should get their medal. Everybody should get a trophy. So there, there's several different movements that have, for lack of a better word, pussified the west. You're not going to be happy with you for that if that's okay. Bring. All right, let's talk a little bit about some of the, uh, some of the machinations I suppose, of, of things that are going on on college, trigger warnings and some of these other things. So you were sort of, you sort of talked about this a little bit earlier. Safe spaces, safe spaces, safe spaces is a place where I can go so that I'm protected from things that might make me go into a fetal position and suck my thumb.

Speaker 1:          21:33          So give me one for example. Well, why would you go to a site? Why would someone in college go to it? Maybe there's going to be a speaker who's going to talk something about pro Israel and uh, I might be a student who is very much against Israel. And so that makes me feel very threatened at University of Michigan. They wanted to simply show, was it, was it called sniper? What was it? The movie American sniper. And that made a lot of the students feel very unsafe simply because that movie was going to be shown on campus. It's astonishing. Do you remember when, uh, Bill Maher was being asked to give the commencement speech at Berkeley, Berkeley, which is the bastion, the home of free speech in America. And some of the kids there didn't want him to do it. He ended up doing it, but he had a guest.

Speaker 1:          22:21          I forget her name. I was actually in the audience that episode. He had a guest who said that he shouldn't do it because he's against free speech. Meanwhile, she's on her. She's on his show using her right to free speech. So there's like a a cognitive disconnect. There's absolutely. I wrote an article where I have Huffington post where I talked about trigger warnings and I listed all of the different concepts that necessitate trigger warnings pretty much everything under the sun. I mean, literally life requires a trigger warning. Is this why everyone's medicated? Pretty much, right? I think you're onto something. You know, I do think there is a connection between, you know, if you do all this stuff right and you give every year, everyone is the trigger warnings. You give them safe spaces. You don't let them hear from contrarian views and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          23:07          Then you throw them out in the world where none of this stuff is real because you get out to the world and it's pretty shitty and you're know you're going to have a boss that might be sexist or a neighbor that might be homophobic. That is why then everyone, Medicaid's because then they're not given the tools to deal in reality life. I agree. How's that? Behavioral Sciences. That's rather nice. Pop Psychology. Very nice. I thought that was pretty good. Do you think the Internet is helping or hurting? A bit of both. I mean, I think to the extent that the Internet serves as a vehicle for meme propagation, people can get their message out, otherwise they might have difficulty doing so. So in that sense it's great. The problem is that some of the ones who hurled the greatest amount of venom are the people who really are against the free exchange of ideas.

Speaker 1:          23:50          So the social justice warriors that come after guys. Luckily I've actually been free of most of these guys maybe because I'm quite reserved than my positions. Maybe. Hopefully, uh, but, but make sure they come after yesterday. I'll send some of my people. So I think that on average a bit of both good in that you allow people to express themselves bad and that there's one camp of folks that is a lot more vested in shutting down free exchange. So is that the challenge then of the atheist community or the secular community or the rational community is that we don't yell as loud, right? So how do we then line up in a way versus versus the trolls versus the angry mob? How do you get sane people to band together? Well, at the very least, and I often a admonish my academic colleagues for this who don't participate in this and this great public discourse, right?

Speaker 1:          24:41          They're very interested in doing. They're very narrow research, but yet they are shy away from talking about these bigger issues. Even though their professors. I mean you're, you're all about meme propagation if you're a professor. And so what I would do, at least what I do at my limited sphere of influence, is to try to get my colleagues to weigh in on these issues so that we could have academics weighing in and not just the trolls. Does that work very well? I haven't been very successful because most are terrified of their shadows. Yeah. So what does that say then? That it's not just. I guess it's coming from every angle, right? It's coming from politicians and it's coming from the media people and it's coming from the professors, not just what I would add. I would add cowardice as part of the seven deadly sins.

Speaker 1:          25:23          I would make it a deadly sins and cowardice. It's, I'm astonished at how cowardly, uh, most people are there and I even get people who come to me and say, you know, I mean, you, you do great science. You're, you're, you're a non scientist. Why do you weigh in on these issues? Because I can't help it because it's, I feel that it's my job to weigh in on issues that are nonsensical. Like the ones we discussed earlier. That's part of my job description. Yeah. You know, I feel the same way actually. Sometimes I think when I'm, when I'm tweeting about this stuff or when I'm writing about or whatever it is, I think I wish I didn't have the right to talk about this stuff. You know, in a weird way because it's so obvious to me. Uh, you know, that the atheist and the seculars that we're, we're on the right side of letting everyone.

Speaker 1:          26:04          I want to treat everyone as Shitty as everyone else. They don't even have to be treated as well as everyone else. You know what I mean? I don't want to be treated better than anyone or worse. Just treat me the same shitty way you treat everybody. A lot of times when I'm in New York City, that's what I think. Like everyone, there's every race there, there's every color, every ethnicity, everything, and it's like everyone hates each other, but no one's killing anybody pretty much. Exactly. Any, any final thoughts? I mean, I could talk to you all day. Uh, well hopefully I'll be back again soon. I wanted to congratulate you on your move to this network. Oh, thanks. Great to meet you in person. And it's weird how twitter works, right? We've done this. We've never spoken more than a hundred 40 characters and yet I feel like. I know you're very well. Yeah, there you go. All right, well you guys can check out gads youtube page. We'll annotate to it. So there should be something if you're watching on youtube right over here. And I thank you very much. And uh, yeah, this is just the beginning of the types of stuff we're going to be doing. Now that we're on TV, uh, the new set is coming and the show will officially launched. I think it's the second week in September, but I'll have to check with my lawyers. Thanks for watching everybody.
