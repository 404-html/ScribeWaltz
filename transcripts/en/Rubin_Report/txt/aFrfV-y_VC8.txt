Speaker 1:          00:00:05       You're not going to believe this, but we have to talk about the regressive left today. I've actually been trying to get away from discussing the regressive left lately and instead talk about the ideas of classical liberalism, which I believe in, but current events keep dragging me back. I see on social media that people are using the phrase regressive left a bit less lately and replacing it with terms like big tier. The control left or the illiberal left, whatever name you use for this well meaning yet painfully misguided set of ideas is largely irrelevant. We needed this phrase to identify this backwards ideology which puts groups before people and sometimes you need a label to get people to understand that an idea, the portion of the left, which is no longer progressive meaning for progress but regressive meaning going backwards has been identified and now we're clearly bringing people to the side of reason.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       All of you who talk about this with friends and family who used the regressive left Hashtag on twitter and share these videos are part of this political awakening. Yes. It seems like these backwards ideas are getting stronger in some circles, but at the same time, finally, for the first time in a long time, those of us who are liberal and open to new ideas are coming together and being heard. Whether or not you like trump, his wind was a huge rejection of the identity politics of the left. But don't take my word for that. Bernie Sanders said it himself. The only thing which can replace the regressive descent of the left is a return to true liberalism or liberalism, which defends free speech and expression, uh, liberalism. That is for liberty and rights of the individual and most importantly, a liberalism that is one for human liberty.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       I now believe that this regressive ideology is the biggest threat to freedom in western civilization that exists today with the rise of trump and the constant comparisons they make of him to Hitler. The left now has the perfect boogeyman to use to excuse anything. If your opponent is a vile racist, then you can use violence in any means necessary to stop him. The regressive left has already begun. Using violence is a tactic and I fear that that's just getting started. If you're only now getting up to speed on what the regressive left is, allow me to recap quickly the regressive control, the liberal left, whatever you want to call it, is a group of people who place identity usually based on immutable characteristics in a pecking order of social importance such as race, gender, and religion were victim. Hood is the highest virtue to be had.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       This oppression. Olympics allows groups to compete for who is the most oppressed, thus the most virtuous. And if someone isn't as oppressed as you, then you have full authority to oppress them accordingly. So black lives matter can protesting gain rights. March in Toronto, white men can be banned from leading lgbt organizations on college campuses, prolife women that can be kicked out of women's rights marches and so on. This backwards ideology which demands we judge each other, not on the content of our character, but on the color of our skin or some other baked in trait puts the collective ahead of the individual. It loves all of its minority groups to behave as monoliths. So if you're a true individual, meaning you don't subscribe to the ideas that the group think has attributed to you based on those immutable characteristics, you must be cast out. Many of the guests on my show have suffered from this backwards backlash.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       I on Hirsi, Ali [inaudible], Sarah Haider and Ali Rizvi, all the felt abandoned by the left because they speak out about the problems within Islam. They dare to fight for a more tolerant, more truly progressive Islam in tune with the modern society and basic liberal values and for that they're labeled bigots or worse, the southern poverty law center even labeled Majid as an anti Muslim extremists. In reality, madge is a former Islamist who has devoted his life to try to reform Islam from the inside to try to reconcile his faith with the modern world fighting for gays and atheists and women and any other free thinkers living under theocratic rule. For this, he is called a porch monkey and other vile names by supposed progressive's while at the same time he's admired by many on the right for being outspoken. This is the absolute height of absurdity, but it all makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       When you value groups over individuals, the individual must be sacrificed at the altar of the collective, so when any of these people dare speak out and call for true tolerance, they find their tolerance met with intolerance, the left gloves, diversity and skin color. Just not diversity in thought. Of course, this regressive ideology isn't just tied to Islam at all. My guest this week is Larry Elder, a black conservative who has had every label and smear thrown at him. Again, like with the previous guests I just mentioned, these slurs come from people on the left who would rather silence and dismiss their opponents then actually engage them in an honest way. People often ask me which interview I've done. That's changed my views the most and I almost always say that it was the first time I sat down with Larry Elder. He challenged my views on systemic racism as well as the need for a strong family and was one of the people that helped sell me on why small government is important.

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       If you haven't seen the video, we'll post the link right down below. Larry challenged me and I wasn't ready so I can't say that it was my best moment on camera, but I listened and learned and just as importantly we didn't edit any of it out so I'm looking forward to picking up where Larry and I left off and as for where we left off, this is where I feel there might be nothing left for me on the modern American left. You all know most of my positions on important issues. I'm for free speech, even for White Supremacist, Richard Spencer to speak and not get punched in the face has happened just a couple of days ago and I'm still a card carrying liberal. By the way, I'm for gay marriage. I'm pro choice, I'm pro legalization of marijuana. I'm against the death penalty and the list goes on. At the same time though, I'm against this oppression Olympics.

Speaker 1:          00:06:23       I'm against safe spaces and trigger warnings. I'm against labeling all my opponents, bigots and racists and I'm against d platforming speakers, especially at colleges where ideas are meant to be challenged and debated. I'm also for states' rights for following the constitution and most importantly for having a limited government that gets out of the way so that you can live your life to the fullest. I've said a few times on the show that defending my liberal principles has become a conservative position. Interestingly, I've also heard conservatives like Andrew Klavan and Dennis prager say that they are conservatives because they really are liberals. This is where we might get lost in the definition of liberal in the modern sense for his classical liberals. So if you're still confused about that, check out a video I did a couple of weeks ago called why I'm a liberal. We'll put a link to it right down below.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       The point is that if the issues I care about most free speech rights of the individual and limited government designed to maximize liberty now have almost nothing to do with the modern left. My position is basically haven't changed, but I've watched as my team has gone off the deep end. The Battle of ideas always gets to a tipping point and I sense that we're closing in on one right now. If we can't reign in this madness on the left than Donald Trump will be all too happy to show them his authoritarian side. Both sides are ramping up for a showdown. That seems incredibly obvious to me. So while I absolutely believe that the new center filled with liberals, conservatives, and Libertarians and others is rapidly growing, maybe I've lost the left and maybe that's okay. But to end this direct message, I now kick this back to you guys. If you're liberal, is there anything left for you on the left or are you left out? Is it now the conservative position to truly be liberal? Let me know in the comments right down below and we'll see if there's anything left to discuss.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       Joining me this week is an author, a television pundit host of a nationally syndicated radio show, and now most importantly a returning guests in that very chair, Larry elder. Welcome back to the Ruben report. Dave, thank you for having me. I appreciate it. Well, I am looking forward to this because I mentioned at the top of the show that I don't know that any guests that I've ever had on challenged me directly as much as you did and actually managed to change some of my feelings. That's gotta feel pretty good for you. Well, I had a lot of good feedback from the interview and people compliment me, but I said the economist would go to you because you were asking questions and unlike a lot of interviewers, you really cared about the answer. Listen, then you responded.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       And so I think if we made the interview so great. So for you to sit down with a liberal, and I think last time we literally didn't know each other. I think maybe we had met for 10 seconds before he sat in the chair. You sit down with the liberal and I think that you were ready to go. So when I said something about systemic reasons, like you were ready to pounce and you did. And I, and my guy said to me after we had only been doing the show for a few months, do you know, do you want to edit that part out? Because there's a part where you really kind of catch me in like a a moment where I don't know and we'll link to it right down below. I want people to see this. I think it's important. Um, how hard is it for you to sit down with liberals generally speaking and, and have an honest conversation?

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       Depends on the liberal. If it's an open minded liberal who really cares about what you have to say it, it's pretty easy. Uh, if it isn't, if it's somebody who, who's already decided what they've decided and believe that liberals, the Conservatives are mean people, rotten people, cold people, anti science people, they were going to be in for a bumpy night. Right. Okay. So let's, uh, I want to just recap a couple of the things we talked about last time for people that haven't seen it and then we'll get to all the new stuff. So real quick, just tell me a little bit about your political evolution. How do you end up here as a conservative? Well, it wasn't so much an evolution as it was kind of like, uh, uh, a series of things that happened to me. People I've met, books that I've read, and that all together you added up.

Speaker 2:          00:10:15       And I ended up being a conservative. My father was always a republican. Uh, my mom, uh, Democrat and so at the kitchen table, uh, they would fight all the time about politics. And when I was younger, I sided with my mom. I think partially because it was just my mom. And when I got older, I began to side with my father much to my mother's a consternation. So going back that, let's say 58 years roughly, uh, what is, what are the types of things that your dad was fighting for as a Republican at that time? I remember vividly during, during a a Watergate, my dad was defending Richard Nixon, which I thought was indefensible. I thought would Richard Nixon was accused of doing with Sabrina suborning perjury and getting other people to lie, uh, was, was deeply wrong. My Dad thought it was trivial. My Dad felt that Richard Nixon had not done anything to enrich himself, that national security was not jeopardize.

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       Nobody died. Why would you impeach a president over the fact that he was trying to cover up a break in to the Watergate? That was my dad's position. My mom physician of course, was that Richard Nixon was a crook and a liar. Fast forward, the polls show that most Americans now believe that Richard Nixon should not have resigned over what he did and feel that what Hillary did was far worse and she did not have to resign. Yeah. What does that say about you? Sorta how, where we've come and where we were, that we're so obsessed with scandal right now and when we know right now trump's been in office for, as we're taping this like five days or something and it's like there is just going to be massive scandal after massive scandal. Obama said just a couple weeks ago that he's very proud that his administration got through without a major scandal.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Now, that depends on where you're definitely, I suspect you disagree with that, but in terms of like a personal scandal or some real feeling of something or that kind of thing, but, but maybe you don't see it that way. I do not see it that way. But your question was, what does it say about us? Where are we gone? Yeah. It says about us is that when it's Republican in office, somebody like Richard Nixon that people did not like, there's one level of scrutiny and one level of judgment. And when it's, when it's, when it's a Democrat, somebody like Clinton or like Obama, there's a whole different thing for Obama to say with a straight face that I've not had a major scandal. Are you kidding me? What was fast and furious? What was Hillary's email server? What was the denying the nonprofit applications of, uh, of conservatives with the, with the irs a what's, you can have your doctor, you can keep your doctor.

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       Um, and Obama reiterated that line after it was obvious from the, from the rigs that you couldn't necessarily keep your doctor or you couldn't necessarily keep your plan. So I buy the line, didn't he basically say that the ends justify the means? That's sort of what he's saying. Like I had to sell it and we kind of knew I'm not defending that that particular leg, but that was sort of his may a cold. I still think as a scandal for you to say that you're going to bend the cost curve down, people are going to be no worse off. They're going to save money and you don't save the money. Uh, when you know for well that you can't keep your doctor if you want to keep your doctor and they say it anyway. That to me as far as I'm concerned, is a scandal pulling out all the troops out of Iraq over the advice of his entire national security team.

Speaker 2:          00:13:14       Hilary wanted him to keep a stay behind force. His Secretary of defense wanted to stay behind forest. The CIA director wanted to stay behind for the joint chiefs, wanted to stay behind, force our, our US ambassador to Iraq advised Obama against pulling all the troops out. He did it anyway and the media gave him a path for that. And uh, Ray Odierno, the um, we tiring army general of the joint chiefs said that had the troops not been pulled out, isis could have been dealt with. That to me is a massive scandal for which Obama got a pass and still gets a pass. So is that one of the situations where we're damned if we do and we're damned if we don't? So that had he stayed at most people, and I'm guessing you included, probably didn't want us to be there forever having left the way he did, they were having democratic elections right before that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       I mean literally in the months before we left, they were having their first free democratic elections and now, now it's an absolute disaster. So is that just one of those situations? There was no win in a way for him at the end. Cause either we're going to occupy them forever or we're going to pull out and then some bad stuff's gonna happen, which is exactly what happened. Okay. Now, now we're talking about kind of the merits of the Iraq war and, and whether or not we should have stayed or not stayed. And, and that's fine. Um, look, I, I believe that as long as the American public does not have the will to stick it through, because what George W. Bush said was, we'll leave when a rack can stand up. As long as the American people did not have the will to do that, we shouldn't have gone. Uh, but I'm surprised, I think, uh, uh, George W. Bush and surprising Dick Cheney is surprised that over the advice of all the people that I just now mentioned, Obama pulled all the troops out anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       He envisioned a stay behind force, uh, to make sure that Iraq would be stable. I mean, we stayed in, um, in, in Germany, we stayed in Japan. We're still in South Korea. Yeah. It takes a while for doing shirts. We have 30,000 troops in Germany now or something like that. Nothing like that. It takes a while for it, for democracy to take route. Uh, and for us to bail out the way we did was, was incredible. You're responsible and I, and I thought jeopardize national security. And again, I am surprised that Obama felt confident enough to walk into the Oval Office, uh, and, and ignore the advice of all these people. So would your argument be basically that these, these scandals, these issues that you brought up, basically he got a pass because the media is sort of in on it with the Democrats? Is that the basic idea?

Speaker 2:          00:15:23       Absolutely. For him to say, as he said many times during press conferences, I most proud of the fact that I rescued the u s economy. Really the major things that were done, tarp and bailing out the auto companies. George W. Bush had set that into motion. Uh, his stimulus program. Most economists don't believe it did anything. Obamacare was a brand new entitlement dropped on the back of the, of job creators. Uh, and, and notice how he no longer bragged about things like a cash for clunkers and cash for clunkers. He doesn't even, uh, cash for clunkers rather, it didn't talk about that anymore because they were boondoggles they did not work. The cost, the American people, American taxpayers money. Okay. So I know that a certain amount of people are gonna hear what you said there and go, that doesn't make any sense. And then the other hand, there's going to be a very 50 50 split on sort of where, where people are at before this.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       So let's move to some of the philosophical stuff, which I think is okay, where are we can get into the real meat of this, right? So racism, this is the issue that more people contacted me about when I was discussing you than anything else. And it's where you challenged me the most on systemic racism. So first off, what does any racism exist in America? Not Systemic racism. We'll get to that in a sec, but what racism is real, right? We live in a country has got 330 million people, roughly eight to 10% of them believe Elvis is still alive. Almost half of them belief. If you've seen elvis a letter, you'll get it. Obviously there's racism. There are individuals who don't like other people because of their race. No question about it. But are there corporations, they have a policy of not hiring anybody? Uh, are there governmental agencies?

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       They have a policy of not hiring anybody? Uh, the answer is no. If you can tell me the company, IBM apple that has a policy of not hiring black people tell me or brown people tell me who that company is and we can deal with it. I don't know what people mean when they talk about institutional racism. If this were the 50s, I would know what you're talking about. Uh, when there was, when there was a segregation that was legal segregation in the south where you couldn't marry somebody, uh, outside your race in certain states, but that is no longer the case right now. The racism that people talk about right now, in my opinion, is individual stuff where some individual doesn't like you or some individuals don't like you. But is it something that is anything akin to what we experienced in the fifties and sixties absolutely not.

Speaker 2:          00:17:36       And I think it's insulting to people who have fought hard and died in the 50s and the 60s to get us to this point to act like things are just the same when you have people like Eric holder's saying as he did when he was age, we now have pernicious racism, which he said was every bit as bad as the old racism. What the hell are you talking about? I mean it's, it's insulting to me. So what do you do to defeat that idea? So again, this is you, you mentioned that in our conversation and it really did, you know, you got me, I said, well, there's systemic racism. And you said, well, what companies can I just, I just asked you for an example. You got me. And so I do agree with you. There are racist people. There are certain amount of people that don't like black people that don't like you cause they don't like gays, etc.

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       We live in a free country. You allowed to not like people, maybe odious and an unpleasant, but you're allowed to. You can't harm them, but correct. But what do you do to stop the idea of what you're talking about? That things have changed for the better and that there's a certain amount of people that want that oppression, that want the impression because it, it sort of puts them above other people. How do you fight that? You've been trying to fight it, I think for a long time. Tell the truth. That's how you find it. Tell the truth. I mean org, this movement called black lives matter. I think we talked about that a little bit. Um, it's, it says bogus and his phone or your movement as the notion that Oj Simpson is innocence from having killed two people. Uh, it's a fraud. Um, most cops simply want to do a good job and come home.

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       Most cops frankly, are more hesitant to pull the trigger against a black suspect than a white suspect. There've been a couple of studies that have shown that recently. One of them was uh, uh, an economist from Harvard named Roland Fryer and he is apparently the youngest tenured professor in the history of Harvard. Uh, and he's a tenured professor in the Department of Economics and he did a study to find out about police brutality. He assumed he would find the opposite and he was shocked. He said when he found out that most police officers, uh, are, are, are more reluctant to use deadly force on a black suspect than a non black suspect. And the reason in my opinion is pretty obvious. If you shoot a black person and there's any question whatsoever about it, you're going to be under the gun, you're going to be po, possibly prosecute it, maybe lose your pension, maybe go to jail.

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       Um, coughs are definitely afraid of being perceived as engaging in racial profiling. There was a recent poll that just came out and it turns out 75% of cops say that they are more reluctant now to engage with citizens, uh, then, then before, before the black lives matter movement. Yeah. So what's the disconnect then when you, when you see these, uh, cities, when you see Atlanta and you see Chicago and you see Ferguson and all of these places that are usually under democratic control, they usually have democratic mayors. The group think would tell you, wait a minute. Democrats are, are helping black people. So where is the disconnect coming from? A lot of people are not thinking critically, Dave, they're just not, uh, take, take Baltimore. Baltimore was run by a black mayor. She got 85% of the vote. What kind of politician gets 85% of the vote?

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       I think Kadafi got 105% and the top two officials running the police department were black. The command staff, majority black. Um, all the city council, Democrat, majority black, the state attorney, the one who brought the charges against the six officers, uh, is a black female. And yet, and still they are still talking about systemic racism. Um, the fact of the matter is a lot of black suspects or engaging in bad conduct and the police are doing their job and often the bad conduct is against another black victim. Yeah. Does this all come down to education for you? Because at the end of the day, if you can teach people properly about history and if you can teach them properly about what the role of government is and all of those things, that that's really how you untie this stuff from just the screeching people on both sides. I think so.

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       And but, but it's also all about, uh, rationally connect connecting the dots. Is it really true that a, that a young black man is more likely to be pulled over by a cop than a young white man? Uh, and if it is true, the other question is why. Um, and you cannot have a meaningful discussion about any of this without talking about behavior. I think maybe the last time we were here, we talked about a national institutes of justice study. Uh, that's the research arm of the DOJ. Uh, they did a study that came out in 2013 called traffic stops and race, and it turns out that whether you're talking about driving without a license or driving while drunk or driving a with a busted tail pipe or driving without a seatbelt or driving without a car seat in the back, uh, it turns out black motorists were more likely to commit those crimes.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       Then a white motorist, uh, and the study said that the differences in stopping have to do with differences in offending. If you can't have a meaningful discussion, unless you have a meaningful discussion about behavior right now, I suspect that some people on the left would hear that and they'd say, well, black people have been oppressed economically, so they are more likely to have a tail light out or some other thing you, you would just say that's nonsense. You would just say that individual responsibility, you've got to drive a car that's supposed to be the one that's on. That's right. Also, there's more poor white people in the country than there are poor black people. But if black people that complained about being disproportionately pulled over, um, half of all the homicides in this country involved black victims, almost all of the black victims were killed by other black people.

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       Um, I don't know what Ha, what that has to do with coffee being racist. It has to do with the fact that it disproportionately large percentage of crime is committed by a law. A small percentage of people, usually males, usually young black males, often against their peers. And that is because of the lack of fathers in the home. I didn't say it, Obama said it. A kid raised without a father is five times more likely to be poor, uh, nine times more likely to drop out of school in 20 times more likely to end up in jail. The number one problem facing this country is not a bad cops. Uh, not Obama care. It is the large number of, of, of children raised without fathers. That is a product of the welfare state between 1890 and 1920, 1930. Believe it or not, a black kid was slightly more likely to be born to mothers and fathers married to each other than a white kid.

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       So what's the connection there? What's the 1920 connections to the welfare state starts and why does that harm the black family? More? Uh, the welfare state, uh, really got kicked off in the mid sixties. 25% of black kids are born outside of wedlock in 1960 right now it's 73%. And what happened is literally Lyndon Johnson launched a so called war on poverty and he sent a workers literally knocking on people's doors to a prize. Women of their right to welfare provided there was no man in the house. And so what we've done is changed the culture. Uh, we've incentivize women to marry the government. We've allowed men to abandon their financial and more responsibility. It is a neutron bomb dropped on this country, uh, all because of the war on poverty that was done by Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats and with, with the tacit support by Republicans as well.

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       One quick thing and we know what we know that there is a, that there is a negative incentive because in 1996, when Bill Clinton signed the welfare reform act of 1996, welfare declined by over 50%, far steeper than anybody predicted. It turned out there was a bunch of able bodied people enable minded people sitting on couches and when the, when the, uh, when the Jig was up they got off the couch and got it and got to work. Yeah. Do you think the intentions are good? So we John and was, pushes this when the Democrats and the Republicans are going to work where their intentions were going to help people get out of my way or is there really something more nefarious going? No, the intentions were quite good. Uh, uh, uh, Fdr talked about, uh, uh, the corrosive effect of, of government dependency when he launched the new deal.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       Uh, and, uh, Lyndon Johnson talked about getting people off of government dependencies and making them more self self sufficient by launching the war on poverty. Those were their stated goals and I believed them. Uh, but human nature is such that if you allow somebody in easy out, some people will take an easy out. And that's what we've done with a lot of people. So basically we've said to a certain subset of people and it I guess is a disproportionate amount of black people. We've said you can get a certain amount of government handouts and basically your argument is that this is now just leaving people in the status quo. Because if you can get something subsidized housing, whatever it is, food stamps and you don't have to do anything and you'll just take it, that's not a black characteristic. That's a characteristic of what else, what any human of human nature.

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       And uh, there was uh, uh, a poll taken in 1986 by the La Times. They asked poor people in non poor people a bunch of questions. Um, and one of them was, do you believe that that poor people have additional children to get additional money from welfare? The majority of non poor people said no. They probably thought that it was insulting if not racist. 64% of poor people said yes. Also, they were asked this question, poor people, where do you believe that welfare is a crutch, a creates dependency or do you believe it's a, a, a means to get you to stand on your own two feet and go forward? More of them said it was a crutch that created dependency than it was a means to get you on your own two feet and go forward. These are poor people responding to this poll. Yeah. So basically guilt has a lot to do with this.

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       The guilt sort of white liberal guilt in a way has actually subjected black people to, uh, not all black people of course, but a certain subset of poor black people to a set of circumstances that they almost can't get out of. I think that's part of it. But also I think part of it is people that are comfortable and wealthy and well educated look around to figure out how they can perfect the world. Uh, and they forget that part of getting anywhere is overcoming obstacles and, and struggling. Uh, and if you make things real comfortable for people, some people are going to take the easy way out. So I think it's a kind of mindset, that kind of mentality. Yeah. When did we get to that point where fighting for what's yours fighting that no one should give you anything, that the government isn't supposed to give you anything and no one should, that it is your life to live.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       It is your, it's your job as a human to pursue what makes you happy and take what you can. And that doesn't mean destroying everything around you. Right. But, but finding what makes you happy. When did that get crossed up? Is it all connected to this, do you think that's, that's a good question. Uh, I think the founding fathers intended for us to have what people have characterized as rugged individualism. Article One, section eight of the constitution, uh, set forth a handful of things that the federal government should do. Uh, they did not include social security. They did not include Medicare. They did not include Medicaid. They did not include charity. But we've gotten away from that, I think, because as people become more and more affluent, um, they look around and try to perfect the world. Would you roll back all of those things?

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       I know. Do you consider yourself a libertarian? You're basically a libertarian. Yes. So, so you wouldn't lay a libertarian small, I'm a law and order a libertarian. So you think there should be driver's licenses? Oh, of course. Yeah. So you're not like, well, because that's an important distinction to make because there are plenty of libertarians that don't. So you're, so what makes you not a classical liberal then? Because that's, this is become one of the themes over the last time. I am a classical liberal and the John Stuart mill sense of it. Yeah, absolutely. I am somebody who believes in maximum personal freedom, but also you have to believe in the excellent personal responsibility. And that is to deal with the consequences of your choices. Uh, and, and a lot of people don't want to do that. Uh, they want to show people from, uh, the, the vestiges of, of, of, of the world of life.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       Uh, and when you do that, you also will create some other kind of reaction that there'll be worse. My father used to say, when you're trying to get something for nothing, you often end up getting nothing for something. Yeah. So what sort of social safety net should there be then? Or do you not think that there should be? And this may be the difference between a small l libertarian and a classical liberal? Uh, I think most classical liberals would feel the way I feel. And that is that the safety net should be provided by other individuals, not by government, but by churches, nonprofits. One of the things that I'm Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about in democracy in America, where were all of these, what were called mutual aid societies that were set up. This is before social security, before Medicare, before Medicaid. Uh, and believe it or not, um, a black person living in Chicago in 1920s, 1930s, was more likely to have health care insurance and a white person because, uh, he joined these mutual aid societies that provided that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       All right. So let's circle back to the family stuff because I remember you said the family stuff last time and the importance of a two parent family. I was, I come, my parents were still married 40 some odd years. I just went back to my childhood home in New York and for the first time I did have, I think I saw a little more tangibly what you were talking about, to go to my parents' house to feel that it was the same place that I grew up in that same community that I was part of. I visited family friends and some relatives that were nearby and it did feel like it connected me to something that was important. It's sort of an a femoral thing. It's something that's not quite tangible, but something that's important that does. It lays your roots, so to speak, and that you can sort of figure out who you are from that.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       Is that really what you're talking about with the family? That not, it's not just that there's a breadwinner, but something else, something that's sort of bigger than that that really can lay out what a life is supposed to be. Absolutely. It's not just a additional check as you pointed out. It's also being a role model. Watching your father get up, go, go to work when he doesn't feel like it. Watching him live up to his responsibilities. And you know, the, the three arguably the biggest leaders in this country, black leaders in this country or Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan and all of them had difficult not for you, Huh? All of them had difficult if not nonexistent relationship with their own fathers. Jesse Jackson's mother was a teenager, uh, who was impregnated by the married man who lived next door. And when Jesse Jackson was raised in South Carolina, kits taunted him.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       Jesse ain't got no daddy. Jesse ain't got no daddy because that's how rare it was in those days to be raised without a father. Al Sharpton had a nice middle class life until his father abandoned the family and then down to the ghetto. And in the case of Farah Khan, his mom was a strange from her husband, had a boyfriend, took back up with the husband, got pregnant, didn't want the boyfriend to know and tried to abort, uh, Louis Farrakhan with a coat hanger. So all three of these men in my opinion have deep psychological issues because of the lack of relationship with their own fathers. And that is one of the reasons why, in my opinion, they're so angry despite the fact that things have gotten so much better in terms of race relations in this country. So basically they can't let go of that pain. I mean, not to fully cycle analyze them, but they're dealing with a personal pain that is extremely painful for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       And they can't let go of that pain. So now they're kind of projecting it on to the rest of us via policy, in my opinion. Again, I'm not a psychologist if I were, that's what I would say. Um, now a lot of people have had bad circumstances and have not been that, uh, that sour because of it. My father. And then we talked about him before. My father does not know who his biological father is. The man named elder was a man who was in his life the longest. He was a alcoholic who abused him and abused, uh, uh, his mother physically. Uh, and my dad was literally thrown out of the house when he was 13 years old by his mother's then boyfriend who sided with, uh, with, uh, her boyfriend when he and my dad got into a corner when he was 13 years old, came home from chemo from school, and he was making too much noise to boyfriend.

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       Got Mad. My Dad said something to him, uh, his mother's side with the boyfriend out of the house. He goes, wow. 13 years old, Jim Crow, south Athens, Georgia, right at the beginning of the Great Depression. My father was never angry though my father said to us, always us, meaning my two brothers and me, I picked up the cars. I dealt with them to the best that I could. Uh, what did he do? Did you do a series of whatever anybody would pay him to do a cleaning? This cleaning that ultimately he got a job with the pullman porters. They were the largest private employer of blacks in those days, and he was able to travel, travel around the country. That's how we ended up in California. He came here one time, it was sunny, people smiled, it seemed more friendly. And after the war was over at my dad, uh, I relocated to California to try and get a job as a cook.

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       And he was told that he had no references, which was California's way of saying we don't hire black people. Right. Uh, and my dad ended up being a janitor, worked two full time jobs at the janitor, save these nickels and dimes, started a little cafe near the Pico Union area, which he ran until the 80s. In fact, I wrote about this in my last book is called Dear Father, dear son, two lives eight hours because my father and I did not get along. Uh, I thought of my father is grouchy and an honoree and I couldn't understand why he was so ill tempered until I got 25 years old. We stopped talking to each other when I was 15 we didn't speak to each other for 10 years. Wow. And my dad and I sat down for what I thought would be a 10 minute conversation. It ended up being an eight hour conversation and that's why I wrote the book a dear father, dear son, two lives, eight hours about this conversation.

Speaker 2:          00:34:06       Do you think that despite what you've said about, uh, President Obama, do you think that now that he's out of office, maybe he could step into the role that you'd like to see him in? So instead of America turning to Jesse Jackson and Farrakhan and Sharpton, maybe they can turn it to you, but if not to Larry elder, but if not to Larry elder, that may be Obama when you disconnected from politics, can actually talk about some of those things. Cause I mean, you addressed it a second ago, you said he did mention the family and mentioned fathers and all that. So is there a chance that you think there's a chance for that? I'm not optimistic because, uh, in his last press conference he talked about we still have a great deal to do on race. By the way, when people talk about a great deal to do on race or all they really mean is how black people feel about white people and vice versa.

Speaker 2:          00:34:50       They don't care about Hispanic, they don't care about Asians. They really care about the relationship between blacks and whites. Um, and Obama has throughout his eight years, in my opinion, when he could have ignored the race card or put it in perspective, picked it up, uh, whether it's Cambridge police or whether it's, uh, trayvon Martin. If I had a Sony would look like Trayvon, whether it's invoking ferguson, whether it's hiring somebody like Eric Holder lecturing in the country on race and racism. Uh, Obama I think, believes that racism remains this huge, massive problem in America despite his election and despite his reelection. And I don't, and so I don't think he's going to say the right thing and do the right thing. I think he, I think he's encouraged black people to think of themselves as victims as opposed to saying, look at me. I busted my bud.

Speaker 2:          00:35:32       My parents made sure I had a good education. I didn't make bad moral mistakes. Uh, I got married before I had kids follow my model and you'll be fine. He has not said that at all. What he said is, we have real problems in this country. He embraced the black lives matter movement. Uh, I mentioned Trayvon Martin. I mentioned some of the other things. In my opinion, the reason that a lot of people voted for Obama was because he, they thought he was going to do exactly what you suggested, which is to heal us, put things in perspective, tell young black people they ought not be angry when they're pulled over by a cop. All the copies is doing is his job. Instead, he did the opposite. So I'm not optimistic at all. The he'll play the kind of role that you'd suggest. Yeah. So the way we've demon hope I'm wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       I hope you're on too. I don't know. But the way we've demonized cops as part of this. I agree. I mean, I see a lot of times people are just screaming about how evil cops are and they're hunting people down in all of this stuff. I don't know a ton of cops, but I knew some in New York and I know a couple here. I mean generally they're trying to do good. Right. I mean, do you have any experience in which were, have you ever been pulled over and had it? I probably had been pulled over maybe more than almost anybody. You know, I got my driver's license when I was 15 and a half my learner's permit. And then when I was 16 I was able to drive by myself and I probably looked like I was 12 so I got pulled over probably a hundred times.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       And with the exception of one or two instances, the encounter was brief and professional. Uh, one time a cop told me to take my head out of my ass. That was the first time I got pulled over by the way. I was driving and there was a light behind me and I knew I hadn't done anything, anything wrong. So I just keep going. The guy pulled over and screamed at me and he goes, why don't you pull over? And I said, what? I said to you, well, obviously I didn't, I didn't think I did anything wrong. And he said, whenever you see some lights behind you, you pull over, get your head out of your ass. And he was right. I should've had my head head of I ask, you know, um, uh, the instances in which cops kill blacks has declined 75% in the last 45 years according to the CDC, while the instances in which cops are cops kill whites has pretty much flat lined.

Speaker 2:          00:37:31       And so it's going down. It is very, very, very rare for the cop to kill anybody, let alone an unarmed black person of the 965, um, uh, people that were killed by the police, uh, in 2015, less than 4% were white cops killing an unarmed black man. It is very rare. By contrast, 400 people were injured by lightning last year, but only 250 people were killed. Black people were killed by police. So it's very, very rare. So how much of this, I know you talk about fake news and I want to get to that, but how much of this is because the media is complicit in all of this. So for example, just this morning, I think the Oscar nominations were put out. I haven't even seen them yet, but apparently there are more minorities this time. I guess there aren't some more Latinos and a Dev Patel and some more black people.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       And you know, for the last couple of years there's been this Oscars so white thing to me, and I can only speak for myself, this is like keep your eye is just off the ball. You're just paying attention to the wrong thing where it's nice to have people nominated for these things, but they're irrelevant in the scheme of what's important and what you should be caring about is education and all that. Right. But the media has made such an importance out of this that it's like it's getting the black community's eye off what's actually important, which would be education and family and some of the others. I couldn't agree with you more. Um, I have an actor friend and I said, why is this important to you? And he said, because it provides role models and enhances the self esteem of black people. That's what he said. I say, are you aware that black boys and black girls have higher self esteem than white girls and white boys?

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       This has been tested for decades. It's been the case for a long time and there are very, very few Asian actors and actresses, yet, uh, Asian Americans, Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans and Korean Americans on a per capita basis make more money than virtually anybody else in this country. So it's utterly irrelevant. Yeah. And for us to pay attention to this, and it's also not true. If you look at the last 15 years or so, roughly 10% or so of the nominees for the major categories have been black people. They've been a couple of years where there has been a shutout. Uh, but um, add it all up. It's, it's about parody with population. Right. So that's the irony. It actually within a couple of percentage points, it actually has been a party and Jamie Foxx who got an Oscar for four re, uh, said, uh, in, in, uh, in connection with this Oscar.

Speaker 2:          00:39:48       So white movement. He said, act better, be better, raise your game, don't demand, don't yell, don't scream. Get better, act better. You got an Oscar and, and, and, and I think part of the reason he said that is because it kind of demeans his Oscar. Right? Cause then it means like you're, you're complaining that the Oscars are so white. How did I get one? I was lucky. Yeah. Maybe just, maybe I was excellent. Yeah. So do you think that at times visibility is important? So for example, I had, I've had jack a Harry on here. She was the first black woman. I think she wasn't for best supporting actress in two to seven, uh, around, I guess it's around 1989 or so at that time. Do you think that a certain amount of is visibility may have been more important than it is now? Like, cause finally a black person did it even if you don't think that the thing in and of itself is, is important?

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       I don't think so. I remember some years ago there was an Olympic, uh, blacks, uh, skier named Debbie. Debbie Thomas, I believe was her last name. And she was the first, um, uh, Black Olympian and in, uh, in, in ice skating. And she was constantly ask, who are your role models? Who are your role models? Who inspired you? And finally to me, out of, out of exasperation, she said, I don't need to see somebody black do something before I think I can do it. And that's how I feel. If I want to do something, uh, w w what's holding me back from doing it other than my own insecurities or, or, or, or, or inadequacies. Just get up and make it happen. Yeah. How exhausting is this conversation to you? I don't mean this literal conversation right now, but just this thing, you know, so much of what you talk about has to do, unfortunately be framed around something that you don't even think is, is real.

Speaker 2:          00:41:32       You know what I mean? It's something that you think should be put behind us that actually is behind us. And yet you have to talk about it a lot. Just on a personal note, how does that feel for you? It doesn't bother me. I, I think there's a lot of a feeling that race and racism remain major problems in America. Uh, and I think that that you're approaching this with, with, with sincerity and, and, and, and since and real concern. Uh, I just don't think it's that big of a deal. Yeah. By the way, I've emailed duray Mckesson [inaudible] who's the leader? I think the quasi leader of black lives matter. He hasn't responded, but I will, I will ask him again. So I'm not doing it. I'm not just playing favorites. I'm just putting that out. No, no, no problem. Um, this is America. There.

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       There are Cubans who are braving shark infested waters to get here. There are people from Central America coming up here. Why do people come here? Why does so many people want to come to America and is because it is the land of the free and the home of the brave. It is a place where you can go from nothing to something a faster than it anytime, anywhere in all of human history. That's why we're here and to me again, you are are almost giving the fourth finger to all the people fought, struggled, worked hard and died for people to sit around in 2017 in Bitch Moan and whine about race and racism. Yeah. I suspect I know your answer to this, but what do you make of all these people that now want to look back on history and label everyone racist from back then? You know I was at Monte Cello, which was Thomas Jefferson's home, Thomas Jefferson who owned slaves who was sleeping with at least one sleep, I think several who they, by the way at Monte Cello, I took the tour.

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       There's only about a year and a half ago, they fully owned up to everything. They did not. I thought it was incredible what they did. They said this man was writing the laws to free the slaves at the same time he was sleeping with the slaves, which I think you could probably make an argument was rape in a certain respect because they weren't equals right now I'm not saying he's a rapist in the conventional sense, but you can. I can see that argument being made, but what about that concept that we're going to look back at? What the, I think the left is now trying to do is look at all of our founding fathers and take them out of the give our 2017 morality to them who lived very complex lives. I mean without Thomas Jefferson, the slaves do not get fried as quickly as they did.

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       Well. I think the idea of going back and airbrushing history and looking at history through the, through the filter of today's a morality is pretty silly. I think all a state can be. It's just in its own time. And that's what we're trying to be trying to do right now. Uh, and people are right to call a slavery Americans, America's original sin. But without a compromise, you wouldn't have had an America. And, um, and there was 750,000 people, both sides who died in order to free the slaves. And people don't really have an understanding of, of, of, of the, the, the scale of the sacrifice that people made. 750,000 people at a time when this country was just 10% the size of what it is. So that's like 7.5 million people dying, uh, in order for there to be an outcome with slaves are freed and that's the, and are the people that died and not the ones who've been injured.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       It was a horrific thing, uh, that, that America went through. Uh, and, and on the other side comes the 13th amendment, the 14th Amendment, the 15th Amendment, uh, the civil rights movement and, and all the things that have happened since then, but that, this was a country they went to war over this proposition. Yeah. What, what do you make of this intersectional thing that we have going on now? And I think we saw a lot of it at the woman's March, this, this past weekend where there's a certain amount of people that are trying to conflate trans issues with black issues and then Muslim issues with women's issues. And just this whole thing where, you know, I talk about all the time this oppression Olympics and now we're all, they're all tied together by this oppression, but they all have to kind of beat each other and oppression to be the winner.

Speaker 2:          00:45:15       This is a toxic mess, Huh? It is. It's, it's a, it's what I call the victim correct culture where everybody has a grievance, uh, and everybody's making a demand on the government to solve that grievance, uh, when in fact, uh, we have far more in common than we have apart and we ought to celebrate our similarities and we're not doing that. Okay. So let's move to trump then. I think what you said, there's an interesting segway to trump. So there seems to be this feeling that the white supremacist back, they're back in business. And it should be, and it's because of trump. So I saw this. Do you see this video of this Guy Richard Spencer, who's The alt right guy and you got to get in hunched? He got punched. I tweeted out that I, this guy has obviously bad ideas. I've had family members on both sides of my family killed in the Holocaust.

Speaker 2:          00:45:59       So I am not a Nazi sympathizer in any way, but I have to defend his right to free speech without being punched because that's the whole point. You can't just defend it when it's easy. You got to defend it when you don't want to. And that's, but I saw a lot of people on the left, a lot of famous people, a lot of people with a lot of influencing. No, it's okay to punch Nazis, which if you just follow their logic through, well he could have killed him cause you could accidentally kill somebody. And then if it's okay to punch a random person because of their beliefs, can we blow up his car? Can we bombed his house? I mean this is a, this is a horrifically slippery slope, right? Oh, of course it is. Uh, is it okay for me to, to, to burn up a building, uh, because I'm unhappy with, because of the way the police treat me are riots perfectly.

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       Okay. Uh, would it be okay if somebody walked up to John Lewis and punched him because they feel that John Lewis should have attended the Donald Trump inaugural? Where do we, where do we go with this? Are you kidding me? Yeah. And, and believe me, it would have been a huge story if that had been somebody like John Lewis who had been punched as opposed to this Spencer Guy, uh, that the media doesn't care about. Uh, and feels is loathsome. I understand that, but I would've thought that would've been a little more coverage of it, but there wasn't very much. Yeah. So I know a certain amount of people are gonna Watch this and go, wait a minute, wait a minute. Here's a black guy and a Jew somehow defending a Nazis, right to free speech. He wants to, I'm pretty sure he'd want to kick both of us out of the country or something close to that.

Speaker 2:          00:47:18       But it's tough to have principles, right? I mean it isn't that, isn't that the crux of what you're saying? Basically the through line of all of this is you got to have some principles, wasn't it voltaire who said, I guess we have what you've said, but I would defend to my death your right to say it. I mean we're talking about principles here. Yeah, free speech. So, and by the way, it's not unlawful to it to hate somebody. You can hate somebody. As you pointed out earlier, you can't put your hand on that person, but you have every right to dislike somebody for whatever reason you want. Yeah. So I sense that a lot of people think though that white supremacy is back, that they, that they feel that there was a link to trump somehow. I don't really see that link. But there there was a link that somehow he unearthed this and now pepe the frog and Rob Bay, the monkey and the white supremacists, they've been unearthed and now they feel it's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:04       So their only response is to hit back. I would argue, which I think you would argue, which is your beat them with better ideas. Let this 80th talk and guess what he's going to show what a fraudulent bigot he actually is. Right. Um, but do you think there's any resurgence of actual white supremacy? I mean, is that a real issue? I'm not saying it. Uh, Donald Trump got a higher percentage of the black vote. They, Mitt Romney did and John Mccain did. He got a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney did. Um, he got a smaller percentage of the white vote, then his, um, his predecessor, then the, the, the, the, the Republican rand beforehand. So I'm not seeing it. I am seeing a resurgence in the, uh, uh, assertion that white supremacy is back, but I'm not seeing it. Look, um, one of Donald Trump's, um, a surrogate's was doctor Ben Carson is doctor Ben Carson.

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       Uh, somebody that's going to cozy up to somebody who is a white supremacist. Uh, one of my friends, Steven Miller, uh, is the young, uh, speech writer who wrote Donald Trump's inaugural speech and wrote his rnc speech. He's about 30 in his early thirties. I've known him since he was a teenager. He is not a, somebody is going to work for it for a white supremacy. He happens to be a Jew. Um, so donald trump's a wrong vehicle to peg that on. And John Lewis said that he was not going to attend his, his inauguration the first time in all of his years being in Congress. He's not going to to attend the presidential inauguration. False. If he, he, he did not attend George W Bush's inauguration. Now with George W. Bush a Nazi. What's he, what's he a fascist? Was he a racist? What was your argument? Mr. Lewis, if he were here, I'd ask him for not attending George W Bush's inauguration.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       I understand donald trump's, but explaining George W. Bush to me. Right. So is that the crazy position that a lot of people have painted themselves into now they've screamed and ranted and raved that trump and this whole movement is, is vial and racist and all this stuff. We're now, if he does any good, they're going to have to lash out in crazy ways because you can't have a guy that you've been calling Hitler for a year. Suddenly you can't suddenly admit that he's doing some good stuff, right? So they've put themselves in a really tight intellectual box here. I think they have, and again, Donald Trump is a bad vehicle, uh, to, to do that with because if you look at some of his points of view, they are quite populous and quite left wing. He and Bernie Sanders were completing each other's sentences on free trade. And when a Donald Trump had the interview with 60 minutes and he was asked about same sex marriage, he said it was settled law.

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       He could have said the same thing he said about abortion, which was I'm going to put on a justice who ultimately would turn over Roe v Wade. He didn't say that, but that's really what, what, what he wants to happen. But he could have said that regarding gay marriage because, uh, gay marriage is less settled law then abortion. Uh, abortion has been on the books since 1973. The gay marriage decision just now came down. Oh, so your argument is that he's actually more for gay marriage than he is for abortion on gay marriage. He said to Steve Croft, that issue has been settled. Really he could have said, I'm going to put on justices that, that, that we'll look at the constitution and we'll have all these issues. Go back to the state like abortion. But he didn't, he said same sex marriage is settled law, which was his way, in my opinion, of signaling to all of the people in the country, especially his critics that I am okay with same sex marriage.

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       And on, as I mentioned, on and on, on free trade, he and Bernie Sanders were, were, were identical and on infrastructure. He wants a trillion dollar infrastructure, uh, investment. Uh, Chuck Schumer just now said that he's okay with that. Yeah. When you have chuck Schumer smiling, it seems to me you ought to be worried. But the point is, these are the kinds of things, and they felt that Obama's stimulus was too small and this is bigger than that. So they're, they're giddy over all over all of that. So why Donald Trump is engendering all of this hostility when he has so many a centrist, if not leveling point of view is beyond me. Well, I think it has to do is just the way he speaks. I think you know, my concern about him from day one, as I've said a thousand times in that year, I don't know what his moral center is, but I don't know that, you know what a lot of these guys, moral center is at the end of the day, a lot of them speak a lot clearer.

Speaker 2:          00:52:04       So you to, you think you know it, right? And then you don't know it. You'd probably argue that about Obama, but for trump, I don't know what it is. That being said, I think the answer to your question is I think the left no longer has the ability to understand the difference between words and actions. So they see his gruff language and some poorly phrase things and that he speaks not that well, and then they think that translates into action when in fact he actually did a lot of things that brought them more center. I think it goes back to what we said earlier and there's just a lack of critical thinking. I think we are at the end of your name. Uh, all of a sudden there are certain sets of, of views that people assume you have a and they, they go after those views.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       Um, I look at his, his, his moral center. I look at Donald Trump's family. Uh, these kids adore him. He's had three different marriages. It's complicated to pull all that stuff together. Three different marriages, uh, children from all three of the marriages and they all get along and they all worked up their father. How bad a guy can he be? You know, it's funny, I had Donald Trump jr on my Sirius xm show talking about how he was for gay marriage is about a little bit before it got passed it about let's say three years ago, four years ago. I'm talking about how he personally was for gay marriage, even though his dad was in it and that his dad said, you go out and tell people whatever you want. So I thought that that's actually a nice marker of, of sort of what a father should be.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       Do you his authoritarian side at all because as you said, small l libertarian, so you want the government to scale back. I sense he is going, he, yeah, he's going to lower taxes and they were already doing some stuff with regulations that you're probably four and that kind of stuff, but do you sense there could be an authoritarian side even controlling what businesses can do overseas and that kind of stuff that you may not like? There are. There are things he said that I don't like. Uh, I don't know that I would label them authoritarian. I would label them as stupid. For example, saying I'm going to put on a 30 or 40% tariff on goods that come in for this country. If you've left the country and started a factory, all you're doing is discriminating against cheap prices and hurting American consumers. I as a business person have an obligation to maximize shareholder return.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       And if my biggest cost is labor and I can go somewhere else and build my widgets, uh, for less money, I have an obligation to do that. And if I don't do that, my competitor will. And for a business person like Donald Trump to tell another business person, I'm going to punish you for it, for seeking profits to me is outrageous. I understand and support his idea that a lot of the reason people go overseas because we have onerous regulations and high corporate tax. Once you lower the regulations and lower the corporate taxation, and I had a CEO had made a calculation that I can make more money by putting my factory I in a third world country. How dare you tax me for, for doing that. We'll get you the right to do that. Right. So you would basically argue that if you lowered the corporate tax rates, did everything he could to unregulate business here, you wouldn't need that tax on the overseas stuff because it would be humming and pairing nicely here.

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       You wouldn't, you wouldn't need to leave the country to set up a factory because you would stay here. What we have right now are all these environmental rules and regulations designed to fight climate change. We have a very high corporate tax rate, the highest in the industrialized world. Uh, you deal with those kinds of things and you'll take away the incentive that some ceos have a to move outside of the country. But so when you take all those away and you lower the lower the, uh, the regulatory burdens that ceos have to deal with and they still want to put a factory somewhere, you have absolutely no right to stop them from doing that, in my opinion. Do you think it's hilarious how we look at certain companies that do the exact same things as other companies? Some are. Okay. Some are. So for example, trump made his ties in Mexico, which I kept saying all along, this isn't something you're getting him on.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       He, you're, he's proving the point. He's proving the point that it's cheaper to do there, change the regulations and then he wouldn't have to at the same time a company and trump was mocked relentlessly for doing that. Right. At the same time, apple designs their stuff in Cupertino as they say, and it's all made in China and they hide all kinds of stuff tax wise. But we're all walking around with iphones. How come some companies are able to, that's just the cool factor of apple. I think so. And uh, I think Al Gore was on the board of directors of apple at one point or if he isn't now, uh, and here they are manufacturing stuff in China. Um, yeah. Some companies have better pr than other companies. He also sold current TV, Al Jazeera, which is owned by Cutera, one of the biggest exporters of oil in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:56:21       But, but that's not what we digress. Let's not dwell on that. Um, okay, let's, let's move over to fake news because I, this is so tied into what's happening with trump, the outrage machine and then the fake news machine. All of this, you've been all over this. I am just a pocket, a pap apoplectic and apoplectic about what's going on with this. Because I see the mainstream media crumbling. I see online media growing, but I see risks in that too because anybody can put on a tie and pretend they're somebody and get a desk and that's, you know, it is what it is. Uh, how bad is this scorge of fake news? I think we've always had really bad fake news. It just got passed off as CBS, NBC or ABC. Um, uh, there've been lots of stories in my opinion that had been fake news.

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       Stories are, one of them was, um, uh, when Obama was pushing obamacare, he said over and over again, uh, that his mother who was suffering from cancer as she lay dying in her hospital bed in Hawaii, had to fight with her insurance carrier to pay for her medical bills and her hospital bills. Turns out it is not true. He said it over and over and over again. A book came out by a woman named Janice Scott, who used to work with the New York Times. Therefore it must be a good book. And she said that those bills were promptly paid. The only coral was that Obama's mom and dad had taken out a, um, uh, a policy, uh, so that if she got sick, she would be entitled to money. And the, the law is that if you are, have been diagnosed you and you try to take our policy like that, uh, we can, we can challenge it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       And that's what they challenged. But regarding her medical bills, hospital bills, they were paid promptly, but he said it over and over and over again. And it helped to drive the narrative that if my more that got jacked over and she has a phd and has a son from Harvard with a law degree, imagine what these insurance carriers will do to you. It turns out complete completely not true. Another fake news. Oh, I said, I think I said earlier when Obama said during his many pref press conferences, I am most proud of the fact that I rescue the economy. Really tarp was done by George W. Bush. The bailouts were done by George W. Bush. Uh, and many of the things that Obama has done, including stimulus, actually hurt the recovery, didn't help it, it, he says this over and over again with a straight face. And the failure of the media not to ask challenging questions when he raises that to me is fake news.

Speaker 2:          00:58:35       So that's the issue. So not to split hairs there, but that's the issue that we've had basically a lapdog media. So there's the idea, I think when the left talks about fake news, they're talking about these right wing sites that are just making up things, right? They push a lot of that on, on Breitbart and we can talk about that you want, but that's different than what you're talking about, which is just immediate. That just simply got cozy. They got cozy with the people in power, so they just stopped doing their job. You're calling that fake news. Absolutely. These are two separate types of fake. Absolutely. I talked earlier about Obama pulling completely out of Iraq over the objection of his, uh, of his team. He also then said, well, the reason I did that is because George W. Bush had negotiated a, an agreement that required me to leave.

Speaker 2:          00:59:17       At the time, I did completely not true. George W. Bush negotiated an agreement, but he fully expected his successor to negotiate a stay behind force. And again, Obama has said this over and over again, and the media hasn't said anything about that. That to me, fake news. Right. So I remember when that happened and I remember thinking when Obama said it, yes, they had, they had set the date, but obviously Obama had plenty of political capitol at the time. If he had wanted to stay, he could've stayed. So that's right. This is just a, it's just a conflation of poor media practices and we saw a lot of this with Hillary. I just pour media practices, the willpower, the willingness to, the willingness to, the willingness to look the other way because it's a guy that you're pulling for. Yeah. When Obama came into office, he reneged on a deal that George W. Bush and negotiated.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       He negotiated a deal with Poland and the Czech Republic to for them to get missile defense. Russia didn't like it. Obama thought that he could curry favor with Russia by reneging on the deal. And he did, um, the failure of the media to bring this up and to bring up him saying him and pushing the reset button and him saying to Medvedev, ah, when I get reelected I have more, I'll have more flexibility. The failure of the media to bring this up when they're hitting Donald Trump for being too cozy with Putin is another example of fake news. So that to me is the monster that we've created. They did nothing for so long now because they don't like trump. They're trying to be professionals, which I want them to write. I want them to do true investigative journalism. I want them to fight the power. But they seem almost ridiculous doing it now because they're watching tweets and getting outraged before weekend.

Speaker 2:          01:00:52       Right. I just wrote a column about all of this and what I've said is that the media has rediscovered their mission now that the Republicans back in the White House. But before that, in my opinion, they didn't do their jobs. Yeah. Easy. Almost too late for them. Have they? Because I think they've lost so much credit that even now is they scurry to get their credit back. I mean, for example, uh, yesterday, the day before I watched the second Sean Spicer, uh, press conference, not, not the quick one where he was bickering about the first official. I watched the first official one, right? I think it was Monday and I watched the entire thing. I'm doing cardio or that's the only way I can watch it. Right. I got to buy up to be moving. You got to run from the bullshit. So I'm watching this thing. Okay. I thought he basically did a pretty decent job.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       He took a good Julian questions. He answered them in pretty much the same way that all prices people do, which is, you know, half answers and partially that's what they do. But suddenly I saw the headlines. First of off the, the main twitter moment headline was saying that he was focusing on the numbers of people there. That was just a small portion and it was only because they kept asking him that same question. Right? So that's also fake news, right? Where they just keep framing something a certain way, not just the, not just what it said, but that you can take an hour and a half thing and go, well, this was the part that was important when, you know, it actually wasn't the part that, let me say a couple of things about that spicer and not only quarreled with the idea that trump's a audience was larger than what the media report it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:18       Uh, he also talked about the fact that a reporter from Time magazine, not, not the Bug Tussle Gazette Time magazine said that I'm a Donald Trump removed the bus to vml k from the Oval Office. Now that to me is a major story. If it were true, it is not true. Time magazine, uh, reported for twice Time magazine tweeted it and it went around the world rather than focus on that fake news part, they talk about what Sean Spicer said about the crowd size because that's something they could probably make an argument about. What the mlk thing, they can't make an argument about it. So when we haven't even talked about that and we found out because of Wiki leaks. David, how many of these reporters, we're in bed with the DNC in bed with Hillary, I mean in New York Times reporter is doing a massive story on, on Hillary and and gave her veto proof over quotes.

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       She doesn't like a power that she, that she in fact use and took out a quote that she had made about Sarah Pailin. Yeah. You're not making this up by the night wash it. Washington Post, uh, was doing a story on John Podesta and found out some conflict of interest regarding money and gave him a heads up and told him, don't worry about it. We'll bury it in the, in the, in the story a staffer is far for jake tapper in for Wolf Blitzer of CNN, contacted the DNC and said, we're about ready to interview some Republicans. You have any questions for us? Dana Milbank is a columnist with the Washington Post. He did a story, a column called the 10 most outrageous things Donald Trump has ever said. He contacted the DNC and said, I'm about ready to do this column on the 10 most outrageous things Donald Trump ever said.

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       Do you have any suggestions? They gave him 10 suggestions. He used eight. Yeah. Are you kidding me? You didn't even mention the most egregious one in my opinion, which is the whole Donna Brazil thing, which is to me the heart, because that one is the heart of how corrupt media and politicians have become. But at least cnn fired her. But the d DNC hired her as interim chair even after she was out in his head as having conspired with hilary to make sure that Bernie Sanders, uh, got, uh, didn't, did not win. So what is at the moment, but I think the most are one of the most outrageous ones is, um, a guy named Kurt. I can wald. Yeah. He writes for Newsweek and tweeted that Donald Trump had been put in a mental institution for some time, no evidence for it whatsoever. He took the tweet down pretty quickly when it was debunked but he wasn't fired or or even suspend or even chastise.

Speaker 2:          01:04:38       So this is where people talk about post truth. Now I know we don't want to be in a post truth society what's post true, but we'll post truth that at this point, you know any idiot who's amass the 150,000 twitter followers, it has as much influence in a lot of respects as news one on one was that 150,000 acre? Thank you for calling me an idiot. I just went above it. That's why I mentioned that number cause I was any idiot that could have as much influence but, but really you could have a set, you could figure out how to do the social media game and somehow because of that you've got a little blue check to now. Now you're an authority on this stuff and there so that I do see as a major risk that while I wanted the mainstream media to get the lashing, it deserved the fact that it's now everyone's just picking their truth wherever they can find it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       As a huge problem. It's, it's both a problem and a blessing. It also means that the, uh, the, the traditional establishment media, it can be, can be gone around. Uh, you can get your ideas out, uh, and uh, and nothing can stop you from communicating to people. Uh, but you're right. It means that anybody can communicate and whether or not he or she is credible, uh, is left to you as a consumer to figure out. Is there any way that you think trump can reconcile this relationship with the media? Because I think it's almost the most important thing right now. More important than the policies because it's one thing to just rail against the media all the time. Again, I don't like what the media, the mainstream media has done, but do you think you can get to a point where he'll actually do some real sit downs, do some real press conferences and not do the same things, you know, be willing to sit down with an interviewer.

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       Hopefully it will be me, but maybe it will be somebody else and not demand the questions in advance, you know, be better than all the reasons that you just said the Democrats. Well, I don't think it donald trump's job to, uh, to curry favor with the media. I think it's the media's job to be fair. Um, and as far as I'm concerned, he has very little risk. Um, he is disliked more than Reagan, more than George W. Bush. Uh, in my opinion, uh, they're out to get him. And for him to have a more confrontational attitude towards the media to me, makes perfect sense because there is no upside in him doing it any other way. They're going to go after him like nobody's business. They just, they just like him because of his attitude about, uh, about, uh, uh, immigration. Uh, they think of him as a racist.

Speaker 2:          01:07:03       You think of him as a, as a, as a bigot, as a, as a tyrant. If that's your attitude and you're not going to cut me any slack, why should I kiss your butt? And so I have no problem with what Sean did. Sean Spicer, his first, uh, informal press conference when he, when he blasted the media the way he did. And it does turn out that Donald Trump's audience, which is the word he used, uh, to watch the inaugural with, was bigger than any audience and history in part because of social media. Right? So a lot of people on twitter were angry me over that, cause I didn't say anything about it. But if you listen to actually what he said, he said, audience, meaning he, and then he clarified it on Monday. He said, I mean, people that are streaming it on facebook and watching on ipads and youtube and all that, but everybody wants everyone to get outraged all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       It's exhausting, isn't it? It also turns out, apparently, that when you look at the, the, the, uh, the pictures of, of, uh, Obama's inaugural and trump's, trump's does look thinner, but my understanding is part of that is because of security measures. There are certain places you can't stand anymore for in place. You can't go through anymore. It's a lot of people couldn't get to the main area because of all these security requirements. So you're comparing, uh, not apples to apples and so you'd agree all of that is just sideshow nonsense, right? Like it's actually completely irrelevant. The amount of people I'm talking about, not, not the lying about it, but just whether they were x amount of people or why it's completely irrelevant except that he's putting media on notice that you have to be fair to me. Yeah. Do you think the media regrets, you know, it's hard to categorize all the media, but when they look back at the way they treated mccain, who now looks like the most moderate, the public and of all time, you know, and they, they, they were times calling him racist.

Speaker 2:          01:08:38       And I think he has an adopted black daughter, if I'm not mistaken. Or when they look at Romney and the binders of women and made it sound like he hates women, that they, in a way, they created trump because any republican was going to get the cries of racism, was going to get the cries of misogyny and the crisis xenophobia and homophobia and all that. Right? So he brings up Peter Teal. These still hates gays. He has a, uh, Ben Carson, he's still lays black. So in a way, he was the only answer to this absurd equation, right? I think you're right. I think the media did they help to create Donald Trump. People resent the idea that the media has gone after Republicans in a way that they not gone after Democrats. And so there's a distrust. And when Donald Trump talked about political correctness and how he was no longer going to be politically correct, a lot of people took that to mean I'm no longer going to going to thinking of myself as a racist, as a sexist, simply because I've got normal views and normal ideas at any other guy has.

Speaker 2:          01:09:35       And I think Donald Trump has given people like that a certain amount of, uh, of comfort and credibility. Yeah. All right. So one more for Ya, which we'll sort of wrap this whole thing up. What happens over the next four years? Where do you really see this all going? Do you see this endless clash between, between trump and the left? Is there a way to get the media straightened out? Can we get some of this societal stuff to, to shake out or is it just going to be more battling because it seems, I thought there was going to be a couple of days after the election where everyone would take a breath. Right? It seems like everyone's just ramping up more and more now. No, people see things differently. We disagree. We disagree about abortion. We disagree about same sex marriage. We disagree about taxes, about spending, about foreign policy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       As long as we have those disagreements, we're going to have these kinds of disputes. But I think what will happen, uh, hopefully, uh, is that we have 4% GDP growth. Uh, like we did under Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was overwhelmingly reelected, not because people agreed with him, they disagreed with him about his nuclear proliferation. They disagreed about, uh, his, um, uh, going into South America and trying to roll back some of the communists movements there. If you go down and list by list, it was a article in the New York Times in 1986 I talked about all of these points of views and how Americans disagreed with Ronald Reagan, but they respected him and overwhelmingly reelected him because ultimately it comes down to the economy comes down to pocket book and 70% of the American people felt that we were on the wrong track economically. Uh, and that is the primary reason in my view, why Donald Trump won worst economic recovery since 1949.

Speaker 2:          01:11:03       This has been a 2% recovery. The average recovery 3%. And the difference between 2% and 3% is 1 million jobs times at length the recovery. So if Obama had done nothing had on is putting, we have 7 million more jobs than we have right now. Yeah. Well, he did work on the buddy know we'd have 10 million. Morgan. Good. All right. Well, Larry was a pleasure. We're going to do a little boat to segment for our audience and I thank you for coming back. Pleasure and we're going to link to the original one and people can see if maybe I changed you in some ways too. Who knows? Well, I felt I felt the same way leaving as I felt coming. How's that? Fair enough. All for war on Larry. Checkout his website, Larry elder.com.
