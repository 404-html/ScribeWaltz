Speaker 1:          00:02          You're saying different for our third show, we're going to get away from atheism and religion today, believe it or not, and we're going to focus on another passion of mine politics. Real quick though. I should thank all of you that listened to last week's direct message and actually took it into action. You guys are calling out the bullshit artists on every social media platform like I've never seen before. As I said last week, when you guys are engaged, we can focus on other things and not just have the same conversation over and over. Uh, I've really only been intimately involved in this conversation for a couple of weeks fighting the lies. It's not only exhausting, but it has also affected a couple of my friendships. Uh, I really do think that part of the plan by these people is to tire out the good guys and to giving up your part in this debate is beyond crucial.

Speaker 1:          00:43          But enough of that. Let's talk politics. I was at the gop debate at the Reagan Library last week. I've never been to one of these things before and I really had no idea what to expect behind the scenes. We had a booth in the spin room right alongside CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News. The fact that they call it the spin room really tells you all you need to know about this thing. This is where campaign people and candidates go to spin their message. I went to the truth room next door, but nobody was there. Weird, Huh? We were able to snag surrogates from pretty much every candidate except for Carly Fiorina and Donald trump because neither of them sent any reps to the floor. I even got to ask John a question about gay marriage and Scott Walker, a question about money in politics. Come to think of it. Maybe that's what caused him to drop out of the race earlier this week.

Speaker 1:          01:24          What I realized by being on the inside of all this is that there are some unspoken rules to how the game is played. I talked to Mike Huckabee's, campaign manager about gay marriage, and she basically just danced around it. Had I pushed her to the breaking point, I probably would have never gotten access to her again and then word would have traveled fast that I'm someone that they shouldn't talk to. So with that in mind, I tried my best to navigate all the interviews with some basic questions and then some deeper probing. I asked pretty much everyone about campaign finance and I really pushed on social issues. It was a big learning experience and we'll figure out how to engage with the candidates and the representatives in an even more incisive way beyond the spin and the sound soundbites. Hopefully as the show gets bigger, we'll get to more of the debates.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Candidates will eventually realize that I'm going to be tough but honest, uh, whether we agree or not, we're planning out our plan to go to the first democratic debate and October right now. So stay tuned for that. So for today's show, we're going to jump back into the political waters. I've got two comics I like and respect Jimmy, Darren, Felicia Michael's. I agree with them on some issues and, and, uh, disagree with them on some others. What I know more than anything else though is that comedians have a way of holding themselves to a high standard of truth. Sure will get things wrong, but the good ones have a fearless desire to say controversial things and let the chips fall where they may, as Billy Wilder said, if you're going to tell people the truth, be funny or they will kill you. I guess you could say the Comedians are guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. Just like the Jetta. Well, except comedians usually smoke a lot. All so I am with two of my favorite political comics, Felicia michaels and Jimmy Dore. Most of you guys probably recognize them from our old show, but they are new. The all new Rubin report. What do you think of this? This digs. Come on. You have a great apartment. Pretty, pretty sweet Jimmy. We have a gym. There is a camera flying around. You love the job. I do love the gym. You want. You want somebody to. Comedy is 90 percent gap.

Speaker 2:          03:14          Ninety Percent Jib and 10 percent eyebrow raising.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Ah. All right. Well then we're in good shape. So what I wanted to start, we're going to do all that was good. That was good. Uh, so we're gonna do all politics. All right, let's go see. Brought you guys on for politics. I know you guys love politics. So unfortunately we have to start with Donald Trump. I hate that we have to start this way, but I feel that we do because this is the thing that has just consumed everything. So, uh, I guess I'll just open it sort of evenly. What do you make of this trump?

Speaker 3:          03:46          You know, the thing that irritates me most about Donald Trump is how all my liberal friends are freaking out. You know what I mean? They're always going to get his hands on the button. All that kind of red recognition would you not up. The only way he's gonna get his hands on the button is if that's what his wife calls his penis.

Speaker 1:          04:03          It's just so crazy to become the president. You have no fears that this actually could be legit.

Speaker 3:          04:08          Well, I, I think anything is possible. I hope he doesn't become president and I mean it's scary. The people that are attracted to him, that scares me, you know that he gives a voice to that. That's frightening.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Yeah. So we'll get to those people in a second because I do want to talk about them. But the. Do you think this thing is real? I've been saying for mines, I think he's going to do three debates and we've already done two, but I think he's going to get to three. He's still going to be peaking in the, in the rankings. And then he's going to say I moved the dial. I'm out. And then he's gonna be the attack dog for whoever the nominee is that, that's my basic prediction. Do you think this is real?

Speaker 2:          04:45          Well, I'll say what you want about Donald Trump. He does make the racism run on time. Uh, what I do actually enjoy listening to Donald Trump speaks just because every once in a while you know, I'm in the mood to watch a Hitler documentary, but I want to hear it delivered by Gary Busey. So that's why I'm really, it's part Hitler par. Gary Busey, that Kinda, that Kinda works. Donald trump. I predicted he would go away. He doesn't really want to be president, he doesn't want you running, do anything. He doesn't want to have to read up on anything. He doesn't want to have to learn anything. He doesn't want to have to. But um,

Speaker 1:          05:19          so is that, is that the craziest part of this? Because did you see about a week ago he was on this radio show and he asked him the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah, that anyone that knows anything about world politics, anything, you'd have to know a lot to know that these are very different groups. One is in Gaza, one is in Lebanon and Syria, and he made it sound like it was a Gotcha question. What does that, the genius of him that every, he turns everything into it. You see what the media is you have to be. Is that the real genius of that? That's

Speaker 3:          05:46          not the genius thing of Donald Trump would carry the gene, but here's the thing. I would think the average American doesn't know the difference between those two factions. And it's complicated and everything's intertwined. It's not a Gotcha question. Anyone who's running for office should know those answers and the fact that he can just keep going at it and going at it and not taking any responsibility for what he doesn't know. That's frightening, you know, and that people don't call them out more.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Right. So, all right, so let's talk about the people that you mentioned, these people that are digging this, because I know you, you rant and rave about politics all the time. You hate the system, right? I, I hate the system and what I think people are attracted to is that he's calling the system out on their bullshit. So should we at least grant him that much that he has. You know, when in the first debate when he said, well, I donated money to Hillary. So she showed up to my, uh, my wedding, like, should, we should give them a little credit on that kind of thing, right?

Speaker 2:          06:42          Yes. He gets a, a little, a little credit on that, but you will say what the genius of Donald Trump is, is that the geniuses that he knows, it'll appeal to people who are not geniuses. Right? Right. So that's, she's not appealing to smart people, just like Ben Carson. Right. So Ben Carson also butts butts. I respect Ben Carson more than I. I do Donald Trump and I don't respect respect Ben Carson and. All right, well there you go. So trump's in negative territory. Yeah. So I mean, so what he's doing is he's gaining more support. Ben Carson, I ironically with racists but not getting support with other neurosurgeons. Isn't that interesting?

Speaker 1:          07:18          Well, right. Well first off, just Ben Carson real quick. I mean, can a neurosurgeon not believe in evolution? Don't. Wouldn't that be a warrant to take your license away?

Speaker 3:          07:28          The stuff that he says, he said a couple of weeks ago that the number one killer of African Americans are abortions. And when he said that, I literally was like our cops giving abortions and crazy. It's so insane.

Speaker 1:          07:43          What do we do with this whole group? I just said in the intro to this thing that I went to the gop debate. I talked to a couple of these guys. I think casick is sorta a decent guy. I think Marco Rubio is at least in the right line of work, even if I disagree with him on a lot of stuff, but what do you think about trump's place in this? It seems to me they all seem like children that can't get the attention of their dad, you know, he seems to be dead. That's getting all the attention and the kids can't.

Speaker 2:          08:08          Well, let's go back to his supporters. Donald Trump's. I mean, I'm there for instance, women are, it's like when he, he said Carly Fiorina's face, you can't have that face. And then his poll numbers went up with women who hate themselves. Yeah. So that's really what's. And so, and a lot of people don't say the mainstream news media won't call him racist. They'll say his controversial comments on immigration, uh, and they won't call them fascist, which is exactly what this is, what it looks like, right? So they're charismatic, they're popular, they demonize the immigrants and the people with no money and no power as being the problem right there over overly nativist are naturally strong. I'm military, so he's, he's got all those 14 hallmark and misogyny is a big and fascist, uh, regimes, right? And in their culture and he's pushing them aside, jainism. Right. And I don't know if that's a word and that sounded like a word. So it's amazing. So what we can say, I'll say it here and I say it on my show, that, that this is what fashion that people go, well, how did Hitler happen? Well, he gave a good speech. He didn't have to appeal to that many people and that's exactly what Donald Trump is.

Speaker 1:          09:17          So that really is. So this is just a show, right? Like to me this is the ultimate reality show. Is that at the end of the day, is that really what's happened?

Speaker 3:          09:24          Yes. I'm sorry. The only thing I want to say about when I watched Donald Trump is the makeup that he has on his face and I'm being completely serious. He's had three baby mamas. They all are all gorgeous women that know how to apply makeup and the fact that he doesn't turn to his wife or one of the former baby mamas and go, do you think this is too much orange? Too much wine under the ice says to me, this is a person that doesn't give a shit about anyone else's opinion or doesn't care. No, I'm serious, really serious. To me as, as a, as a silly woman that I am, I'm all like, there's something wrong with that guy that he can't turn to his woman and say, what do you think? What's going to be able to do that with any subject?

Speaker 2:          10:03          He can't turn to his woman because she, you know, his women are anchor wives.

Speaker 1:          10:08          Last thought I'd him. I mean, is there something really psychologically sort of void in someone that's answer to everything is they love me and I'm going to show you why

Speaker 2:          10:19          I look forward to Donald Trump's next speech where he called another group of people rapists and then ends up with. But they love it,

Speaker 1:          10:25          but they love. Yeah, exactly. Um, alright, so let's move on to the other one, which the other big one, which is Hillary and to me it seems like Hillary is running, I think the worst campaign probably in modern history and forget the email thing and the, you know, inaccessibility of the press. There seems to be just no sort of joy or humanity or sense of who she is or any of that stuff. Are you guys with me on that? What, what do you think about the campaign itself?

Speaker 2:          10:53          You are correct, Dave. It is horrible. She's at the beginning of the summer she said that, uh, nobody stands up for progressive values a stronger than she does. And then just the other day she said, Hey, I'm a centrist. She's bragging that she's, that's what's wrong with the countries knucklehead is that the center has moved to the right. So now when you say you're a centrist, you're actually a Republican from the nineties. Right. Okay. And that's the problem. So that's why Bernie Sanders had such traction and that's why she's doing such a bad job. But I will say that the email thing, it just goes to prove you because they did, they just came out and said that there was, if you don't commit a crime, it will haunt you.

Speaker 1:          11:30          Okay. So they've said. So I guess the State Department has said that she actually didn't send any classified emails. I don't know what to believe at this point, but to me the whole thing is sort of nonsensical because one day we're just going to have a point where the politicians just won't use email or they won't use any electronic communication and they're going to do all their bad shit by just talking to people. You know what I mean? Like, so to make it about the emails itself is sort of, it's, it's the, uh, it's the wound, not really what's, what's the underlying problem?

Speaker 3:          11:58          I don't think necessarily that she's running a terrible campaign. It could be a lot better. I think when we were talking earlier in the green room and you were saying, what does she stand for? I thought that was a great point because no one knows what does she specifically stand for. You know what I mean? We know. Yeah. Yeah. But how's that Democrats? But how is that possible? There's one thing where you were like, what is Hillary? Like, you can't name one thing that she likes. Right?

Speaker 1:          12:21          So, so I think you generally, you basically like her, right? Like

Speaker 3:          12:23          I do like, and I was telling him earlier, I have a picture of the Gig 15 years ago of Hillary and me and the backstage and I'm like, I just want her to be president for that picture. I mean that's a funny answer to the seriousness of the question. The thing is she's had so much bad news over the past two or three months on headlines about Bengazi all the time about those emails and it's just insane how much people in America don't want its establishment candidates. And that's the problem with her is she's too establishment, you know? That's why Donald Trump is doing good. That's why Bernie Sanders is doing good. People want something different.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Yeah. So I want to get to Bernie in a sec, but I think you hit on something with the, with the establishment and the media. It seems to me that the media loves trump because they, because of what we said earlier this off the prompter thing, hillary is completely scripted and I also think the media is sort of digging the fact that Hillary has been around for so long and it's, she's always had this back and forth with the media and I think they love just attacking her that in no way as a defense of her, but how much is just that the media just loves a narrative and now it's like we're going to take down this woman.

Speaker 2:          13:32          Yes, that is exactly what you know. And, and, uh, not that I want to defend Hillary Clinton, but to be, to, you have to in this situation because the New York Times just had like a fricken vendetta against her over these and the law. There was nothing. By the way, you talk about email Hank Paulson, who was the secretary of the treasury when everything went belly up, right when the whole thing cratered, he never even used the males. Right? And that that's my booze email. Right? So that's what your point is, is like, well, let's make a bigger deal out of her emails and no one will put anything in an email that's important.

Speaker 1:          14:05          Right? And by the way, we know that even when you lie under oath, we've talked about this a thousand times, like James Clapper, who was the head of the CIA and they, they asked him, are we doing this mass data collection? And he said not wittingly as he was scratching the top of his head, because that's where you scratch when you're in your lie. So we know that even when you lie, right, like they're not going to really do anything.

Speaker 3:          14:25          It makes me laugh because pottery barn does mass data collection mean everybody does.

Speaker 1:          14:30          They know what you, what you have in your kitchen.

Speaker 3:          14:31          They do know what I have in mind.

Speaker 1:          14:33          Yeah. Alright. So let's move on to Bernie because this is the one that I think we should be talking about more. And I've been trying to talk about him more. Uh, I think he's talking about the right things. Income inequality, which is a huge problem. He's talking about money and politics, which nobody's talking about. As I told you guys earlier, I went to the gop debate. I literally think I might've been only person that asked anyone in that room about money in politics. I asked Scott Walker. He went out of the race two days later. I mean, that tells you something.

Speaker 2:          14:59          So that goes back to your earlier question about Donald Trump deserves credit for bringing up this issue. Yes, he does expose the cravenness and the and the emptiness of the political process, right? Or the, I don't know, the complete corruption of the political process, but then no reporter ever says, Hey, what's your plan to fix that? Nobody ever says, hey, that was great. That way. You showed everybody how you buy all these guys on stage. What's your plan to fix that? Right. And he doesn't know. So he's also at the same time revealing the corruption in the political process. He's revealing the corruption and the news media. Right? So the news, me, Chuck Todd had him on and he asked them the Muslim question, right? And he started out, this was just Sunday, and he said, uh, you know, you say that you don't have to respond to everybody who says something and I agree with you on that.

Speaker 2:          15:44          That's how he started his question. So he just interrupt. Chuck Todd just interviewed Donald Trump after the biggest gap that you could ever imagine, right? Some guy says, let's call it let's round up Muslims. And by the way, the president of Muslim and trump says yes to both of them. Chuck Todd, the number one political reporter in America has them on the show, doesn't lay a fucking glove on them or you can delay. And then he's like, well, thanks for having Donald Trump. Says it was a pleasure and didn't know what Chuck Todd says. You Bet. Yeah, that's what he said. So that's what's wrong with the. And if you go, why? Why, why do we have the biggest income disparities since the gilded age? Why do we only have five major media corporations in America when they used to be 50 and 1980? Why can't we get the straight dope? Why does when we nationalize the banks, nobody calls it that and that's because they're all bought and paid for by the same people. Read manufacturing because.

Speaker 1:          16:32          All right, so I think your answer, the original question was what about Bernie? And I think it got there in a long way because he is talking about those things. So basically do you think that the media just has a vested interest in really not showing him? So for example, the other day a Bernie and trump were both giving speeches at the same time. And even MSNBC, which you'd think would be, you know, they're supposed to lean forward or I guess they did until two months ago. Now I don't know that they lean backwards or I'm not sure, but even they were covering trump instead of covering Bernie. So can it. Can an outsider like Bernie ever really win

Speaker 3:          17:07          if he is a little bit more fun? I'm seriously the answer why people love trump because he's fun. You can make fun of them. It doesn't hurt his feelings, you know, and he is out of the box. But when it comes to Bernie like they, they're going to have to start putting him on the tonight show, drinking wine with a, you know?

Speaker 1:          17:26          Yeah. Yeah. Well I saw, I did a promo. He did a promo for the nightly show and he said on fleek, which you've ever heard Bernie Sanders say on fleek, it was actually pretty funny. Um, but yes. So how much of that is it that he's the outsider guy so he should be getting the Obama, the first time Obama went around, he should be getting that excitement. But, but Bernie himself, he's a 70 something year old white guy from. He's not that exciting and sadly that comb, right? Like, you should shave the sides, but you don't really like how much is just that, that maybe his person sadly in, in 2015 in America that his personality doesn't match up in the way we want to vote for somebody. The way his rhetoric, which I think a lot of people agree with.

Speaker 2:          18:10          You know, it's funny that he, he, he's the big outsider on the left and trump is the big outsider on the right. And one of them spend zero time on their hair and one of them here I would like to ask Donald Trump, does he have a long form birth certificate for that fucking hairpiece anyway, so that thing definitely was not born in America. No one thing he talked about what you know. So even even msnbc wasn't covering Bernie, right? Well let's. Because Msnbc is not a liberal corporation, they're a corporation by the way, through the whole Iraq war. MSNBC was owned by General Electric, which is a huge defense contractor. So the lefties were left getting their antiwar message from a fucking defense contractor, which is why they fired, filled down to you because he was against the war and they kept grits. Matthews. And then they also just fired Ed Schultz because he's against the tpt and comcast is all for the dpt. So I said, I already said this, but they're not liberal. As soon as Rachel maddow says something that costs comcast's money, they will fire her. And it's just an embarrassment to her that they haven't. Well, for the record or a has told me, I can say anything I want. It's all a fencer. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. I mean it shouldn't be the fairest went to them and if you watch the channel like I do, you see that they're corporatists they're not. Especially Chris Hayes. He's couldn't be worse.

Speaker 1:          19:21          Yeah. All right, so my last thought on this is does he have any chance? Does Bernie have any chance? My, my feeling is no. Unfortunately, and I know people are going to give me shit for saying that because if they'll, they'll say to me, if you say no, that causes people to get depressed about it and then they're not gonna vote. I just unfortunately I think that it's very clear to me that the party is going to not going to back him. They simply will not back him and that's why people are talking about Biden because I think hillary probably will flame out and they're gonna go with Biden and it's like you guys are the big party that hosts lot of minorities and women and everything else and we're going to pick the VP who. Just another old white guy.

Speaker 2:          19:55          Why Dante embrace Martin is because he is an independent and he railed so hard against both Democrats.

Speaker 1:          20:01          I think they genuinely think he won't win. I think he, they think he can't, that are liberal for someone that far on the left from the northeast, just can't win the middle of the country.

Speaker 2:          20:11          Uh, I think it bring us home. No, I, I think the reason why the Democratic Party hasn't rallied around Bernie is because the, he's not in bed with the big money donors. And so they read the Democratic Party no longer responds to their voters. They only respond to their donors. And so their donors are telling them, get rid of this guy, right? We got to get rid of that guy somehow. They don't want the donors want nothing to do with Bernie because they can't control them. Just like the donors don't want anything to do with Donald Trump because they can't control him. So in that sense, they're very much alike. And that's exactly what's happening. We do live in a banana republic, like we don't really have a responsible government. I mean, the Sandy Hook taught us anything. Ninety percent of the people in America wanted some kind of gun legislation and we didn't get it. So I'll no longer do our representatives represent our interests. They only represent the donors and that's why Bernie is winning. And that's why he gets 30,000 people when he shows up to speak.

Speaker 1:          20:59          That's how you have to segment. All right? So how do you guys think we can make the debates better? Because I've watched both of them, as I said, I went to the last one. Uh, I tweeted on the first debate that technically these things have not even been debate. A debate is where they present an idea and then two or more people go back and forth on these same ideas. But basically what we've seen is moderators ask people questions catered to them so that they can talk about their things. So for example, a jake tapper would focus with Lindsey Graham on foreign policy because he's a foreign policy guy, right? That's not a debate. That's just sort of lobbying up softball. So what do you think we can do to make these things better?

Speaker 3:          21:38          I'm back to let's make it fun and entertaining and do it like the voice comes on and you got three minutes to talk. Everyone. Wolf Blitzer, they all have their back to them and as soon as he says one thing that they like, they turn around and he's in.

Speaker 1:          21:52          That's actually not. So you mask the voices, right? Because otherwise they'll know. Oh, that's true. That's just not the worst idea I've ever heard. I'm just saying,

Speaker 2:          22:00          uh, the last debate which was on CNN was fantastic because they, instead of getting a journalist to moderate it, they hired Eddie Haskell. He just kept trying to forgive anybody to pick fights with each other. Now Donald Trump said that you were ugly. What do you want to say to him?

Speaker 1:          22:17          So you're not jake tapper guys that what you're telling me?

Speaker 2:          22:19          No, that was the, that was probably the worst. By the way, Jake Tapper, uh, he just announced that they're going to be start doing fact checking of politicians with the factcheck.org because apparently at cnn they don't know how to do that, so they had to hire an outside organization to teach them how to fact check at CNN. Nobody, I'm jake tapper. Staff really knows what they're doing. So what that is and why there was no real questions and why there was no followup. There was no candy Crowley moment at this debate where they corrected carly Fiorina for being a crazy person and saying blatant lies about planned parenthood. What they reason they don't do that because they don't want to alienate any of the viewers that like these people. So what they'll do is they say, hey, Jeb Bush said this, Donald Trump said that. What do you want to say to him? Instead of saying, Hey, the facts are this, and you said this, how do you don't do that? So they're not doing journalism. They're doing Eddie Haskell, ISM and they're trying to get people to pick fights with each other.

Speaker 3:          23:14          Yeah, I do agree with you, but on the other hand, that question needed to be asked to Carla feared the quest, the face thing that needed to be asked about trump saying, you know, calling her out on her looks or whatever. I mean, that is so terrible that it needed to be at.

Speaker 1:          23:28          So I agree with you. It had to be addressed because it was just another absurdly misogynistic thing that trump did, but interestingly doesn't that then get more of the play the next day then anything that might be more important such as foreign policy or immigration. I mean really can you think of any headline the next day that was related to policy?

Speaker 3:          23:49          Important things, but it's important how a person who is running for president is treating the women of this country. Yeah, that totally is as important. Okay.

Speaker 2:          23:58          I totally, and the GLP did make it clear that they welcome all women into the gop. Even the ones who make Donald Trump wins.

Speaker 1:          24:07          All right, so we haven't had a democratic debate yet where you have one in a couple of weeks in Vegas, right? As I said that about Bernie segment, you know the Democrats were supposed to be the big party. That's what everyone says. They're supposed to be the big party, but they've really only got two people running for all intents and purposes. Right? Hillary and Bernie, and then there's Jim Webb and and o'malley. Well, but, but it's really only two people that everyone's talking about. So should we give the Republicans a little credit for at least they have 20 clowns in there, clown car while in the democratic clown car. There's really only two people.

Speaker 2:          24:38          Well, Martin O'malley did come out last week with a bold proposal. He said, raise the age of gun ownership to 21 years old, and everybody responded by saying who the fuck?

Speaker 1:          24:48          But that's my point. You know what? I'm going to call us, call something crazy here. I think that that guy who's polling at negative 60, that nobody knows who he is. I think he has a little bit of a chance here because I think they're all going to get equal footing and people are so sick of Hillary on the debates. Yeah, and I think I, I think he'd bring him, he's a good looking, middle aged guy and I and I think he's a pretty decent guy and I think people are suddenly going to go, who the hell is this guy?

Speaker 2:          25:11          The irony is that it was Howard Dean who, whose idea was to limit the number of democratic debates because he saw what happened with all the Republican debates last time and how they ate each other and how it was just a clown show and so we didn't want that to happen with the Democrat, so they made them limit them, but now we realized, hey, there's actually going to be a real debate now so maybe we should do more of these because this is just free advertising for the Republican Party and we're not getting ready for the Democrats and people still don't know where Bernie Sanders is.

Speaker 1:          25:38          Right? So what can, what can we do? We got the election is over a year away, right? What can we do to make these debates better? Like as the people, like do we have to demand that they have to be done on pbs? I mean they were done, I don't know if there's going to be any of this upcoming year, but for years ago some of them were done at pbs. I mean something. How do we get it out of the Gotcha thing out of the. Does carly have a wrinkle

Speaker 3:          26:01          on a face now? What? The answer for that as. I mean it is going to be interesting to finally see Bernie and Hillary go at it, you know, but how do you make it more interesting and maybe they need to have someone like at the Oscars who did the little clips always beforehand. You know what I mean? To billy crystal come in and write. I don't know or I mean what do you.

Speaker 2:          26:23          It used to be that the League of women voters used to organize the baits and other people use it and then they got smart and they were like, hey, we can't let other people choose. The people are going to ask us questions. We want to control everything. So they created this presidential commission on debates and now so now there isn't any more. We League of women, so it's all controlling everything, which is why they suck, right? So somebody has to stand up like maybe women or some other big organizations say, hey, we want to have our own debate, like the Naacp members saying we're going to have our own debate at our thing and we were inviting people and then it'll be telling who doesn't show up. Right. So that's the way they should do it.

Speaker 1:          27:00          Unfortunately we know that the parties, the parties won't back that they will because they have. But Bernie Sanders is show up. He'll show up and he'll do it a little bit. Maybe that would be good. Alright. So let's move on to what I think was the big elephant in the room or unfortunately not. Come on. Jimmy Dore, a giant of it. The money in politics thing. It is, seems pretty obvious to me that we have a couple like real issues in America right now. The money in politics that's ruined our political system. We've got, you know, political correctness run amok, but nobody talked about money in politics. As I said before, I think I might've been the only person to ask them a question on this. Why do we not talk? We did talk about it wasn't near Mccain Feingold thing 10 years ago. We used to sorta talk about it every now and again. Nobody talks about it now. Right?

Speaker 3:          27:45          Talk about it. I don't understand how we allow people to run for president as a candidate when they still owe money from the last time they tried.

Speaker 1:          27:55          Literally. I think Hillary might be in debt still from the previous thing.

Speaker 3:          27:58          If you owe money from the last time you didn't get elected done, you can't run this time until you've paid everybody off. It is striking in outrageous at people don't mention it or talk about it. I think it's terrible. I mean it's. That's the only answer. I mean, what, how do you fix that though? How do you fix that?

Speaker 1:          28:14          Well, I did notice that when I asked some of the campaign people this and even when I asked Scott Walker, they just, they just link a couple of words to get there to put it, to make a sentence and then you move on because they know they're not going to be asked this and they know no one cares. That's what I really realized that when I asked them that there was a sense of that, that stupid question like nobody cares about that. Asked me the. Asked me that question, you know, so, so what do we do about that?

Speaker 2:          28:38          You know, we a wolf-pack.com, Dave. That's how we, there's a bunch of orders. That's the organization I'm a part of that helps get money out of politics and what you have to do is you have to pass a constitutional amendment right to get money out of politics. Hillary Clinton, by the way, you said she's in favor of it, so we don't. I will. That'll be, that's good to hear. Also, the Senate also in the United States Congress also passed a resolution to open debate on this. So that's a good thing. And three states has since we've been trying to push this, I've already passed the California being one of them, Illinois and I think we have a New Hampshire, Vermont. Uh, so that's what you need to do. You need to get the states, you have to go at the state level. They have much less controlled for whatever reason on the state capital. Sure. So we can make an. So that's my big solution. We have to get money and you can't fix anything. Why are we still debate in climate change? Because big money, right? Why are we still debating? Should we drill in the Arctic because of big money? I. Why are we still bombing nonstop for 30 years in the middle of the big money?

Speaker 1:          29:38          So is that. So that's really the crux of that. The reason we can't get the public to be ginned up enough to care is because they're getting their information from the very people who are paying for the operation to keep them dumb.

Speaker 2:          29:52          The criminals bought the watchdog, right? The watch dog used to be a, the Walter cronkite and 60 minutes and then they got smart and I said, hey, let's just buy them. And they bought them and so now the guys who are working for the people are supposed to be exposing, so that's why they are literally working. So that's how you go, well, how do we, how do we get it into a rack war that lasted? That's how you get it because the people are working for the defense contractors. They're supposed to be exposing defense contractors and they're not. That's what,

Speaker 3:          30:19          yeah, there's a reality where it will ever turn around.

Speaker 2:          30:22          Uh, yes. I think if we get money out of politics. And so. So it happened before, right? So Teddy Roosevelt came along and he did the antitrust legislation, right? They used to call them trust back then because they would take. Anyway, that was the. So now that's what we need. We need him and then we need FDR. FDR stood up and said, never before in the history of America has the money. People have been more organized in their hatred for one candidate, and I welcome their hatred. Could you imagine,

Speaker 1:          30:47          can you imagine anyone, anyone saying that today? Besides Bernie Sanders? Right? So you, I had a little inspiration from you first because it sounded like it could happen, but then I just thought, well, if we get hillary is president or let's say we get Jeb Bush. Pretty sure they're not making that speech. I think we're going to have a revolution. If that happens, we may. Well never have. I'm going to buy a gun. Yeah. All right. So let's, uh, let's talk about religion and politics because then, because that's the other big one. And look a Guy Mike Huckabee's up there. This is a guy that the week before was defending Kim Davis and everyone knows about Kim Davis and not giving the marriage licenses to gay people. And Mike Huckabee actually defended her by saying you shouldn't, you shouldn't, you know, partake in the law that you don't believe is moral. That is the most ridiculous anti American thing you could possibly do. It shows that profound lack of understanding of how government works. At our constitution and all that. So, but there's, there's him, there's crews, there's Santorum and these guys. And even now a Ben Carson, what do we do about this conversation? Religion should have nothing. We have separation of church and state. I think. What, what do we do about it?

Speaker 3:          31:55          Well, I was googling this topic matter earlier and I saw that the boy scouts don't allow atheists in the boy scouts. Right? And I was thinking it's people don't want to trust other people who aren't religious or can pretend to be religious, you know, with decisions that are going to impact them. I kind of get it. But on the other hand, have you ever been around? I have aunts that are so religious, they are evil, you know? Has there ever been around people like that, you know? Uh, I went to Catholic school, right? That's what you and, and when I look at the Republican, a spectrum out there, the candidates, I'm like, oh my God, these people evil. I mean, if, if you have blinders like this about religious and how everyone has to follow the same religion or the same thing that you're doing, I mean that is just as bad as someone who has a void of it and I know that

Speaker 1:          32:56          just as bad as those horrible, a secular values. I know. It's just as equally horrible. Wow. What is this? Is this the irony of. Is this the irony of Republicans that they say they want small government, right? Yes. They say they want some other way and then at the same time they keep jamming. [inaudible] everyone. I didn't live those notes.

Speaker 2:          33:16          Yeah, because you said your question is how do we get religion out of government in my whole thing is they should be made to go to an religious. People should have to take an irony class. Right? Right. Yep. Kim Davis, who's thrice divorced, making a religious stand for the sanctity of marriage, that's, you know, and, and now the oath keepers have promised to defend her and they don't want to lock her up again. She's so grateful. She promised to marry three or four of them. So. And then they played that song right through it with a tiger and so when she came out and she and she got in trouble for that because they didn't want her to. Survivor doesn't want to use that song. But she said she liked that song so much. She's going to play it at our next three weddings. The point is day.

Speaker 1:          33:54          I have a lot of these jokes. She ruined rocky for me. It's just so. But what about Huckabee? So someone like Huckabee, who's supposedly like, to me this is, this is proof that he's not running for president and he's running to run the Christian, right? Yes. He. And I wish people would just say that as I wish almost he could say that and he could say, you know what, I'm up on this stage because I do control or at least want to control a portion of this country and I want to keep controlling it. And then we can be honest about it. And then he would disappear when he gets, when the is go further. But he's not really running for president. Right? Isn't he running his own? That degree of power?

Speaker 2:          34:32          I think you're very perceptive. Dave Bliss is. I think why you have your own show once in a while and yes, that is exactly what he's doing. He's running to get speaking fees. He's running to be the biggest Christian onstage. So non whoever does become president. He's like the Billy Graham. They have to come through him to get to the religious right that they're going to need. So it's all that. He's the biggest charlatan of all of them because at least Donald Trump who is a big asshole won't take that extra step of putting the cross on his sleeve like, like a pocket he was and how it can be as complete phony.

Speaker 1:          35:03          Right? And trump. Not that I ever wanted to defend trump, but you know, they asked trump about the gay marriage thing and he said, look, the Supreme Court made a decision. I, I would have to abide by the Supreme Court. That shows a better understanding of how government works. Then Santorum or Huckabee, who want you to just pick which laws can you imagine if we could all just pick. Well, I'm not going to pay taxes morally. I don't think I should have. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          35:22          yeah. Separate but equal. So that means we can just ignore it. No, that's not that sounds right.

Speaker 3:          35:26          But I do like what you're saying about he's running to get a speaking engagement, but then the reality is how much money is he spending to try to run for president versus how much you would actually ever make

Speaker 1:          35:38          as a space spending his own money. Right? So he's not. Yeah, it's not his. And ultimately it's not about the speaking money per se, as much as just the influence that he will just run the Christian, right? Like be the next billy Graham or somebody. But I want to backup the saying that you said early about this, this atheist thing, because the first two episodes of the show we had Sam Harris, who's probably the most outspoken atheist and Carrie Santa Maria. Uh, also an atheist. And we talked a little bit about, I'm atheist and politics and every poll shows that people would never vote for an atheist. People hate atheist. Why are we so afraid of secularism? I think this is sort of what you were saying before. Why are we afraid of people that would, that would base their decisions on the law of the land and not the imaginary.

Speaker 3:          36:22          I think it's because everyone has this like ultimate fantasy of the. You get to be president. Something terrible goes down somewhere. He has his finger on the button, right? Like what? What's going to happen? You want to know that your president is going to be in that dark space in his room before he asked to make some terrible decision like, dear God, you want the comfort of knowing it's a whole facade. It's a fake, but you don't want that. You know what I mean? You don't want someone that's just like this is the line, the column of good things that'll happen. This is the column of bad things I think, because people want to be able to hang hope on a president and, and as weird as it sounds, I think what he is, you don't hang on.

Speaker 1:          37:00          Sorry, I'm sorry for the fact that I think it's the same thing with gay people. Uh, people were against gay marriage until they knew a gay person and I think people are afraid of atheists until they known atheist. I was against gay marriage to like hockey married. I'm now, I'm okay there. But um, what do you think about it? That's what I really think it is. Yeah. People just don't know atheists and they think, well, they're dying. In fact, they kind of be quitting with devil worshipers know. It's like, no, there are no worshiping nothing, which is exactly why I've been saying on the show repeatedly. Yeah, the atheist have to come out. I think the atheist movement should do that. The most important thing that gay people ever did was come out. And I think that that's what's next for atheism. Maybe we should start calling ourselves something else.

Speaker 1:          37:42          Like, I like the term non theist. Yeah, I like that. It sounds better. It doesn't. It's like I'm not into the shift. Right, but don't you hate that you even have to associate with the term doesn't that in itself, it's like then you're in the club, what club would, why me kind of thing. Yes and that. Yes, and I don't agree that there is such a thing as militant atheism. I don't, I don't agree. That's like saying you're a militant, logical person. I will apply logic to every situation. You know, all these atheists that are getting rallies together to hurt people. It's just not happening. Not. All right, well that's a perfect segue to the next thing I want to talk about, which is the PC culture that we seem to live in. So I have two comedians. This is our job more than anything else is to, is to get to that line and figure out where it is and push it. Maybe cross it every now and again. I think we live in a very bizarre time where we have trigger warnings now in these social justice warriors and every time anyone says anything, you say something about women they don't like, they they. You're now, you hate women. You say something about any minority you don't like or you say anything about gay people. You automatically hate all of them. That we automatically jumped to the conclusion that it's based in racism or xenophobia. Especially for Comedians. This is a seriously dangerous slope, right?

Speaker 2:          38:54          He knows the worst with that. The Puerto Ricans. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          39:03          I don't think it's so much about pc culture. I just think everyone has a knee jerk reaction. People are like this now. Why are people like this now? Everyone is so angry and no one just wants to enjoy jokes or have fun anymore. Every. Everything has to be a purpose. Like now they have the new normal Barbie. It's a Barbie doll that has stretch marks and pimples, unnormal Barbie and I just, you know, why can't people just have toys and not reading a million things? Why does everything have to have a 100 percent purpose or you know what I mean? Be without any humor or anything.

Speaker 1:          39:36          Do you think that that actually takes something very special away from childhood that, you know, I played with Gi Joe or human or transformers and the imagination, I've got to use my imagination to make up this world and you know, figure out things that I thought and whatever, where now you're going to make everything so realistic for these kids and have them have every fear and everything that might upset them, but you're going to send a bunch of robots and by the way, they're drugged, right? They're all on every drug known to man because of, you know, whatever, that we're going to send them out into a world drugged and afraid of everything. That's pretty dangerous combination. Right.

Speaker 2:          40:09          You know, giving back to the PC thing, you are correct that some, some people are to knee jerk and cry a racism or whatever, antisemitism. But there are, there is racism and there is. So that's the thing. That's where it's like murky right here, like, well I don't want to get into a point where we just shout so now because the right wing does a thing where they shop every time there actually is racism. They go, oh, you're just too PC. No, that's not being too pc.

Speaker 1:          40:36          Right. So that, for example, that would be when the right will say that Christians are actually the most under attack in America,

Speaker 2:          40:42          which is of course completely or the Christian is going to have their day in America, Dave, someday they're going to have a guy maybe in the White House to run things. So yes. You know, the thing that Jerry Seinfeld rights for that came up with, he was complaining about pc culture on campus. I haven't in colleges in a year but I mean in a couple of years, but I noticed when I used to play colleges that the higher their tuition, the more freedom I got to say whatever I wanted. And it was interesting. Yeah. The, so the lower the tuition, you know, I don't know if the DM or the kids or whatever. I don't know. I went to a shoe that's very politically incorrect. Yeah, I know that's politically incorrect. So I went to a suny school and I'm a dumb guy so I can say that and uh, uh, don't look up where I went. Went to jail. The point is it sucked. George Bush went there. Well, that whole thing. Trigger war. Yes, it's, I, when I first for, of course dancer, there's going to be someone who reads something and it's going to fuck them up. Will you can't pass a law about it, you know, that's their own problem they have to deal with. Do you know when I hear what I hear a car horns, I freak out. I can't pass a law that says nobody can beat their horn anymore.

Speaker 1:          41:43          Right? So is the bigger fear. I used to fear that the first amendment would disappear, that the government would take our free speech. But what I'm starting to fear now, although I am no big fan of the government in any capacity, what I'm starting to fear now is that ultimately we're just going to take our freedoms away. We're going to get so afraid of saying anything and I see this happen all the time. Now I get emails, not that I'm the most politically incorrect person there is, but I get emails now. People saying that I'm saying things that they wish they could say and it seems to me that people are censoring themselves already, so I fear that I fear the self censorship because of all this more than I fear that the government's going to come in and take away our right to free speech. Do you. Where do you. Where do you fall on that?

Speaker 3:          42:24          All? I want to say this. I was just working vegas last weekend. There was one set where I was having. It was a little bit, the crowd was tight and a guy was sitting with his arms crossed and I for 15 years I've always said, oh, you know our endoscopes. Do you want to let them go? Or you know, three guys sitting, you guys where's the girls and all that were that, you know, that is totally hacky, but it Kinda gets the crowd, you know, going when you're in the mood. But now people aren't buying into those jokes and it was a realization of wow, people really rpc, but it's a good thing. So I think there is a legitimate reason to be pc. We're growing as people and and there are things we don't accept anymore. We don't accept racism anymore. We don't accept making jokes about gays anymore. And that's a good thing. I think the comedians that say, oh, it's too pc to pc, they might be correct, but in other words, maybe you need to change to the idea.

Speaker 1:          43:21          That's interesting because Sarah Silverman said something to that effect this week and in an interview, and I think she was directing it at Seinfeld because Seinfeld basically was saying, you know, I used to make this gay joke about a French king and his loose, you know, his hand like this and now they think it's too offensive. But I would always be on this. I don't know you to call Seinfeld. Politically incorrect. I don't know what he thinks about anything either thinks about anything.

Speaker 2:          43:43          Did you hear what he said about that cotton ball? Yeah, exactly. All right, so my, my weight, my final, but yeah, wonderful final thought about this because there's comes a time, right? Like so now we've come a long way with how gay people are treated in our society in a positive way, but there's guys who were born at a certain age, like Alec Baldwin, they grew up using gay terms as slurs and insults and then when that lizard brain gets activated, when you're angry at someone, those things come up. Right. And so Alec Baldwin got in trouble for calling a guy a cock sucking faggot. Right? But he said he called him a cock sucking bedhead because apparently cocksuckers gender neutral, but no one swears like that. No one. Nobody says a $4, swear word and then follows it up with the cartoons. Nobody goes, oh, you mother fucking farks narco. Right, right. So that's good people.

Speaker 1:          44:29          A little bit of a leash if you grew up.

Speaker 2:          44:32          Yeah. Especially if he apologizes or our lies are lies about it. Like I haven't. Baldwin did, right?

Speaker 3:          44:38          No. If he apologizes. Look, my dad said racist things when I was growing up. My Dad would never do it now, but he should get bull connor. But when I was growing up as a 27 year old man or a 30 year old man, he said stuff and my brother made would be like director and now he would never do that because everyone grows at a different rate, you know, people are learning at different ages and you know. Um. All right. So I apologize at least. So

Speaker 1:          45:05          yeah. So I thought that the, the right way to end something with comedians would be to talk about counter culture a little bit because counterculture is what standup grew out of, right? It used to be cool to fight the system. Yes. And I feel like it's not cool to fight the system anymore. You're thought of as crazy or something or something. I think it has a lot to do with that. Most comics are liberal. Most comics really, at least at the beginning, really liked Obama. So everybody would say, oh, it's tough to make jokes about this guy because he's rational and speaks clearly and he is not making all the grammatical errors that Bush was making. Um, now it's changed and I think people don't necessarily like Obama as much or at least people on the left that field that he's, you know, been more right wing. I think certainly that's what you think. But we don't have a real counterculture anymore. How do we need a Republican in office to have a true counterculture? Would that actually help the country? People have someone that I believe in, nothing that they actually stand for

Speaker 2:          46:05          the argument that would strengthen the argument has been made that Barack Obama being the head of the government right now splits the opposition because they're the people. So we should be opposing him about the indefinite detention, TPP, you know, all that stuff that Syria war with. You and I are on the same page on this. So we should. So what? By Barack Obama being the head of the government, he splits the opposition because half the people are loyalty and then the other half the people are telling the truth or wanting to push back and protest against a terror radical government are bullshit that they see in the government. And so it doesn't happen. That's exactly what's happening and that is what happened and that's why there is no counterculture. Good enough for you to pick up on it.

Speaker 1:          46:46          I get a couple every episode I get one or two bring, bring us home, bring it up.

Speaker 3:          46:50          Well, uh, I was watching Bill Maher the other night and he was of course making fun of Republicans and George Pataki was on there and it's gotten to the point where, yeah, you want to have one Republican in the mix when you're talking politics and doing the counterculture thing, all that. But even George Pataki's like, well my poverty and it's just an indication of we've just all moved to the right,

Speaker 1:          47:16          right. So maybe we do need a Republican in office to wake up the people to actually realize what's important. Yes. And, and it would at least be good for comedians. Alright. Right. On that note, I want to thank Felicia Michael's, Jimmy Dore. You can follow them. Twitter and Youtube and websites. They got all that stuff and we're going to put some of it right beneath you. And Jimmy's got a book. It's called your country's just not that into you. Yeah, they are. All books are sold everywhere. There you go. All right. Thanks for watching guys. And we will do it again next week.
