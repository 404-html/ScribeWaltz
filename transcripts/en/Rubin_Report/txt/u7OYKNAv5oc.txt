Speaker 1:          00:00:02       My goal this year with the show is to expand on even more topics we discussed as well as the people that we're talking to. Yes, we absolutely hit our stride by calling out regressive bullshit and by addressing the regressives, the tide is actually turning. People are finally standing up to their insincere attacks and realizing that liberalism is about the rights of individuals before that of the group, so if you truly believe in equality for women, then you have to defend their individual rights, whether it's to wear what they want, drive a car or marry who they choose regardless of their religious or cultural background. I said there was an awakening months ago and it's pretty undeniable right now, right? That doesn't mean we can rest though. If anything, it means we have to dig in deeper and keep calling out regressive nonsense when we see it, but as I've also said from day one, I want this show to be a place for big ideas of all kinds.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Over the course of the next few weeks, I'm going to talk to people from hugely different walks of life, conservative radio talk, show host, Larry Elder, science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer and former leader of the English Defense League, Tommy Robinson, just to name a few. We're going to go big on topics ranging from the election to science to spirituality and more. We're kicking off the year with CNN. Don Lemon. Love him or hate him. Don is one of the few people in mainstream media not afraid to say what he thinks, and he often pays for it via criticism from both sides of the aisle. Not only does he host his own nightly show, but he also reports on location from natural disasters, cohosts electoral debates, and as even forigin unlikely friendship with Glenn back along the way. I know when we see these people on tv, we have a way of thinking that they aren't even human, that they're just robots or something, but I can assure you from personal experience that with done what you see is what you get.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       We can always mark mainstream media and we absolutely should. Trust me, I've made plenty of jokes at CNNS expense. Just check my twitter feed at the same time. We should acknowledge though that there are many journalists in the mainstream media trying to do good work while online media has changed the way we get the news. I think one of the big lessons from 2015 is how online media could also be full of crap. Just because something isn't mainstream doesn't mean it doesn't push a narrative, distort facts or outright lie. As 2016 begins. Let's all continue to shed light on issues we care about. Talk about difficult topics in an honest way and see if we can make the conversations in our lives a little more enlightened.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       All right. My guest this week is the host of CNN tonight. Self proclaimed king of twitter, and one of the few guys in Cable News, not afraid to tell you what he really thinks. Don Lemon. What's going on? It's called CNN tonight with Don Lemon. Okay. Oh, with Don Lemon. With don limit. How long did you have to fight to get that in there? Not that I'm picky. Listen, it's everything is important. It all matters. Dave Rubin, how are you? I'm doing good. It actually does all matter and it's funny that you say that because that I think that's a good place to start because you have been on this upward thing forever. We've known each other for probably like four or five years now. And you did my old Sirius xm show a long time ago and, and you were, you were subbing in for a lot of people. You were jumping around show to show, but you have your own gig now. Pretty good, right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       It is pretty good. I mean, it's weird because people will say you've been on this upward trajectory, blah, blah blah. And it doesn't feel that way when you're living it. Right. I'm still the same guy. I'm still feels the same. And um, so, you know, the struggle is real, but it's great to be in prime time on a major network. I mean, you know, you kind of, it doesn't get any better than this. A show with my name on it there. I have no complaints and very. I live every moment in gratitude right now.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       Yeah. So there's, there's a lot of stuff I want it to have the first show of the year with you because you're in the thick of it, right? Like every time I turn on the news and something's going down somewhere, they send you there or you're at the studio or you're interviewing somebody. So I thought you'd be the perfect person to sort of kick the year off with. But let's get a little bit first. It wasn't the day to day operations. So you have your show at night. What's going on in the world of Don Lemon all day long?

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       Well it depends on, it depends on the day, but I mean pretty much every night I'm on the air at 10:00 PM and every night between seven and eight I have a rundown meeting and every single morning at 10:30 I have an editorial meeting and then sometimes up I try to do the network, a editorial call at nine, so it can be a very long day. And then I do radio on some mornings at seven. This is all eastern time? Yeah, about seven, seven, 15 eastern time. So it depends, if it's a day I do radio, I'm up at 6:45, 7:00 and I'm giving an editorial and the time during the morning show and then I try to read in from then and reads the papers are at my door and then uh, I try to stay awake and if I do, I do the 9:00 editorial call and then if I don't, I wake up at 10:30 for my shows, editorial call and then I'll try to go back to sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       But then sometimes other shows will call and ask me to do live shots to do something I cover the night before I'm going to cover the that night or I'll do an interview with Donald Trump or are coming to a taping like I did today with Rand Paul. It just really depends. So there's no set schedule. So sometimes I get to sleep. Other times I don't. And um, that's it. And so usually usually I'm here, I try to be, unless I don't have any sleep, the latest I'll get and it's probably like six or 6:30. But usually I try to get in about four, 4:30.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       And you're taking, you're taking naps in the. That is your office right there. I saw you at Lsu blanket. So you do take naps.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       Ouch. Just before, uh, you just before we hooked up on skype. Yeah, we connected on skype.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Be careful, be careful

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       out and buy a, you know crystal, right? I do, yeah. Crystal came in and said, hey, what are you doing? Don't go to sleep. You've got to skype with Dave Rubin and 15. I'm like, I know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I know Dave. And he'll be fine. He'll be fine. So it's funny even the way that you, you started saying hook up there and then you immediately have to hedge your bets because you're one of these people. And I want to talk about this a little later on that everything that you say becomes like this sort of hot button thing. Uh, but before we, before we delve into all that stuff, um, how much news do you actually have to consume every day? Because I know I do an interview show once a week, but I'm in the news constantly. I'm always paying attention to this stuff and on twitter and during this whole thing, and there's a certain amount of bandwidth I think, that you only have in your brain to absorb all this stuff, but you have to know sort of all the stuff that's going on all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:06:37       That's a very good point. Um, and sometimes I, can, I, can, I consume so much that I forget, right? Like, Oh yeah, I knew that. Like someone will say something and then I'll go, oh yeah, yeah, that's right. I knew like, like today I was sent out a note on Wayne Lapierre's flip flop on background checks. Yeah. Then someone else reminded me that we did it before and I'm like, Oh yeah, that's right. We did do that before. And then I looked at why he did it. So there's a, you know, he has a perfectly legitimate explanation in his head why he did it. But sometimes you just forget. So, um, what I try to do quite honestly is not to, um, I try to be informed without being inundated because you don't have to know every single thing that's going on in the world and I don't.

Speaker 2:          00:07:20       My show doesn't cover every single thing that's going on in the world. I don't do a traditional rundown new show like stack, like now this, now this, now this is pretty much a theme and it is the biggest story of the day or the hottest topic or the talker of the day. And usually we try not to do too many subjects are we try to make them all relate and we don't do a lot of stars. Like traditionally, you know, when peers was here and when Larry was here, the hours that I'm in now or like very star heavy and focused and they didn't do very well. And so we do watercooler talk, provocative conversation, have conversations that people will have at home but not necessarily on television. And it's paid off. And thank goodness our ratings are great. We're doing great and you know, we're still going.

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       Yeah. How much of that comes directly from you? Because I remember when, when you did my show way back when, whatever that was, four or five years ago, I think that same week that we met you had subbed in for joy Bihar over on Hln and I remember we were having a drink and you were saying how much you like that because it gave you a chance to sort of be yourself and get out of the kind of traditional newsman thing. So are all these decisions in terms of the format and all that, is that all coming directly from you? Well

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       shared. A lot of it comes from me and a lot of it comes from the, the team, um, our staff, the producers and our executive producer Jonathan Wall who's really great with ideas. And then I'll have ideas as well. It depends on the day. Sometimes like now you know, it's a no brainer. The president is having this big town hall with Anderson this week. He made, he did the Senate at the house. We're going to talk about guns, right? We're going to talk about a executive orders. Uh, and, and so it's pretty easy. We're going to talk about what's happening in Oregon, so sometimes it's just pretty self explanatory. It's our show. It's great to finally have a show, uh, and that I don't have to call a newscast because it's not a newscast, although when it needs to be, we can quickly become a newscast that we can give you. I can give you the 32nd or 15 second elevator pitch between one floor, biggest story of the day or biggest talkers. Otherwise it does not fit. I don't care if you're a movie star, I don't care who you are, if it's not, if it has nothing to do with the news that it's not relevant, it's not coming on the show. That simple.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       Alright. So before we get into all the meat and we're going to talk politics and guns and all that kind of stuff, uh, how did you get into this thing? Did you always want to be on TV? Did you always want to be a news guy? What, what brought little don lemon to be over at Time Warner Center right now?

Speaker 2:          00:09:53       I was always curious as a kid and um, when we would go out and about my parents, I write about this in my book, which is called transparent by the way that I would just talk to everybody and, you know, my mom would like come and grab me in the restaurant. My Dad would always say, don't teach them to be afraid of people. And my mom said after that conversation she just let me go. So I would just ask people like, what are you here? Are you on vacation when you're doing? I've just always been curious. I don't necessarily think that I wanted to be on television, although I liked it. Um, I always wanted to be a journalist and you know, people remind me when I go home for holidays or just to visit my family that you remember even in college, used to bring the camera to school. Remember we taped this fake show when you were a kid. You remember you used to carry this camera around and then a or do you remember? We had you anchor our high school and so I forgot a lot of those things. And so it's always been there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       So let's talk about the gay thing for justice. Sick, because I don't think we had about you. Let's talk about your gay thing for a second. We can talk about mine too if you want. Um, there's so much I can go because let me see that hand. Raise your left hand. Oh yeah. I got one of these. Wow. I got one of these. Yeah. But that's okay. Go ahead. You can get one too. Didn't you just say, I think if I'm not mistaken, just on air. A couple of days ago you said to somebody, why would you get married? Didn't you say that to Brook or somebody?

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       Oh, there's somebody in the crowd. Why would you get married? I just think that I don't want to create another controversy. I don't see the need to run off and get married right away or ever. And I don't know if I'm the marrying kind.

Speaker 1:          00:11:26       Yeah. That said, listen, my whole thing, and I'm pretty sure you'll agree with me on this, is that we should just have the right. The same rate that everybody else has this. Yeah. If you want to do it, do it. If you don't want to do it, don't do it. Like that's it. But that's why I don't even want to talk about the gay thing much. So we could literally do just a minute on this, but I know I'm just messing with you because we know each other. No, no, I know, but like to me like, and we've talked about this privately, but like it's exhausting talking about the gay thing. Gay people shouldn't have to think about it any more than straight people should have to think about their sexuality or of that. But anyway, you basically came out when your book came out, so it was about four years ago, is that right?

Speaker 2:          00:11:59       Okay. Most professionally, yeah, it was 2011. It was funny because I was talking to a friend in Chicago, which was before I came to work at CNN and he said, he goes, I know people were saying don lemon came out and he's like, what do you mean? Downloading came out dot limon has always been out. So, you know, since I've been out since my twenties, but it wasn't something that I talked about on the air or shared publicly, but my bosses knew I would bring my boyfriends to the Christmas party. I mean it wasn't a big deal, but the public didn't know. I would host events for like gay events in Chicago and now basically out. So when people say, you know, it took you 45 years to come out, I'm like, well, not really. I think I had to do it because there was so much confusion. And when you're in the public eye, I think it's important that you say, uh, at least when I came out that you sort of, you had to make a declaration because it's important for young people who are at home, people who may be struggling, people who may have doubt. And I want people to know like, Hey, you can be a gay person and you can host a show on CNN. And it is okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       Yeah. So that's the part that I wanted to talk about because this is exactly what we talked about four years ago, that there was so much going on with gay rights. There was so much happening at the moment and in a way as a public person, it's sort of like this extra pressure of if I'm going to talk about this on air, I have to be authentic about it. Right? Like, how much of that did you actually really feel?

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       Well, I, no one forced me. I started writing a book about, you know, sort of my exploits as a journalist and writing about my childhood and how I grew up and whatever. And I just thought it would be disingenuous to write a book like that and not included. So it's like, you know, telling everything about your life except for that, you know, one important thing. That one, that one thing that is really important, it's not all of who I am. Um, but it is an important part of my life. And I think it's important again, for other people to be able to see someone like me or like a Dave Rubin who, who people who are successful and who just happened to be gay. So yeah, there was a lot of pressure on it, on me and there was a lot of pressure to, as a person of color to come out.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       Yeah. Isn't it cool how it's so irrelevant. I mean, that's even why I'm prefacing this by saying, let's put two seconds.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       Yeah. He enlisted. Let me tell you, it's irrelevant to you and it's irrelevant to many people who live in big cities like you're in la now. I'm in New York and when we met with you in New York, um, so for us it's easy because there I am, there is no space place where I am in the closet. My entire team knows, the audience knows, my family knows people at the barbershop. No. Like I don't really care what you know, bob at the barbershop thinks about me or of, of gay people. I'm, I am completely out. And that is to a lot of people, that's not reality. And it's strange to certain people, especially a certain demographics and certain ethnicities, people aren't quite that out yet. I think it's easier for you as a white man to be out.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       Yeah. Alright. Well

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       we'll. Okay. So we'll, we'll delve into some of the racial stuff. So my, my last thing on the gay thing is do you think there is something about gay people in general that there are so many out gay people in news right now? I mean, you take you and you take cheever and Anderson and Rachel Maddow and Thomas Robertson and you know, there's a half out guy on Fox. Even. He may be out already. I'm not sure. I'm not even going to name them, don't even have to smile or look at the caviar or whatever. But my point is that for some reason, you know Riley, yeah, he's definitely gay. That guy. I'll tell you no, but my point that there's a lot of out people that people get there, there's something comforting in a weird way or something about gay people. It would be my aunt.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       Anything there? Yes. There's something comforting about gay people. We're loving people, loving people, but here's the thing, I don't think, Dave, that those numbers are any different than any other profession. I think that there have been some people who are brave enough to step up in this profession because I feel that if you're a journalist, you take an oath. I'm much like you do. If you have a juris doctorate, when you become an attorney, have you haven't. When you, you know, you take the medical oath when you become a doctor. I think that journalists really feel that, you know, you have an obligation to inform people. You have an obligation to tell the truth. You have an obligation to be as unbiased and objective as any human being can be. So I think that when you're in this business, in order to get the truth from people, in order to be truthful, you have to live who you are and if you can put different rules on, uh, other people that you put on yourself. And so I think that maybe people are just more visible because it's a visible medium obviously. Um, and I just think that we sort of take that oath, but I don't, I think there are plenty of gay doctors, there are plenty of gay lawyers, there are plenty of gay politicians as we have seen plenty of gay people in the clergy and on and on and on. I just, I don't think it's any different. I just think that we happen to be more visible.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       For the record. I have a friend who's a gay janitor, so we are out. We're in every occupation that they're. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       I know gay athletes, I know gay and everything. So there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       Alright. So that's it for the gay thing. Forget about that. Let's move on. Let's. All right, so cable news, you got to ring on your finger. Stop it with me. It's enough already. Um, so cable news, what do you make of the general state of Cable News? Because it gets a lot of crap at, you know, from everybody all the time. And I'm not talking about you specifically, but in general you say cable news and people start freaking out, right? So what do you make of the general like sense of Cable News?

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       Well, I think it's, you know, obviously it's an easy target, right? The media, excuse me, the media is always an easy target and so when you're in that easy target that happens to be on 24 hours a day, you're going to be an even bigger target. And when you're on and there is no script there, you know, then you're an even bigger target because we are human and sometimes many times, most times there are no words in box to read when you're in cable. Now if you're on broadcast, it's a whole different story. If you're doing an evening broadcast in national or local, everything is scripted for you. You read, if you're doing a 30 minute newscast, maybe you read at the most five to seven minutes of copy, right? You're saying, oh, the big story out West was the flooding and Blah about Dave Rubin joins us, uh, with the latest Dave, what do you know?

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       Boom. And then that's it. And then you go, thank you dave. And now let's talk about the president's reform on gun control. And you even talk like this, it's a very specific answer for you and blah, blah, blah. And all you're saying is thank you. And the most that you'll say is incredible report, Bob Blah. That's it. When your cable, you're saying, no, listen, that's not right. The facts aren't there. Hold on, let me get my information where the president said back in such and such, that's another. People are screaming right now and you're like, wait, wait, wait, now you talk. Wait, wait. Now you talk. So there's a lot more room for error. There's a lot more people talking back and forth. It's a lot more interesting to watch. So of course people are gonna, you know, we're going to be a target and sometimes deservedly so. Most of the time. Not really because we're just, we're just, we just happen to be on television in very real moments a lot of the time.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       Yeah. So to that point, how often, because I right now in this very second, I have an ifb in my ear just so that I can hear you, because it's the nature of how we're doing skype. I don't think you have one in, right? You're, you're just doing the skype off the computer. But one of the things, yeah, they're okay. We have proof. But one of the things I hear all the time, and I think I probably thought this too, is that when you're on Cable News, you're on television in general. There is someone in your rear always barking orders at you. How, how often is that actually true for you that, that you're doing your broadcast and someone is actually telling you what to say. And I'm not talking about the technical stuff. Cut to commercial. I mean, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:19:40       sometimes people tell you what to say and so sometimes you're like, Amen. Thank you. Sometimes people are correcting you. Sometimes people are like, they're your other ears are listening to the guest. And then someone will say, well, you know, I'm a, well, it's gonna. It's gonna Affect the fourth amendment. And then so the producer will say, the president never mentioned the fourth amendment. And you'll say, hey, listen to president ever mentioned the fourth amendment. Or sometimes you'll say, um, uh, it was uh, an unalienable right. And then the producer will say in Elliot, right? So just little things, or, um, I always like to tell people that, well, this recent example is we go on the air, everything is ready in the show, you know, the openness scripted, right? And it's like, you know, blah, blah, blah. Donald trump. Is that a rally in Iowa?

Speaker 2:          00:20:28       And we know this is CNN tonight. I'm Don Lemon, right? And then all of a sudden that, you know, introduce now let's go to our panel. Dave Ruben is here, Ryan. Liz is here and you know, Kaylee Macanese here, so panel. And then someone will say, stop. And I'll go, oh standby. I'll say. And then they'll roll the breaking news animation. You're like, oh, okay. And they'll go breaking news, breaking news. And they'll say, uh, there's been a plane that's been diverted. You say there's been a plane that's been diverted. And then as you're talking they'll say, okay, now go with prompter. And so all of this stuff you are talking and then you look up and they say, okay, joining us on the phone. And they'll say, Bob Williams, they'll say Bob Williams from Nebraska, from Nebraska, and so you know, and sometimes you'll be in the middle of a sentence and people will talk to you. So it does happen. People at home think you're stupid, but actually you're not that stupid. You're just like,

Speaker 1:          00:21:16       uh. So that's it. And that's why I wanted to ask you that because I think there's this sense out there that you're getting orders of what you can and should say. And what you're really saying is it's technical stuff. It's stuff because we have a live program and maybe they're fact checking you, but they're not being like, Don, you better tell him or say saving you buy. Wait, whoa. Explain what you meant by that. And you're like, oh, what I meant was

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       because someone might misconstrue it, but it doesn't really. Everything gets misconstrued and everything now gets taken out of context.

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       Like I can say, okay Dave, let's not talk about the gay thing. Right? And then. So we'll just take that and say, oh, Don Lemon zest, shamed of being gay. And you're like, no. That was like a habit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:59       The sentence in an entire conversation that we had and then it builds upon itself and it keeps building. It's like a wildfire and by the time it gets to the end it has absolutely nothing to do with what you said and then people believe it because of social media. It's really kind of ridiculous. I want to explore that somehow.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       Yeah, I think she didn't investigate that. Well. It's something that we've been talking about here a lot because one of the things that I'm seeing all the time now and unfortunately I see this more on the left, is people being misquoted all the time and no matter what you say and so that it's a good segway actually because I think you, in terms of the mainstream media people, you're the victim of this all the time. I mean, every time I open up mediate, Don Lemon says this, Don Lemon, this that, or go back and look at the whole thing of what I said and you're like, wait a minute. That's not what happened at all dot. I don't know if that kind of time to listen to the context. What do you things to do? But, but that's exactly what your point is, that they get you on the, on the one liner, they know that nobody's going to go back and watch the two minutes before the two minutes after. So for you, how, how aware of that do you have to be and how much are you thinking the whole time? Oh, I better not go there even though it's what I really believe or it's what I want to say.

Speaker 2:          00:23:12       Well, I'm aware a little bit, but um, I can't do that to myself. I don't, I don't want to censor myself that way because then you're not authentic. And I think that, you know, whatever success I've achieved, I think it's been through authenticity. And so if I was worried about every single word and how it's going to be, of course you want to be smart, right? And you want to be buttoned up in a certain way or have your facts straight. I don't want to do that. And so if you want to take me out of context and that's your business. Um, and I think for the most part smart people, the viewers aren't dumb. They, they understand what's happening in the stuff that happens online, especially like twitter and all those. It doesn't usually translate to television. It certainly doesn't translate into ratings and it doesn't translate into credibility. So you know, you just, it's wonderful that I work for a network and a boss who says constantly ignore the noise. You guys are doing great. The network is doing great. Our story is great right now. Continue the momentum, be yourself, be smart, keep moving and don't even read. It doesn't even matter if we tweet or not or we don't have to read it. It's a, it's amazing and wonderful. We're in a great spot right now and seeing it so we don't worry about that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       Right. It's kind of funny because on the social media side, you know, like I, I could pick something like when you said that the black hole thing during the, the plane thing and think you know, you're on air for hours, you're talking about all of this stuff. You're just throwing out, you know, somebody said it could be a black hole, like you weren't saying it's in a black hole or whatever it is. And then next thing you know don lemon is trending and all that. So you really, you really can just put it aside.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       No, I mean I can because we listened. We, I've talked about this ad Nauseum at the New York Times. Did a thing on it. It's not, it's not that you believe those things. We had a thing called crazy conspiracy theories that people were sending to us. Yeah. So one of those was that it was a question from a viewer. That's it. I've read the question from a viewer and that was the end of story and that took on a life of its own, but so be it. It may be famous, but it's not. It did not come from me. That's [inaudible] positing that I'm saying, Hey, look this, this is what viewers are saying. They were also seeing. It was in a hangar somewhere that we mentioned that there were also saying that it was a, it was flown. Someone else took it and hijack did. There were a number of different things that were said about it, all of which we talked about on social media. That one just happened to get picked up.

Speaker 1:          00:25:32       Yeah. You know, at the top of the show, I did a little piece on how I was saying we need mainstream media, but we also need online media because I do believe we need both for different reasons and different corporate interests and all that. I think. I think. I think we look as the online guy and the and the mainstream guy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       We need more. We need more honest online people. We need online people, online people who will actually do their homework, who will call, who will not write an article off of someone else's article off of someone else's opinion of what someone else did online. People who actually saw the entire segment in context to do their job, not just like lazy people are lazy and they just go, oh, you know, I'm such and such. Whatever. Yeah. He said that and you're like, no, that's not so. It's. And it's Kinda hard for us, for those of us who are in more traditional media to chase all of those things down and it's just not worth it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       Yeah. I mean, you literally took the words out of my mouth. That's exactly what I'm saying because I think at some point there was the online media, dede was doing a lot of good stuff getting to stories that maybe hadn't bubbled up to you guys yet. And yet somehow in the last year or two, there's so many trashy sites that are just waiting for, for not, not just the, you know, the on air guys, but for politicians to just find any little thing that they can say and run with that just so that they can get clicks and they're no longer doing a service either.

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       Well, we call it click, Click Bait. We're at, at the point in here at CNN where we realized that I'm clickbait. Just say Don Lemon and people are going to click on it. Yeah. So they will say don lemon and then anything. But um, what I wanted to say is, oh, when you talk about online people, so have you ever worked for a traditional network where you work for serious? So that was, I would imagine that's pretty. Yeah, that was corporate. That was corporate is so rigorous here before I can say anything on the air as a fact or present something. It's got to go through our fact checkers is it has to go through standards and practices. You know, what our definition of what we're talking about, the guys in Oregon, what our definition of terrorism is, all of those things, um, how we confirm things we had the other night when Natalie Cole died, everyone was reporting Natalie Cole died, but we couldn't get in touch with her, her publicist, the publicist was busy and every time we call the phone was busy. The email, I guess we could not report that CNN would not report that until we heard from an official person online. People don't have those, you know, they don't have to climb those hurdles. And I think that's sad and missing because listen, we don't have to be first, we just want to be accurate and I wish like, I wish the online people want it to be more accurate than first or funny or opinionated.

Speaker 1:          00:28:06       Yeah, I totally hear you. I, I feel like I sort of exist in between those two worlds and I'm, I'm just trying to do what you're saying which is, which is be honest and have honest conversations. And even though I had one of these things in my ear and nobody's yelling, what did they tell you? No, uh, nothing they're saying doing it. You're doing a hell of a job. That's what they just said. Um, so, so the other thing that I think is interesting about you is that you get heat from both sides. And I'm not talking about when they misquote you, now I'm talking about if you say something, for example, about black lives matter or you're taking a selfie right now.

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       I just wanted this for. I'm going to do when I, when I post online, go ahead.

Speaker 1:          00:28:42       Nice. So, um, that you get equal heat from both sides. So if you take a black lives matter, for example, there's a certain amount of racist people who will look at you as a, as a black man, and they're going to just say racist shit, that's just going to come no matter what. And then there'll be people when you've said things that haven't been, you know, sort of in lock step with, with the movement that'll say you're an uncle Tom. And I'm only using that word because when I googled you, it was one of the first words that came up, uh, that Don Lemon is a trademark. That word. But go ahead. Yeah. That don lemon is an uncle Tom. But to me it seems like you're usually doing good stuff when people on both sides are attacking you and that's what you're getting all the time, right?

Speaker 2:          00:29:24       Well, yes. And the thing that people. Here's the thing that when I, when we talk about double standards and expectations of people, uh, as a person of color, well, someone just to say someone not of color, people don't expect you to be the spokesman for all white men, right? Are All, thank God they don't even expect you to be the spokesman for gay people. I got it. Somehow. There's this expectation of me to be the spokesman for black people or gay people and I neither what? I'm the spokesman for his information and truth, and so if black lives matter does something that is worthy of criticism than it is my job as a journalist to give that criticism because no movement is perfect. Even the civil rights movement was a perfect and received that share of criticism. So there's a black person in this position and the only one who is in prime time on a cable network.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       When people see that coming from me, they're like, how dare he? Well, I'm not doing that. I'm doing my job. That is what I'm supposed to do. So, and if someone who is white sees me talking about black lives matter and in a way that's positive, then of course I agree with them so you know I can't win. And so the. The point is not to be an advocate or someone who is an activist. My point is to be a journalist. The I get those races and they get this homophobia, sexism, but at the end of the day, what I'm giving his information, or if I say, um, you know, uh, I just received information that, you know, Michael, that the cop in the Michael Brown case is not going to be indicted. That word is going to come out. People who want him to be indicted or going to get upset and call me an uncle Tom because it came out of my mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       And then 20 minutes later when the guy comes out and says, there's no indictment, no one goes, oh, he was right. They just go, oh, he's covering that story. I can't believe him, you know? So it's just, it is what it is. People take out their frustrations on the person who was in front of them and I haven't been that person. And do you find that a lot of it, it's odd that like with the uncle Tom stuff, that, that comes from people on the left that they would want you, right? The people on the left, they should see you as an individual except what they're seeing or what they're complaining about is that you should be this representative of black America or whatever. I find that the people who were supposed to be the most tolerant are the least because they, they never consider that they in fact may not be because they think that everyone thinks like them.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       Yeah, and not everybody thinks like you. So you know, concern. I find that, listen, I get it from all sides, but I find that the people who are most incredulous about things and many times the most vocal are liberals. Yeah. And and many times for me as well, African Americans, because they're looking at me regardless of the facts. Even if the facts don't pan out, even if, if the evidence and all the investigations and all the autopsies show no hands up, don't shoot. I have to come on television and say hands up, don't shoot. I can't do that. That's not what the evidence shows. So I have to say the evidence does not show that. So that never happened according to the evidence. I can't believe you. You sell out and you're like, well, what do you want me to do? Lie. I can't lie. Right? And then that's exactly where they go. Oh, because he's getting

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       the information from his year, which I think you've illustrated is actually not the case. Okay. So a lot of people have been asking me this on twitter and I thought you'd be the perfect person to pose this question to the way the media frames certain things. So the way the media frames black lives matter versus how the media is now framing this Oregon militia thing and we don't have to get into the nitty gritty of, of every little instance that's happening. But a lot of people were saying, you know, that the media is not calling these Oregon people. They're not calling them terrorists. And if this was a group of black people or especially if this was a group of Muslim people, we would be calling them terrorists. And I was googling the word terrorism and you know, it talks about intimidation or violence and violence and to me it's a little hazy whether them taking this building where they had to use no force per se. And apparently the building was just open and yes, they had guns and it's federal property, it's all that, whether it's actually terrorism. And would the medium be treating it differently if it was either black people or Muslim people. Why are you falling into that trap? Dave Rubin, I tell me why me out of this trap, how about that? So here's the, the thing.

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       So I actually wrote an editorial saying that it was terrorism in my editorial for the Tom Joiner morning show. And so, um, you know, it was read by someone here at CNN and they said, well, our definition of terrorism here at CNN is different, is that it has to be political, it is political, that's political, but it also has to have someone who has been hurt by it, like physically hurt. So it's not terrorism until someone has actually hurt or killed or what have you. And I think that's part of the definition here, but according to the law enforcement people I spoke to, if you are doing something for a political end or whatever that is illegal in that manner than it is terrorism. So I have called a terrorism. I've heard other people call it terrorism. I don't know how other media organizations frame it, but here at CNN I don't think there's a double standard about what's going on and what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:34:38       Now. Here's the thing, is it, do I know that it. Would it be different if it was Muslims or if it was black, black people? Yeah, of course. I live in America. I know that in this particular case. So I have to have to hedge it and say I'm not so sure. And here's why. Because it is in the middle of nowhere. It's 280 miles from Portland, Oregon. The next biggest city Burns is what? 80 slash 30 or 80 miles away. And no one really knows where Burns Oregon is, right? So it is basically a truck stop, not even a truck stop at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. What the government is trying to do, the FBI is trying to do is to avoid another Ruby Ridge and another waco and so it is the middle of winter. Nobody's there. Nobody is in danger of being hurt.

Speaker 2:          00:35:28       The best thing that these guys can do is be ignored. I hate that we even have to give them media attention because they're Yahoo's. They're not within their legal rights for anything. So I think what they're doing now is perfectly fine. Let them sit there in the middle of winter and freeze their asses off and fine. If you want to stay down in the middle of winter in that little crappy building, then that is your business. Yes, it is a federal building and they are breaking the law and at some point they will have to take care of it. But I think at this point I think they're actually doing the right thing. As far as immediate reaction, I don't. I haven't seen any. I don't know anyone who's called it like a peaceful protest or what have you. It's it is what it is. It's people who are ignorant of the law who have taken over a building and they should pay for the pay, the consequences when the time comes, but right now I'd say ignore them.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       Yeah, and I'm pretty sure they're not going to get what they want at the end of this. That's usually how these things

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       and it's many of the people whose land was saved by the government helping them out years ago and now they want to reclaim it and get the money back. That the more money that was already given to them, they're just ignorant of the law. If this was a building that mattered in the middle of the city that mattered, sure. Reaction will be completely different and there would be more direct threat to Corbett direct threat. Yes, but I do think that they're getting a pass there because of their religion. They're not Muslim because they're white non-african-american. I do, but I don't know how different the reaction would really be. I don't know because it's a building that nobody cares about in the city, in a place that nobody really cares about it. Yeah. And it's only 15, about 15 or so people who are actually in that building. It's not hundreds of people. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       They're running out of snacks. I heard. So this thing can't last that long. They're idiots. All right. So, uh, let's talk about some of the things that bring us together because that, you know, what the audience is going to go now see lemons looking at somebody who's giving him the signal, whether he can talk about it or not. Someone is in my office, but I'm just, we're just laughing. Um, so one thing that you've done that I, I really appreciate because it comes completely with the spirit of how I've done this show is you've really tried to build bridges with people that perhaps some might think you shouldn't get along with or you shouldn't talk with. So I've seen you a couple times with a Glenn Beck and, and I was tweeting up a storm the first time I saw it because I thought this is exactly what the news is supposed to be. This is what not not reporting, but this is what conversation is supposed to be. You guys come from very different places, you know, he's a pure libertarian, I suppose. Uh, your politics are different and you know, you're just trying to have the conversation and that's what I'm trying to do here. And I thought it was pretty beautiful. I was. So I guess I don't even know what my question is as much as I want to see more of that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:12       Well, he, you say that our politics are different. I'm not political. I'm like the least political person that you got on. I swear I don't care about conservative or liberal. I think all politicians are full of it. I think I'll go with you on that. And I judge things on my own. So, you know, especially coming from an African American background, African Americans are pretty liberal and then some things and also very conservative and many times conservative socially when it comes to the church. So you know, you know, for people to sit there and pretend like, oh, where do those big liberals and they're not, and then you don't accept gay people and then it. So it's not true. So I'm not, I, I am not political. So when you say my politics are different, it's not, I will listen. I think the only way, especially if it's someone you don't agree with or if you consider them your enemy or not on your side, don't you want to know what they're thinking?

Speaker 2:          00:39:05       I don't understand. When people say, I am never going to talk to them, how could you? Don't you dare sit down. You knew how much crap I got because I like I because I sat down twice with Aaron Wilson and I went, um, I almost got the interviews between me, uh, George Stephanopoulos and one other person. I forget who it was and we all, you know, George ended up getting the interview. I got so much guff because I wanted to do an interview with him. It's like, well, don't you want to hear from him? Like even if you don't agree with them, especially if you don't agree with them, you want to hear his rationale and his reasoning, so it is never made sense to me to not talk to someone who you disagree with. Now that's it. I think that people should be respectful and they should be in their right minds, but you know before you are, when you're talking to them and if they don't then they're outta here. I'll cut you right off if you're. Yeah, if you're being an ignoramus, I'm not dealing with it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       Yeah. Well, interestingly, I wasn't even going to bring this up, but a couple months ago, maybe two months ago or so, you had a Sam Harris who's been on my show who's become a friend of mine and Dean Obeidallah were on and they were, they were debating this Islam and and sort of, you know, religion verse people thing. And in the midst of it, Dean said something that I knew to be implying that sam believed something about all Muslims and I knew it to be not true because I had sat there with Sam and rehashed it. He's rehashed it a thousand times. And while it was infuriating aiding for me to watch, I thought, all right, at least they're having the conversation. So that's what you're just opening the door for.

Speaker 2:          00:40:45       Yeah, and the thing about that is, is that we have to stop calling people, you know, Isms or obs, phobias, not homophobic or Islamophobic or whatever because they want to have a conversation. That's part, that's what we do is have a conversation. And when you have great minds, like you know, a Fried Zacharia or Sam Harris or whomever who say, yes, there is a problem that must be addressed in Islam and we have to figure out how to do it. When you have great minds like that, those are the people that you should listen to. When you have people who say there is no problem. And by you saying this, then you are as auto phobic, then that person is very dangerous because the evidence is there doesn't mean that people in that religion or that it doesn't mean that that Islam is bad, doesn't mean mean that Muslims are bad.

Speaker 2:          00:41:31       It doesn't mean that because we talk about crime in that is committed mostly by African Americans. It doesn't mean that African Americans are bad or that black people are bad. It means that we were just having those conversations and so we have to stop that. And, and you know, Matt, I think that's why I can talk to someone like a Glenn Beck is because, you know, I want to, I would rather have common ground with people or try to reach some sort of common ground or consensus rather than just having them an enemy, keeping them at arm's length and not being at the table. That's what's happening in Washington and with the Congress right now. What good is that doing anybody?

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       Yeah. So that's actually a perfect segue for the political climate. So let's just talk about that a little bit. So you've been in this for awhile. It's pretty bad right now, right? Like, could it get much worse? I keep thinking that it's not going to get much worse. And now I realize we're in an election year. We've got this crazy thing with trump right now. That's me. Yeah. You just have to nod through this whole thing probably. But really like how much worse is this thing gonna get before this election

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       comes? I think it's going to get a lot worse and I think um, because of how much it's being amped up on both sides. So whoever's in the White House next is going to have a huge challenge. Like if a Democrat is in there, all those people that have been read by the right and by Donald Trump, right? Some people you can, if you can just go hillary

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       and they go, ah,

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       can't even get her name out, right? Say you say Donald Trump,

Speaker 3:          00:43:02       they go, oh my God, I hate that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       You can't even get their name out. So I think people are becoming amped up more than almost any election that I've seen except for during the Obama election. It was pretty, it was pretty crazy, right? Him and Sarah Pailin, it was like, wow.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       In a weird way, doesn't it seem like, to me, it seems like we were all on ecstasy back then, like it was like seven years besides the past, is that if we just romanticize the past,

Speaker 2:          00:43:28       it was bad. Yeah. I mean, come on. It was, you know, he wasn't, he wasn't America and he was a Muslim. He went to a madrasa. Um, what else? Oh, you know, a socialist, all that socialist, all those things. And then, you know, mccain couldn't find a running mate in any found Sarah pay on it. And then that was a disaster. And then people said, oh my God, everybody was out to get Sarah Pailin. And then as it turns out, she was not as informed as she should have been. And so it was, you know, it was a little crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       Right? All that said, we didn't have a trump. Right. How do you deal with this trump thing? Because one of the things that I've noticed and, and we've talked about it,

Speaker 2:          00:44:05       it makes me, I love interviewing him. It goes, love it. I, I know. I don't necessarily love what he says. That's not. Don't get me wrong. The spectacle. I loved new. No, I love interviewing him because you don't know what he's going to say. I love the back and forth. I love the way his mind works. Doesn't mean I agree with him. When he's like, excuse me, excuse me, Don. You know, people at home are like, oh, he cut you off inside. I'm kind of laughing. I'm, oh my gosh. And I'm like, you know, when he goes up, excuse me, done. He is, it's a bit comical sometimes he's, he's a performer, so I love interviewing him, but that's about it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       So is that really though the secret sauce to what he's doing that the rest of these guys? All of them, pretty much. I would argue that Bernie probably is not as Bernie does seem like he's speaking from the heart and he speaks in a way that doesn't sound like a politician, but pretty much the rest of them, they all just sound like politicians and people are over that. And because of that, even when trump says crazy stuff, it makes people like him, like we had this like a thing that's like eating itself constantly with him.

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       And because of that, I mean, I tell people this because I use it, tick them off, right? They usually tell like people who are on the left, the president trump get used to it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       Oh Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       But it's, you know, I had never, I had not underestimated him since he got into the race because here's why. And I said this from the beginning, you can probably find it on tape somewhere. He's used to swimming in these New York media waters. Sharks, right? He knows how to handle them, manipulate the media. He knows how to cut a deal, you know, if you can say, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. This guy has made it with help from his dad. Don't get me wrong, but you know, he, um, he's made it here. He's become, you know, at the top of the food chain and the media food chain here. He knows how to deal with the media and so, and he's got a lot of money, a lot of it, of running for president is having a ton of dough and he has a ton of dough and he knows how to deal with people and he has a good year on what people want to hear. So when he's in front of a crowd, he's like, oh, they liked that, huh? And it gives them more or they don't like that so much. He changes the subject. So having known all of that and being here in the nineties and, and knowing Donald Trump, I was like, this guy isn't going anywhere. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       Yeah. I'm all right. I got just a couple more for you because I know you have to actually be blowing me off. You have to be live on air. Uh, not too. Not too long from now and about two hours and 15. Oh, I got plenty. I'll go. Listen. I'll talk as long as you want. Um, so, uh, how much do you think. One of my major issues is when I watch something live, by the way, I know we're not lying. We're not. Okay. All right. Um, when I watched something like the, uh, you know, the press club, the yearly thing where the media gets together and rose to the politicians and all, what's it called at the press club, the, uh, my last correspondence, the White House correspondence dinner. Thanks. When I watch all of this stuff and even I saw you a couple of weeks ago at, in the spin room at the debate in Vegas, we were at the democratic debate there and I've been around it a little more lately.

Speaker 1:          00:47:12       I'm. One of the things that I really do fear is that the media and the politicians are just in it too tightly that people are just too friendly with each other. They're actually, you know, we have so many instances of people that are married to people on television and they're the kids. And this one or the uncle of that one on all of this stuff. Uh, I'm pretty sure no one in your family's pulling strings in politics. Right? Let's get that out of the way, except for my cousin brock. But that's, of course he's your cousin, of course these guys. Right. But really, how do you see that as an actual threat to democracy? Because that I really see as a major problem.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Uh, I don't know if I would call it a threat to democracy. I do see it as um, it's a little fake and phony to me. Like, you know, it was great going to, you know, being invited to the White House correspondence dinner, but it was a lot more fun when I was covering it and I can make fun of people. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       So how much does that make you bite your tongue? Because you want to go to the dinners, right? Like we've all been around.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       I went to the White House Christmas party, right? And because I knew the Obama from Chicago and it was tough and I said this before, like when you know someone, people I didn't know them that well. They weren't my best friends, but I knew them from around the way. Right from being I was a local news anchor and they were there, they, you know, that would introduce them at chicken dinners like emo state Senator Barack Obama and Michelle, and then his wife would always say, Oh don, stay out of trouble. And I'm like, who? Me? Why? So to have to sort of criticize him on policy and the things it was, it was, at first it was uncomfortable in Michael, he's the president and the buck stops with him. So I've got, you know, an ease, black, whatever. I've got to do it. I'm a journalist, that was, I took an oath and so when I saw him sort of in an, in an informal context and not like throwing questions at him or seeing him at the end a Bj and like yelling across the room, like, how are you going to handle this?

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       And having them yell back when I had to go and shake their hand and take a picture with him, I was like, oh, what are they going to say it? So I walked up and you know, and they were like, hey, you know, you did the right thing by coming out. And I was like thank you. Right. And so they get it, they get it. But it was a little weird and I felt like I don't know if I should be that close to winning in this sort of situation to be partying with the president or for that matter, partying with some of the people, you know, when you go to the Oscars and all those things. I don't know, I just feel like I kind of feel like Wendy Williams, right? Who Sits on her purple chair and she liked talks smack about everybody and then when they see her or when she sees him she's like, oh.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       Or I kind of feel like that a little bit. So don't you think that more you guys need that sense? Because I totally feel like everybody, you know, and it's not just, I don't mean just the at the friendly level, but you know, we don't, we don't have to. I'm not trying to name names or people here, but there are plenty of anchors that literally used to work on campaigns for. For President or I mean you can name some names or look a little weird to me. Look, I mean somebody like a, you know Stephanopoulos right there. This

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       is Diane Sawyer. There's a George will. I mean even in George will is a commentator, a David Gergen. He's accommodated Donna Brazil commentator. That's different. But when you're a journalist, you know there are plenty of journalists who have worked for campaigns. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       but when you're a commentator, how, how different do you actually think that is? So somebody like Don Dave, but don't you think they have a certain amount allegiance for a campaign that they would, that they worked on previously that they can, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       I think they do. That's why we hire them because they not because they have allegiance because they have knowledge to that person or will. We will say, Donna Brazil worked for the Al Gore campaign. You, everybody knows that. So she can offer insight, but also with it, unless you're crazy, you know, that her allegiance would be to, you know, um, to Al Gore. Uh, I think it's totally different because when you're a commentator, you're hired to commentate as they say or to comment. Uh, and to give your opinion as a journalist, you're not necessarily, that's not your role.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Yeah. But you're pretty much right. I would say you're right in between those two things.

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       Um, I do it on CNN. What I do is I do and more of a point of view on I am hired as to give commentary on the Tom Joiner morning show radio show which had to be approved by CNN. So I feel free and different in that zone to give. But when I'm on CNN I have to watch myself because that's not exactly what I do, but everyone has a certain lens and everyone has a certain background and they have a point of view and I think that's okay as a human being, as long as you let people know that and. But that's nothing new. You know, Merle Cronkite, all those guys gave commentary.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       Right? Well, I always do think that's funny when some of these people on tv, you'll say, well, I don't share any of my opinions. And it's like, that's pretty much impossible actually, even if for no other reason than your body language when you're talking to somebody. Right? Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       yes, absolutely. Yeah. I don't see anything wrong with it, especially if you declare it. That's why I had, you know, when, when people were saying, oh, Fox is to the right, okay, fine. They let you know, MSNBC is to the left. Okay, fine. They let you know and we are neither here. We want to be objective at CNN, but we don't want people to have an in our objectivity to let people run all over reality and truth. No.

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       Yeah. Um, so I should tell everybody that right before we started the recording here, uh, you said to me, what are we going to talk about? And I said to you that I knew with you I wasn't going to have to, you know, a lot of times I'll tell them, I guess our, we're going to touch on these kinds of things, but I knew if you knew that you were going to be cool with that, so I hope that that alone, I want my audience to know that because I hope that alone will dispel some of this stuff about sort of how a lot of you guys have to operate or at least how you have to operate. Because [inaudible] the person that I know off the camera is the same guy that I know right this second.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       Yeah, I. There you go. And I don't want to know the exact questions you're gonna ask me. And most of that was just like, Hey, what are we gonna talk about what's going on and what's. No, you didn't, you didn't push me at all. Don't do that or I'm going to get mad. Yeah. No. And we don't do that with our subjects either. Like someone we're going to go interview. We don't give them the questions. I mean, I'm, they'll say, what are we going to talk about? We're going to talk about you running for president. That's the. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       GimMe a Gimme like your worst moment with a candidate. Like what's like the worst thing that's ever. Any real flub or did he ever really offend anybody or anything like that?

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       No, I mean, one of the, um, one of the most contentious moments was with Rand Paul. I'm sure you remember that. And I started this whole thing called no talking points because I hate, I hate, I hate talking points and I hate the way politicians answer questions. So ask me a question, just a simple question and I'm going to be a politician. A. Does that, your office that you're in right now? Well, when you talk about offices, a grandmother taught me was that you don't really own anything. It's all shared. It's all part of the American people own everything. Right? And then you're just like, okay, are you going to answer the damn question? So the simple answer is yes, this is my office. Politicians have a hard time doing that. So Rand Paul had did that with me and I was just like, I'm like, look man, could you stop telling me what you did yesterday in Congress and would you do, how do you feel about this, do you hear the question that I'm asking you?

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       And so then he got really upset and it became really heated and so it was an uncomfortable moment, but it was also a very freeing moment to me because I was like, you know what, you know what, I'm sick of this. And so I set a marker there and so everyone I had that came on had to answer the question and they do now, now I'm not going to badger people because sometimes they just won't. And I'll say okay. And then I will say it is obvious that you don't want to answer the question so we will move on. Right? Because I don't want to waste the audience time. So that was probably an, an uncomfortable moment that I have with a candidate. But then I just interviewed him two hours, three hours ago. So it's all, it's all good.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       Yeah. Do you ever bite your tongue though, related to the fact that you want these guys to come on again? Because even when I was in the spin room talking to, talking to their representatives, not even the candidates, I did feel a little bit of, you know, I had huckabee's campaign on back on there at the end, the

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       for you, but they all want to be on CNN. Fair enough. All going to come. But yes, I know where you're going with this. And the thing is, is not, it's not. So let me share a little secret with you. This is just between us. This is just between us. So if you had that concern you had and that's a very real concern and that. And that's real because you do want people to come back, right? So it's all in the way you asked the question, it's all in the tone and if I say, why are you such a damn bleeding heart liberal, you'll go, what do you mean? So you can just go, well, you know, that's a very liberal perspective. Why? Why do you feel that way? Yeah, it's the same question, right? Pretty much. It's all in the way you asked it. It's like asking a question with a smile on your face. It's all in the tone and you can do it by complimenting. It's like I know you pride yourself on your politics and your liberalism. So would you answer this question for me? Same thing. Well that's the way you asked the question

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       that sort of brings it back to we started this sort of online versus mainstream media thing because I'll see a lot of times, you know, the online guys who aren't interviewing these people who are commentating on it, they'll be like, Ahhh, lemon didn't attack him for this or you didn't do this or that. And it's like, well guess what? He's the one that actually has to stand there. Do it, get another interview in the future, you know, figure out how to get truth from people that aren't going to give you a much truth. Uh, so my point is it's easier said than

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       here's the thing. It is, it's not. And it's not even that it's easier for them to say it because there was not necessarily the best way or the easiest way because you want someone to continue to sit there and the interview to answer questions, right? Uh, and you, you also want, you don't want to antagonize them. And I'm also thinking about the viewer because if I continue to antagonize them, the viewer gets no information. That person shuts down and it's not good for any of us. Right? So it's done. So rather than what am I going to do, stand up, go over to the chair that the subject was sitting in and ring their neck. It's not, it's not gonna happen. So if you're, if you're sitting there, Dave Rubin, and you don't want to answer a question, what am I going to do? Inject you with, what do you call it? Sodium, sodium Pentothal to make you tell the truth. It's not gonna happen. So you get as much as you can and then you move on. That's how it works.

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       All right, I got one more for Ya. But first, have you ever touched wolf, blitzers? Beard? I feel like I'd really today in that way it was,

Speaker 2:          00:57:52       we gave each other a td hug and it was a little weird, like, Oh yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       I'm convinced there's something, there's something like the whole secret to his success is the beard.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       It's mad. It's magic will be on my show at 10:00 PM. So you have to watch.

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       Oh, nice. All right, cool. Uh, all right, well then my last question for you is what's next? Because I've, I've seen this thing not to talk about the rise that you didn't want to talk about before, but, but I've seen it. I flat out seen it. So what's next man?

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       So I'm sure you've read. Um, so here's the thing, people always ask me, Oh, what are you going to do next? What's your, you, how long bought to get where I am. So I'm just going to love this for awhile. Like I really, I wake up every day and usually, you know, sometimes the first time I wake up as, because an alarm goes off and it's time for my editorial call. And the first thing that's on my mind every day as well. What am I going to put on tv today that is pretty freaking awesome. So I'm in a really great spot. I'm, I live every moment in gratitude. I am very happy. I'm content. I'm not complacent, so I'm going to enjoy this for the moment. And I would have to say that the next thing, if I could think about it, but best laid plans, right?

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       It's probably a show that is more bill Maher or Chelsea handler or something like that where I can actually give a point of view and actually say, like you said, shit or whatever it is that you said and not have everybody going, oh my gosh, she can't. I can't believe Don Lemon said that. Well, they're probably gonna do that either way, but uh, yeah. So that's probably. If I had to think of something, but who knows, I will probably do this if all goes as it's going now, knock on wood, you know, God allow for the next 10 or 15 years and that's not a bad thing. Yeah. Uh, well listen, I 100 percent. You know, how thrilled I am for your success and our friendship and uh, I look forward to our next adventure at blondie's. You can down some wings. You, you put me to shame.

Speaker 2:          00:59:56       I mean it was sad. I had to cut back. I was there this weekend. Past weekend. Yeah. I only ate eight of my 10 wings. Oh yeah. I've ordered like two ordered double owners when we've been together. You literally, you got a double order. You had I think 48 wings on a plate. No, let me tell you this. Let me tell you. Um, I used to be able to do that in my twenties and thirties and forties and now I can't do it. Wait, did you hit the big five? Oh, I thought you were 49. I don't want to hear it. Oh No, you turned five. Oh, I'm a little behind you. How far? Uh, I'm 39. Oh Wow. You're, you're older than me. I'm 37. Wait a minute. Something ain't right here. Anyway. You guys can catch Don weeknights on CNN and pretty much wherever and whenever breaking news happens. Don. Thanks a lot, man. Thanks. Good to see you. Did you to keep up the good work.
