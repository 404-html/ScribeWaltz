Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Joining me today is the milbank family centers senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a senior fellow at the Center for European studies at Harvard, where he also served as a professor of history for 12 years as well as the author of 14 books. Neil Ferguson. Welcome to the Rubin report. It's exciting to be here. How'd I do on the intro there? I mean I was looking through your bio. 14 books. There were 87 other things I could have credited you for. We've already done an interview here and just the 15 minutes we've been sitting here. How was that all right. I mean I could have just made it quicker the better as my feeling about introductions just to said he is Neil. All right. Here's Neil. All right. There's a ton we got to cover here and we've already done half of it I think without the cameras, so let's just dive in immediately to the culture war stuff because I can tell you've been traveling a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Half jet lags, half wide awake, but I can see that's really where your head's at at the moment. So let's talk some culture war stuff. What do you feel is happening sort of in the gestalt of the universe at the moment? We'll get started with the university might be where we should begin since I've spent a lot of my life in universities. You mentioned a couple of them, the Stanford and Harvard. I was at Oxford before that and um, much of my life has been, I think witnessing the gradual homogenization of academic life, especially in the field like history when I became a historian back in the 19 eighties in Oxford. And then in Cambridge it was generally accepted that that could be conservative historians and liberal historians and socialist historians. And then some oxys stories. It was really quite a heterogeneous community. Oxbridge in those days.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       And if you, uh, as I was attracted to the Conservatives because they were more fun and it was a, either they say more, right, but more fun. But the fun was the initially attractive thing when I first got to Oxford in the early eighties. It was clearly at the funniest people where the riots, uh, the young Andrew Sullivan who was a year ahead of me at Moreland, so this was all great fun and it led to intellectual, uh, insight because they turned out all sorts of b writes, the historians take Bob Conquest who was then at the hoover institution, one of the few historians who got the Soviet Union right at the time who wrote about Stalin's crimes not long after they were put up a tracy. I mean, those were the heroes of my early years, but in the course of my career, what has happened has been that one history department after another has moved steadily and relentless me to the monochrome left and it has become steadily harder to be seen as a conservative.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       I say CNS because I, I've never really felt that I'm a conservative, but I've often been described as one. To be seen as a conservative historian has become steadily harder and harder and as a result, but culture war to use your phrase in the universities has been won by the left. There will really be soon a handful left of conservatives at institutions like Harvard and Stanford and Harvey Mansfield will probably be the last one at Harvard. Uh, and, and that's, uh, to me deeply depressing, deeply troubling. Do you remember a moment when you saw that shift occurring because you're saying in the, in the eighties, mid eighties, it was pretty diverse in terms of ideas. Do you remember seeing something or did you see markers that started that you can start putting together the map of where this thing was going to go? I think the definition of defeats in the culture war is that it's imperceptible, uh, your, your aware of.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       It's a little bit because in a typical department, each year somebody retires or dies, but they're always replaced with somebody working on that. Say for the sake of argument, gender history. So you, you'll colleague was a, was lecturing on the history of the Soviet Union. Richard Pipes who was at Harvard and a and just lately died, one of the great historians of the Bolshevik revolution. You don't ever see someone like that replaced with somebody like him that'll always be replaced by somebody working on gender history, native American history that, that process whereby there was no replacement of conservative historians, was a more or less annual events. I got accustomed to being in a real minority, a minority of conservative historians. I got accustomed to losing pretty much every vote. Being in the minority on every committee. It became a kind of you. You've got to climatize to it. And then one day suddenly hit you that you were practically the last one left.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       Uh, and you know, when I moved to Stanford, the revelation was quite startling. I was invited to come to the hoover institution, many hoover fellows who have associations, a joint appointments with Stanford departments. I had been pretty successful as a teacher at Harvard. My classes had been very large. Uh, the students gave me very powerful evaluations. Uh, I kind of assumed that I would come to Stanford and have some relationship with the history department. And then I was told, oh, no, no, none at all. Not even a courtesy appointment. And it was clear at that moment that I had become in the eyes of the Stanford History Department, but a pariah, somebody who, who simply couldn't be allowed in the building because of my, my conservative leanings. Can you explain little bit more about how the universities work like that, that, that could even happen? They're going to, they're going to bring you in, you're, you're a fellow there, and that you're just going to be ignored by the department that you're an expert in.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       It's quite insulting, especially as you mentioned, uh, as I've published, rather, there are lots of Buddhists rather more than, than most of the department put together. And I think, uh, a department with falling enrollments might have been expected to, to want to have a me playing apart. But what happened is, and it's happened in most departments and most universities inexorably the left to Kovar and an implicit rule, tacit rule was imposed. That one does not hire, right? Leaning a historians know does one higher. They're graduate students. So the two people who have been my graduate students have found it difficult, uh, to get hired. So it's essentially a straightforward, a process whereby the institution has taken over one committee at a time and the left has been good at that for the better part of a century. They've always. How do you think they saw that?

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       How did they have the foresight to go? All right, we've got to take over the university's first. I think that on the right, uh, the previous generation of historians, and this was also true of philosophers and people working in other fields did not fight very hard, uh, or effectively to promote their successes in academic life. You need to be mindful of the succession. The left was better at ensuring that it's proteges got the appointments. Ultimately academia is a committee's game. It's all about getting to be the chair of the department to be in charge of the committees. If you control the process, you control the selection, you control the recruitment. And I suppose I'm, I'm such a naive person. I kind of in my youth, assumed we were in abroadly meritocratic world in which if you were smart and hardworking working then, then good things would happen.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       And it took me, I was completely naive. It took me a while to cottoned onto the fact that in, in reality, in academic life, as other walks of life, patronage is everything and you can be as talented as you like if you're not in the right patronage network, then you're done. And I suppose it's been thinking about these issues, how do networks capture institutions that, that led me to write the most recent book, the square and the tower, which is actually book number 15 to try to think about how networks operate. We, we tend to talk casually about networks, but I came to realize that in academic life as another areas, you need to understand quite exactly quite precisely how networks operate. To see how power is truly wielded. We can all see the hierarchical institutions that are, where power is located. Uh, even universities are not as powerful as, as governments, but the critical point is to understand the disease often networks that capture institutions, the capture the hierarchies.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       And that's what happened in academic life. And now I think pretty soon there just won't be conservatives in university departments. More importantly than that, nobody will be teaching subjects like the history of the Soviet Union, so no students will be taught about the crimes of Lenin and Stalin and students like the students I taught yesterday will not hear from inability that the was a religious motivation to the nine slash 11 attacks. I had a class at Stanford just the day was allowed to sit in and teach somebody else's class as a guest professor. And it happened to be a discussion about nine slash 11. Uh, and it became clear to me that the students had never considered the possibility that there was a religious motivation, uh, to the nine slash 11 attacks and more or less accepted the idea that they were retaliation for the misdeeds of US foreign policy in the Middle East, what are called the Howard Zinn theory. And since Howard Zinn's books are more widely read in the United States than anybody else's history books, we therefore arrive at a situation in which there will be nobody in any major university saying, actually, Howard Zinn is completely wrong. And this is not what nine slash 11 was about. So that's what I find depressing when I say that the culture was kind of over in the universities. That's really what I mean.

Speaker 2:          00:10:52       Yeah. So let's circle back because it does bring us to your 15th book. I stand corrected. Um, this, this idea of networks because we were talking right before we started that there's something happening here with this loose association of people that has been coined the intellectual, dark web. And I said to you when you walked in, are you part of the intellectual, dark web as if you were going to give me a secret handshake or a special card? Or when I was asked about it, I, I denied all knowledge. The assumption that it was secret and then it turned out to be all over the New York Times. Yeah. So you weren't, you weren't photographed in the bushes like the rest of us, but I suspect that you secretly are in the intellectual, a dark web. What? I couldn't possibly reveal that because it's secret. But you said something interesting about because of your level of academic, sort of academic credit that you thought perhaps that took you out of it, but then Christina Hoff summers said something interesting. You go from there. What

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       was it? Emailed me and my wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who's been on your show is much more interesting than me, is the greatest. I mean we. She must be tough for you because millions of people love your work and everything else, but it's like ion is like transcendence. She's one of the most enormous, wonderful blessing in my life to be married to somebody who's just way more interesting than me that's not looking to so that. So we were both asked my Barry Weiss, the intellectual dark web, and I'd said, look, how can I really claim to be part of that? When I taught for 12 years at Harvard, left of my own volition, I'm here at Stanford, can write newspaper columns and have them published more or less where I want it would. It would be a little disingenuous to to claim kinship with people like Bret Weinstein who've been persecuted by the academic left.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       Now I've been attacked. I've been criticized, but I haven't really been driven underground, at least not at this point, but Christina Summers said to me just the other night, no, it's not about whether you've been denied a platform or not. Clearly, almost all the people in the article that Barry wrote of have plenty of opportunities to make their views known. It's about whether you are seen to speak for people who feel that they have been silenced, who feel that their voices aren't heard night. That's quite a good definition of what this is about, but you're also right to, to, to see that it's a network. As I was reading the article, I was thinking how funny I know all these people. I'm the sole exception of Jordan Peterson, who I've never. That um, I, I sent that's coming. Yeah, I hope so. I look forward to it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       Um, but I, I, I think it's a network of the most, uh, ideal sought. It is a truly informal network of people from right across the political spectrum because nobody could call Bret Weinstein of conservatives who have come together spontaneously, informally. Nobody called it into being and said, I'm forming the intellectual dark web. Turn up on Monday at 5:00 PM. Change as it change the second it's name, generally a network. So if this is the right type of network, right? It's cool. Kind of diverse group of people who had all sorts of different motivations and everything else. Once it's sort of named, does that change the way a network has to operate? Because I sent. That's what the discussion is about right now. Although I'm not not. I think fundamentally that the critical thing is when something ceases to be secret. I tell the story of the Illuminati, a network in the late 18th century in Germany that sought to advance a radical version of the enlightenment, but covertly as a secret organization.

Speaker 1:          00:14:37       The intellectual dark web I sent me seriously said was secrets until Barry wrote that, and now that it's out in the open, what will happen is that it will grow because people are Andrew Sullivan. I was discussing with him to said, hmm, why am tiredness? And of course the answer is, but you should be really, I mean anybody who, who is engaged in critical thinking about the whole range of ideas in our society, ranging from the political to the social and cultural, anybody who is in the debate and is antagonistic to the dogmas of the left, uh, the political correctness, the identity politics, the spurious pursuit of so called social justice. If you are skeptical, if you are thinking critically about the dogmas of the left, then you belong in the intellectual dark web because you're the kind of person who will at some point will be no platformed, who at some point will be taken down who at some point will be the target of a hit piece in the New York Times.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       One of the characteristic features of the intellectual dark whereby think is that most members at one time or another have fallen foul of the leftist thought police and as soon as you've had that experience, it's happened to me a number of times that is quite transformative. Yeah. I mean, it literally changed my life. It's the only reason you're sitting here right now. I was once one of them and and I suspect that your experience was like mine. You're kind of taken aback to be on the receiving end of a social media mob. You're kind of taken aback to be attacked, not for the substance of anything that you've argued or written or said. You're attacked for your reputation, you're attacked for your alleged bad faith, and each time this has happened to me, I've. I've been a little stunned. I was naive. Not only was I a believer in meritocracy, I was also a believer that we were engaged in a rational debate about the past.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       That's what historians do a and that one made ones case presented the evidence and then the other side did the same, but I wrote a book, a book about the British Empire. Now what, 15 or so years ago, an argument. That argument of that book was that not everything about the British empire was bad. Then there are benefits as well as costs to imperialism and I never had a debate about that argument. I only ever was attacked by the left for being an apologist of empire and neocolonialist, et Cetera. Uh, and so in that curious debate that, that is central to the culture war you never really are engaged with on the ideas or the evidence it is always about whether you have bad faith or not, whether you are covertly, yeah, racist, uh, an Islamaphobe, a homophobe that there's a long list of things that you can be accused of, but are the most popular ones.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       Ones never really discussing the arguments of the books. One's always discussing the personality of the author. Yeah. So this is just sort of simply put the ideas verse people conversation. Right? So in a case of a van, I mean to live through the things that she has lived through between fgm and her and her and her friend being murdered and the whole thing to be called the things that she's called. I mean, it flips, you're very personhood on its head, which is. I mean it's, it's so deeply twisted. The episode that, for me brought it into bold relief was the brandeis a honorary degree fiasco when I was invited by the president of Brandeis and this was in 2017 to accept an honorary degree and speak at commencement. And then, uh, was very publicly and humiliatingly disinvited under pressure from an unholy alliance as far as I could see of leftists and Islamicists who sets out online to smear her reputation with the usual confection of selective quotation and, and misrepresentation.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       And as often happens in these situations, the university authorities capitulate without a fight, uh, to the left and, and they do it publicly. And that, that for me was a, that was a moment when I learned a lot about what was going wrong in American academic life and realize that it's the combination of, of aggressive activists on the left, um, and useful idiots in a university. Bureaucracies. So fold it. Is it that they're useful idiots or is it just, is it just sort of blanket cowardice by on part of some of the academics, but really the, the administrators and the upper brass at all the schools. And the fact that the donors, although this is changing right now, and as we're taping this today, I know it's going to be out in a couple of days, um, evergreen is now firing a whole bunch of professors, which is exactly whatever what all of us predicted, basically because the donors have just had enough.

Speaker 1:          00:19:57       It's fascinating. So it's hard to figure out where does it come, just coders. Coders is the most powerful force in human history, no doubt. And I'm constantly amazed at just how much cowardice is out there. Uh, my wife's experience has shown me that the, the, the difficulty of getting people publicly to support her work against Islamic extremism is all about cowardice, fear of being in any way drawn into, into the, the real war, the jihad, facing the death threats that she has repeatedly had to face. But it's not just cowardice. And there's a good deal of complicity. Many university administrators are themselves ideologically on the left and feel that they have a mission to empower the leftists in the student body. Uh, and this is, I think, a different thing from, from covered this. So yeah, I think, I think this is a fascinating moment in time because donors, alumni look at what is going on, uh, on university campuses as do people who have not had the privilege of university education who see it almost complete madness and ask the question, what the hell is going on here?

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       And I think the more that question gets asked, the better, but we should not underestimate the massive inertia in the system. It is extremely hard. Even if you're a university president, you say, right, I'm going to clean house. It's really hard to do because they're all tenured. I mean the faculty is tenured. It's hard to get what happened everywhere. You know what I mean? Like we don't find out, you know, in the northeast it's a little bit better than, you know, just even geographically, we just don't even see that. Yes, there are bastions of freedom. I've heard University of Chicago or a couple of places are a little bit better, but how do you think it actually spread that way? That it wasn't just here and there and we'll this theory that universities are always left wing, but that's not true of, for example, if you had been in Germany in the 19 twenties, uh, the universities were bastions of conservatism, a, an extreme and indeed extreme right wing nationalism, which is one reason that universities very quickly went over to the Nazi regime when Hitler came to power.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       So it's, there's no golden rule that says universities have to be left wing. Oxford and Cambridge in 18th century were extraordinary reactionary, a fundamentally religious institutions and deeply Tori with a few exceptions in the, in the politics. So there's no rule rule here. Uh, I think the best explanation I can offer you is a process of generational capture of education institutions dating from the 19 sixties universities in let's take the elite universities, the Ivy League universities in the 19 fifties. We're already seen as being liberal. Um, and if you were a kind of mccarthy leaning Republican, you already knew that Harvard was likely full of fellow travelers and a covert commies. But the real shift I think came later. I think it came with the antiwar protests of the late sixties and early seventies, the more radical baby boomers who were protesting in the campuses and 68 and into the early seventies.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       It grew up to become professors and they're still around. Uh, and I think that generation which was essentially formed at the time of the antiwar protests, successfully replicated itself. They were very, very good at replicating themselves by creating graduate students in their own image and then making sure that those graduates, students got jobs and, and the right was nowhere. So you were, you were out there writing books, doing research and figuring. All right, they're doing that. And maybe in the long run on my heroes at Oxford and Cambridge who, who wrote great books and we're also politically active people like norman stone or Roger Scruton who did much of the thinking that, uh, that accompanied that tourism in the 19 eighties. What they did not do well was academic politics. They were poor it that, uh, they were poor at succession planning. And that is, I think, the best explanation I can offer for the fact that in nearly all universities in North America and in Europe, 90 percent plus of faculty members are Liberals or progressives, if not outright Marxists.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Alright? So with some of the historical context of how this all happened, I know you are enthused about this new network idea and because it's come around the right way, do you think there's a gatekeeping responsibility for whoever is involved in this? This seems to be one of the hot button issues with this thing are who can be in this? Whatever it is, what are the ideas that can not be on the inside? Uh, I see it coming much more that we have to watch out for ideas on the right than on the left. That seems to be the way it's being framed, at least from where I sit. Um, how would you do that in a, in a proper network monitoring? Two kinds of, of, of net was open access networks. Let's take the example of facebook where you can just join up an open a facebook account.

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       You can even do it as a fake human being, and then there are the restricted access networks, uh, extreme cases, the secret societies of a, of the 18th and 19th century don't really have many analogs today because it's hard to do anything secret in barely exists any anymore in the age of, of Wiki leaks. So you have to decide whether to be an open or closed or restricted access network and the minute you are restricted access network, somebody is making the decisions about who joins that then ends up being the, the, the membership committee and then you were just a club. Really. I don't think that's an option in our time. I think an open access networks, the only real way to go, um, and you must accept that if the, uh, if the intellectual dot webb is real, that it's an open access network that, that won't necessarily connect you to ever really, that you want to be connected to a may connect you to people that you positively don't want to be connected to.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       This has been a central problem I think of uh, being on the political right for a long time. I can remember in the 19 eighties when people said to me, well, Neil, you're a conservative, and I would say, well, I'm actually not a member of the Conservative Party. I think of myself as a classical liberal. They would say, oh, but nevertheless, when I look at all the things you say you were a conservative, and then I would think, what does that mean? That I have to have dinner with the likes of, I would think of various egregious conservative members of parliament. And it was as if you would be associated with those people even if you never had dinner with them. And it's the same problem now except that it's, it's worse now because the way in which the left seeks to discredit it. Uh, you, Jordan Peterson and probably me as well.

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       Now that I'm on your show man, I mean 15. Look at the people who are connected to these people who quote these people or who read the books that there they are over there, but terrible alt right. And you know, when you say, all right, the audience is supposed to start booing and hissing and you know, Steve Bannon is supposed to appear in a black robe with a sife. You know, I am deaf. So I think that the problem is, I think in escapable there will be a constant effort on the left to say that, uh, the, the intellectual dark web is just some kind of a facade in front of a hideous outright, which is composed of remember racists, Islamophobes, homophobes, and that will be the culture was next, right? I mean that is how it works. We have a strange amount of gay people and Muslim people and absolutely.

Speaker 1:          00:28:04       There you go. Otherwise Brown people and every other type of thing. And the self, the self hating phenomenon, the left has long known how to say that it is absolutely typical of the wicked, right? That they should have lured into that, to the side, a self hating. And then you just fill in the blank. Self hating Muslims self hating gays. That's how this works. Remember they lost all the arguments. All they've got left is reputational smearing man. We got to fight in front of us. Huh? You know, I, I have lost sleep about this. Not only because people threatened my wife's life. That's the real war that the war against the Islamic extremists is. No is no mere culture wards and actual war. I've also lost sleep about the media culture war at the prospect of, of the reputational attacks. It's, it's never pleasant to be attacked as I was recently in effect for being a, I guess a sexist, racist or a racist sexist because I'd organized a conference at which all the speakers, uh, were white men because the women are invited, couldn't come back.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       It was a private conference, wasn't supposed to, it wasn't. He was kind of informal discussion about how we could take the idea of applied history and make history more relevant to some of the debates that go on. I think a lot of what has done in academic history these days is not really relevant to anything terribly much, but this event was a rather crudely exposed in the New York Times and the Washington Post, uh, the pictures of the speakers were published as if the mugshots as it appeared in the New York Times. And the implication was that I must be a terrible racist, sexist, or sexist racist for having organized such a conference. I did lose sleep about that. Uh, and I, I think that part of the culture war is really is really odious because it is, it is calculated to discredit it, uh, the targeted individuals. And it is, it's bad faith on the part of the people who launched those attacks.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       So in my view, what's happening with some of those gated institutions when the newspapers that used to be objective, you know, Barry wrote this piece in the New York Times that I think was a pretty fair piece. It was even somewhat critical of me and I'm not above criticism, so I'm certainly okay with that. But then just a week later, we see this awful piece about Jordan and enforced monogamy and it's just nonsense. It's just nonsense. And you know, I'm on tour with him right now and he keeps explaining why that's, of course he doesn't want anyone to be forced to do anything and all that. He's talking about marriage in effect. Um, and, and Eric Weinstein, our friend found two other references in the history of the New York Times where they talked about enforcement I'll give me and they were both positive relative to progressive ideals. So it's like they flip everything on its head. But what do you think happened there? I mean, you're giving me a pretty good layout of what's happened at the academic side, but on the media side and those, those gates,

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       what is going on? I spent a lot of my life doing journalism because I didn't have any, uh, inherited money. And being an academic in Britain in the 19 eighties and nineties wasn't terribly lucrative. So I kept body and soul together, even from my graduate years writing for newspapers, uh, uh, newspapers have had their own transformation in the course of my adult life. A part of that sister economics, as we all know, the business model which essentially revolved around advertising has been annihilated by the combination of Google and facebook and these institutions are in some measure in desperation trying to reinvent themselves for the Internet age and everybody's in pursuit of clickbait. Even the gray lady, even the most illustrious of, of newspapers. And I think that's one explanation. The other explanation is that an institution like the New York Times has its own university, like character behaves a little bit like university.

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       The most self important newspapers if you go to them are rather like colleges. And it's also true of the Financial Times, which is that like a kind of Cambridge college that sort of ended up by mistake in London. And so they have some of the same dynamics as, as universities. And I think that's especially true of the New York Times. Also true of the BBC incidentally. So institutions like the times and the BBC are think of themselves as being liberal bastions, but for them liberalism is truth. It's the same problem at Harvard has, if you, if your motto is Veritas, but you translate that into liberalism, then by definition conservatives and must be untruth and so I think there's a tendency and it's there and in the New York Times periodically to lash out against anyone like Jordan Peterson who dissents from liberal orthodoxy. Remember, part of what we're dealing here with is a kind of quiz I religious phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       The dogmas of the left have become more and more religious in their quality as they have been unmerge from that fundamental economic rationality which was at the heart of Marxism when that all went down in flames in 1989, the left decamped to the realm of culture and as it did that it increasingly to on the form of a cult, a good. Let me illustrate what I mean. Colts defined themselves partly by a belief in a lot of things that are slightly weird. In order to be an account, you have to have some weird beliefs and one good example of a weird belief is that sexuality is entirely constructed socially and is not biologically rooted and you can actually have any gender you like and there are actually multiple genders now that's absurd, but to believe it has become a kind of test of your orthodoxy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       Uh, and, and, and one sees this at meetings are in academia in which people introduce themselves by name and by their preferred pronouns. Now, when this first happened to me, my immediate reaction was introduced myself and say that my preferred pronouns were, it restrain myself because I realized that my sense of humor forged as it was in Scotland in the 19 seventies is now almost entirely politically incorrect. And anything that I consider funny will get me into trouble. But that has gone on in the media too. And the other thing that's happened is that the polarization which characterizes a network society is now very visibly there in the realm of newspapers and cable television. One thing that we all got wrong about the internet, because we hadn't really thought much about network science, was that we just assumed that if everybody was connected, everything would be awesome and that was the kind of mantra of Silicon Valley for about 20 years, but no network science tells you that if you build a social network, even quite a small one, there will be something called homophily because birds of a feather flock together on bet you already.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       That the intellectual dark web has two clusters that are somewhat separate from one another. I sense it happening right now immediately, and that's what happened in the media. So as society became more polarized politically, so to to the media, I think that's an issue that is one of the defining characteristics of our age. The polarization or if you like self segregation that we see online is translated into almost every realm of life. Can there be any positives out of that, out of that self selection, into finding groups that you're more in common with

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       that for at least for a certain period of time. There's some goodness there because you can really sort of get into your ideas enough to maybe leave the group then and take those ideas out.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       I think if you are in what you want to call it, the echo chamber or the filter bubble, if you are in a cluster that cuts you off from a contrary ideas, you'll last. Yeah. What was fun about being in a network of right leaning undergraduates in early 19 eighties? Oxford was the. We're in constant combat with the left leaning Marxist that was still real. Marxist is then and we weren't far from cut off constantly engaging with them and the soggies Social Democrats in in the middle and that was what made it interesting. What I see happening in the networked age is that people can retreat into a realm of confirmation bias where they here only things that are similar to the things they liked yesterday and the algorithms are the key here where you are, whether it's youtube or on facebook or on twitter, you are essentially going to be fed more of what you already liked.

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       That's deeply intellectually unhealthy. Just as a university cannot be a university if everybody agrees about first ideological principles because how can you have critical thinking in that environment? So it's unhealthy for any intellectual network to be Autarkic. So the one thing the intellectual dark web must not do is cut itself off from other networks, including the ones that hate us and when we have to be in an argument and we have to have our minds constantly open to the possibility that we're wrong about some things. And that's what I see more or less disappearing from public life. I recognize this at one time, uh, when I was in, in, in mortal combat with Paul Krugman, the economists turned journalist and, and realize that recruitment could never admit that he'd ever been wrong. And then when it was obvious that he had been because he hit his part of his result, Dettra was always being right about everything.

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       Did you happen to see the day that the article came out, the original intellectual, dark web article by Barry? The day that that came out that Paul Krugman tweeted it and he tweeted this thing about how we're also oppressed, you know, just mocking everybody basically, and then a bunch of us responded to him and I of course retweeted it and invited them on the show. I said I'd be to discuss this, you and it gets a couple thousand retweets, but of course, no response. Right? And that you're right. That's what we have to make sure we don't become, but I think there's a, uh, there's a human trait that would sort of make you want to retreat because it's exhausting having your motives attack. Then your humanity attacked and lies and smears and all the things that I don't see anyone on this side doing. I don't. And, and that's an example. So it's an exhausting fight because we're fighting two different battles. Yes. Supposedly the same trick

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       award at the moment in the sense that we haven't recognized that in the culture war. The only thing that works is reputational destruction. I think we, we are guaranteed sleepless nights. Remember, there's also the phenomenon of guilty until proven innocent, which is insidious and means that if the reputational hit is bad enough, there may be no, uh, there may be no recovery from that. I was very struck by the speed with which reputations were destroyed in the, the me two movements, uh, most violent phase a and a characteristic feature of the process seemed to be the men were essentially guilty until proven innocent and crimes were conflated with a quite clearly noncriminal behavior in ways that were deeply troubling to my eyes. The false accusation is, of course the, the ultimate nightmare of anybody in this world at this time, because if you're falsely accused, uh, well, your reputation can be gone in 24 hours and that, that has an emt introduced into our lives something that hasn't really existed since medieval times.

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       Uh, the feeling that we are at the mercy of what wheel of fortune that can arbitrarily turn against us and dashes overturn us. I think this makes the culture war, uh, a deeply troubling thing to be a part of and most sensible normal people say, God, I want a quiet life. Get me out of here and never involved me in any of this. Get me off twitter, get me off facebook. Never let my name appear in the New York Times. Never let me appear on a, on a show like this because it's just too dangerous. Uh, I only need to say one thing that can be taken out of context and represented as heresy or hate speech as heresy is now called [inaudible]. That's what we now call heresy and I will be subjected to potentially a weeks of vilification and maybe worse, maybe the vilification will actually lead me to lose my job at. People are right to be fearful of that.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       One of the things that Eric, who I mentioned before we had dinner with and, and just to illustrate this, I'm sure you don't even want me to say this, but just to illustrate the level of what we're talking about. We had a private dinner in a home with Eric and his wife and I and you and me and my husband, and we had. There were security guards out outside, so you're not. You're not just saying this stuff like this is. This is real stuff, but what Eric has said to me is that it's exactly what you're saying, that there's a bravery element here that I don't even consider. I don't consider myself. I don't know what I'm just doing what I think is right, that that really is the truth, but I want to ask you about that. So. So for you, for ion, it's not just academic. Where do you think the bravery comes in for you? Because I can tell there is nothing that I could possibly ask you here that you wouldn't give me the clearest honest answer and and that isn't always how it is with everybody. Obviously. As an interviewer, where do you think that comes from? Uganda has always been one of my greatest weaknesses. I think

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       I was probably brought up in a rather combative family in a rather competence parts of the world. I grew up in, in Glasgow, in the west of Scotland, and

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       to a physician and a, and a physics.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       That's right. My mother was a teacher. My father was a doctor and they were the first in their families to go to university. Uh, my grandfathers had served in the world, was a scots, have a self image of themselves as being a courageous. The Scottish regiments were famous. I wrote about this in my, one of my earliest books, the prisoner of war were famously the sharp end of, of the British military. Uh, we marched towards the sound of gunfire, bagpipes playing. That's the self image that a, a small Scottish boy growing up in the 19 sixties and seventies was encouraged to have. I remember vividly the day that nine slash 11 happened. I was sitting in Oxford where I was then teaching, but planning I'd planned and was intending to fly to New York a very shortly to give a lecture on nine slash 12 at New York University.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       Indeed, I was booked into a hotel very close to the World Trade Center and my response when I saw the attacks was somewhat a bloody minded. My response was very shortly afterwards to resign my posts at Oxford and go to New York University, and I taught there for two years in a, I suppose a mood of defiance that the attempt to terrorize would not terrorize me. When I met a on a nine more than nine years ago now, it never crossed my mind as I fell in love with her, which happened very fast, that this implied some meaningful, a threat to my person. Even when the FBI came to tell me that there had been a threat against me, something that I'd seen them due to a yarn on more than one occasion. I never gave it a second thought because obviously my calling different from my grandfathers who were called to fight in real wars.

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       My more, much more manageable callings to is to protect her. But she's one of the great heroines of our time. Extraordinary courageous woman who's been through a hell of a lot and who is never shirked from saying what she believes is wrong with modern Islam, so it, it is second nature to me to be there with her in that, in that fight, in that war. That's what it turns out to be. My warm. I always used to wonder as I was growing up, why is it that my generation isn't really been called on to fight wars the way my grandfather's generations were called on, and then it turned up. Then my water turned up.

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       You briefly mentioned this earlier when you were talking about ion and brandeis, but can you explain this intersection of Islamism and the left? How, why this has occurred. This confuses a lot of people. This idea of the oppression Olympics and you know, I've got plenty of theories on this that we've knocked out, but, but what do you think it is that has attracted something that is completely totalitarian and control with another thing that's so completely totally. I mean, I guess that's the answer right there, but.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       Well, there are many unholy alliances in, in history. And, uh, no, don't, many people will gravely, uh, surprised when the Ribbentrop Molotov pact was announced in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, you formed an alliance. So we shouldn't be entirely surprised when seemingly odd bedfellows jump into bed in the case of the Islamists and the left, I think it's pretty clear to me that the Islam, this are the, the leading partner and the leftists have broadly the useful idiots because the Islamists have a strategy. It's bare and Muslim Brotherhood and other documents for expanding their network in the west. And part of the strategy is the kind of a partnership that they have formed on campuses against, uh, against their foes. One way in which this is that you use the issue of Israel, uh, to forge the packs with the left. So you get the left's longstanding animosity towards Zionism, uh, and you essentially say, well, we entirely agree with you about that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       Let's, let's have an event about how wicked Israel is a. and so that's the gateway drug into accepting. The next thing is well headscarves or actually empowering for women. Don't you think? A and isn't actually Islamophobia to be in any way critical of sharia law. So you play the multiculturalists cultural relativist card and you again depict any critics of radical Islam as it is in fact, uh, engaged in some kind of orientalist project, a or essentialist project to other people always talk about othering in academia, uh, Muslims and you blur the distinction between Islam, Islam, Islam and Muslims as people. So this has been going on for awhile and the left as broadly fallen for it and it, to me, it's just astonishing. I remember looking at the list of academics who had, who had argued that they aren't, should not receive an honorary degree at Brandeis, and it included professors of Queer Studies, a female professors of gender studies.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       It's incredible. You kind of feel like saying to these people, have you taken a look at what the Muslim Brotherhood envisages have you read works? Do you realize that the project is the permanent demotion of women to second class status and potentially a capital punishment for gays? Is that something you are aware of? And I can only conclude that they aren't aware of it. And have been very thoroughly duped as useful. Idiots usually are. So is that basically because both of these movements wind power, so the useful idiot part of this is that Islam is a really just using the left who attain power and they're doing it all in the name of diversity and all of these things. And eventually, once that power is attained, then for lack of a better expression, I mean, you basically decapitate them and then you've got, they did it for you.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       They did the work for you. Yes. I mean, I always used to joke with a on that, uh, when we lived in Cambridge, it would be fun if all my enemies and all her enemies came and protested outside our house together because after about 20 minutes and they'd fall on one another and they would have the most tremendous fight. I do think that power is part of it, but if one looks back at the history of another intolerant to Talla Terry and ideology of Marxism, that there's a combination of power and a, a kind of idealism. One must call it that in the square and the tower. I tell the story of how the Soviet successfully penetrated the British establishment by recruiting spies and Cambridge and the people they recruited had leanings to the left that were inspired partly by revulsion at those aspects of of British imperialism or British society, that word in many ways a legitimately open to criticism.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       There was an idealism there at the beginning of guide Burgess's involvement in Marxism, sympathy with workers during the time of the Great Depression, but those were the useful idiots that the Soviet cynically recruited to be spies who, whom they persuaded to betray their countrymen in what was the single most successful act of of Russian espionage, of the mobile recruiting. These highly educated people from an credibly exclusive network, the Cambridge Apostles and the related network that led to Bloomsburg. This was a brilliant strategy. Something similar is going on here because I think there are a great many naive young people who are drawn to the rhetoric of social justice. I encountered them often. People who say, oh, there should be limits on free speech because I don't want such and such a such and such as feelings to be hurt. They're naive, they have a very naive view, somehow there can be a circumscribed form of free speech and no in which nobody's feelings get hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:52:00       That's not the pursuit of power. That's just naive city and the people who know how to explain that naive 30 are both people amongst the Islamists and people amongst the leftists who are pursuing power, but you can never really get to power without the useful idiots without the naive idealists who think that they're going to build utopia with your help. Yeah, and I don't have to tell you, they're usually ends up in Dystopia, right? So that, that's, that's something that it's hard to persuade people of y'all keep reflecting on the curious revival of, of Margaret Atwood's the handmaid's tale, which is always taken to be a vision of what happens when right wing people, uh, take over America. And to me, the amazing thing that is almost never observed is that something very like this has happened. Uh, it happened in Iran after 1979 and it happened after the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       So we don't need to fantasize about crazy evangelical fascists turning women into baby machines. This has already happened, but it was done by Islam as it was done by people pursuing an extreme version of, of, of Sharia. And yet almost nobody who enthuses about Margaret Atwood's book realizes that it is actually really quite powerful realization of what a theocratic Islam this regime does to women. All right, so I want to shift gears a little bit here and we can either. I'm going to let you choose. We can either go the historical root or we can go to the president route. What are you feeling first? I do want to do both. I think the key to apply to history, which is what I've spent my whole life doing, is that you do both and you can't do one without the other because no, you could have no real insight about the present without the past.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       So why don't we talk about the president and I'll try to show why to understand that you need history. All right, very good. So, uh, there are a couple of things that are interesting that you've staked out positions out over the past couple of years. Uh, we briefly, right before we sat down, we talked about brexit for a second. So you originally were for, were against brexit. Yeah. Then you came around for it. Now it seems to be in this odd limbo that I think unfortunately most people in America don't even understand what's, what's going on. I don't think most people in Britain, I'm sure. Um, so when I was reading your position on this, at first I thought, well, wait a minute as a, as a conservative and as someone that wants some autonomy over his country, I was somewhat surprised actually, that you weren't for it originally. So can you explain to your original position and then how you changed on it?

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       The two reasons why I was on the side of remain remain in the EU, uh, back in 2016. One was pure personal loyalty to friends up. David Cameron was prime minister. George Osborne was chancellor of the Exchequer and they, uh, friends of mine and I, I felt obliged as a friend to support them when they decided to stick with the EU or not to recommend brexit. Did that friendship supersede what your feelings were or was that because you really trusted what they could get into? Swung it. Okay. And I think the reason that I was willing to, to get on board with Romaine was that I found the arguments of the brexiteers deeply unconvincing. I remember one night sitting down and reading a lot of stuff by Daniel Hannan, one of the advocates of, uh, of leaving. And I remember thinking that this was just intellectually completely a foot class and unconvincing the, the notion that Britain would be better off economically outside the European Union wouldn't have passed muster as a, an undergraduate paper, another undergraduate paper.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       So I felt that the brexiteers case failed intellectually because they were claiming implausibly. I thought that you could have a free lunch, that you could leave the European Union and be better off. And that just seems to me to be intellectually completely deceitful. I think it would have been harder for me if they had said, honestly, this is going to cost quite a bit, but it's worth it because if we leave then we shall have the ability to control our borders and we shall have a autonomy at a time when Europe is pursuing a federalists course. But that wasn't the argument. The argument was that not the argument here, Wednesday get the money. This was the argument you had to get the money that we give to the European Union and we're going to be able to spend on the national health service because we will be in fact better off.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       And that was a lie and I'm not good with lies. It was a clever line. It worked politically. And I give credit to Dominic Cummings for crafting a message that was a pd both to conservatives and to Labor voters. The Conservatives got immigration control, Labor voters got the national health service, gets the money. So this is brilliant politically, but it wasn't mendacious I think at heart. And so I, I opposed the brexit when it happened. Uh, what struck me in the subsequent months was that while I had been one, I had been on the side that last, there was a good reason why we lost and the good reason was that we went around saying how much it was going to cost and I think we were right about that. I think ultimately at least some of what the Treasury said, well will turn out to be true about the cost, but that wasn't what people cared about. And when you went into pubs as I did in, in, in Wales and England and in Scotland, there was a question to which you could not give an honest answer without losing the debate. And I'll tell you what that question was because I was asked it multiple times. You'd make the case about the cost. Nobody was interested in the cost. They would say, listen Neil, about the one point 3 million Muslims, the Germans have just let in to Germany because that had just happened. If the Germans give them German passports, can they come here?

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       And the only honest answer to that question was yes. So immigration was the issue. And I think for a significant number of people in England and Wales especially was less so in Scotland where brexit was defeated.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       The realization was that Britain had lost control of immigration. The people had been promised net migration in the tens of thousands in the 19 nineties under the Blair government, and they'd ended up with net migration and the hundreds of thousands, they saw the chaos in Germany. They saw the waves of migration coming on in different Syria, but from all over North Africa and uh, and even so Asia. And they said, and I remember David Cameron using this phrase, get me out of here. And that was, that was the driving motivation for the brexit vote. And I think it was legitimate because I think that Anglia Merkle had made a catastrophic mistake and throwing open the gates. I think it will have consequences for the future of Germany and of Europe. And I do not blame British voters for saying forget about the cost of brexit. We really need to get out of this.

Speaker 1:          00:59:34       So I take the view by the end of 2016 that you had to, you had to respect the fact that ordinary people had cut through the crap of the debate and it got to the heart of the matter and the heart of the matter wasn't the cost of Brexit, which is what I had, I think mistakenly focused on prior to the referendum. What was it like for you as a public person and someone that writes about this stuff and put your opinions out there that have that realization? I think it's very important if you write regularly, if you are what we call a public intellectual, a to be willing to admit that you've been wrong. I think you have to be prepared to say I was wrong and I. I think I was wrong in the sense that what I wish I had done looking back was.

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       I wish I had said to David Cameron and George Osborne in the spring of 2016 when it was clear that the Europeans were going to make no meaningful concession on the immigration issue. When they basically sent an insulting proposal about what could be done about migration, that was the moment I should have said to cameron and Osborne, forget it. Yeah, you should campaign for Brexit if that's all they're going to offer you. If they're so completely oblivious to the very real concerns about immigration, then you should campaign for brexit instead of which we stuck with it and that was. That was David Cameron's great mistake. He should have said at that moment if that's all you've got, I'm going to recommend brexit to the voters and it would have saved him too. So. So you think it was just, it was just a bad negotiating play that he just didn't use some leverage to say we're going to have to walk away from this.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       There was, there was a moment when he should have walked away and I should have advised them to walk away. So yeah, I think one has to recognize when someone's made a mistake with such consequences. The second thing which is worth knowing about this is that the people who then inherited power after the fall of Cameron and Osborne, we're not the people who had campaigned for and one on racks and it was people who had been on the remain side. Theresa may became prime minister. Uh, I always knew that would be a disaster. I did not have high regard for her prior to the referendum. The Daily Mail essentially put her in that position and also Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and others because they bungled the leadership contest. So we then ended up with a terrible combination which was a commitment to Brexit, but it's execution in the hands of people who had been remainers.

Speaker 1:          01:02:11       And I think the result is the worst of both worlds because right now we essentially have the psychological reality of brexit. I think British public to a large extent has accepted that we are leaving, but the execution is a total mess by invoking article 50 early on the UK in essentially seated the, the power and the divorce to the European Union. And the concessions have come one after another. Ever since then and we now find ourselves in the odd predicament that I think Theresa May is saying that brexit means you ceased to be a voting member of the European Union, but you remain within the customs union potentially even within the single market and you accept all the rules and regulations of the European Union. You just don't have any power. If that's the end game, then it's a disaster so that the people that are trying to stop this now, they want to invoke some some pretty crazy extreme stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       Right? I mean there would be some really, very rarely if ever used rules. Am I right about this that would actually allow this to allow the state to occur. Well, listen, I think there's going to, without getting into all of them, I knew that there is a level of complexity in the discussions now in London that is bewildering to most ordinary procedure people when people start talking about Max Faq and the customs union complex. Confusing, right? Because I discussed it with Douglas Murray and he was even a little confused, so it's actually not confusing in the sense that what is happening is that Theresa May is trying to get Britain to accept the realities of a belonging to the European customs union, which would preclude Britain having its own trade policy, uh, with our leaving the European Union's decision making body. So essentially in that version, brexit is just a, you have the responsibilities, you just don't have any power anymore, which is definitely not what the British public was told that it was getting in, in brexit.

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       Uh, the, the bigger problem in my mind is not one that, that we've discussed. And that is that all of this will end in tears to the point at which Jeremy Corbyn, the most left wing leader of the Labour party has ever had in its history, becomes prime minister because Theresa May is leading the country towards this very unhappy compromise at some point. The people who truly believe in Brexit, Jacob Riis smog, for example, uh, perhaps Michael Gove, uh, they may decide when we can't ultimately accept this and the government, they may fall. But the problem is that if the government falls, then Jeremy Corbyn is prime minister. Uh, if the government doesn't fall and we go all the way to the finishing line with this Theresa May version of Brexit, then I think the Conservatives will lose the next election in 20, 22 and Jeremy Corbyn will be prime minister. So the worst are about brexit is in my view that if it is bungled in this way, it will open the door to a truly leftist government and that will be far more economically damaging than anything brexit has done.

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       And that's the nightmare scenario for me. And probably socially damaging and figures zillion other reasons deeply. We should be extremely suspicious of Corbyn and his people. They are committed Marxists. They've been on the wrong side of every issue in my lifetime with a possible exception of South African apartheid. And I do not trust them with the keys to 10 Downing Street because I think that their ultimate agenda is a truly revolutionary one, a, and it poses a threat to the fundamental liberties, the traditions of the constitution. It's a dangerous, dangerous prospect. And I'm much more worried about carbon that, about brexit.

Speaker 2:          01:06:02       I mean, this is how I feel about what's happening with our left in America to that you guys are giving us basically the

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       cursor to this. I think one of the lessons of history and now we can bring history in, is that with populism, you, you get two flavors in a typical backlash that would come after the financial crisis. Uh, the political establishment discredited. There's a backlash against inequality, uh, all of the things that typically follow a financial crisis. But there are two possibilities. There's the populism of the left, which is the tax, the rich solution, but the populism of the writers more potent because it says that it's about immigration. It's about globalization, it's about free trade. And so broadly speaking, there's a very good study that shows this afro big financial crises, the populace of the right. Do better because they offer a more plausible story, but if they don't deliver when they generally don't, because quite hard to make immigration control and terrorists pay quite hard actually to make your constituents better off with those policies, then the pendulum has a tendency to swing to the populism of the left and that has happened in Britain really quick because Corbyn became popular very soon after brexit. It's slower here, but the fear must be that are. If the trump experiment goes as wrong as the vast majority of of intellectual to expect it to. The pendulum will swing to the left of the Democratic Party. And that scenario seems to me more and more plausible are. And I don't think that's a. that's a not an appetizing then.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       That's genuinely scary to me. But I want to back up for one second because the moment that you had that, you said a few times happened in these pubs when you would go there and people would say this about one point 3 million Muslims in, in Germany. How do you. So, okay, so if you were listening to the mainstream media, they would say these people are all racist. That's what they would tell you. They're, they're racists and they're bigots. I suspect that's not what you think of these people, although there probably was a certain amount of people that are just racist and don't like people have a different color or a different culture. How do you even have that conversation? Because that's what so much of this is about because you, I'm sure we'd have a pint with these people and you'd talk to them and realize that they weren't racist. They were actually just worried about their future, which is legit. But if you can't have that discussion because every time you open your mouth, they tell you you're racist. Well then we know what you end up with. Look, I would be a very strange

Speaker 1:          01:08:41       if I took a bigoted view on this subject because I'm an immigrant. I'm in fact, it's about to become an American citizen. Uh, in a matter of weeks. My wife was a refugee who got from Somalia originally to the Netherlands by applying for asylum. Uh, and so we would be the last couple to take a kind of a bigoted view on the immigration issue because we're immigrants. When I had conversations on this subject at the time of the brexit referendum, I remember realizing that the opposition to immigration was not plausibly a racist because I remember somebody making the point that he was as worried about the people from Lithuania and Poland coming to Britain as he was about people from Syria and Iraq. Uh, and you probably know that people from Poland and Lithuania are pretty wide. So here's the thing, what we all read to recognize is that if immigration shoots up, if it grows from, in the case of Britain, 10,000 or $20,000 a year to 200,000 or 300,000 a year, perfectly unprejudiced, people will say, that's too much. This is going too fast. And that I think was the dominant argument. Of course there are people who are racists in any society. But the striking thing about Britain is actually that it's not a terribly racist place. Did you see many people protesting against Prince Harry's decision to marry an American of mixed mixed race?

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       I was there a couple of days before the delivery. Exactly. Were

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       huge crowds. This matches extraordinary popular with ordinary people. So I think it's hard to argue that racism played any meaningful part. Uh, the, the, the white supremacist element in Britain is really, is really very insignificant. And actually one of the ways in which the British like to define themselves is as being tolerant, uh, memories of the war of not entirely faded. Even as the wartime generation gradually disappears from the scene. What was the war against apart? It was a war against the ultimate racist state. What her Jeremy Corbyn the most in the last three or four months. The evidence that there are antisemitic elements within his faction of the Labor left that hurt him. And it's important that that argument being made because it has real truth to it. And I think ordinary people think that's no good. So I think this is not really about racism.

Speaker 1:          01:11:42       It's not about bigotry. It's about how rapidly should immigration occur, how large should flows be across borders, and the lesson of history is that if you allow a real surge in immigration, there will be a populous backlash against us. What happened in the United States in the late 19th century, the peak in the 18 eighties, the foreign born percentage of the population in the US was about 14 percent and gone up from relatively low level to about 14 percent. Same thing has happened in our time. It was down I think below seven percent in the mid 20th century, in the period after World War Two immigrants. We're a relatively small proportion of neat foreign born citizens were pretty small portion of the US population. And then from the 19 eighties onwards, the proportion surged and the character of the immigrants changed, uh, the places that they came from change.

Speaker 1:          01:12:33       And these changes are bound to elicit a reaction. It always happens and it's not enough for people in the liberal elites who by and large don't live in areas where immigrants come to say, what a terrible deplorable bunch of chauvinists you are for not wanting a, for not wanting more immigrants. That's simply that simply historically stupid. Uh, and the other thing that stupid about this in the United States is a, the people on the left who want to legitimize illegal immigration. Now, I think for many people who were attracted to trump, the issue was the illegal quality of the immigration. The rule of law is a big deal in the English speaking world, and people don't like to hear anything that simply says, amnesty for lawbreakers, or if you're a law abiding citizen and you'll suddenly told, well yet the law applies to you, but there are these other people it's not going to apply to.

Speaker 1:          01:13:27       Then your natural reaction is, screw this. That's why I thought one of his best lines, he doesn't use it as much anymore, but during the campaign were either a country or we're not. I thought was a really effective line. You either have laws or you don't. I mean, that in essence is the true. So let's shift to trump a little bit here. Um, I think that we're kind of in a similar spot with him, which is that it's better than the alternative, that that's certainly how I feel at this point, that all of the forces that we've spent the last hour plus talking about would be that much more emboldened against free thought and all and free expression and open inquiry and all the things that we care about and historical fact and, and everything else if he wasn't president. Right now, I am deeply ambivalent about all of this.

Speaker 1:          01:14:16       I think it's, it's very, very hard, uh, to say, uh, a good word about the personality of Donald Trump. I'm with you. I, I, it was a reason that I, I found it impossible to support him in 2016. I think one has to acknowledge that he has a used inflammatory language, uh, on the issues are, we've talked about immigration, uh, that he has a record of, of, of lying, which is a, even by the standards of American presidents. Pretty remarkable. Uh, and so the familiar list of things about Donald trump that most of my friends find objectionable is kind of hard for me to, to dismiss. But I said I'm bivalent for a reason. On the other hand, number one, what if he lost? I said this to Sam Harris a few weeks ago. Let's run the counterfactual. Let's just what historians should do. Let's imagine an alternative history. If Donald trump had lost the election by let's say, the same narrow margin that he wanted it, how would all those people who voted for him have felt, and how would they have behaved to my mind?

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       The election of Donald trump is a cathartic moment for those people. So despised by the liberal elites that they could refer to them as deplorables. The people who voted for Donald trump are not by and large are racists, are not by and large, uh, uh, anything like Donald Trump is personally. What attracted them to trump were two things, which as with the brexit campaign will legitimate. Number one, they were attracted to trump's policy positions on trade, on immigration, on Islam, at and on our, the somewhat a corrupt liberal elite that had been running the country for the previous eight years, so I think they were attracted to trump's policy positions, but they were also attracted to his cultural position and I think about half of American populism is cultural. What attracted the friends I have who supported trump to trump was his fundamental shift in language, away from the politically correct talking points of the political class, Republicans and Democrats alike, to a demotic normal way of speaking, such as you would here in the typical American bar, more or less anywhere in the country except Massachusetts, Stanford, California, and the rest.

Speaker 1:          01:17:13       Now, I, I remember thinking on the eve of the election, if you line up all the people who are going to vote for her and you line up all the people who are going to vote for him, which line would you rather be in? Remember at that point, I'm not a citizen. I don't know, and I thought, that's easy. I'm with the people who are so pissed with the political establishment that they're ready to take a chance on this guy because they see no other way to shake things up. The way my friend Jerry Blake put it to me, ex marine corps, Xn ypd never went to college, helps take care of my wife. Security. Jerry said to me early 2016 two things that stuck in my mind. First he told me trump was gonna win, but then he said the two reasons why he supported trump.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       Number One, he tells it like it is. Number two, he's going to shake things up by. He tells it like it is. Jared did not mean he is always truthful. What he meant was he talks like me by shaking things up. Jerry meant we have to do something because this system as it stands is not in my interests. It's not in my interests economically because it seems to favor China over the United States. Mexicans over a native born Americans the rich one percent over me, the median household, but he's also. It's also about this cultural reaction against the multiculturalism that has become the orthodoxy of the liberal left. So for all my reservations about trump, I completely got why people voted for him. And I think their reaction had he lost, we'd have been toxic. I don't think they would have accepted the legitimacy of the result. I think they would have bought the story, trump would have told them that the election being rigged, and I think we would have had a poisoned body politic from day one of the Clinton presidency if it all ends.

Speaker 1:          01:19:13       Oddly though we're having that right now, just in the reverse, right? It would have been worse, but we're having a left that's not accepting the legitimacy of the election. And I think it would have been worse. Yeah, I think it would have been worse. Uh, and I think, and this is another part of the story that for Jerry and his and his many, many fellow Americans who voted trump, this has always been a gamble and they've always had a sense that it could go wrong. You know, when you shake things up sometimes they break. And I, I sense that if it all ends in fiasco, which I guess that the vast majority of public intellectuals expect, and some combination of Watergate and other scandals, I think Jerry and his and his fellow American trump supporters will say, well, we gave it a try. Give it a try.

Speaker 1:          01:20:03       And I, I think that's, that's one possible scenario. The other reason that I am ambivalent about trump is that for all his flaws, in some ways he's doing a better job on foreign policy than his predecessor did a because trump has this superpower that most intellectuals can understand. He has an unerring instinct for the weakness of the counterparty that it's a kind of almost animal instinct. But some are Donald Trump can tell when the other side is weak. You could see it in Jeb Bush, you could see it in Marco. Rubio could see it in Hillary Clinton, and now I think he sees it in the Europeans. He sees in Angola Merkel, you don't pay enough for your defense. What if I walk out on NATO? Yeah. Well, the season Kim Jong UN and he sees it in Xi Jinping. He sees it in the, uh, in the supreme leader in Neuron.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       So my ambivalence is partly my sympathy for trump supporters, my fundamental sense of why they voted for him. But it's also that in some ways this disruption has its plus side in the way that it's repositioning the United States. I mean, I, to me, it's given oxygen to everything that we've talked about here. And that doesn't, that doesn't discount all of the legitimate concerns that you look. The big concern for me as I mentioned before, is that the pendulum swings the other way. If this all ends in tears, all of those who defended it, even if they defended it, halfhearted delight me, will be discredited. And the damage will be irreparable, uh, for conservatives and populists alike. The left we empowered and they will spend the rest of our lives telling us that we were apologists for the worst president. And that's, that's not a scenario that you can discount likely for a time.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       I think it was exhilarating are freely admit that for me, one of the most satisfying aspects of trump's victory was that all the people I most dislike in this contract, we're in a state of shock for weeks and I remember things that are. You know, it can't be all bad if the people. I really can't stand her in this state, but you have to. I think with history and mind, be conscious of the dangers of the fact that this could end so badly that it does irreparable damage and and the worst damage of all will be if it propels the left of the Democratic Party into power and that, that you can't reload. You can't really do that. The worst thing about studying history is that it makes you aware of under terministic that historical processes that there is always more than one future. Where's the future of trial as the future of tragedy and there's this kind of other future in the middle, which is a little bit of both and that's really one of the historical moment is bad for restful sleep on wakes up in the morning and I'm sure you have the same feeling wondering what alert will be on your phone and what message will be on your phone.

Speaker 1:          01:23:11       Will the alert say was broken out, will the alert say a palace coup and will the message say, uh, your reputation has just been a been destroyed by some accusation or other. So one wakes up in a state of anxiety in the United States of 2018. And that is a reality for that I think is inherent in both the culture war that we've spoken about and the trump presidency, which is in some measure a backlash against that. That culture war.

Speaker 2:          01:23:48       We're going to leave it at that, but I am going to demand that you come back. I don't think I've ever demanded that. I guess come back, I've been asked, but I'm legitimately demanding that you come back because next time I want to do, I want to just do all history and, and even even barely jump in. I want them to meet with the British empire stuff and Churchill and. Okay, I'm demanding it. Will you accept my demand except. All right. It took a long time to get you here but, but considering we're both two guys just off planes today and you're a, you're like 87 hours out of whack and jet lag and all the things we said will be taken out of context on twitter. Well, I sincerely hope everything because that's how you know, the whole thing goes. This has truly, truly been an absolute pleasure and thank you for doing this and send my best. Of course. Diane. Sure will. And uh, for more Neil, you can follow him on twitter, although you don't fight with people that much on twitter, which means, which means you have strong moral character. I decided the jungle warfare was not the way to go. He's a wise man and it's at an F E R G U S.
