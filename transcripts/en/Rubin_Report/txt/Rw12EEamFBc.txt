Speaker 1:          00:02          Joining me via skype this week is Ayaan Hirsi Ali. I hope that most of you already know ion, but in case you don't, her story is truly an incredible one that takes her from a childhood in Somalia to an elected member of parliament in Holland to a fearless free speech advocate, a hated by both the extreme right and the regressive left. We'll dive deeper into her life's incredible journey shortly, but before we do that, I wanted to take a moment to talk about why people like Ian actually matter. As our show has gained momentum here, I realized that what we're doing is really becoming an influential force for the things that I believed that mattered, namely the battle of ideas, free speech, and liberal values. At the end of the day, though, I want this to be about more than talk because the repercussions of these ideas that we're talking about aren't just abstract notions.

Speaker 1:          00:50          There stark realities for so many people. I had Hirsi Ali as a survivor in every sense of the word. She survived. Genital mutilation is a child. She survived a forced marriage to a cousin. She survived the cold blooded murder of a friend in broad daylight in Amsterdam and subsequent death threats. Many people would've given up after any of these horrific events. Many people would have just accepted that this is what life has given them and remain quiet. Many people right this very second are doing just that. By the way, I find no fault with these people who remain silent under such subjugation. They see no way out and sadly, even though it's in the secular world who want to help them fear the repercussions if they speak out, not ion though she has bravely and boldly fought for women's rights, brought the issue of female genital mutilation out in the open and relentlessly made her life story a cause bigger than herself.

Speaker 1:          01:41          It's easy to sit back and privately talk about these things or tweet about them from the comfort of your own home, but she's actually out there putting her life on the line after they already tried to take it from her. I want to be very clear here that when I talk about these issues, I'm talking about ideas and not people. This seems to be a major sticking point in this conversation and I really hope that we can eventually get past that, not just for the health of the debate, but for all the young people currently being indoctrinated with this ideology. Imagine if a political party had a platform that included female genital mutilation, forced marriage and death for apostates. Absolutely insane and ridiculous. Right? Well, guess what? Religious ideas, cultural ideas, any ideas deserve the exact same scrutiny no matter how uncomfortable it makes us. I for one, would rather live in a society that deals with uncomfortable truths out in the open, then one that leaves huge portions of people alone in the dark. I'm here with Ion Hirsi Ali, human rights activist and author of the new book heretic. Why Islam needs a reformation? Now I am welcome to the show. Thank you. Thank you dave. Thank you for having me on. So I'm going to show all my cards right upfront here. I'm such a huge admirer of yours and I think you've done such good work and, and your story's amazing and your, your bravery is amazing. So I'm going to hold nothing back and just set us off on that, on that good welcoming note. Is that okay with you?

Speaker 2:          03:07          Thank you. Thank you for having me on again, and we'll thank you for everything you said.

Speaker 1:          03:13          So, uh, there's a ton that I want to talk to you about and so many of the things that your life is an example of are the things that we've been talking about on the show here for months now. And I know many of my guests have been people that you're friends with and, and coworkers with and I've done speeches with, um, but your story is the most unique and most interesting. And I want to talk about the book, but I thought we could just spend about 10 minutes just sort of on your biography and I know you've, you've discussed it a lot and that's one of the books is about, but if you could, it's so illuminating to sort of how you got here. So if you could just tell me a little bit first about growing up in Somalia and uh, let's just start with that.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Well, I was born into a Somali Muslim household and if I look at my journey from, I was born in 19, 69 November, my family went to Saudi Arabia, we lived in Ethiopia, we lived in Kenya, and then I went to the Netherlands and now I live in the United States of America. I think if you look at my geographical journey, there's really nothing unique about it today. People from all over the world moved to different places, learn different languages and adapt to different situations. I think that what Western is a find interesting, intriguing, and maybe in some ways disconcerting is the intellectual journey. Uh, I was raised as a Muslim. I was raised in a clan or tribal society and the model framework that prevails there is that of honor and shame and it's a different kind of honor and shame from what we believe here in the West, which is, you know, as a little girl at the age of five, my genitals were cut and when I was old enough to ask why did that happen?

Speaker 2:          05:05          My grandmother was very, you know, she really explained it as well. We purified you and if you are not purified, you will never find a husband. So that kind of practice is, and it isn't something that happened only to me. It happened to happens according to the United Nations number is two 98 percent of Somalis, Egyptians, Sudanese. Uh, so that's one thing that people find fascinating. How could you have India with something like that and come out a cultural context like that. And then fast forward, when I'm 22 years old, my father returns from a long journey. He was, he had left at this for 10 years in Kenya, a country that if you're a Somali, you feel you know, you are in a foreign country, comes back and he feels he has the show as my father to marry me off until the first student, the first guy who comes along and says, you know, I'm off the same clan as you. I'm looking for a wife, which go would you like to offer? And then I'm the one who offered. So to Western as that seems pretty straight,

Speaker 1:          06:09          this person, just to be clear that this person was a distant cousin of yours, right? Which probably wasn't that abnormal for, for that area.

Speaker 2:          06:16          Absolutely not. In fact, the closer the kinship, the better because the only way to make sure that family members are loyal to one another. Share wealth, don't mistreat one another, is to try and marry within the same family as much as possible. Obviously with all the genetical problems, but that's not what we were looking at. But that's it. That's the context. You know, your, your roles as a male, as a female that's given as a female you can bring shame not only on your father and mother, your brother and sister, but the extended family as well. And even extended religion. And so I think what is fascinating for most Western as is how could you that intellectual journey. How come? Once I believed in all of that, I lived it and now I, I'm saying, you know, as an individual you have a right to be free, to choose who you want to marry. You don't have to cut off the genitals of girls for them to be married. You don't even have to be mad if you don't want to, because as an economic security, as a woman in the western context where there is the rule of law, what is freedom and where there's this wonderful education systems. I was a go. You can actually choose what you want to do in life. You can map out your own destiny.

Speaker 1:          07:39          Yeah, and that's, that's why I love your story so much and why I find you so inspirational because you're, you're truly living, breathing proof that things can change and that people and girls, especially from this part of the world can have a different life. And that's why I find it so wonderful. But let's just back up for just a second. On the female genital mutilation. When, when this happened to you, um, did you immediately, and you spoke to your grandmother and all this, but did you immediately questioned everything I to be that age and go through something like that? How long, how long did it take before you really were questioning everything about your life?

Speaker 2:          08:18          At the age of five, I didn't question it at the age of 10, I didn't question anything at the age of 20, but I didn't question anything. But there's always, as you grow up, and I remember for me, um, in, in, in terms of evolving as you're evolving from childhood to maturity, it was the ages of 14, 15, 16 when I want to know, you know, what's the point of this life and why are we put on rf and is it only to reproduce? We're at that point in my family, I, we're going through a lot of adversity and it is what is the point, what is the point? So instead of being suicidal, I joined the Muslim Brotherhood because they make the point so very clear. You've been put on this earth to be by God to be tested for your absolute submission. You're going to be tested as a female in various ways and as a male in various ways.

Speaker 2:          09:13          And you just have to say yes to that submits and on your points and for your audience. I'm just going to give you one interesting, um, way in which, how do they, how, how does one even manipulate that as a believing Muslim? How does one know that you know you're doing what God wants you to do? You have two angels on either side of your shoulders. When you're hide side, you have an angel that notes down minute by minute, second by second you have good intentions versus you have bad intentions. So we're not here. We're not even talking about what you say before you say it, but on top of that, that same angel also notes Don what you say, and then your behavior and on your left, same thing. Everything that you do that is strong, that angel is doing the book keeping and you will live, and at some point you die.

Speaker 2:          10:14          And then there is the here after this, the Day of Judgment. And we're told as Muslims, no one can escape that you're, oh God. And His tribe, you know, you'll be for God and his tribe. You know the prophets, the angels of all his other human beings. And those two books are going to be put on a scale and if you afraid handbook weighs heavier than your left hand book, you go to heaven and if you are left, handbook goes weighs heavier, you go to hell. And you know as you grow up, it's especially with the radical Islamisation of or things. These things are made so explicit to you and you become so aware of them. It's like in the west, it's like taking, keeping track of your calories.

Speaker 1:          11:04          Well, it's interesting because even the way you're describing it, there's sort of a whimsical miss to the way you're describing it because now as a secular person, it sounds so ridiculous to you. And yet there's literally millions of people that believe in this in a, in a literal sense.

Speaker 2:          11:20          Absolutely, absolutely. And you know, you're young, you trust your parents, your teachers, your and Islam is your religion and religion. I mean, I know that all human beings who are religious are taught that the criteria, you know, the framework, what, how do we know the difference between what's right and what's wrong? Religion tells us that. And so as a Muslim and Islam is a way of life, you are told that this is the difference between right and wrong and these things are spelled out that which is forbidden her on that which is permitted. Hello. And so then it's up to you. There's a level of, there's a level of choice in there, you know,

Speaker 1:          12:01          it sounds like, it sounds like the guy on your shoulder already knows your intentions anyway. Right?

Speaker 2:          12:07          Exactly. So even if you abstain, they still. Angel's still knows you want to indulge.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Wow. Alright. So I want to talk a lot about. I want to talk. It's funny that it seems funny to you now. I'm, I'm glad to see that. And you have a beautiful smile so it's nice because you've, you've come out of this. So it really is nice. So I just want to do one more thing on your bio and then we can, we can get into some of the specifics about the doctrine and things sort of in your life after that. Um, so you, you made political asylum in the Netherlands, you then became member of parliament. This is an incredible story of success and you know, with all the refugee things going on in Europe right now, there's a lot of parallels to that. You found safety and became successful and influential and went on to talk about female genital mutilation and women's rights and all this incredible stuff.

Speaker 1:          12:55          But here, of course I have to mention that then Theo van Gogh was doing a movie based on a script that you wrote and he was killed by a Muslim extremist in broad daylight in Amsterdam at 9:00 AM in the morning. And as if that wasn't horrific enough, the person that killed him pinned a death threat to you on this person's body. Now I know, I know you've talked about this a lot and I know people hear things like this and I don't think he quite gets to them. You know, it sounds like a movie sort of. Right? And so I just want you to talk about a little bit about it specifically, but also just the feeling that it left you with the sort of terror. Because it's one thing to say these things happen, but you're, you're a person that these things actually happen to.

Speaker 2:          13:44          Well, in a way I have to say the difference between a Theo fungo and myself was that I believed in those threats. I didn't know exactly what the individuals who were threatening me would do. So two years prior to a theo's death, I started to take all kinds of security precautions and when he and I were working together, I kept saying to you, you know, I know it sounds surreal in a Dutch context. I think he would tell me over and over again, do you know the last thing in the Netherlands, someone was killed because of what they believed in, and he would give me years from the 17th century like we, we had Dutch, this is the Netherlands, we don't do that sort of thing, so relaxed,

Speaker 1:          14:31          let's do this. And that was actually true because. Because Holland was an incredible place of mixed cultures and religions and ethnicities and all that. Right? Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          14:42          And it wasn't only that, it was also in the wider Europe when in hundreds of years ago to a 17th century, 18th century, when on religious grounds people would face in tolerance, so much as to threaten their lives, thinkers, creative people. They would go to the Netherlands and they would get a sanctuary. And so for him it was for Theo, it making this film, it wasn't about that, it was about preserving what he knew was his culture, his civilization, and really not just Dutch civilization. I think civilization with a capital c when human beings can discuss and, uh, can disagree without having to threaten with force, right?

Speaker 1:          15:29          So in a bizarre way by, by them killing him instead of you in a, in a weird, I know this sounds perverse or something, but that was more of a direct attack on Holland, right? Because they were going after one of their own, so to speak,

Speaker 2:          15:44          so to speak. And I had, I had accepted the perimeters that the government puts me within, you know, a security framework, which was a really is something that I would never ever accept anything like that because these security measures a cattail, you have freedom to a degree that you are not free. And Him I'm never going to accept that. And he wanted to prove to them it is not having to put a shell around the people who are practicing free speech. That is not the answer. The answer is to openly discuss these things and make them open. If these people are provoked by what is that was that particular film was this is what the Koran says about women. This is how it's put into practice. That's what we need to be talking about. Why we shouldn't be talking about security. And he gets killed.

Speaker 2:          16:32          And I think by doing the murderer killed Theo fungo and that incident confronted Dutch society and Dutch leadership. And I think the wider European Western leadership with, you know, we can all go around saying, talking about the First Amendment, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, all of this. That. And the other, but what are we willing to do to preserve it? And he, he has left us with that question and I'm disappointed to say that so far we haven't done that much because as you know, this year, the beginning of this year, the cartoonists in Paris or killed and the threats to free speech continues and if government policies are anything to go by, it seems as if they are telling us it's best not to provoke them.

Speaker 1:          17:20          Yeah. All right. So I really want to focus on that because that's been one of, you know, this free speech, uh, and political correctness. It's become this perfect storm that's actually strengthening everything that it should be against a. But just to put a final cap on your bio and all that. What was it like for you? I mean really at the, at the personal level, when, when he was killed, did you want to just disappeared? Did you want to leave the country? Did you want to give up? Because now you've lived for these last. How many years ago was this? This was

Speaker 2:          17:48          this for,

Speaker 1:          17:50          right? So you've lived for these last 11 years honoring everything he stood for, but I'm sure there must have been a time when you thought, let me just get out of this. Right?

Speaker 2:          17:58          Well, I think it every day. I think it all the time. It's so tempting to just think, you know, I've done enough. I'm, I'm. This is my age. I'm 46 years old next month. Uh, there's nothing for me in it personally, but it's, I think it's what high accident made the difference between being comfortable, which if I just disappeared and changed my name, I would be very comfortable versus actually living, which is when you're challenged and when civilization is challenged, when our freedoms are challenged, we always rely on those who stand up for it and those who wanted to push their agenda through intimidation, through force. They know that their argument is very weak. Otherwise, why would they avoid discussion? Why is it difficult for them to showcase what the Quran and Allah and Heidi's the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed and the Jewish food ins and the practice of Islam says about women in essays to women. Why are they afraid of women? All women had a 100 percent the freedom to choose. And if your message is superior, why not? Why not allow people to just choose for it?

Speaker 1:          19:19          One of the things we've really focused on here is what I'm now calling and what Majid new eyes has coined as the regressive left. That there, there are people I come from the progressive world, that that's where I've been for these last couple of years and it's only really in the last six months that I've had my own awakening that I realized it was my guys. It's my guys on the left that are trying to silence people like you in silence. People like Sam Harris and, and modular and all of this. And uh, and I've had salmon. I've had my jacket on and I include you in that. Um, and I think partially I think that Sam said that party or my agent said the part of his awakening was after a debate that he had with you. Um, what do you make of this coming from the left? Because the left is supposed to debate ideas, right? We're supposed to be about ideas free thought and yet it's those very people who are trying to silence you. I, I'm amazed by this.

Speaker 2:          20:16          I think what I've seen and I could be wrong, is that what the left does is they put all the emphasis on justice, the concept of justice and maybe what the rights rather classical liberals because those are the people I identify with and in the US, they are called conservatives, sometimes libertarians. But um, what classical liberals do is they put the emphasis on freedom. And I was exposed to these concepts between say 1995 when I go to the University of flight and until 2000 and then 2001 something happens that makes me intent on testing these ideas. And what I have discovered like many people before me, and I think you will as as you grow, is that there is no justice without freedom. And so if you accept and that is freedom from coercion, freedom from being forced into doing something you don't want to do or using the tools of state to make individuals to do something they don't want to do. Or with government failing art, you know, having one individual take the freedom of the other individuals. But if you have no freedom then you will have no adjustments.

Speaker 1:          21:32          Yeah. So, so I'm with you on just to see secondary. Right? So what do you make of the tactics that they use because there's been so much. We've talked about it so much, but so much lying and smearing about people's views including your own. Even when I, when I've just tweeted that I'm having you on the show. Fortunately because we've built something good here. I think, you know, 80 percent of it was positive, but a lot of people she's racist. I mean they're telling me that you are racist. So what, what do you make of the tactics that they're using? Because I do think they think they're doing something lofty. They think they're there helping the downtrodden or something like that when in actuality they're strengthening the very people that they should by definition be against

Speaker 2:          22:13          and I think that is because if you put the emphasis on justice, you are by definition going to start talking about groups and collectives. Groups in abstract. You belong to a group for a short period of time. You're a member of whatever you are, collective you are a member of for a certain amount of time but freely all the time. You are an individual. So the basic arguments I used to have with the left and I started out in the Netherlands was okay, so you want to protect the culture and the religion of this collective and this collective is saying, if we don't practice our religion the way we used to back at home, we are just not happy. We feel deprived when we feel persecuted, we don't feel at home and that has all kinds of psychological effect on the entire group. But what about the individual?

Speaker 2:          23:01          What about the individual goal? Who's removed from school? What about individual girl who's forced into a marriage where she's consistently rate, she can't reach out to her parents because they put her in that situation. Her husband thinks he has a right. What about that individual? Right. What about the individual right to say, I don't want to do this. I want to do something else and you're forcing this individual into doing that and these constitutions in liberal countries is all about heck. Organizing that individual freedom and aspiring to protect it as much as possible, and so what I tell my left wing friends and I have a lot of them because a lot of them have good intentions and they're progressive and they want to stand up for the poor. The downtown.

Speaker 1:          23:43          It doesn't feel the same way. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          23:45          it is. Just to take them back to that unit so that they can empathize with. If you're gay and you're on the left and on the one hand you belong to a movement. You're fighting for the right in America to marry, but on the other hand, you're also fighting for the rights of some minority collective to do what ever they want. To the individual members, shouldn't you be thinking about the plight of the individual members, those who can't voice their wishes and those who if they do have to deal with consequences, so die, and I'm not talking about death and threats, I'm talking about your father looking you in the eye and tell him you're no longer my daughter. I disown you. You control yourself up in the mosque you are not invited to, so you are shunned. And think of the psychological impact of that on the individual who chooses to have a lifestyle that is not in sync with seventh century lifestyle.

Speaker 1:          24:43          Right? And that lifestyle, whether they're gay or a or just a woman, is what is what the progressive should always be fighting for. And that's the ultimate irony in this.

Speaker 2:          24:54          The ultimate irony, these women that I. I mean this is my background. I wanted to be free to determine my own destiny. I didn't want to marry the man. I was first in to Mary. I wanted to find my own mate in life. I wanted to work and I wanted to finish my education and I was still. That's going to bring shame on us. Now with the emphasis on us, that is the group, the collective, so it's always you, the individual, the unit, and you're constantly being told you're so selfish. You're bringing down the whole family, the whole clan, the whole group and a in. And here's the irony. I think it used to be the left that would take up the defense of the weak and now unfortunately we live in a time when it is the left that has decided to define week units as groups, not individuals.

Speaker 1:          25:49          So, so what can we do? So what can we do? People, people in the public sphere with a voice that care about people on the left. They're not even people I left that care about liberal values. What can we do? Because when I see the tactics and the way they treat you guys, I even, I've asked this to Sam and Majid, I said, you know, there must be this piece of you that wants to get out and that's why I asked you to. And I partly think that the reason that they do it is they want to do enough damage to you guys and people like you so that everyone else. It's not about you. You know what I mean? Like they'll get rid of you. You'll just say, okay, I can't do this anymore and that. But it's the chilling effect for everyone beneath you. So how, how do we fight this?

Speaker 2:          26:33          It's above the utopia. I think what we have to do is we have to expose the fact that they are after a utopia, this whole justice thing, the, you know, life would be wonderful if we had to. Sharia law, all of us. It's just uncovered their message really would we? And I think if you are a liberal, you have to revisit the basic principles of liberalism. And it was about individuals. That is how the aristocracy was put in its place back then when there was, you know, I have all of these rights because I happened to belong to this family and you're all surfs and you serve as, as aristocrats because you happen to belong to that collective. It wasn't about that. It is about individual freedom when it was about, you know, fighting slavery, you have to recognize the other person who was the slave as a fellow human being and as an individual fighting for women's rights.

Speaker 2:          27:30          You had to recognize women as fellow individual human rights in human beings and the whole concept of human rights is based on the individual and the freedom of the individual and we know that we are social animals and are social animals and as individuals within our families and within our communities, within our workplace, we have to negotiate that sweet spot, that space where you can say, I can be me and and this is how I can serve my community and this is how my community can serve me, but all of that is not going to work if individual liberty is compromised and unfortunately the people who have inherited these systems, America, Europeans are the free countries. They're compromising that because they think it's so. There's this collective collective and this story, that narrative. It is.

Speaker 1:          28:22          Think it's. They think it's a lofty goal somehow, but I do. I do. Do you sense that the tide is turning? I feel like, you know, the social justice warrior thing and this whole movement, I feel like it's been gaining strength for the last five years, but I do think partly because of Charlie Hebdo and sort of the general absurdity of so much of it online and you know, Brandeis University saying that they're not going to give you an honorary doctorate. I mean the, the height of absurdity to not give you an honorary doctorate after they said they would do it. That I do sense that the tide is turning. I. Am I just being optimistic there or do you feel that?

Speaker 2:          28:59          I think what we're seeing is more and more confrontations that really pronounce this, this struggle and I think one of them is Israel versus the Arab Muslim world. Uh, he, he is a liberal country. It's a democracy for goodness sake. And, and we find a outside is telling them what they can and can't do. Who Do you know in the United States of America, if we had people throwing rocks at us, knifing us. If you had the leadership of the opposition saying, you know, take a knife, take a car, take whatever weapon you can go after them, we would find it completely and deal with it appropriately. But when Israel desert, we demonized and vilified Israel. So in a weird way, that's one way, but that's one example. Yeah. And then we have more examples and you've mentioned magic and myself and all the other, uh, what I, I don't know what is the right time to use Muslim reformers, Muslim modifiers, Muslim heritage.

Speaker 2:          30:03          I think that is the right word. Heretic is you're on the inside, you start to ask questions and then you'll fight and shunned by this group because they don't want to change or because they have an agenda for Sharia and the Caliphate and Jihad and you stand up to that and then they'd go after you. So we're seeing so many of these confrontations in so many different levels. And I think the mistake is that you know, if, if you're a socialist in the United States, think you know you're a Bernie Sanders and you're hiding for president and you are Donald Trump and you're running for president, you can say the most ridiculous things in the world. Nobody's going to kill him and nobody expects you to be killed. And if you are attacked, if any violence against these two right now, these two extremes, the American population is going to meet that with such rejection and it's going to be reviled and we have to teach the rest of the world that it is possible to disagree and to disagree radically, but not use violence. Less violence is used.

Speaker 1:          31:04          That's an interesting thought because we always think or I think that our system is so broken here. Our political system is so broken and we can't get things done properly in our discourse is so silly and cable news, but actually the way you just said that, that look, you have these two people who were, couldn't be further from each other. Trump and sanders, the ultimate capitalist, the ultimate socialist, and yet they're not. There is no threat. There's no credible threat to their lives. Right? So that does show that we have something pretty good about our, our Western society. I know it's not cool to say that, but that's the truth, right?

Speaker 2:          31:38          That's the truth. And it's, it goes even more than that. We also expect them to shake hands on stage. We expect them to be civil to one another and they can disagree as much as they like, but you know why he is the general public, uh, say the establishment Republicans. Why are they angry with Donald trump? I don't think it's because of his ideas. Sometimes just because of the way he speaks. That goes a little tool five gets too close to, you know, uncivilized behavior, violent behavior. Let's not do that. There is, is a culture here where, yes, people are violent. There's a lot of, there are a lot of guns out there and people use these guns, but mainstream Americans expect mainstream Americans to behave in a certain way. And it's not a culture that says, let's not disagree. We know we all disagree.

Speaker 2:          32:28          Say the system is broken or it's the human being that's fragile. We disagree. What we have is a system where you can have these disagreements and these and you can change your mind or you can go as radical as you please, but you are not expected to use violence and the government is there to protect you and with people putting question marks on the first amendment. The two different things is one part of it is you know, we can disagree with one another as much as we like, but there's a system here. There's an infrastructure that allows us to disagree with one another without the use of violence. If you start putting question marks on the first amendment, in other words, you know, defamation laws, there are some religions or there are some icons that you may or may not criticize. Then you are really eroding the system.

Speaker 2:          33:20          You're bringing down the system and this system is superior to any other system I've ever seen any other system in history. So our job is, and here's where people like you and me and Sam and magic seeing it's. We've got to be careful that the government does not enact lows where some ideas cannot be criticized and religion is just an idea. It may be to you and everything, but to me it's just an idea and all ideas can be criticized. It makes your idea on the stronger, but we're not. Yeah, we must not challenge the. Doesn't erode the system that makes that possible, so I'm. I'm a first amendment fundamentalist if you want.

Speaker 1:          34:08          If you're going to be a fundamentalist of some kind, I suppose that that's the one to be so I know a lot of people will, as I said earlier, they'll call you and Islamophobia. They'll tell Majid who's Muslim and Islamophobia. What do you make of the meme of Islamophobia? Because at one time I feared that the government was going to come for our free speech, so infringing on our First Amendment. Bottom. Now fearing is that we're taking it away from ourselves by what the universities are doing and by every debate ends in someone being called a racist. Right? We know what's happened to Sam that were due. It's not the government, but it's the use of words to stifle debate.

Speaker 2:          34:47          We're doing it ourselves. You know? Uh, when the Charlie Hebdo incident happened, I expected all newspapers in the free world, all televisions, the whole media, to stand in solidarity with them and republish those cartoons to show them this is what we do. This is what we are about. It's an idea. And the Islamophobia meme, if you want to, first of all, you know, to, to criticize an idea is not to be phobic. Islam is a religion. It's a faith. It's a set of beliefs. It's an idea. It's not the people. Muslims are very diverse and many of them disagree on many things, including the position of Muhammad, including whether Marvin should be drawn or not drawn, criticized, not criticized. So given all of that, yes, you're right. It's not only the government, we shouldn't, of course the government is lobbied by 57 member nations of the Organization of Islamic Conference that through the United Nations and other international bodies is trying to make them adopt laws that leave Islam out of that realm and discussing ideas and criticizing ideas. But it's not only that we're doing it to ourselves, schools are doing it, the education system, um, the press, um, even individually, I think that some of it is because we are scared because we think, you know, we don't want it to be, we don't want to be short, we don't want to be killed,

Speaker 1:          36:13          which is just what they want, right? They want the. Because the fear is as powerful, if not more powerful perhaps than, than murdering somebody. Right?

Speaker 2:          36:21          Absolutely. Absolutely. That's the whole point of terrorism is to. They want to get what they want. So this is. So I would like to promote the idea that men and women are equal and should be equal before the law. I want to get into every Muslim community and promote that idea and I know it's an uphill battle, but for me to do that, my life is not safe enough for the Islamic extremists. They wanted to promote the idea among Muslim American citizens and others that women and men should behave in a certain way. They can take advantage of all the freedoms that we have, freedom of religion, of association of expression. And I give them that, why can't I do the same, why is my government not protecting me to promote my message, which is 100 percent aligned with our constitution.

Speaker 1:          37:16          Yeah. It's so fascinating because it's so many levels of, of craziness. I, I suppose. Um, so I think part of the issue also is that people get a little lost in the, in the definition of terms. Um, so could you explain the difference between the doctrine of Islam? So sort of the religious side of it versus what political Islam is. Because I think that that split in itself I think has many people very confused. And that's why I'm trying to use this show to get people just to understand the basic tenants of all this stuff because maybe that will remove a bit of where everyone says this is about bigotry and racism and things like that.

Speaker 2:          37:55          Okay. So in the seventh century, a man called Mohammed comes with a message. So man, Mohammed the message, submit to one God, forget about all your other got submits to a, my God, the one who spoke to me and they're in that cave called a hero and a bunch of people say this mighty is crazy, what are going to abandon our gods? And he carries on. So for the first 10 years, what he is preaching is my God requires you to pray too fast to look after the poor, to be charitable. A lot of the things he was saying in those fast 10 years would fall under what you and I and a lot of Americans and Europeans understand as religion. You believe in these things and maybe something good will happen. Maybe something good, you know you can mobilize. If you look after the orphans, I mean what's wrong with that?

Speaker 2:          38:48          That's great, right? And then the next 10 years of his life, he moves from Mecca to a place called Medina and he starts to put together a militia and he starts to wage war. Small wars that he wins that get bigger and he starts to concrete and concrete. Of course, all that goes to his head and from then on the second 10 years of Mohammed's life, that's when political Islam comes about. On the first 10 years he was saying, please reconsider. Think about having all these many, many gods. Give them a come to my one. Gordon would be your choice to do it from Medina onwards. You had to do it had to happen at the tip of a sword and every victory strengthened him and his followers in doing that and that happened for centuries afterwards. So a lot of the people today who are using Islam as a political tool to get people to do what they want them to do.

Speaker 2:          39:44          A following Muhammad in this example. That is. That is why Mohammed is relevant. That's why he needs to be discussed to be drawn. Who was he? Did he really live? Is this really what he said? If he said so, was it really more moral? We should discuss Mohammed the way we discuss Hannibal, Julius Caesar, you know this will water is of the past. They Alexander the Great. They established all these empires and then now the historical figures. That's how and it can we, can we do that in 21st century America without having our own demand around me all the time without fearing for our lives.

Speaker 1:          40:32          Unfortunately, I know that the answer is to that,

Speaker 2:          40:34          and by the way, a lot of people on the left, liberals, well intentioned, wonderful, wealthy liberals think that the way that they can make Muslims as a minority feel at home in America is by respecting the icon and I think the best respect that they can pay to the icon is to put him along with all those other icons of the past.

Speaker 1:          40:57          Isn't that what Bill Maher refers to that as the soft bigotry of low expectations that somehow we have to treat these people differently. I want, you know, I want everyone to be treated as Shitty as everyone else. It's about treating them well. Treat everyone equally crappy that will be good for me

Speaker 2:          41:15          and, and bail my, his, you know, his own clients. He is one of those few liberals who is saying, I'm not going to make an exception for my fellow American sentiment. Why would I? I want them to be. I see them as equals and he knows there are a lot of Muslim Americans laugh at his jokes and who love him, but they have to hide that from the Islamic extremists inside of their families and their communities. So that's. Yeah. And it's our job to emancipate them by saying I'm, I, I, I'm not in Pakistan or Afghanistan or Somali or Egypt. I'm now in America probably in La and I want to laugh at my luck. His jokes.

Speaker 1:          41:55          Yeah. That's the crazy part, right? That Bill Maher when it comes to this discussion, is really being treated like a pariah by the regressive left and they're calling him. And Sam, of course racist because of that whole Ben Affleck thing. But we've spent so much time on that. I don't want to get into that specifically, but, but look what they've done to build.

Speaker 2:          42:14          I want to say why, why doesn't Ben Afleck play the parts of Mohammed the grade or something like that.

Speaker 1:          42:22          That would be something, right? He had no problem playing a fallen angel in dogma, which was all about Christianity. But I guess it's a little different in this case. Um, so, uh, one of the, one of the other things when I tweeted about you was that a couple people said, how could you have her on? She's a neo-con that the urine neo-con are you neo-con ion.

Speaker 2:          42:45          What if, if somebody explained to me was an near Connie's, I might decide to be any record or not.

Speaker 1:          42:51          All right? So I think, I think what people are saying is that the neocons, they really think of the neocons as the sort of George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney nation builders. This idea that America can exert its influence to nation build. And I think they, they lump you in on that. Um, take it away.

Speaker 2:          43:13          It's a position in felt foreign policy that if you are going to intervene and uh, and you remember right after 9:11, you know, if we go out to, as the United States of America, we know we've been attacked from Afghanistan. We get into the affairs of that country. How do we leave it now? There were people who were saying, we don't just go in and destroy and get the bad guys and get out because we leave the situation far worse than we found it. We have a responsibility to rebuild and it's going to cost us a lot of blood and treasure. If those are the neocons, count me in on them. The fact that such a thing is really quite murky and it takes a long time, but I find that position to be more noble than the position we are in now, where we're going to go and get rid of the feet and degrade and defeat isis by bringing together people who really have never fought and have them be defeated and offer some airpower and just mock it up and muddle through.

Speaker 2:          44:18          When the neocons were in charge. If that is president George W Bush, he did make huge mistakes early on, but after the surge in Iraq was under control and the rats lived in relative fees, we didn't have to pull out. These are political positions and this is policy and you can say, what do you like about the marriage of the policy? But I think it is wrong to put labels on their foreheads, of people as neocons and this and that. It's not. There are a bunch of people who thought about what would happen after you leave the place. Uh, and, and again, I still think it's more responsible once you invade a place to stay there until things are in order instead of pulling out two, three years into it.

Speaker 1:          45:02          Right. And I guess that's the irony is that, you know, we know in retrospect that the Iraq war was based on faulty logic, but when, when we were there, it was better than it is now. And that's just a sad reality and that doesn't mean we should be there forever. But, you know, we look at the United States, we're in this weird thing, we do things, people hate us, we don't do things and look what's happening now. Yeah. So I guess that gets you right. They hate us anyway. And I guess that gets your point about labels. I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2:          45:29          It's also about policies. If you're in, and maybe I can't blame it for people who haven't been, you know, in parliamentary, in poly, whoever want to involved in policy, every single policy has consequences, intended consequences, unintended consequences, you name it. So it's all about the positions you take around these policy issues in the position you take around a policy issue should not define who you are and I think people who then start coming up with these names of neo-con this and take it from the policy to the person they are from their militias and the acting in bad faith.

Speaker 1:          46:07          Yeah, and the part of that that particularly bothers me is that they think if they can label you with that or whatever that label is, that then they can extrapolate every other idea that you think and they think they understand every other decision that you make, which you so rarely the case. Many of us believe in many conflicting things or have liberal values and libertarian values and so on

Speaker 2:          46:29          that plus they also distract the weaknesses of their policy position. So it's all about not having to discuss the merits and demerits. I don't care if my opponent's position, so I discussed the letter and I know that they'll have weaknesses and they'll have strengths, but in order to discuss the policy position to polish the proposal of the other person, I would never call him this or that. It has to be about the policy.

Speaker 1:          46:52          Yeah. Well it'd be your, your, what I would refer to as a true liberal and willing to debate the ideas. So I know we only have about 10 minutes left and I wanted to discuss one thing with you because I saw you. I was probably about six months ago now on the daily show when Jon Stewart was still there and I interned at the daily show in 1999. John is, you know, we've met a couple of times and he's given me some great advice about comedy and life and I love John just like everyone else loves John. That said, I thought his interview with you was really terrible. I thought every time you brought up something about Islam again, coming from the history that you come from, from your life, your firsthand experience. Every time you said something, he immediately brought it back to Christianity. He immediately said, well, Christianity did this stuff and you're focusing on Islam and I, and it really was that regressive thing that we started this conversation about. Um, so a, do you agree that it was a sort of messy interview a and B, were you shocked? Because I, I would think everything being equal that you would sit down with this guy and he would absolutely love you. You stand for every liberal value and women's rights and equality and all that. And I thought it was really terrible.

Speaker 2:          48:04          It wasn't funny. It definitely wasn't funny. Oh yeah, for sure. Isn't funny. It wasn't funny. And the reason why it wasn't funny, it was probably because it was about Islam and Islam is not funny at the moment. And I don't know what it goes. I can't speculate on what the see what somebody work, but you know, imagine if the next morning he gets a threat, he gets whatever, you know, people telling him that he hasn't treated them fairly. You can't laugh at Islam. There's nothing funny. I mean, I can, I can make a lot of comedy about the absurdities of Islam and all the sad things that are done in the name of Islam, but nowadays that comes laced with threats laced with resentment. So it wasn't a funny show. Uh, I don't, um, I mean in hindsight I asked myself why he even agreed to it. Uh, but it, it is for him. He's, he's an adult and he, he will probably have his own explanations in his own lesson.

Speaker 1:          49:04          Yeah. Listen, I, I know that saying anything negative or whatever about John is not going to win me any Brownie points, but I thought that because not only was the tone of it unnecessarily combative as opposed to just listening to you, but then at the end he said something to the effect as he was saying goodbye to you, like basically like, ah, you just want to sell some books. And I really thought it was just incredibly dismissive. And of course you kept your calm and your cool and all of that.

Speaker 2:          49:27          Well, that's funny because people go to John who had books, just sell books and sell a bunch of books, but that is, I mean, I think what he did it to a certain degree was put himself in the shoes of my opponents and in doing so, I think the people, he entertained a thought that this is not entertaining, this is not funny. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. All right. I think that's the west view. You can give comedia.

Speaker 1:          49:54          Yeah, exactly. All right. So, uh, so I have one more for you, that sort. I want to try to tie this altogether. So, uh, you know, you alluded to security threats that, that you still have, you know, your life story as we've said. It's just, it's just incredible and an inspiration. I think, um, Gimme something to end this, that we can all feel good about the direction that this is going. You know, we've talked a little bit about how the voices are finally raising up in the liberal community against the regressives and I think a lot of my audience take solace in that. Um, but, but give me something that you from everything that you've lived through that you can really help us all take with us and feel good and feel like, feel like we can, we can win for the right reasons and the right principles.

Speaker 2:          50:40          Well, I mean the best news I have at the moment is just the sheer number of individuals who are born into Muslim households who are rejecting the absolute is submission narrative. He was saying, I think I don't like it if it comes to choosing between my conscience and what Mohammed tells me to do. I go with my conscience and people are paying with their lives. I've talked about as much as I can, a battery in Saudi Arabia of all. Can you imagine living in Saudi Arabia and somehow finding the intellectually, the capacity to say no to all this and stand up for a message of freedom and rationality and reason and science and then having to deal with the consequences. This man is sentenced to a thousand lashes. 50 of them have been carried out, is fighting for his life inside prison. Now he is an icon, but he's only one of what I now see as thousands and I see them everywhere because the emails I get, I'm so heartened by that, and 10 years ago it was the opposite. Every single Muslim who called me, he just called me an infidel and told me, you deserve to die, and now people are saying, oh my God, you are. You're my hero. We're in this together. And some of them still identify as Muslim. They're not necessarily out, but they are. They're thinking and you and me and all the other liberals, the one thing we can advance is the idea of critical thinking. Let's just give people whether they're Muslim or not, the ability, I mean just enhance their ability to think critically about these things.

Speaker 1:          52:20          Yeah, I love that. I mean, I, that's, that's pretty much what I've tried to now make my life about and it's clearly what, what you've done. So really this has been truly a thrill to spend a little time with you and I hope, I know you're not going to be in la probably for a couple months, but I hope we can do it in person next time.

Speaker 2:          52:35          Thank you so much. Thank you for having me and David and good luck with this, with this show and keep up the good work.

Speaker 1:          52:41          Thank you. Likewise. Uh Alright. Well you guys can buy ions book. It's called heretic A. Pretty much wherever books are sold. Where do you want them to buy it though? Do you have a place you want to send them?

Speaker 2:          52:52          I don't know. I mean it's by whatever you can find it. Whatever's convenient for you. I guess

Speaker 1:          53:00          a nice message at the end. Alright, great. Well thank you so much diane. I really appreciate it.

Speaker 2:          53:05          Thank you very much. Thank you for having me.
