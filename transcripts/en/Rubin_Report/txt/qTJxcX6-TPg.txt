Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Joining me today is the author of the orphan x novels, a comic book writer whose work includes Batman, Wolverine, and the punisher, and a guy trying to save the Democrats. Gregg Hurwitz. Has It gone? It's good to see you. That's the scariest one. You can write all the thriller novels you want to in gallery. It's worse than any Batman Villain or evil theory I've ever heard. Trying to save the Democrats, but you're trying. We're going to get to that in a little bit. So there's a lot I want to do here with you. Uh, let's talk or if an experts and a little bit just about your work. Um, what got you into thrillers? You know, the only thing I ever wanted to do is write thrillers. And my parents did not let me watch TV when I was growing up in Leicester was Alfred Hitchcock movie on or the Red Sox were on my dad's from Boston.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       So that was religion. Um, and so all that I did was read. And so I was like climbing the bookshelves to get to, you know, jaws on the top shelf. And Stephen King, I mean I was just into all that stuff by, by fifth grade and I was obsessed with it and I still remember reading Salem's lot, like under my bed with a flashlight. I was 25 years old, but my parents were out and I remember just being terrified and just thinking it's, it's insane to me that this guy, Stephen King can take a combination of familiar words and put them together in an unfamiliar way and elicit this much emotion in me and just the only thing I wanted to do. So I started to write these mysteries with like crown illustrations at that age. And I went to college, studied English and psychology. That's where I met Jordan because I thought that'd be the best combination of majors.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       And I started my first novel when I went to Harvard. I went to Harvard. Yeah. Say College. You could, you could say that place in Canberra. Um, and so basically I started my first book when I was 19 and then it got supremely lucky and sold it, you know, and kind of never had to have a real job. Yeah. Does that, is that how it feels to you still have a real job? Like when I was just looking through your wikipedia today and all the cool things that you've done and all the comic books that I've grown up, you know, reading and the characters that everybody cares about. It doesn't. It doesn't feel real. I can't believe I get paid to do it. Like I love it so much. I sort of wake up and float down the hall to my office on a barge of gratitude.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       I just, it's so great. And the comics were a blast. I mean the comics are like when you get into marvel and DC, it's like that super rich kid who used to live up the street from. You had all the best toys and you could go to their house and play with their toys. That's more vul in DC. It's like, do you want to. I still remember my first call for marvel. I'm the editor in chief who's, who's a very good friend. Axel Alonso was a fan of some of my books and called and said you can have sort of any character from the marvel volts. Oh Man. And it had to be super calm and cool and collected, but my inner geek boy, he's doing cartwheels. I mean, I know you love this stuff and it's like it's in our cells. And so I said know I wanted to do the punisher because the punisher was the end all be all.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       There's a lot of punisher in orphan acts too. I mean you can a lot of Batman, you can see those and basically I wound up writing that they wanted someone from outside of Comex because garth ennis had completed his legendary run and they wanted to kind of reboot it and I still remember I had this totally surreal experience where I went to the bookstore right here on Ventura. I'm sorry, the comic book shop and I could no longer buy my favorite comment because I was writing it like I already knew what would have happened in it and it was completely real comic book in there. So when I was wild. Yeah. So are you more of a marvel guy or a DC guy to ask? I don't know that you legally can answer that. You're more marvel. Yeah. I'm more of a more. I am more marvel with the exception of Batman.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       I mean I love whole spider. I was hardcore spider man, like you know, and I had every punisher appearance would make of sort of the way the movies have gone down because it's so clear that marvel has figured out how to do these movies correctly and at least from my opinion, dc or the wonder woman, the standalone. It was good. Like they just can't quite get right. Although the, the original Batman, the Christian Bale, Batman's, where will those Batman's? So I wrote Batman the dark night, do you have here? So my Batman series, it was very much has an homage to those films. It wasn't the main Batman title, just Batman was Batman the dark night and I was very focused on reinventing the villains. I love villains and I love dealing with darkness and giving them a very legitimate viewpoint, which is probably part of the perspective shifting that I think that I'm capable of doing politics.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       I can see a lot of other sides and a lot of valid reasons for it. Well, I can also see this is why you can do some things with Jordan because he always talks about you have to give the devil his due and I guess you really have to do that if you're going to write a good villain, right? No. Yeah. I mean the bad guy never thinks he's the bad guy. Right? So it's like the more I think younger writers and me included, you know, my early stuff, it's like the worst possible serial killer villain you think that makes your guy a better force for good. And what you realize is if you can actually build a steel man instead of a straw man, like someone who has a reason, rationale and worldview that we almost start to relate to as a villain, like it's right there.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       And then your guy defeats him even through that chaos and ambiguity, um, that actually occurs way more positively to your protagonist than if he's just tracking serial killers all day. Serial killer is inherently aren't that interesting from a narrative perspective because it's like, why do you do it? Oh, he's insane. You know, if you can find people with a real rationale, which is what I do for, it's what I really do in the orphan access. But I did that with penguin, with scarecrow, with, you know, the mad hatter. I tried to give them an inner life that shows the reflection of Batman. It's sorta like a buffalo bill. Wasn't really the interesting bad guy. Silence of the lambs. It was Hannibal Lecter, right? Like the psychopath. There were the straight up murdering psychopath. Yeah. It was more about the intricacies of the psychological piece. Well, and that structured like a love story.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       Right? That's a love story between Hannibal Lecter and clarice starling. Right. Didn't end that well for well. Well for them it did. For them it did. I didn't end that well for the guy to jail. There's a dance and there was a flirtation and so it's very much about them, you know, it's just very weird, twisted foray into intimacy between two opposite parties. And so it's structured out like a romance. We should recut cut that as a Romcom sure. Somebody, somebody's done that on youtube somewhere. So for somebody that's interested in stories and these archetypal characters, and as you know, I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson right now. Um, how much truth do you think people can get out of these stories because Jordan is always talking about, you know, the truth that you can extrapolate from religious stories, but then also it does related that you can get truth from well written fiction, like, you know, he talks about Harry Potter a lot or the story of Pinocchio or just different things when you're writing these things.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       Are you really keeping that in mind? Yeah, you know, that's a really interesting question. I mean, I, I believe I'm a hardcore young yet. I mean, I first studied young under Jordan, my, my thesis, if anybody, like if Ambien doesn't work, my thesis was 14 and young in analysis of shakespearian tragedy. I mean I pause it that Shakespeare was. His tragedies are like perfect thrillers, right? They're highly structured, convention bound, reinterpretations of past themes that are narratively driven of lust, intrigue and murder designed to appeal to the broadest possible cross section of people. But I'm a hardcore young Ian and that I do believe that the hero myth is as essential and evolutionarily selected as opposable thumbs and eyelids. Like you can find a tribe cut off from all human contact very deep in the Amazon and you know they're going to have opposable thumbs.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       You know, they're going to have eyelids and you know that they're going to have a hero myth with all the constituent parts. So then the question is, well, why? And so what I believe is that, I mean, what I believe, what, what young believes, what Jordan talks about a lot is that there's essential wisdom that's embedded. That in my mind is more, is a more real truth. And the truth is that we deal with on the surface and a lot of ways of how to contend with the unknown, both internally and externally. So you buy in. If we were looking at the Sorta Sam Harris Jordan debate on this, you buy Jordan's version of that, that it's beyond just fact that can give us truth. It's that there has to be some other sort of story on top of that. Yes. I think we're story processing and story making machines that you can't get value out of just fact alone basically.

Speaker 1:          00:08:32       Yeah. I mean you need to. You need to embed something in some archetypal structure. So I always think of it like we're preconditioned to have. And you know, it's complicated because people think when you talk about the end collective unconscious people think that like somewhere floating in our prefrontal cortex is the notion of a whiz into old woman as representing wisdom. But I don't think it's that. I think that there's a story engine that is selected that drives people to say, okay, I need a representation for wisdom. So if you look around your village or your city or your community, that will tend to land on somebody who's older, like it's ingrained in them. So there's different choices that happen. I don't believe that, that there is sort of essential specifics that are floating in our head, but the mechanism to make, to make meaning, um, he's in there and the mechanism to look at different things that are in the world around us and the plugin symbols and to make them construct a certain way.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       And that's why if you look at like the epic of Gilgamesh, it's a direct overlay for the terminator, right? I mean, so there's all these overlaps and nuance between the ways that we're used to processing story. What do you make of the fact that it seems like the only thing we can seemingly do right in Hollywood these days is make superhero movies. Is there some like extra meaning to that right now? Like we're making blockbuster after blockbuster, at least marble is just blown it out of the water with all of these things. And we don't seem to be making a lot of new, original stories anymore. Well, I'm a little. I'm divided on that. I mean, my favorite movie last year was wind river. I don't know if you saw. I didn't see that. Heard of it. Taylor Sheridan is the writer director. He also wrote hell or high water and he wrote a scenario.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       Okay. He's amazing. So there's interesting work that's being done. I mean, I think there's a preponderance of superhero stuff because as we are sort of laying waste to some of the structures that have protected us in a lot of ways. It's sort of the new gods and the new mythology. I mean in the case of thor literally. Right. And so I think that it, it, it's, it's this overlay for us to contend with and make meaning with, with bigger symbols in our life. I mean, it's so weird. I Love Batman, right? You're a Batman guy to just by being a marvel guy. But it was so funny because I was out the other day and there was a guy with like a Batman Wallet and a Batman Tattoo and a Batman shirt and I was like, we're grown men. What are we doing? What does this mean? Right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       You have a wallet. It's sorta like, is it that different than having a cross around your neck? Like why are we, if you like it, if you like or comment if you like a movie, why are we necessarily like ingraining that in our skin? Right. And having that be on our, on our, on our clothes. Like why would we wear this with a shield? I think there's a lot of, a sort of religious overlay to what these represent. Yeah. Well the stories, right? These stories of good and evil and the way star wars, at least the originals affected me or, or the way now. I mean, you can get so much truth and interesting, deep, profound psychological, a thought out of the, uh, the original Batman trilogy. It's incredible. Well, it's funny how good and evil and laying waste to the world. I mean that heath ledger joker is just amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       Perfection. Yeah. Well, so it's funny. So you look at, there's sort of, we have a direct line with star wars in some ways because you have a young who has a fairly impenetrable cannon, like he's not breathing reading, you know, you can read Freud and the studies read like short stories. I mean, so it's obvious for me in hindsight why studied it, but things never make sense when you're just following things that you love. And I was super interested in psychoanalysis and in hindsight it's like of course all young wrote about was narrative and all Freud wrote about was, you know, interesting psychological case studies which are also narrative based and they read like short stories. But so you have a young who's very tough to penetrate. So you have Joseph Campbell who came along, I think of Campbell is like the cliff notes for young.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Um, I don't think Campbell has a lot of stuff that if you, you know, like young's tricky, you know, he's like reading young takes a lot of work and focus. So Campbell makes that more accessible. And then Campbell had, you know, that's where Bill Moyer, that famous interview, right? And Lucas then specifies that makes it specific in a way and when you're talking about meaning in stories, that sort of thing, it's like no one will deny. You can find meaning from Freud and young. Right? But when that's distilled down into something that's specific, that embodies those principles, that's the thing that sort of tattooed on our spinal cords in this culture, like who didn't have that experience with Star Wars, right? Who doesn't show up with that. And that's because it's taking these things that are literally a philosophical, psychological meaning making human beings in, in, in these bodies, in these cannons and distilling it down to something that everybody can plug into.

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       Whether you get it at whatever level, you get it out, you get it at. Seeing those at seven is different than us seeing them at 30 or 40. So when Jordan takes that to the religious place, did, do you follow that thinking there? Yeah, and I'm from like an atheist Jewish, you know, my socialist background, you know, like I'm not conventionally religiously ready, but it's like to deny that a story isn't that successful. So here's a weird thing that's always an issue that I have with, with Democrats. I know you get very defensive when people have problems with Democrats easier. There's this funny thing where Democrats tend to view other cultures with great reverence, especially the more exotic they are, even if there's some fundamental issues and the other cultures that should be relevant, right? Like you have hardcore feminists who were supporting certain regimes that treat women terribly and you're like, we should jar out of that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:03       Like that appreciation for the exotic. And the one thing I find frustrating is we have such a collection of different cultures in the United States and it's like, why can't you go to Alabama or the deep south? I love the deep south. Like when I sold my first book, I drove through the deep south to go to the Bourbon distilleries and a see faulkner's home. And why don't you look at that and people's relationship with the second amendment and their relationship with each other and their relationship with their value system as also being a culture that is different. That should be appreciated, right? We don't. It's a weird thing. And so we do it for the outward world, but sort of, it's to be safely exotic. Right? But if someone disagrees with you, and look, this is true both ways. I mean I'm not, I'm not merely beating up Democrats, but it's a frustration that I've had to say people think differently.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       So if you want to pretend that you're going jump into their brain and make a moral judgement on why they hold their opinions, that's not good for anybody. But the same thing holds true for stories. It's like going to any university and it's super cool and hip to talk about you to analyze the marvel stories or to analyze star wars. And it's like, why wouldn't you do the same with a story that is so successful that it dwarfs all of those over centuries and centuries that his, you know, given rise to cathedrals and, and, and, and wars and like, this is stuff that is moved. Right, right, right. So it's like if you're into those stories, it's like, ah, that was, that was yesterday. You know, you're a Jesus freak and it's like, wait a minute, like write a story. Somebody that guys at the star wars convention.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And it's like, well, so what's the story of Jesus like if you, if you shoulder your own burden, if you bear your own cross and accept your own suffering, that's the only means toward, to transforming it or to transcending it, I shouldn't say. And so it's like, oh, is that relevant in relationships or psychology? Like what's the best approach? If someone's really screwed up and complaining and as a murderer in the whole world, like you go, yeah, I'm honey. The world's awful. Like, is that the parenting that you want? Or to say what, what are the things you're doing? Where are the faults as they exist in you? It's one thing that Jews are great on the Old Testament. God's angry we screwed up, right? Jordan? Jordan says that a lot. It's like where is it centered in you and what is the way that you can accept the conditions in the inherent tragedy of life in a way that allows you to transcend that and it's like that's played again and again and again.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       I mean, you look at Tony Scott, Denzel Washington's a man on fire and it's like you look at how beautifully that takes an hour in the first act. Just the relationship between him and the girl and it's basically a classic like you need to become a monster to hunt monsters, but it's the story of his salvation and sacrifice for something innocent. It's just, it's, that's my favorite modern movie probably. What do you make of the fact that people actually care about this stuff right now? Like this type of conversation and being able to relate it to either comic books or movies and still talk about religion or talk about it from an atheist perspective that people actually care about this were I think four years ago if have a whole bunch of us had been talking about this, people will be like, what the hell? Like he likes this relevant.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       What? What? You guys live in your mom's basement? Well that's what they'd be saying covered with snack crumbs. That may well be true, but I cleaned up before. I can't remember that. We appreciate. So I mean, I think what's interesting is there's a letter f Scott Fitzgerald sent to his editor and it's great because he talks about all the notes that you get from an attorney. He said the American reading public is totally stupid. It needs to be led by the nose or number two, massively brilliant and can interpret every problem that you have more like it's, it's everything. It's so morphous view that we always take toward society and so there's this view of like the American attention span is shortening. You look at it like we went from books to blogs to kind of my space. You had to build out to facebook, to twitter, to instagram, like this ever shrinking aspect, but it's too simplistic.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       I mean, everything's too simplistic, so we have podcasts, exploding audio books and publishing exploding and this sort of longer form discourse. I mean, what I think is really interesting, this is a lot of people were hungry for it. I mean, I always say to Jordan and it makes no sense at all that he did a lecture series on the psychological underpinning of the Bible and more than three people showed up like it just. You wouldn't anticipate that, but people are a lot smarter and are a lot more oriented in their desire for meaning. Then we give credit. I can tell you that from being on this tour with him in the middle, he'll often say something about how he's working on the next series of biblical exteriors. It gets a huge applause every time. Like people want more of that. Absolutely. Whether they're believers or not.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       I think many of the people that watch them and appreciate them actually aren't believers, at least in a traditional sense. I mean, and who knows what that means. Does it, am I a believer or like do I believe those stories contain some of the most fundamental grains of first principles of orienting oneself in the world? Absolutely. So it's like what does it even mean to be a believer? But I mean the other thing I find really interesting with it is that it's sort of going back to our conversation about archetypes and my belief that it's selected is we were sort of meaning making creatures and so if, if there's a discussion that Jordan has, if you guys aren't conversation on a stage or Eric's arguing with Ben, right? You get these opposing views within this group, people are engaged in that. If there, if it feels like there's a genuine focus for, for meaning because it's like that's the thing that we want more than anything and it gets hijacked a lot for the purpose to be like, oh, I just want to be happy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       And it's like happiness is temporary and this is a femoral. So I think that's what's happening with these longer form discussions that people are engaged in is because it feels like there's something real happening and it's not buzzwords and cliches and facile dismissals. It's, it's something that's real. It's almost like also at the same time mainstream has become so meaningless, right? That our ability to just do this and have a little bit of an exchange maybe with some differences and some agreements has that much more value right now where 10 years ago maybe it wouldn't have had so much value but the. But as mainstream careens off into the abyss. Well, we're still here. Well, it's funny too because in some ways a reasonable centrist view is now radical, right? So if you have a senator who's willing to compromise and interact with the other side to pass legislation, which is one of the tenants of how Congress had was the right, that's sort of radical.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       Like if you don't only vilify and shut down from either side and, and continue to polarize. And actually, I, you know, part of this, I've been thinking a lot about how this has driven with mainstream media and you and I were talking a little bit about trying to use the intellectual dark web is an ability to sort of broaden out what views are of different parties and you know, it's all heterodoxy base, but like how do we bring in centrist views and have them represented. Because one of the things I've been thinking about a lot, I've been doing a lot of candidate training. I've talked to dozens of candidates from Tennessee to Alabama, like all over the country. Virtually no one that I talked to is making it a key key aspect of their platform. You know, trans bathrooms in democratic socialism, literally not a one. So then it's like, wait, is there a role that we're all playing, you know, even in this umbrella of the intellectual, dark web.

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       But then the mainstream media, everyone who's sort of virtue signaling on social media in starting to think, you know, Eric calls it the Chihuahua fact. I'm like, there's very loud people who are out at the edges and like maybe good for them, right? Like I'm not in favor of d platforming anybody on either on either edge, but there's a huge story in the middle that I think isn't being told and I think it's really important to, to, to, to have the Chihuahua fact not cow, everyone in the middle from being able to sort of speak up and have the discourse that they want to have. One of the things I told, I sat down with the, with the Washington Post have sat down with some other places and said, look, count the number of times that you've written about, for instance, it costs ego, right? Like, so she won in a very deep blue district, like good on her.

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       Go off in the Bronx and when and see what, what's going to work there. That's not my proclivity, but I'm not denigrating that. But it's like how many times have you written about her verse versus Angie Craig Halley, Steven's Joseph crops or Ken Harbor? All of these amazing former military pro business, amazing Democratic candidates. But I'm guessing that 90 percent of the people watching, I haven't heard one of those names and she said she was all over everything endlessly for weeks and everyone does that. So I've been trying to think about why, why that is the case, you know, I would bet if you go to the New York Times or the Washington Post, she's mentioned, you know, 10 x 20 x these other candidates if not even more so. I think from the right it makes sense. And the left does this too. So this is not me claiming that the rights owner who does this, it makes sense to paint the parties further left than it is because it's an easier sort of target to paint the furthest extreme and then to denigrate that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       But with the left they're doing it also I think because there's problems and they need clickbait and eyeballs. So I think there's that. And I think there's also a sort of curious. There's a curious desire on the part of the left sometimes to continue to be murdered. Right. And I don't know if, if sometimes there's a drive to app to to further the stories that are stories that in fact are going to hurt the left. An example of that is when we talk about progress that's being made, there's a lot of progress being made in race relations for, for women in business. There's a propensity for the left to say everything's bad as it ever was. Nothing's gotten better and you go really like you. Like today it's the same. Like this is not to say that there isn't problematic widespread racism, you know, but is it really the same as in during, before the civil rights is really the same as in Jim Crow, that nothing's changed and it comes.

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       I think from a concern that if you can see that things are better than everyone will just give up and go home. There was like a driver to it. And so I think that there's this aspect with how the left engages with progress and what candidates that it looks at that it's almost. And I think the right does, has its own version of this. There's almost a desire to be constantly upset and outraged or to constantly be under the heel of what's viewed as the other side and what I'm noticing a lot in the discourse that is the most advocated or is the most widely spread is there's. There's a real sort of martyr mentality that lies beneath the outrage from either side. Okay, so let's just back up a little bit better. So we come from a pretty similar political backgrounds, both pretty much democrats our whole life, both part of the left, the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       I think we differ a little bit now and that I basically think that ship has sailed on this thing. I. I do think that the left has just rotted the Democrats from the inside. I get that there are these good people and I look forward to having many of them sit in that very chair and I'll hope that some things can return, but I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. You're really trying to help the messaging of this thing, the focus, the messaging, but basically it get rid of some of the identity politics stuff. Maybe stop doing so much class warfare stuff. I think a few other, a few other pieces of this convinced me that a, it's possible. Well, you're right. First of all that I bet if we sat down and did a chart of our political views, I think years in minor, the closest of anybody in the intellectual dark web, like you and I are probably aligned on everything from gun discipline to abortion.

Speaker 1:          00:25:33       Like if you go down the list, um, and you're right, that the biggest difference is like you've left the party and you and I'm trying to write. I haven't joined a new party but just for the record, but I don't consider myself a democratic political. If that's a party, I'll join that party. Yeah. And I'm trying to kind of refocus the party in a way that, that, that lives up to the promise. I think it has specifically to when people like you back. Yeah, it's a long road. There's a lot of hurdles and there's a lot of quagmires and we have been, there are a lot of errors that have been made and I think that one of them is, I believe that corruption is a very widespread problem. I don't think that the Democrats can continue to make an argument that we're the less corruptive to parties.

Speaker 1:          00:26:25       I don't think that's a winning argument. Yeah. I think you could probably make the counter argument pretty easily, right? I mean the Democrats did a lot of stuff against Bernie and, and Donna Brazil and the questions to hillary and all sorts of other stuff that you could argue there are probably more corrupt and that's, that might be another. I don't even think that's an important argument to have any anymore because I think put it this way, let's assume from my perspective, let's just take the leap to say I believe the Democrats are less corrupt than, than, than what is happening right now under, under this administration and some of the stuff that's going on. Okay. Um, I don't think we can have an argument that says vote for us were corrupt, but just kind of lost. I don't think that's a winning argument. And I think if we're going to engage with people like you, uh, you know, Libertarians, you know, Republicans, the first thing they're going to say when it comes to corruption validly.

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       So it's like, oh, you want to clean up corruption. Okay. You first. That's a reasonable first claim for people who have been in the party and feel that they're lost. And so a lot of the hope that I have with the party or these new candidates and voices and as part of my dismay about the way that it's painted that the far left is what's getting the most attention or, or like the ridiculous stuff that happens on college campuses. Like a lot of the attention that it's sort of like claiming that every person who's on the right is, is you know, a radicalized neo Nazi. It's like, so where is, where is the internal push back on that? Because I can see it this way, that from someone that was always a lefty and a Democrat and a progressive, the whole thing, and now although I still consider myself liberal, I definitely, if someone sat me for four hours here, I could probably get to the point where I'd say I'm a libertarian.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       I see ice, intellectual flexibility on the right. These days I see a libertarian side, I see the never trumpers, I see the trumpers, I see sort of the Mug lefties. Like I do see like a couple of different pillars that are all sort of lefties, the Mug, the Mug lefties. What I would say like I feel like a mug lefty. I, you know that I see like a couple of different groups that are thought of on the right right now that differ on certain things. But basically you're agreeing to disagree. I don't see that on the left, but you just mentioned a couple of names that you believe are people will. Here's the thing, that's what I think is happening and it goes to your point about where the oxygen is, but if, if it's, if there's some evidence of it, I, I'd love to see it in here as a, a trail of candidates.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       I mean, I, I could list 20 candidates, which I won't just rattle off, like you said, people don't necessarily know, you know, Katie Hill and Haley Stevens and Kendra Horn. I'm dealing with people everyday who we're talking about number one thing is anticorruption and they're signing. I asked yesterday, I was at an event with six candidates and Adam Schiff and I said, you know, I've worked with some of them. I'm working with others. Instead of all of you signed on the disclose act, disclose act is vowing to a name lobbyists, all lobbyist influence. It's all to get money out of politics, which I, which I think is the number one issue isn't business. It's, it's sort of the donor class level and influence of lobbyists. Like I think that's a really big problem. Um, and do you disclose everybody? You disclose your donors, which I'm going to talk more about from a libertarian perspective in a second because we had a very interesting conversation with Ben that shifted some of my thinking on that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       Lobbyists, right? You going to name all your lobbyists, are you going to come out for protection of the vote no matter what? Right? Are you going to come out hard against taking pac money for individual candidates or like bombing the other side through a pack, a anti Gerrymandering, right? Which means either a bi partisan committee that does it, which has some problems or judicial or I'm increasingly starting to think about that. There was a congress congressional fix, like if you're really great job, Congress doing a lot more. Imagine if they did anything right, so it's swearing a bunch of things before they're going forward. There's dozens and dozens of names on the list of people who have signed onto this call is to act and I believe they're all democrats. They're all younger Democrats. Would this wave. Now the disclosed thing is troubling for me because you get stupid stuff like, um, this in and out, a boycott that lasted a day and a half, which if people aren't familiar with it, I think somebody called it, they found out the in and out had donated to Republicans and called for a boycott and the best thing in southern California, everyone's like, dude, that's in and out, like, sorry, not happening.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       But then they found out that they'd given money to Democrats and like the whole thing is this mass. And so and I understand and things are also complicated. Like Nike Right now has Colin Kaepernick's the face of that, they're calling him a $6,000,000,000 man. They rent the ground floor of trump tower for $13,000,000 a year. Okay. They've given three times as much money to Republicans and Democrats. So it's like who are we boycotting? And meanwhile there's a sandwich chain that just got put out of business because the owner took a picture with trump, right? So it's like from both sides, it's like, what are we doing? Everyone's burning there Nike's, but they're actually paying $30,000,000 to rent space and are giving three act. Right? They're using sweatshops in China or Vietnam or wherever and now suddenly everyone on the left school with that because they want to support Nike because right in the eds, but also everybody in the right is sort of outraged by this move and they're burning their shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       But Nike also was given three act. It's like let's not look for our moral guidance maybe from corporations. Like maybe that's a good. So that that's it. I would say not your moral guidance nor from politicians. I don't think we should be getting it from politicians or. I mean people look at politicians now as if they're supposed to be superheroes and they're just people who are middle management pushing things one way or another a little bit, but instead we want people to come in with magical powers and fix things that haven't been able to be fixed for all of humanity. I mean, I think there are certain standards to which we want politicians held. Like we want doctors and lawyers. There are certain oats of the office. If someone's life is being run by lobbyists, it's like that's a problem, but to go back just real quickly to that, to that concern, which is if you just close everything, then people can kind of mob you and boycott you, and we've seen that from both sides in a way that just becomes a mess.

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       And then companies like my one of my biggest protest actually isn't a moral. It's that it makes everything boring. It just makes it so dull that anytime somebody takes her, you're a comedian. Guests what you live on the edge, if you live on the edge, you're going to say stuff. Sometimes it doesn't play or stuff that's offensive. Look at Richard Pryor. Look at Eddie Murphy. Look at Dave Chappelle. You know you're a comedian. I mean the whole game is to do that and maybe you're going to miss and fall down and then got a cell phone in the in the crowd waiting, just waiting to click send and then there's that word, craven nonsense. Apologies to who? Who is, who is like curled in a fetal position in their shower scrubbing themselves because Dave Rubin made a joke that was mean about something like I just don't. Who are you, who do people apologize too?

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       But so one of the things, and, and I know that this is an issue. I mean this is one of the other things I know that disclosing is a problem from a libertarian perspective because why shouldn't people just give money and let's say that somebody in La and they're Christian and they give money to a pro family, anti gay marriage group. It's like maybe they don't want to be out and if it means they're never going to work again. Um, and so I understand those concerns. And so one of the things that I'm sort of discussing and advocating is to raise the floor of that to some number and I don't know what it is, but these are conversations that are being had internally. And obviously the Democratic Party is the one pushing all this. This is not my invention, but this is something that I find to be important with the candidates who were running to talk about, but maybe there's some floor where we say, look, 5,000 or $10,000 give what you want and it's secret, but if you're giving over $10,000, you want to be political player and maybe have the spine to stand behind your money then and I know that that's not like I will concede that that is running against the current of what a libertarian argument would be, but when I'm weighing that against, you know, millions of dark money that no one knows where it's from.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       If it's in the country, out of the country going up to take out candidates. Like that's, that's a sacrifice that I'm, I'm interested in making. Yeah. Well that's one of those middle ground things that I think is worth having the conversation about because I don't. I'm not someone that would say there should be no government involvement in any of their shirt, so you have to figure out, all right, you're going to be a real player in this. Then maybe that does have to disclose that. That actually does make sense to me. Unfortunately this isn't where you get a lot of headlines of, oh, people are trying to figure out what the, what the fair balances on what to disclose, but wouldn't it be cool? You know, it's like we have this thing and it's one of the things I talked so much about messaging. You walk into a big rally, you say, I believe universal healthcare is a right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       Everyone's immediately in their camp like, yeah, and there's cheering and it's wonderful. Or like there's no way I worked so hard my whole life. I paid for my own healthcare. Why can't people do it? And what you just said about there's a reasonable ground in the middle. Um, and these are conversations I think that are essential. It's like everything's in the middle. It's like, okay, well, you know, we think everyone should have some standard of healthcare so people aren't dying in the streets in America, right? That's an American and it's unethical. It's also a massive public health issue. If people just die in their bodies are rotting and Mr also paying for it either way. Exactly. So like still it's an economic argument like let's not pretend, let's not fight over an abstract notion of whether universal healthcare is a right or a privilege like that doesn't actually do anything for people who need healthcare.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       So instead do we look at it and go, okay, average cost of an emergency room visit is $1,233 hospital passes onto an insurance company who passes it on to us because they're uninsured and our rates go up or vaccination is $19. So let's have some dollars and cents discussions and let's also talk to people from around the table even who we might disagree with about how we get into that. And it was interesting because I was on with Jordan when we jumped on the phone with Ben when I was talking through some of this stuff about like, like I was trying to figure out if there's any good argument for gerrymandering. Aside from the fact that everyone from either party just gets to keep their jobs. So why would you literally the points of interest to me is to call someone like you and be like, make an argument for gerrymandering so I can know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:36:28       And so I was kind of having this conversation and, and you know, getting pushback from Ben about this disclosure thing for exactly the in and out reasons and it's like, okay, well he and I aren't going to agree, you know, it's like he's, he's gonna see his, his opinion is get all money out of government and then no one's going to compete for it. It's a very different solution to the one that I advocate. But in hearing that I think there's a way to, to address concerns that reasonable people will have to say I want to give to $2,500 through candidate. I don't want the whole neighborhood to know like what if it's more liberal and I'm in Alabama, right? What if it's more conservative and I'm in San Francisco and so the ways to sort of hear where people are coming from and try to figure out ways to discuss that.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       And so the biggest hope when you said to convince me for me is this next generation of leadership in the Democratic Party. There is amazing. You know, there's a Guy Joseph Kopser in Texas who 20 years he was an army ranger, a professor at West Point, went to the Kennedy School, got a degree, started his own business, you know, created hundreds of jobs for people in Texas and is now running for a seat. Interesting guy, very common sense geared, goes into churches, goes into Republican strongholds and sits down and we'll have a conversation with anybody could sit here and hold his own with you. So this does show why the media or the way they frame all this is so much of the problem because no one has heard of any of these people. And if you control the information that we're getting, we're shifting the views on the party. And I feel the same way an inverse about trump voters.

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       Like you're, you're hearing from them. And people are saying it's, it's guys with torches at midnight protecting confederate statues. And it's like, wait a minute, I have an incredibly wide array of friends. I have a very broad cross section of friends who voted for trump and it's too widespread for me to dismiss everybody as being mouth breathing troglodytes. There's no way. I've very smart friends. I have friends who were in the military, there are a bunch of people made different decisions. There's people who think that we need anything as long as it wasn't another Bush or another Clinton, I don't care what it is. They wanted a disruption. And I think that it's really important. Look at the way that the media is tailoring that. And part of what I think our job is are people like us, is to sort of cut through that and to try and have a conversation about what's really going on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       And for me, with the Democrats, it's like I can, as I said, I mean have people sit down or look at it, Angie Craig or Kendra Horn or you know, can harbaugh's someone I just spoke with last week, you know, another guy was in the military, didn't emergency relief a organization afterwards health 80,000 people like you talk to him. He's talking about healthcare and jobs and education. And when you say that most of these folks are against identity politics and just sort of the general state of when people talk about the left, what it's become. Would you say that they're in opposition to what I think are most of the concerning part of the left? The concerning parts? Yes. I mean what's hard is at least the parts that we seem to be concerned about, let's put it that way. Here's what's hard with identity politics is, it's one of these terms that means very different things to different people.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       Right? So some people are like identity and that you know, like I'm African American and have an issue with actual statistics on imprisonment rates or police brutality and ways that that skews is one thing saying you can't have cultural appropriation and I'm melting down over white male privilege because you know, Justin timberlake has a braiding, his hair is another thing and all of those are sort of different and chopped up and it's like I like for me, nobody, like I haven't had one conversation about trans bathrooms or white male privilege or any of these things with the candidates. It doesn't mean that they are not more inclined based on their political orientation and their big five personality traits. Right? Or empathy, higher openness to have sympathy for those arguments or the arguments that are beneath those arguments where people are coming from. But the very far left stuff about it like a day without white people at Evergreen.

Speaker 1:          00:40:28       Evergreen. The brass. No, I'm not hearing that stuff anywhere. So it gets a little tricky because for me I feel like we can't have it be that all immigration is bad or all integration is good. Like you were talking about meeting in the middle with stuff. It's like everyone in this country is the descendant of an immigrant basically. Yeah. Unless you were native American or, or brought here. And we also can make an argument that all immigration is good. So maybe if we could put down those bats that were beating each other with and actually sit down and talk to what the concerns are. It could be a conversation. He said something very interesting about when you were on with banner. Ben was on with you. I don't remember. We were talking about abortion and you're, you're, you support choice. Um, I consider myself begrudgingly pro choice and I cut off basically. Yeah. But it's like you, you conceded, which I thought was really interesting because I'm always trying to look at this issue and to approach an issue that's incredibly emotional with like, it actually is an issue with very good people on both sides. Well that's the abortion was the most interesting to me because it's so obvious that sides have

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       a principled position to start. One doesn't want to control the woman's body. One doesn't want, one wants to make sure that this child is taken care of it and has the right to life and all that, so it's like if we can at least acknowledge that now we can start discussing some of the science, we can start discussing some of the social responsibility of government and everything else

Speaker 1:          00:41:52       before we get into trouble is when we impugn the motives of another side because nobody knows. We don't even know our own motives half the time. So for me to say, you just said that, let me tell you what your moral failings are. Let me tell you where you're not in command of your own, you know, moral nature to be flawed to make this argument right. Anytime we get that from the other side's the reaction is obviously like a highest men into that. But what you said that I thought was the most courageous thing that you said and I think it's the. I think it is the, it's the, the tectonic plate under which we can sort of build solutions. As you said, look, I can seed that. Part of my argument is arbitrary. Like how about, what'd you say? Twenty, 20 weeks, so obviously weeks in a day.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       How about if she's raped and she's going to die, but it's 21 weeks there. There it is. We have to concede that we are not absolute in our views and some things are absolute for people, but it's like when we're talking about immigration, right? When we're talking about gun discipline, it's like there's certain stuff where if you go in same thing where everyone raise your hand who's for gun control? Everyone's going to immediately go into their two camps, but you can go in and say, look guys, politicians and the media always want to make it seem like this is an all or nothing proposition that anything that's a slippery slope. We're going to just slide all the way to the bottom, right? If we make any impingement on, on second amendment rights that everyone's going to take our guns away and the other side is like, hey, anything that you come for me for this, if I give any ground, it's going to get worse. And everybody's really entrenched in that and it's like we're already on a slippery.

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       So what do you think we need to break that because it seems to me that I'm with you. We've got these two sides kind of going and polar opposite directions. You know, I've spent more time talking about one side that I used to be part of because that's where I was. But I get it. We've got two sides doing this partially scoring lover thing to do. You do that? Well, that's why I said mugged left the year before. I think I'm Bret Weinstein said that I have, I have ptsd basically, but whatever, whatever it is you, you, you, when you're a part of something, you can recognize it there. And look, if 10 years from now, if I'm hanging out with all these libertarians and they're all crazy, I'll, I'll call them out. You know what I mean? Like I just think it's just human nature. You can go to what you know and where you were.

Speaker 2:          00:44:04       It's almost like we need something crazy to happen. I don't even know what I mean by this. Exactly. To break this thing, we can talk about it rationally, right. And the whole idw crew can talk about how to have these conversations and agree to disagree and I, you know, ben and the, the gay cake and all that. Like I can try to hopefully he'll make me a cake one day now that I think he's in particularly good baker, but like we can do that for the next 50 years, that discussion. But it almost seems to me we're on this like slide to something

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       really horrible. Is gonna happen. I again, I don't know exactly what I mean, but it's like what would it take to wake people up to this? We're all talking about it and no one's actually stopping it from happening. Well, the inevitable descent I think in a weird way when everyone's looking at the sort of trump phenomenon, right? Which came out of nowhere seemingly but really didn't part of the vote for him and for you know, a 70 something year old democratic socialist from Vermont I think was that. I think it was a reaction to that. The people said the status quo isn't going to work anymore. Like I said, I don't care who it is, it's not going to be another Bush Clinton, and you know, I might, I might disagree with the choices that some people made, but I can't disagree with the driving anger and frustration that underlay that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       And, and you know, Eric talks about the sort of three big lies that have been put forth, you know, one is that all immigration is good, right? The other is that would trade a rising tide lifts all ships. The third is that there is zero connection whatsoever between terrorism and Islam, that they're totally unhooked. I add a fourth though, Eric thinks it's less relevant, but I think that it's the argument that, um, that biology has no basis whatsoever in gender definition or in, in, you know, sexuality, that there's, that there's, that, that seems like a huge one these days. Mean Eric believes that that's less wide spread. But I think that culturally that, that position is so weaponizing that I think that that's an equivalent one. And I think that what you're seeing is a reaction to these absolutes that everybody knows that a gut level aren't true and it's like everybody's entertaining them on the surface.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       Everybody's having a conversation, which is, you know, I believe only an open borders or I believe we have to shut down borders and, and separate families. And then it's like, these polls are so crazy and I think that they're both groups are motivated to protect their further left or right compatriots. I mean, so we're having this movement that's going out in that direction. But I think that's what it was a reaction to. And I think you're saying, look, where's the point of the Big Bang theory that the university, you know, explodes that it starts to come back together and because I'm afraid it's going to have to take something horrible. And again, I don't even know what I mean. Is there going to be like some terrorists deck or something that will just remind us that these people are not all of our enemies. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:47:00       Like it's like, I don't want to think of the world that you were saying essentially what that thesis is to say if there's a horrible terrorist attack, the new sort of outgroup threat will get Americans back together because nobody wants that to happen of course. And there's huge danger and what that ends up leading to because we know how we sort of went crazy after nine slash 11 and the Patriot Act and all that. But like it just seems to me that the, the wheels on this thing, although now people are talking about it, it's not slowing down and that just leads me to believe it gets to the ledge to. Well I think the first thing is, is you know, like clean up your own kitchen first. I mean that's what I'm doing. If the guy that I'm on tour with, it's doing something about cleaning up your own.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       But see I switched into kitchen. That was. No, that was effective. It's yours. Jordan got everything. He knows I'm boiling. Wait, let's pause there for a second. Just real quick because we shouldn't have totally dismissed this. So you were in Jordan student? I was, what, what was that like? Well, we'll get back there, but let's just not because I wanted to do it like 20 minutes ago and Jordan was amazing. I mean, I love Jordan from minute one. He taught me, um, personality psychology. I went back into the young seminar with him and then he was, my thesis advisor is like, what? Mid Nineties? Early nineties. I graduated in 95 and he was dynamite. He was very imposing and formal. I just like, right away was, was, was like I just got to solve the whole thing and I remember telling my college roommates, I was like, that's a guy who's going to be remembered just by his last name, like Hundred Years after his dad and you know, I didn't quite think it was because he was going to be doing, you know, kermit the frog.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       Hitler means. But like whatever. I mean I just thought in an academic arena. Yeah, he's sort of brilliance for me was. And his pattern recognition and ability to boil stuff down. But he would even then, if somebody came in ideologically from the left or the right and it was kind of a hollow shell, he would just puncture it, didn't have as much of a, of a, of. He was formidable. I mean he wasn't as joking. I mean obviously we're, we're good friends now, but he was, you know, he could be intimidating to other people, but I always just really liked him. And then we stayed in touch after that. He was my thesis advisor. We're very close and then he officiated my wedding. So I, I'm the only person on record to have a wedding that like sites extensively from Canaan, evil, everyone, I assume the Gulag archipelago needs.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       We had little like Gulag archipelago, like table settings. No, but at one point my wife and I just re watched our wedding video was so funny and she's looking and you know, she adores Jordan to and Jordan was going off about something and she, she's looking up at me and she's in her dress like where that moment at the altar. And she said, this is the part where I wasn't sure if I was getting married or being treated like they're Jordan did a whole archetypical analysis and then, you know, look, I put his rules for life in orphan acts as a, as a I have like the assassins 10 commandments and I wanted to actually good rules that, that someone could be raised by. And then I helped him, you know, edit the book and work on the book from the early stage. So I read it and had an orphan x three years before his book came out. So when you, when you say that when people would come in with arguments from either side and he could just pop them just like that. That's one of the most interesting things to me because if you listen again to what mainstream is saying about him is that he's this, he's this ultra conservative or this forest monogamy or he doesn't like gay people are just like any of this nonsense. Which every night I hear him go up there and beat these arguments down. He beats down the arguments of identity

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       politics on the right. I mean, he's literally, every criticism of him is like the reverse of what he's actually doing doesn't mean he's right about everything, but it's not, you know, everyone is deserving of criticism, but it should be legit criticism. So it must infuriate you when you read some of these things about him knowing that, you know, this is, this isn't the guy that you learned here.

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       Yeah. And you meanwhile he brings like a gay guy on tour with him. He's a crazy Christian homophone. Yeah. So, I mean, one of the jokes I have, he got accused of being an antisemite at some point and um, it was so great. Eric and I were talking about this and I think I tweeted, I'm like, boy, you know, Jordan did a terrible job covering up his antisemitism when he officiated my wedding 15 years ago. Most incompetent anti-semite I've ever met. Um, you know, it's more infuriating for me. I, I feel like the media skew is so complicated. I've almost given up on us in, in certain ways. I look, I think the media has done an amazingly impressive stuff. Like I'm, I'm a big fan of the Washington Post despite how some things have gone, so it's like I'm not, I'm not giving up on that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       I don't. I believe that the media is doing a really good job on cultural issues. I'm accustomed to it when people come in and attack Jordan for being right. It's like there is a video online of him denouncing the alt right for an hour if you bothered to look into it. The thing that infuriates me more seemingly intelligent intellectual people who will dismiss him or get nervous if I bring his name up based on anything that is wildly taken out of context. And with Jordan it's like, look, I was a student. I've known him a lot of years. I've seen hundreds and hundreds of hours of his lectures both in school and here. You know, I, I helped him with his book when he was going through the book and he makes fun of me for that and the acknowledgements. There's nothing that he has said that I. I mean I know his work about as well as anyone could. There's not a single thing that he said that if you don't contextualize, it doesn't actually make sense and I have people wholesale say, Oh, well I have my feelings about that. It's like, you know, I, I'll mentioned doing something with him and people who are, who are seemingly academic and I'll say, did you read the book

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       just, is that just the plight of doing something that is something close to true? I mean when I'm out there with him every night and he changes the speed, you know, he does an hour and a half. I'm warm. The crowd up. He does an hour and a half and then we do like 40 minutes together at the end, but that hour and a half he does. He changes it every night. I see him searching for truth every night and it's like, well actually all this hatred and all of that non contextualized stuff that you're talking about is just, that's just the shitty part of doing something good. Right. Maybe like, isn't that if you were writing the character, wouldn't you be doing dealing with all this? It's so interesting. So. All right, so two things like who's gonna say something true and then it's going to be all good. Everybody's going to love him.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       I like it. Worked out for Jesus. Didn't work out that well for the earth isn't the center right, so I was thinking that brought up two kind of ideas for me. I mean one of them is people who were seemingly academic and intelligent and pride themselves on being cerebral. It's like how dare you denigrate him because you read an unflattering profile and not read a book or listen to a lecture or do any research beyond that, but they got it in the New York Times. Well, right. I mean or in any host of other places that have missed the mark and then the New York Times will come around and do something flattering. I mean a profiles, a profile and they take a point of view but like dig deeper. But what's so interesting is you were just talking about that and that it is such a cool thing to watch him just like you're watching somebody grappling with issues when he's on stage and you've watched him do that a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       It reminds me a bit of like the, the abstract expressionists. I was just thinking like we're, we're pollock started to say the act of creation is a triumph, right? So what I'm going to paint something, you're going to see my brush stroke, right, that's laid on on canvas and of course linkedin. She did a great kind of piss take on that where he did like a carefully painted cartoon version of that. But where you really are seeing the work and that the work is what is the abstract expressionists really sort of put the art world on their head by elevating the form and the function for like the heroism of the crater. So it's sort of interesting because I haven't, I, I've noted of course that he's grappling with things and part of him thinking about is what's appealing. Like the thing that I said that I keyed to with you is saying, look, part of my argument for pro choice is arbitrary.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       It has to be we're so used to not conceding any of that, so to see somebody stand up in front of 3000 people and go hang on, like, and really be reasoning with that in a way that you might reach in a bag and come up with nothing is compelling and there's something heroic about that. The way the Jackson pollock was portraying. So as a writer you want to create characters that show vulnerability because it shows that they're human and yet we seem to operate in a time when almost no one is showing vulnerability outwardly. Our politicians don't want to show it or media people like everyone wants to be perfect every, all the virtue signaling these days. Everyone wants to be like this perfect thing. So then you get the few people that show a little vulnerability and I guess that has a little extra value.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       Hmm, that's a good point. I mean we tend to question there, just the point. Yeah. Well I see. It's interesting because we see a lot of photo vulnerability, right? Like when it's masking virtue signaling, like I've been thinking about this other notion that I have, which is, you know, in writing, because it's sort of like why am I doing all this stuff and politics, right? Like, nothing makes sense. So I looked back on, like when I was like, why would I study, you know, shakespearian tragedy, young and Freud, and it's like, oh, that's, that's thrillers, right? That's everything that I love. But likewise with politics, it's like when you're writing, well, what you want to avoid is cliche. Like it's like your podcast, like what you don't want to do is do like whatever, what you're supposed to say, everything about you and what you do is not saying what everyone else says and not lowering yourself to cliche.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       So in books, you, you, that's what you search for, right? If there's an obvious plot turn right, you have the cops sitting outside of the guy being like, this is my last day till retirement and I'm going to buy a yacht and sail around the world. You're like, that guy's getting killed, like everything we try and do is avoid that. Yeah. So in politics, so much of what I'm doing is trying to make people speak humanly and to avoid buzzwords and so it's like I have this theory that like as soon as you talk about, you know, a woman's right to choose that doesn't feel like it's sufficiently complex and motivated. I understand people need to, we need to gravitate with shorthand. But like I remember growing up in the Reagan era family of like, you know, we were the only Jews in Saratoga and Silicon Valley in my neighborhood at the time and the only people who voted Democrat, you know, it was early days of Silicon Valley, so diverse now, but that was all the, like Hewlett Packard engineers who look like the launch guys from NASA, the glasses and the pocket protector.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       It was just, it was totally geared that way. Retail is not thrilled with the diversity in silicon valley, but that's a different issue. Dot Okay. Yeah. Well, he's not thrilled with the diversity of thought, but you were talking about the university is getting code of thought. Where was. I lost my thread. You guys were the outliers when you were growing up there. Oh right. And so everybody was talking about family values. That was a big political thing from the rice and I'm sure you had a bit of a reaction to that too, of like, well I want to talk about family values and I just felt like, what do you feel like it's such a Republican word that coded for all this stuff for me? And I was naturally very resistant to it. So then I grew up, I get married, I have two kids and I'm like, Hey, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       I should have family values, family values. Like I like this new light because the word was co-opted as a catchphrase and when Republicans were using it, there it one time it had a rich and body of meaning. But when it's used again and again and again and again in a campaign, it loses all the life to it. And the same thing happens with liberal slogans. And so it's almost like the process of compressing information into newsworthy soundbites and using phrases and catch phrases the further you are from genuine or authentic thought and it's a very similar thing of where you're trying to reach in and do things differently in novels or in screenwriting or Comex, um, is very similar thing to the stage. It's like, don't just shovel out a bunch of cliches. Like, oh, Democrats are all for redistribution of wealth. It's like, no, that's not what all democrats are for.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       Republicans are all, you know, racist and scared of outsiders. It's like, no, that's not what all Republicans are. And so the more that we hear things that we've heard again and again and again, the further we're off the mark, and maybe that's why this expansive format you know, is, is what's leading to more complicated things because we're not, we don't have two minutes to just sort of hurl the cliches at each other. So if I'm, if we're looking forward a little bit to the elections that are about to happen, these midterms now, it seems to me that for, for the decent Democrats, trying to retain some of what old liberalism and old democratic messaging was, there's a really tough position here because it seems to me that if the Democrats win, it means that the further left wing of the party wins right now. Is that, is that a fair estimation?

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       I don't know. I don't think that's right. So because you think that these sort of unknown people. Yeah. People. I mean, so it's like tell me the candidates who you know, to be hardcore laugh. Well here's the reason I'm asking you is that if, if the argument is that these far left, these are going to win. Well then there's no reason to have a reformation of the Democratic Party. They're going to go, all right, Greg Sia, you know, our far left. He's one. If the Republicans win and then that sort of far left thing implodes, then there's a huge amount of space for you. If you're, if what you're saying is there is this huge groundswell of people that nobody's heard of who are more moderate sort of blue dog, they're rejecting some of this socialism stuff that's, that's a hopeful story there that I haven't heard too much.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Oh yeah. Well I'm more sanguine about this because I feel like just like we talked about people dismissing Jordan because they read a New York Times profile or like whatever the head pieces of the guy who talked about him romancing the salvage, like there's horrible stuff that's out there, but they haven't actually read his book or they haven't seen an actual lecture or they haven't read an opposing piece. Even if you only want to read profiles, so it's like maybe read a flattering one if you hold yourself to be an intellectual before dismissing him as a pseudo scientists, which is absolutely absurd. Given his academic record, like maybe take a more, a bigger position. Same thing is happening in some ways with politics and like, I don't ever want to put people on the spot, but it's like, you know, I always feel like name a bunch of congressional candidates and people are like, I'm Rossio and across you it's like people, that's not what we're reading.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       That's not the water we're swimming in. And so to really have a conversation we have to go outside of the profiles about, you know, you being an old writer and Jordan being whatever Jordan is this week. It's amazing. The things. It's incredible. Again, know we need to go out and dig into that. And that's the thing where I can say I've spent, you know, at this point, hundreds of hours with the party and finding. And I don't know all this stuff, like I'm not a natural politician, but I'm going to talk to people to go, here's what I think we need to sort of unify the party, you know, under the values that I think that we've had in the past and need to improve on in the future. Especially with the anticorruption. And here's the way that we need to talk about issues that they can see that the other side is human and that we don't have a magical ball to judge them and to judge all of their moral shortcomings.

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       And what I'm finding again and again and again and again, is that these candidates are amazing, but there's sort of no reason unless you really go digging that you would have heard of them because no one's doing that. And that's part of why I, you know, I called you to enlist you in my eval project and I was like, look, you and I agree on almost everything. Let me get some people on here to talk to you so that you can see that that's, that's in fact like 90 percent of the party. Well, that's the thing. I care how this story ends as long as I remain true to myself. So if, if you succeed, right? And the messaging of this succeeds, and five years from now I'm proud to be a Democrat again. If that even matters in the labeling process or whether I'm, wherever else I am, as long as I'm true to myself, that's what I care about, but like it's like man, get to it and make this thing work and that, that would be great.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       Well, and I should also make, make abundantly clear, like I don't mean in any way to imply that I'm somehow like the magical steering. No, no, I got you. I mean, you. Yeah. But I mean that's what I'm trying to do. So I'm doing my part of that. But obviously there's a lot of political leadership. There's a lot of people working on it. My team is, you know, includes Marshall Herskovitz and Kenny Corey, like we have a lot of people who are engaged in this. So, um, but I mean, your point holds, I just realized I don't, I don't want to sit here and pretend like I'm, I'm the unique message or the party, but I had been putting in a lot of time and I think I see things in a way. Um, I have a pretty broad range of friends and associates and I think I can really see things well from different perspectives.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       Like if there, if there is, you know, another talent that I would claim besides typing, you know, it might be that, that like I'm, I'm glad and empowered to have conversations with people like you where you're, where you have concerns that are different than mine and a real genuine curiosity to kind of go, what are poke called poke holes in this. Here's what I'm thinking. Tell me everything that's dumped because that'll give me a big benefit when I have to go sell it internally and certainly when we go out in the real world because then you're naked. So if I can enlist people who think differently and see the world differently to really beat up ideas that I might have it, it's like that's just silly. That's like wandering out into the mob naked, you know? So I'm, I'm, that's just something that's always intrigued me.

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       Yeah, that's a pretty solid input. Alright. I think unless you got something better than that, but that was that. We kind of wrapped it nicely there. Yeah. Well, before I deteriorate into inarticulateness, maybe we'll just. We'll call it a day. All right. We're going to do more on comic books next time I think we should do all comic book. We should just totally geek out and you'll have like three viewers like your podcast low will get super. Yeah. Well maybe you'll get a whole bunch of other. Yeah. You just shift audiences. That's true. It's all the people who we associate with are not going to be interested back. That's all right. It's been a pleasure, man. For more on Greg, follow him on twitter. It's Greg, two g's or width.
