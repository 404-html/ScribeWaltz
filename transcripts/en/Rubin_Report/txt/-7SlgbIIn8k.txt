Speaker 1:          00:05          It's presidents week here on the Rubin report and we're partnering with learn liberty to bring you five shows in five days each highlighting a different president of the United States. Joining me today is an associate professor of history at Sam Houston state and the Co author of JFK and the Reagan Revolution, a secret history of American prosperity. Brian, to be attributed. Welcome to the Rubin report. It's great to bear to Mitrovich Demetrihevic. Usually I say it with a hard state. Demetrihevic Demetrihevic. Okay. I was a big fan of draws in Petrovich who was a basketball player from Croatia and the in the early nineties, but some people said Petro Vic, and I could never tell rudy. Tom. Johnny bench the old coach. Yeah. That's properly hot. Check at the city, so I'm heretical. Rudy Times daughters. That 95 Houston Rockets. Steam is my favorite basketball team of all time. Clyde Drexler right there. There you go. As a Houston guy that has. That has meaning to you. All right. I could talk basketball the entire time, but let's talk president by the title of your book. We could probably talk about Reagan just as easily as we could. Talk about JFK, who we're going to talk about. Um, do you have a, do you have a preference out of those two?

Speaker 2:          01:09          Well, our book JFK in the Reagan Revolution really is two thirds, three quarters about John F Kennedy because we've forgotten that John F Kennedy paved the way for the Reagan revolution and this big

Speaker 1:          01:17          tax cut. Alright, so jfk, since he spent two thirds of it on JFK, that's the guy we're going to talk about. Um, I find with JFK that what it seems that most, at least younger people know, say under 45 ish, 50 ish, something like that. They know a lot about the assassination. You know, history channel runs the documentaries all the time. You can watch the movie, JFK, a zillion other, uh, things that are out there, but there's obviously a lot more to jfk than, than just the unfortunate ending. So let's, let's start at the beginning. What do we need to know about early childhood, the Kennedy family, et Cetera? Terry, let's start with childhood.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Sure. It'll. John F Kennedy was born in May of 1917 in a very, uh, important family, a family that was becoming one of the richest in the United States. His father, Joseph p Dot Kennedy, at that point in the teens that graduated from Harvard about 10 years before, was building his fortune would within Kennedy's a young childhood before he turned 15. I'm his father had become one of the richest men in the country. And actually just a peak. Kennedy made most of his money in what we call the great contraction, the worst period of American economic history from 1929 to 1933 when he short sold the market. And that's really when the Kennedy's became, uh, the one of the top richest families in the United States.

Speaker 1:          02:35          So how political was the Kennedy family at that time?

Speaker 2:          02:38          Yeah, I mean, it was pretty political. Joseph p Dot Kennedy. John F Kennedy's father had married the daughter of an important Boston politician. And then Joseph p was not involved in politics until FDR. Franklin Roosevelt appointed him the first head of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934. And then he became a big Roosevelt Democrat.

Speaker 1:          02:57          So that was the sort of beginning of

Speaker 2:          03:00          the dynasty in the Kennedy name. Yes. Yeah. So Jfk then tell me a little bit about sort of his evolution from a young person to starting to become a politician. Yeah. So John Jfk was the second son, so there was the Joseph Kennedy junior who would be killed in World War II and he wasn't a good student in prep school and he went to Princeton actually for a semester. It didn't do well there. Then went to Harvard, did not do particularly well until his senior year, probably plagiarized his thesis, which then somehow sold 80,000 competence as a book when it was published. But with his father's help. Really. Wait, are you telling me a little more about that? I haven't heard that one. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh, John F Kennedy, uh, his father in 1938, 39. I guess this would have been at that point was the ambassador to the court of St James.

Speaker 2:          03:49          So it was the US ambassador to Great Britain and was very interested in the United States fighting the Soviet Union and not necessarily fighting Nazi Germany. Uh, and so that kind of caused diplomatic problems with FDR foreign policy, but JFK had extraordinary access to the files. And so he wrote a thesis that was probably substantially ghost written about how England was dealing with the Germany credits and then, and then it was published as a book and it sold about 80,000 copies. Of course, Kennedy would publish another book, profiles in courage and Joseph, he would pull string. So at one of the Pulitzer, it's good to come from a family. It is pretty good. Uh, so tell me a little bit more about how he then decided to get into about in development. Yeah. Well, I, the decisive event really was the death of his brother in 1944. Joseph Kennedy Jr, uh, killed in World War II because really all the hopes were on, on this son.

Speaker 2:          04:45          And he apparently was a very impressive guy. If you look at old pictures of the sun, Joe, he was even way better looking than JFK. He was kind of bigger. JFK was always kind of skinny, uh, and it really devastated the father when he was killed in the war and they realize, Oh boy, Jack is going to be the one where we're going to have all these political hope son. And the father did not have high hopes for Ted at that point to Robert Robert, maybe a. But right after Kennedy got out of the war, of course he had his distinguished career too. He ran for Congress in 1946. His father pulled a lot of strengths and he won a seat in Brookline, Massachusetts teams in the US House. What does Paul a lot of strings mean because I just find the dynasty part of this fascinating. The idea that they're sort of moving children, that the power elite can sort of help people get into play here.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Well, pull out a strings in the 1946 election, for example. So on the ballot, Kennedy was running against a particular opponents. His father found somebody else with the exact same name and put that guy's name on the ballot and then had a whole publicity campaign for that guy's name. I forget the exact name, uh, to be voted for so that, that would split the vote. That takes a lot of money and a lot of kind of, um, a naked ambition. So that's an example of the kind of hardball, but he felt pled. So that's a slight sidebar when you hear about all the craziness involved in politics these days and everyone. No, it's never been worse and listened to the way people talk and all that. It's like a lot of shady stuff has been going on for a long time. Well, I have no idea how we could look at, say, the McCarthy era, both how mccarthy was treated and how mccarthy treated others and say that politics was warm and fuzzy back in the forties and the fifties.

Speaker 2:          06:24          I have no idea how we could say that. Yeah. So did JFK, do you think he had a presidential aspirations then when he started this? This was sort of thrust on him and he and he became a congressman. But was he already thinking about that, do you think? I, I think so in that, um, it was well understood that, that Joe Jr was going to be something like president of the United States. And so when that could not happen after his death, I think it'd be, became pretty clear to the sons. Uh, so there was still jack, Robert and teddy left and then I think six girls that they had to take, take that place. And so when he ran for Congress, yeah, I mean it was to go onward and upward. So he was a congressman. How many years was he a congressman? Right up until he ran from.

Speaker 2:          07:07          He was a US representative from Brooklyn, Massachusetts from from 46 to 52. And then he won a US Senate seat in Massachusetts, bucking the eisenhower a trend because he ran on the democratic side. So he was one of the few democratic victories in the 1952 elections. So then he was a senator for eight years before he became president. Yeah. Did he have any major accomplishments as a senator? Well, that's the interesting thing because when we asked what were his major accomplishments as president, let's say legislatively really comes down to maybe one or two, the tax cut in the civil rights act, so there's not a lot of major accomplishments and the whole Kennedy biography. The funny thing about his career as a legislator in the Senate in particular, this is big enthusiasms for two things. Number one, he was going after the mob, which then his son route his brother Robert would be big on and number two is an anti communist in foreign policy and that that's how we distinguish himself as a senator.

Speaker 2:          08:07          Yeah, so it's interesting that the anticommunist part is interesting because the parties have shifted so much these days that I'm not saying the left or the Democrats are communists now, but that voice, that sort of anti socialism, communism voice would rarely be heard of from the lottery left, which does tell you how these things have shifted. Joseph p dot Kennedy, his father became persona non grata in the U. S government, when in 1938, 39, he told Franklin, d dot Roosevelt from his high position as ambassador in Great Britain. We don't have to worry about the Nazis so much. We have to worry about communism because communism can overthrow the American way of life. I think there's a pretty direct link there to what his son was doing in the fifties and sixties. That's interesting. So he was, he viewed it as Nazi-ism was an external threat, not within our borders, but communism actually with something that could come from. That was joe's feeling. Yeah. Yeah. It was Kinda Kinda prophetic. And he was a new dealer and all that. You said, well, new deal. The new deal can help save capitalism. That was an erroneous argument. But, but Joseph p dot Kennedy was worried about the onslaughts against capitalism. Communism.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Yeah. Interesting. So it sounds like the Senate career was sort of less than spectacular. It doesn't sound like anything major happened.

Speaker 2:          09:21          Kennedy was pretty careful. Uh, he, he began his Senate career, uh, ailing. He had back surgery in 1953. As soon as he became a senator and could not attend the Senate, he was in fact had to be reclined, uh, for a very long time because his back injury and that's when he decided to write profiles and courage, his 1956 book, 1955 when the Pulitzer in 1956 about the greats of the Senate over time. So because he was incapacitated, he wanted to show he was still doing senate work by writing about Senate history.

Speaker 1:          09:52          Right? Yeah. God, what a beautiful thing to be in government. You don't really have to do anything and you could write about the other guys that did some stuff. It's, it's an incredible thing. Nineteen 60, he becomes president and he defeats Richard Nixon who was vice president at the time. I think the one thing that people really remember is that debate. Oh yeah. Because he was sort of this young good looking guy and there was Nixon sweating. Is there anything else we have to remember from, from that election?

Speaker 2:          10:16          So yeah, that. So I, there was debate in September 19, 60 and people always say that Nixon won on the radio and lost on televisions, that if people just heard his words or even read the transcript, that he defeated Kennedy. But if you looked on the television, there's black and white television and lots of viewers. A Kennedy was the youthful, a bronze, which is probably from his Addison Syndrome, not the Suntan, a hero in Nixon looked like a schlub. Uhm, I dunno

Speaker 1:          10:43          because it was in black and white, but it's still even having. Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:47          Still helps. And again, that was from one of his ailments. I mean that wasn't from the South Pacific. So I dunno, I've read those transcripts and I think Kennedy clearly won. I mean Nixon was saying things like, oh, there's been great economic growth in this country. We're tipping into a recession, right? Then 400,000 people. We're about to lose their jobs in the month of October. And Nixon was saying, oh, we've had the greatest economic growth with that we've ever had under Eisenhower. Been three recessions under Eisenhower. Now. I think Nixon lost that debate on the transcript as well.

Speaker 1:          11:13          Interesting. So just to get a sense of how parties have changed, what was the, what were the basic tenants that a jfk was running on?

Speaker 2:          11:21          Yup. So John F Kennedy didn't know what he wanted to run on a. This is a classic Kennedy thing. We know we must be president. So the question is what are we to run? Uh, uh, so, uh, it was really the Democratic National Committee or the, the, the convention that summer that kind of defined for Kennedy. He had a lot to do with it of course, at what the, what he would run on. And he decided he would run the on, that the country was not growing enough and he made his tagline, we have to get this country moving again. We have all these old slow people in government and he kept making the point that we have a lot of recession. So it was right. There was a recession, 1954 big one in 1957 and then it was coming right then in 1960 and he said we got to get out of this Rut, and he kept saying we have to get this country moving again, get this country moving again.

Speaker 2:          12:08          So that was his main thing. And then he also talked about after we helped, we have to get a little tougher on communism because we're not moving enough. The Soviets are starting to pass us by and those were his big themes. So when you say that within a 20, 18 context, it's hard to believe, as I referenced earlier, it's hard to believe that a Democrat would be running against sort of slow, inefficient government, but that is what he did. It's kind of incredible. Yeah. Now the Republicans back then were the big deficit hawks there are like, okay, maybe we've had some recessions, but we have a budget deficit. Then we have to keep taxes high tax rates high, so we take care of the budget deficit. Wouldn't be prudent or that'll George Bush line. I mean that's very applicable. George Bush came of age in the 19 fifties to have economic growth if we don't take care of our deficit first.

Speaker 2:          12:54          And that was the defensive position. Avantis and Howard and Nixon. Kennedy saw that and saw an opening and ran with it. Yeah. So what was the beginning of the presidency like when I watch all of these documentaries now, you know, they talk so much about the family and that there was this feeling of this young person in the office and all of that. I suspect there was more to it than just that. Okay. So when Kennedy was elected in November 19, 60, the United States that just tipped into a recession and there were mass layoffs and hundreds of thousands in October probably delivered in the election when that Sorenson has advised with certainly thought. So and then unemployment went all the way up, increased up to $5 million by night by January 1961. So when you kind of, you know what that percentage was just for reference to five percent now it doesn't sound like that.

Speaker 2:          13:39          What will 5 million, 5 million the workforce, the unemployment rate was probably going up to about eight percent at that point I'd have to check, but probably around there. Um, so Kennedy took office, submits a snow storm of, right. That just ended it before his inaugural address, famous inaugural address. And the big problem was there's now a new recession and then when he gave his State of the Union address 10 days later in January of 1961, um, he kind of had a lot of kind of equivalence equivocal statements. He said we have to get our house in order. We have yet our country moving again and we have, the government has to spend a lot of money. So we kind of laid out two options. We have to kind of get the government more efficient but also get the government spending a lot of money. So it was unclear what he was going to do.

Speaker 2:          14:28          Yeah. What does that even mean? I mean, do you think he knew at the time because those sound like statements that can't work together. Richard Reeves, who's his greatest biographer, he wrote the great book on Kennedy in Nineteen Ninety two. President Kennedy. He said, no, no, no. What Kennedy liked to do, and I think this is true, we have all the Kennedy tapes. We can hear him on audio that John F Kennedy Library has an amazing things online. We can hear so much from Kennedy's voice privately. It's pretty clear that he thought himself kind of the Uber intellectual. I'm not a philosophical intellectual, but somebody who could process thoughts and he would get a lot of good advice and then pick the best option. So that's the way he would operate. He wasn't gonna figure it out himself. He was going to wait and see and then make a strategic decision.

Speaker 2:          15:14          So you think when he brought up those seemingly conflicting ideas that he actually did mean it and that eventually you could pick one. You would whittle it away with the right people behind it. And now this sort of gets to what your book was about. Which one did he end up going for? It was this good. He went for both. Okay. So Larry Kudlow and I wrote this book a Jeff Can, the Reagan Revolution about the John F Kennedy tax cut. And the big reason is what Larry, my co author has had to deal with for 15, 20 years. He gets this at parties from the likes of people like Caroline Kennedy. Uh, he gets it on television and CNBC. How dare you say that? The John F Kennedy tax cut had anything to do with the ragging tax cut because that tax cut was designed by Keynesians in order to stimulate demand in the economy.

Speaker 2:          15:59          And Larry's out. I don't think so. And he's right. All right. Wait, let's pause for just a second though. Can you tell me a little bit about the tax cut specifically? So we have the framework. Okay. Yeah. So there was a tax cut in 1964. So after Kennedy's president of, after Kennedy died, that was his brainchild and that actually was his main legislative accomplishment, but he was president for a thousand days and he didn't get anything done really on the economy until he introduced that tax cut in 1963. So in 61 and 62, he was doing his famous vacillating. That's when he was thinking about, hey, the canes, yours is saying we need loose money from the Federal Reserve and we need a lot of social programs. And he was experimenting with that forecast. Came in, there's going to be another recession. He pulled back and said, wait, we need some more deep thinking.

Speaker 2:          16:49          Keynesian said, keep doing it. But then pulled in other people. What do you say? No, we need a big marginal tax cut. I get it. When the stock market crashed in April 19, 62, June 19, 62, he said, okay, we need a big marginal tax gut. How powerful was the presidency at this time? You know, one of the things that we talk about on this show a lot is just that the executive branch just keeps getting more power and more power and does all this stuff via executive action. A lot of this, when you hear about it, I think the average person thinks, wait a minute, is it the president's job really to be doing all this? Is it he's supposed to sign. The law is not really making the laws, but it's interesting on that score is the John f Kennedy was actually not terribly interested in making unique executive actions actually with each of his executive sign it signing up signings.

Speaker 2:          17:32          He had these signing statements that went on and on and on about how he justified his signature was sometimes. Now we did. They just sign it right now. It's just no know he paddled up. Signature back. So good. I think that's the residence. Yeah, so he actually rejected a, an executive authority that his liberal advisors were imploring him to take him and that was his liberal advantage and say you should have a standby tax cut authority. You should have the authority as president just to reduce taxes on your own for a period of time, maybe up to 18 months. So if the economy starts tipping into recession, you can just sign a piece of paper and everyone's taxes will go down and we'll get out of recession. And then if inflation starts going up or overheating then you can take it away and that's effective. And Kennedy said, no, I'm not going to do that. That's interesting.

Speaker 1:          18:23          So I always described Kennedy as my kind of Democrat. You know, I talk a lot about how the left has sort of lost its way and it's lost its classical liberal roots and they've picked progressivism, big government over liberalism. Do you think his political ethos, I mean, from everything I'm hearing from you so far was he basically came from a classical liberal line of thinking, right? Is that, is that fair to say?

Speaker 2:          18:46          Yeah, I mean, Ken Kennedy ultimately

Speaker 1:          18:49          it sounds like there was definitely some play on both sides. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          18:51          Yeah. Kennedy ultimately did some very good things as precedent above all the tax code. You could argue the civil rights act even though like I still kind of think and Kennedy believed, and we can talk about this later if you like, that if the tax got, had just happened, the civil rights, that would have been unnecessary. We can talk about that later. The thing though about Kennedy's, he was kind of a wild man. I mean, he was a rich wildman and um, I don't know how useful that particularly is in our political life. His father was kind of crazy about what he did, how he felt he could influence politics and his son was kind of a chip off the old block, although his son was incapable of making money unlike his father. Uh, but they were both pretty wild people in kind of in charge of the United States government. That might be an argument for shrinking government.

Speaker 1:          19:40          Yeah. Well, all right, so when you say wild, I mean we hear all kinds of stories and rumors and all this and that. I mean, what are you, what are you saying wild is or was?

Speaker 2:          19:47          Yeah. Um, we at Larry and I talked a bit about a girl. He dated, a woman named Margaret [inaudible] who won the Pulitzer Prize in biography and history sort of biography, a great biography of John Calhoun, 1950. And when the pills surprise then Kenny wanted to get to network because he wanted to win, appealed surprise too. And we have her recollections of the time when she dated Kennedy right before he, um, he proposed to Jackie in 1953 and she said, you know, he'd just drive around in the convert convertible and making sure he was staying on the street car tracks and just annoying people on the road. And he was saying, I want to do this, I'm going to do this. I just realized this guy's just a little bit out of my league. Um, he was a force of nature. Um, so all right, there are some people who are forces of nature. So I just think from a certain perspective that might be a reason if we have government to make sure that if we have those people at the top of government, government should be small.

Speaker 1:          20:46          All right. I want to do a lot on the taxes and I do want to

Speaker 2:          20:48          get to civil rights, but we should back up a little bit because I haven't mentioned Jackie at all. I actually just watched the movie with Natalie Portman. I thought it was excellent. What do we need to know about their relationship, the courtship. And then the amount of power that she had, or at least the uncomfortability with, with being the first lady, and then subsequently after, after he was assassinated, Jackie, I'm the first guy who proposed to Jack. He just died a year or two ago in his home on Nantucket in Massachusetts. And Jackie turned down his proposal. This is in 1951 or 52, uh, because she and her mother did not think that he would end up being rich enough and I point out that he'd died on nantucket. But I think she was right. Even he was, would not have been rich enough. Well, um, no, I think that Jackie, and that's hard to believe, but people don't really understand what that sort of northeast, um, what, what do you call that?

Speaker 2:          21:36          It's not even a lead. It's something else, right? Just that, that family dynasty the thing where these people really were connected with other people for the purposes of, of politics and power. It's hard. It's hard to believe it. I think in modern sense. Um, but I think what really calm Jackie down, they were a great love match. I don't think there's any dispute about that Jack and Jackie, but what really settled Jackie was Joseph piece wealth. Jackie really adored Jeff Case. Father adored him. Um, and his $400,000,000 calmed her down. So I think that was at the absolute glue that kept them together. Right. And she came from a lot of money, right? I mean, the movie has had money. Yeah. They, uh, then there's a divorce and she was married and she had brought into the [inaudible] family, which was very involved. The senator from New Jersey, all class representative who voted for the Kennedy tax cut in 1960, 19 sixties.

Speaker 2:          22:31          Lewis, the famous novelist, um, but they, they had been harmed by the 1929 crisis and the Kennedy family had been immensely enriched by the 1929 crisis. So there was a big wealth gap between those families. So everything that I've seen about, or I haven't read much about her, but I've watched grey gardens, the Jackie Moody and everything that she really struggled with the public nature of this really from day one. But she also knew what she was marrying into. Is that just a little bit about the complexity of her character? Well, Jackie was this. No question. She was a sophisticated person. I mean she spoke French and Spanish and all that because she was interested in the ways of the world and she really was one of the most remarkable fashion plates in all of history. And she stepped into those roles very well. So yes, she was shy.

Speaker 2:          23:24          She has that little voice that you can vary the amount very barely here. Um, but she also understood what her potential was. Her potential was to be an ambassador for civilization and she stepped into that very, very willingly and it's good that she did. Okay. So now let's jump back, renew a little more on her, but then now let's jump back to those tax cuts. So you're saying the JFK put those tax cuts into place 62, 63, but then they weren't enacted until after he was gone. So tell me a little bit more about that. What happened is they didn't split those tax cuts in place, I'm afraid. And 61 and 62, he listened to his liberal advisors who said, we have to concentrate on government spending, hold off on tax cuts. Let's just concentrate on government spending. Let's get loose money from the Fed and maybe welfare programs spend on national parks.

Speaker 2:          24:08          I'd post offices all bunch of stuff and that will stave off for session, that'll stave it off, that'll stave it off. And if we invest in education and hospitals and Medicare and welfare, the economy will grow because of that government investment. That was the argument of his liberal advisors. Kennedy did that for the first year and a half. All the forecasts came in and said, oh, there's gonna be another recession. There's been. There were four recessions. The 1950 to 1949, 50 4:57 60, let me a fifth and 13 years. Every 24 months, 36 months, it's going to be a recession. When the stock market went down 30 percent in the spring of 1962, Kennedy said they made another recession. I am going to be so run out of office. It's not funny. We're going to switch gears here and that's when he gave his commencement speech at Yale in June of 19, 62 saying we have to think about reversing our policy mix towards tight money to protect the dollar in tax cuts to expand the economy, and then what happened?

Speaker 2:          25:04          What was the result then is liberal advisors said, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's going great though. Listen to that. We're going to do this. Their argument though, at that point when they were looking at the numbers, what, what was the argument was purely like operating on a philosophical level and then you just keep throwing money at the government and these programs. They waves academic articles. I had, they had Paul Samuelson at Mit and Robert Solow to future Nobel prize winners who was a staff and the council of economic advisors saying, Oh no, we've come up with this thing called the neoclassical synthesis that says if you have really loose money from the Fed, that will get the economy moving. Don't worry about inflation. You can mop it up with high tax rates and then the revenue you get can fund programs in education, in healthcare that will help the economy grow.

Speaker 2:          25:49          It was just stick to. I forget about those forecasts for recession, but that, that really reveals Kennedy's decision making character. He listened, listened, listened, and then just said, okay, you guys are wrong. We're going to do the opposite. And that's, you know, that's real decision making metal. So then aft in 64, when these tax cuts go into place, then what was the result? Well, so there's still a year and a half there, if I may point out. Yeah, so then in July, Kennedy started talking to his treasury secretary. Big Time. Now he had communicated with them daily on all sorts of matters. But Larry and I talk a lot about seed Douglas Dillon, the unsung hero of the Kennedy Administration, Justice Richard Chesapeake Kennedy, by the way, I'm Kennedy's treasury secretary. Dylan said, you got to protect the dollar and cut tax rates. That's what you gotta do. Kenny went on national television in August, saying, by the way, that's our policy. I'm going to introduce the bill in Congress. He did that in January of [inaudible]. Sixty three big congressional debate almost got passed before the assassination by that point, the markets and everyone else, Kennedy serious about tax that and that's when the huge sixties boom started.

Speaker 1:          26:47          What did the parties think of this at the time? Because if you think about it in the context of 2018, the Democrats generally you are for higher taxes. Republicans generally are for lower taxes. So when Kennedy goes out there and listens to the advice and says this was the party behind him, right? Or am I looking at this only through our 2018?

Speaker 2:          27:06          No, no, this is news. This bigness. Larry and I talk about this in the book a lot. The party of tax rate cuts particularly cuts on the top rate of income tax. The top one. Now back then it was 91 percent. That's unbelievable. It's really hard to fathom. On a top rate was 91 percent. It's so hard to fathom that it has to be a joke and it wasn't true because nobody paid it. No, it's true. Nobody paid that, right? Um, maybe 20 percent of people who should been a red should have applied to pay to. That's how many loopholes there were. And the Democrats said, you see these French guys, what they're doing is they're buying off the tax system. They climb, they're paying this rate, and then they get all these loopholes and they're hiding their money and we get a recession every 24 months because capital is not deployed correctly.

Speaker 2:          27:53          So it was the Democrats, Wilbur Mills, chairman of House Ways and means committee in 1959 commissioned a huge 2,500 page study on why we have to cut the top right of the income tax. And it was the Republicans who said, Hey, hold it. You know, we know what to do. We, if we say we need a loophole, give us a loophole. We're in charge here. So Republicans said, no tax rate cuts. The system's working fun in the Democrats said, tax rate cuts to get us out of the cereal recession. What does that say about how things flip over years in time? Well, I think first of all, we have to blame the Contemporary Democrats, Democrats today, the last 20 years. Um, what are you doing for getting your legacy? I mean, we can go back to the 18 twenties to realize that the founding of the party, it was about lowering top tax rates.

Speaker 2:          28:39          When you talking about the tariff, John Calhoun and Kennedy had a lot to say about calhoun through his girlfriend Margaret. Quite galloon said, yet tariff rates hurt the little guy. And then grover Cleveland income tax hurts the little guy. 18 nineties woodrow Wilson after a raised taxes had three treasury secretaries who said, these are completely scarifying. Let's lower them. They're killing investment in this country for the little guy. Really you can go through just about every Democratic president is cut tax rates. I mean, Bill Clinton cut the capital gains rate. Jimmy Carter cut the capital gains rate. Barack Obama was spooked by the exploration of the Bush tax cuts and he kept them from one more year. So, I mean, there's a long history of Democrats getting the top right.

Speaker 1:          29:19          Yeah. So then, all right, so 64. Now the economy starts going again, k Kennedy's gone. Tell me a little bit more about the legacy of that and then sort of how that got to Reagan and then we'll get it.

Speaker 2:          29:29          Okay. Here's the basic, uh, inflection. Here are the basic numbers. The eight years of the Eisenhower presidency in 1953 to 1961 economic growth was two point five percent. Okay? That's not good. Population growth than baby boom was two point five percent. This is complete stagnation with three recessions from 1961 to 1969. So at the beginning of the candidate administration, through the end of the Johnson administration, economic growth was five point one percent more than double the rate of economic growth. Now we believe it's a highly attributable Larry and I, to the policy mix that Kennedy adopted, which is we are going to guarantee that dollar. We're not going to try to get the dollar off the gold standard and Nixon would. We're going to guarantee the dollar. So we're not going to have loose money from the Fed and we're getting get money out there by lowering tax rates, particularly on the rich.

Speaker 2:          30:18          It worked. It worked as beautifully as any public policy has ever worked in, in American history. All right, so let's change gears a little bit here and talk about some of the civil rights stuff because as all of this is happening and there's a ton of. Obviously we're talking about economically mostly, uh, the civil rights movement was, was happening in, it's in its best sense. So I guess first, what was his innate feelings about the civil rights movement and we'll talk about some of the specific. Yeah, I think John F Kennedy was in favor of the civil rights movement. I think he clearly thought that there should be equal opportunity and a lot of the recalcitrance that could be found in the country, um, you know, was regrettable and should be lifted when it came to policy though, he was characteristically slow moving. So how, so for example, like what could he have done earlier, etc.

Speaker 2:          31:09          Well, yeah, I mean now we should note that slow moving might make sense and that a lot of civil rights activists argue with that the laws are already on the books. I mean there's nothing We need to do except just be true to ourselves and all the problems will be lifted you the freedom rides. He made phone calls and a birmingham jail when martin luther king was in the birmingham crisis in april, may of 19, 63. Kennedy wasn't doing a lot aside from just kind of pressure verbally. But the funny thing about that is that what a lot of leaders said in a Philip Randolph had been saying this for a long time, Is that we need jobs. You know, civil rights is nice, but when black unemployment unemployment's 20 percent and when you don't have any shackles to rub together would go to civil rights.

Speaker 2:          32:01          So kennedy started understand, oh, if we have a booming economy, a lot of people in this country, including whites, are going to start relaxing and say, sure, blacks, whites, everything. Because everyone is well off and that kennedy perceived. That's one of the reasons he cut taxes. So I know I'm going to get some crap for saying this, but that almost seems like the trump view of equality that trump has been cutting taxes. Uh, the, I think I read just a couple of weeks ago, the black unemployment is at an all time low right now, so he was sort of taking that. That's a page from the jfk book. It is. And when I talk about the civil rights act of four $65 and 64 when kennedy introduced in june of [inaudible] 63 and it was passed, um, I don't know if the tax cut have been passed. If we had had a growing economy and five percent in the fifth days, would we have even thought to have a civil rights act? I don't know because everyone might have been getting along well enough that kennedy kind of came to that realization and that's a real thing. so if we perceive it today, we shouldn't run away from it. That's a, that's a good association.

Speaker 1:          33:03          Yeah. It's interesting because I know even just by saying those two names in the same sentence, a certain amount of people that are going to be angry at me, but that's all right. Um, what, what was the nature of his relationship with martin luther king? Because I've read a bit about it and it sounds like it was, it was kind of complex. There were places where they were lined up, but not all the time.

Speaker 2:          33:21          Well, let me answer it this way. What was the federal government's relationship with martin luther king? Because jagger, hoover of course, is still doing his thing, his fbi director with all the kind of surveillance, probably harassment of martin luther king and kennedy is paralyzed as everyone is with the fbi. Um, so there's that. I mean, kennedy is not doing anything about the kind of harassment

Speaker 1:          33:45          kennedy know about that. Do we know if kennedy knew that all that was happening?

Speaker 2:          33:48          I'd have to look at the files. We have a lot of those remain classified. Um, so I'm not totally sure.

Speaker 1:          33:56          Yeah. They have declassified some of this stuff just in the last year, right? It's exposed a little bit more of the surveillance that was happening. Yeah, mlk. right. But what about their personality

Speaker 2:          34:06          relationship? Yeah, I think kennedy appreciated kings, intellectual ism. I mean there was kind of. He brought a king into the white house and then he, he watched the march on Washington from the portico of the white house, kind of peering around the corner and then invited everyone back afterwards and he apparently said, I wish I could be out there with them and acted chummy with king, but he did kind of keep them at arm's length. I think he was a little worried about king's association, a invidious or not with communism because kennedy was very anticommunist. Right.

Speaker 1:          34:40          So that's interesting because a, from when we're taping this, it was just a couple of weeks ago that it was a martin luther king day and I, you know, I find it, it's one of the strangest days to be on, on twitter. not that you can garner that much embraced twitter, but where everyone's sort of takes mlk and uses them for their modern day political purpose. Right. So the meme. So some people saying he was a socialist, some people saying he was a communist, he was an environmentalist, eat whatever you want him to be within your 2018 lens. That's what people use. But that's really interesting to me. But jfk had this, this idea of built in him from childhood, as you were saying about hating communism. Mlk had some association, at least with sort of loosely communism or socialism or certainly had issues with the United States government and certain levels of capitalism. So they did have. They were at loggerheads in some way.

Speaker 2:          35:27          Yeah, I think kennedy did not want to get burned by king. In other words, he didn't want to kind of bring king into his inner circle. And then king manifests himself as a flaming communist kennedy. It was way too cool a character to get burned that way. But by the summer of [inaudible] 63. So after the birmingham crisis, which was the national outrage on television, can I get heckled and his speeches? Hey, you're not doing anything about civil rights. And that's when he really pushed the tax cut in that august and september nine, 63. Which is when the march on Washington happen, and let's remember the subtitle of the march on Washington, martin luther king, a Philip Randolph was march on Washington, was the march on Washington for jobs and freedom and those are the two sides of kennedy's legislative agenda, tax cut. Civil rights act. Kennedy actually felt, we believe that if you had the tax cut early enough, you wouldn't even need the civil rights act.

Speaker 2:          36:15          So that's the way kind of kennedy walkthrough this going to complicated politics. So he really sounds to me sort of like a politician's politician. He doesn't sound much like an ideolog specifically, and that he really was listening to the people about him. Is there anything else that we're missing to sort of get the full picture on the way he tried to govern? Yeah, I mean he got lucky too, and I hate to use that word in this context. I'm the most outrageous event in the history of the rights movement. Might be the birmingham birmingham church bombing and September, 1963 when the four girls were killed by dynamite, um, that actually made kennedy's tax cut because the event was so outrageous. Case tax bill was being voted on in congress. Right. Then the southern democrats did not feel like they could make a show of defeating kennedy's legislation because that event was so outrageous and then it slipped through the house and passed right there.

Speaker 2:          37:07          So the birmingham church bombing actually had a lot to do with the passage of the kennedy tax cut. That's interesting. So yeah, I know kennedy, he was okay as a legislator, but I mean he got away with a lot too. And he got, he got a little lucky. Interesting. So speaking of luck, let's talk about the cuban missile crisis. Got a little bit, because I guess this really is the. well, I guess you would argue that the tax guides really are his biggest legacy, but I think most people think of the cuban missile crisis. Uh, so just to kind of set the stage. Sure. Well, I just want to point out in terms of his legislative agenda, I don't think it's disputable, but the tax cut was his most important legacy. Maybe the civil rights act, but yeah, when it comes to foreign policy, we're talking about two different ballgames.

Speaker 2:          37:47          Yeah, like even as a grad and now that played right to kennedy's strength, I'm afraid because if it was going to be clarified, there's going to be a contest between the us and the representative communism, the soviet union, the us was going to win so that that played right into his hands so that we know that that's built into him from child. Just give me a cuban missile. Crisis was kind of one on one, a little bit about wHat led up to what his decision making was. That showed a piece of wonder. So nikita khrushchev is the premier of the soviet union and they use new client states and Cuba. If ever since fidel castro had taken over in 59 and a. He khrushchev sent nuclear missiles to Cuba, so there'd be 90 miles away from us territory in Florida. When this is discovered, a kennedy tells the soviets they have to get out immediately. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          38:34          has done a great tension, could lead to the firing of missiles in kennedy, gets khrushchev to face down. Kennedy gets him to say, okay, we'll pull our missiles out, and it was Big akan christians face back in the soviet union. One tidbit about that, the documents that came out in november on the presidential assassination do seat just this past november, the last couple of months ago, do seem to indicate that khrushchev gave the order after that humiliation to all networks globally. The kennedy should be assassinated and lee harvey oswald may have begun his preparations because of that director. Wow. All right, so I do want to talk about the assassination. Obviously even just the way you said that there's so much of it that it's hard to piece together. And how far do you want to go down the rabbit hole and filed the conspiracies and all that, but we will get to that.

Speaker 2:          39:23          But what. What was the final Moment that got khrushchev to turn down? I mean, did kennedy basicaLly say, well, I know there's the line of course, but was it really communicated like this is going to be world war three? I thinK to answer that question, um, we have to speak russian and have access to the archives because I think what happened is that crew chef felt pressure at home. Um, as a lot of people have said, the soviet union really was the status quo power in the politburo began asking khrushchev, um, are you going to take our lives away from us? You're going to take our summer docos on the caspian sea away from us and our, our 10 percent of us in the soviet union who have a nice life. Um, what are you doing? Would you please Back down? it seems that whatever kennedy was doing, the real folding happened on the soviet side.

Speaker 2:          40:13          And chris, jeff was not the first among equals. I mean, he did not. He was barely premier of the soviet union. So it seems that, and we don't have enough information on this because it's behind the source walls that the russians backed down because they realized khrushchev was acting crazy. Yeah. This may sound like an amateur question, but did they ever actually speak the two of them through translators? Was there ever or everything goes through the communication for review. There's a great book on this called one hell of A gamble, uh, which has all the documents is amazing book by ernest may and phil zelikow from, from the 1990. So let's look that up. How much after the cuban missile crisis, I mean, that really changed everything in american foreign policy, right? I mean, it really was a huge catalyst for a lot. Well, we argue in our book, um, that the, the big change foreign policy wise came a year later when kennedy countenanced assisted in the assassination of the south vietnamese president's am in november, just a couple of weeks before kennedy's assassination. And that seems to have been the tipping point in Vietnam. I'm telling you, I've been listening to a lot of the kennedy tapes on Vietnam with mcnamara and everything else. It is true that kennedy had no real interest in a longterm war in southeast asia and no, he didn't. What on earth he was doing helping to assassinate cme and I have no idea and that was a big mistake. So was that really just because he had this again, he had this thing drilled him from his father

Speaker 1:          41:34          from childhood about communism and maybe that overrode the intellectual part of him that said, let's not get into these intractable wars.

Speaker 2:          41:42          Yeah, I think. I think gm and Vietnam was one of those people that madden kennedy, because he didn't like king. He didn't want you to bring him into, into his circle. And then have you burned him? Tim was an american guy. Yeah. He's our guy in south Vietnam and he just kept alienating people and making life difficult for the monks scenario and kennedy's like, hey, you're supposed to be our guy. And um, John F. Kennedy. So at some point kennedy will break and just said, okay, you're gone. Gone. And this meant that. Fascinated and that is rare in the kennedy ambit, um, and it ended up being not good for american and vietnamese fortunes for the next 10 years.

Speaker 1:          42:24          Yeah. What else do we need to know about your sort of, the personal side in terms of what was going on in the white house during those years?

Speaker 2:          42:32          Yeah, I mean he ran an elegant white house and all that. He did have his Kids. Girlfriends really kind of did that, that side of him to desecrate the white house and I think we have to understand what you mean.

Speaker 1:          42:42          well, no, I think it's hard for people to understand in a modern sense of what could it be for social media before everyone had a phone and all that. Like what did the average person know about that at the time or what was the media even saying about that?

Speaker 2:          42:56          Well, I kind of the wisdom of crowds. I think the electorate largely understood what was going on even though there's no hard evidence in the papers and so forth. And there really wasn't any hard evidence. I mean, now we know about his swimming nude and this is what the pools and the secret service having to hold his drinks and all that stuff and we know all about that now when judith exner may have been killed by the communists because she was a plant and all that. Judith exner, but give her punches. Nice. Um, I believe that because kennedy had so many kind of crazy affairs in the white house, the press felt that it was burned, like we're not allowed to report this. And that's really what gave us water k because nixon's things were kind of small in comparison. And the press just like we got burned them, we're not going to get burned again.

Speaker 1:          43:44          Wow. That's fascinating. I've never heard anyone lay it out like that. So basically they kind of played along with jfk because they were trying to be nice. Maybe he was a little bit of their guys sort of. But then,

Speaker 2:          43:54          and if they felt embarrassed by it, I mean they felt used. I mean we're just shutting up about this. And then the next time a suggestion of that came around, they just went with a sledge hammer.

Speaker 1:          44:05          Interesting. That's really interesting. Sorry. So obviously we have to talk about the assassination. Tell me a little bit just in the weeks leading up to it and what was going on in the presidency.

Speaker 2:          44:15          Yeah, I think that was really kennedy's highest time as president thurston clarke has written a great book about kennedy's last hundred days from august to November, 1963. But he really was coming into his own. And I think that's true actually. He kept talking to the secret service agent. Hey, isn't this a great day to Be alive? I mean, he was really into it. um, his tax that was going through. So [inaudible] was going through, the soviets were gone. He just says that's a footnote. So how public was that by the way? Was that. Oh, it was public. It was completely public. Well, no, it was presented as a palace coup that it was internal. So the american fingerprints were not clear at the time. And his ambassador is new ambassador henry cabot lodge, uh, who defeated in the senate race and fifties was kind of the fall guy, so it appears that he put somebody in and sat in saigon who would have to endure the dirty work.

Speaker 2:          45:10          So aside from that, kennedy's enjoying watching polo, horace mitchell missile launches and he's laughing at the senate finance committee, which is trying to hold up his tax cut and it sounds like you guys keep trying to hold it up, but you know, I'm going to win. So he's really kind of coming into his own. And then November 22nd. So what was it, you know, how to ask this question properly because you see everyone seen so much about it, but the new starts breaking and it's hard to imagine what breaking news would be like at that time. Now, can you kind of frame that a little bit? We can see these. They're on youtube. Um, so we, soap operas back then were, were alive. So they will be live actors acting out the soap opera and they were broken into. and you can watch this again and on the internet right now, uh, with bulletins from wall, from a walter cronkite and so forth, uh, saying that, uh, there's been an incident, dallas President's been shot and then they would go back to the live acting and then the actors would just start acting again about the drama of the soap opeRa.

Speaker 2:          46:14          But it took about probably about 45 minutes to an hour for people to realize that that happened here. When the, the conspiracies start popping like immediately where people go, something is wrong here, you know, why was he taking this sort of circular route and around with the topless card and all of that stuff. Like people immediately doing that. Well, yeah. I mean the trip to dallas itself was controversial. It was in the planning in october, november because dallas was a hotbed of kind of what we might call white supremacy. And people worry. Well, and kennedy said it's not country down there. They're kind of anticandida even though they voted for kennedy because of johnson on the ticket. so everyone was worried about his not getting a good reception in Texas from the, kind of called them racist, you know, whites, if you want to use those terms. But the trip was totally successful on those counts. He went to fort worth and a huge celebration and he went to dallas and everyone loved them in the last words, perhaps spoken to John F. Kennedy were from connally's wife in the car. Well, it's all over now and you can't say the Texas doesn't love you. And then he was blown away. Wow. Incredible. So, you know, I think the first time that I

Speaker 1:          47:30          paid at the end, the attention to this was probably in high school when I saw the movie, jfk. Uh, I assume you've seen the video. So how far is as someone that really cares about this story and all that, I mean, how far down all these rabbit holes are you willing to go? It sounds like some of it's still unfolding as new documents still come out, but just for you as someone that is interested in this.

Speaker 2:          47:51          Yeah, I mean I think, um, there are a couple aspects of the assassination that we have to take seriously, that we have to kind of lose our sophistication about, oh, oswald acted alone. Now hold it up. Dealey plaza is the best place possible for an assassination. That's where it happened. That should interest us in terms of conspiracy theories. Can you, can you explain why? I mean there's that slow turn as the points of vision. Oh, it's at the end of the parade routes to the parade is over and then there has to be a right turn and a left turn that goes then downhill. So the parade's over, which means the intensity of the experiences over in the secret services, um, interest will start to wane. And that was absolutely essential in the assassination. Then. So there's that setting in those, the school book depository right there with an aggressive goal and an overpass to stemmons freeway. And um, well it's a perfect place for assassination. So therefore we should stop this pseudo sophistication about, oh, alice world acted alone. The other thing too is kennedy was absurdly good at making enemies. I mean, he just made enemies, I mean, his father made enemies for a living. So

Speaker 1:          48:58          by the way, we've talked for 45 or 50 minutes and we haven't even said in military industrial complex one. We obviously had some sort of issues with him, which we can touch on it though,

Speaker 2:          49:06          right? So, um, so, and oswald also had connections to beat the band with the mob. The soviets, cubans, you know, I mean, so that's also very fruitful. Jack ruby oswald was killed. Jack ruby has connections to beat the band. So these are all suggestive nonetheless. James pearson's book, camelot and the cultural revolution is the best book ever written, but about the kennedy assassination in. It is about the liberal reaction to the kennedy assassination because liberals to this day have pinned it on the white supremacists in dallas. And that's just crazy. He was killed because he was a con because he was an anticommunist. I mean, that's pretty clear that lee harvey oswald killed John F. Kennedy because John F. Kennedy was anticommunist and we now are starting to piece together that he may have felt he was acting on orders from the soviet union.

Speaker 1:          49:56          We may have felt. That's an interesting way of phrasing it. What do you mean may have felt

Speaker 2:          50:02          well? Oswald was quite a character and what was going on in his head. We don't know. We do know that he met. He went to the cube, the cuban embassy to me, to soviet assassination expert in september 19, 63. The documents that just came out imply that it was understood in late 1962, that nikita khrushchev, after getting burned in the cuban missile crisis, may have sent out some kind of broad order into the global soviet network than it would be desirable if president at states were assassinated in that order may have been called back because of pressure within the politburo at chris chef, you're still acting like a nut. Khrushchev was forced out in 1964, but once you squeeze the toothpaste out of the tube, it's done hard to get it back in. So it may be, this is speculation, but grounded in some sources that oswald was part of that initial outreach and then may not have stopped and then went ahead with it.

Speaker 2:          50:58          So basically you're willing to go down these, these routes. You sort of have to do that. The more I read about this and the more of these documentaries I watched, you know, I've got across the and book right there and I always quote, you know, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. So I don't know that we have the extraordinary evidence, but there were so many pieces in play here that, that make it seem hard to believe. I think the one thing that is firming up pretty well is that oswald killed kennedy because he perceived kennedy to be anticommunist. So it was the left that killed kennedy because kennedy was too right wing, um, that's been lost over the last 50 some years. That is firming up through a lot of sources. that's the most important thing. I think to conclude then with the deep story of oswald's connections are okay.

Speaker 2:          51:44          That's interesting. From the grassy knoll. No, there's no shot from the grassy knoll. It's impossible. Anyone's been a dealer. Plaza realizes that's a physical impossibility. All that stuff. It does appear very clearly that oswald fire, those bullets hit the traffic light. Then he hit kennedy in the neck. Then he had kennedy and the dha. The magic bullet. That's very easy to see with a heavy case bullet. Full metal jacket. Yeah. That will act that way. The ballistics aren't a question. Oswald shot kennedy. What was it like after the few weeks after the assassination? Johnson was disoriented. Um, you know, his staff of kennedy's people wanted to resign. They didn't like johnson. I'm the one thing he realized though, is that, uh, I have to act to make, to memorialize kennedy. And the one specific step he took was he told the senate, guess what you're doing? You're passing his tax cut right now, which they did because he could intimidate the senate.

Speaker 2:          52:38          That gave us the tax cut of 1964 and then kennedy's promise was fulfilled in that five percent growth kept cruising through the sixties. What waS the general, even taking it away from the political side, the general feeling in the country after that? Yeah. Um, this whole thing about lost innocence, uh, I was just in fort worth a couple of weeKs ago and I can't believe fort worth and dallas have a big rivalry. Fort worth thinks as much better than tantalus reds 30 miles away. And uh, everywhere in fort worth there are these reminders of kennedy's last, uh, moments when America was innocent. We're in fort worth and then he went to dallas where he was killed. Um, so that myth of american innocence is perpetuated. I don't think it's particularly a, makes a lOt of sense in terms of. First of all, kennedy was killed because he was anticommunist.

Speaker 2:          53:28          So I know the narrative makes sense on that grounds too. And I mean, look, the civil rights movement, which was a great benefit to the United States, will then push through and flourished after 1963. So that kind of lost innocence I've never quite understood. So basically the three markers really are the economic stuff, the tax guides, the civil rights stuff, and the cuban missile crisis. Is there anything else we're missing in there that that's important? Well, the Vietnam, I mean, kennedy would have never let Vietnam be. The disaster was. He would have never let that happen. So oliver stone is completely wrong. That, uh, you know, that kenny was killed by right wingers who, one of the Vietnam war. But uh, it is, I think in escapable to conclude that kennedy would not have presided over the Vietnam wars like johnson did. yeah. I'm curious as a historian and someone that deeply cares about this stuff, when you see all of these movies, I mean we make everything into movies now rather jfk and there's lincoln, everything now there's like 18 winston churchill stuff.

Speaker 2:          54:30          How much does that concern you? Like at some level it's great. people are getting basic ideas about this stuff. But then in the case of the jfk movie, which I really loved by the way, and I can, as you can see, I can play those conspiracy games, but that it also is hinting at, you know, there's a real implication that, that johnson maybe had something to do with it in the jfk movie and read all that stuff. So how much does that worry you that we get all of our information now from movies and documentaries and all that history is cult like having a history originated in the stone age, around campfires. Tell me stories about them. And it's not a closeted academic subject. I mean, academics have a lot to say, but there has to be very, you know, good interaction, healthy interaction between all of these kinds of so called vulgar forms of history, which are wonderful, uh, better in certain ways and academic history.

Speaker 2:          55:18          Um, I just thought all of a sudden it's great movie maker. I mean, I love his movies and platoon is incredible movie the others. But he has an ax to grind about Vietnam. I mean, it was the capitalist who gave it to us. It was the right to gave it to us, know if you kept the anticommunist presidents and you've got to realize he was anticommunist. He would have realized how to deal with that crisis. Hmm. Alright. So to wrap this all up, I thought that the right way to end this would be. We've talked a little bit about the sort of modern day context and the modern day lens on some of this stuff and you've referenced how sort of the parties have kind of flipped some of the things that jfk was saying then would not be things that democrats would say. Now, what do you think his political alignments would be these days if John F. Kennedy had lived?

Speaker 2:          56:05          I don't think the democratic party would have flipped. So let's say John F. Kennedy has two term presidency. Somehow we don't really have Vietnam war. He is ex president, 1969. Um, to the democrats spend the next 20, 30 years saying that kennedy tax cut had nothing to do with cutting the top right. No. He would've been forced discipline on that conversation in the democrats would have been born along as the party of tax cuts. So that investment flows into the real world and there are lots of jobs for the regular guy. So no, I think that the democratic party would have been a lot different than if he had lived. Wow. so, so he really was the lay's. is it fair to say then you think that he was sort of the last, somewhat small democrat, small government democrat at some level? yeah. I think what happened is that the left took advantage of the assassination because kennedy wasn't around to defend himself specifically because of the assassination.

Speaker 2:          56:56          The left said, aha, we can misrepresent his record, we can hold him high, some kind of Big government liberal. And then he became that and caroline and john john. We're kind of enough to go along with that ted certainly. And that became the icon of John F. Kennedy. John kennedy himself would have never let that happen. So I'm trying to place where he would be at right now. And I'm guessing. sorry. So if he was basically for tax cuts, he believed in a strong military at some level because he was fighting communism yet also at all these issues with the military and industrial complex. I'm trying to figure out what, how would you frame that type of political person these days? It's like sort of libertarian, but then with a little bit of a neo-con yeah. Well these days would be very different. I don't even thinK we would have had bill clinton because kennedy would have been around to be the elder party leader and people wouldn't have been able to get away with a lot of the misrepresentation that they have in order to make the modern democratic party.

Speaker 2:          57:52          That's interesting. So the assassination and then subsequently the whole family sort of falling apart and Robert Kennedy and everything else and I mean that really did set it, set the nation in a strange way, but it really did something crazy to the democratic party inherently because it's holding machine. Yeah, sorT of. You mentioned rfk. Yeah. Rfk probably was going to have another marginal tax cut a. Then he's blown away in 1968. Ted kennedy continue to talk about tax cuts through the mid seventies and then only in 1980 became this kind of big status, a government type. So yeah, we could have. It could have been a lot different if the kennedy boys had lived. Yeah. Do you think we're done with the dynasties? I mean it seems to be now that you know, hillary lost, so it seems like perhaps we've had our last clinton, although I'm sure chelsea is going to run for senator from New York or something like that.

Speaker 2:          58:40          You know, the bush family really after jeb did so horribly. It seems like that might be done. Although George Bush down in Texas, maybe we'll do something. Maybe trump iS goIng to step aside and let ivanka run next time or who knows, but I sense that the dynasty thing really has people's sort of exhaustion, you know, with families that have this much power really has reached a peak and that would seem to be a celebrity as phenomenon. I think again, the assassination is at fault here. If John F. Kennedy had had two full terms, would the nation have felt the obligation to find out about all these other kennedy's? Probably not, but the cutting short of that political career, I think is what gave life to all these

Speaker 1:          59:21          other kennedy's running for office. Wow. It's fascinating stuff. Well, I've thoroughly enjoyed this. We're going to put the link to your book. Write down below. So for more on jfk, his life and legacy checkout. Brian's book, jfk, and the reagan revolution, a secret history of american prosperity, which again, we're going to link to write down below.
