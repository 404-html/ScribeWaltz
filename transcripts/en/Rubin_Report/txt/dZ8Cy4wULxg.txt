Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Monday was Dr. Martin Luther King Junior Day and as is the case with almost everything lately, virtually everyone on social media seemed to parse out mlks words for whatever narrative they're currently pushing in our modern times. I saw articles on how Mlk was the first environmentalist, how he was an ardent feminist, a communist, a socialist, and much more. The one quote I tweeted of his is perhaps his most famous. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I believe this quote to be as relevant now as it was in the early 1960s but for a whole other set of reasons. In the 1960s mlk was fighting for equality under the law and equality of opportunity to things that we should all absolutely believe in today.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Those who judge people by the color of their skin and not the content of their character are fighting not for a quality, but for special treatment of some at the exclusion of others. This misguided principle thinking you should treat someone differently because of their skin color or thinking someone should believe what you think they should believe because of their skin color or any other immutable characteristic is the essence of prejudice, which means to prejudge. This is the complete reverse of what mlk stood for and sadly this way of thinking has infected the modern left almost completely. This is why like myself, so many of you find yourselves on the outside of a political bubble that you were once safely. Part of for this direct message though, I don't want to focus on the flaws of identity politics. Instead, I want to focus on one of the other topics I just mentioned, socialism, and for the purposes of this message I want to put aside whether mlk was a capitalist or a communist or a socialist or a hybrid of any of them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       What I want to discuss is some of the reaction around the word socialism itself. The amount of people I see talking about socialism positively is actually staggering. A tweet I set out saying socialism isn't cool. Even got me into a little exchange on twitter with the official verified Socialist Party who explained to me that socialism has actually never been tried, which is why we don't know if it'll work yet. Perhaps they should tell that to the people of Venezuela right now who were fighting for food and basic services as they watched their socialist system collapse on top of them. The ideas of socialism, that the means of production, distribution and labor should be owned, controlled and regulated by the community as a whole are the worst sort of collectivist ideas which exist. The very implication that the group knows what is good for the individual that we exist to do things for the greater good is totally antithetical to the purpose of being human.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       It's your job to find value in your work, to strive for more than you have to bring good to yourself and the people around you and to live as a free person as you see fit. The very idea that you should set aside your individuality for the community as a whole, which virtually always turns into an intolerant hostile mob is exactly why so many have died in socialist regimes. Despite the obvious failures of socialism, Socialists have no problem using the freedoms of capitalism against itself. This is perhaps the most perverse part of the socialist worldview. Much like Islamism, socialism wants to use our freedoms against us until it attains complete power. For example, they use the tools of twitter and facebook companies created through the ingenuity of individuals and the freedom of capitalism to attack the very system that they often live in. By the way, I'm all for them being able to do this even if I don't like what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       That's the tricky part of freedom. It even applies to people and ideas you don't like. Just think for a moment, if we had a socialist government in charge right now, how do you think it would be going for free expression and free speech? How tolerant would they be of all the people that they label, Nazis and bigots, whatever you may think of Donald Trump and the evil capitalists, are they the ones coming for anyone? Speech right now, our reporters being put in jail. Actually President Obama used the espionage act to put a record number of reporters in jail, and as far as I know, trump who dislikes the press to put it mildly, hasn't put anyone in prison for the crime of journalism. Fortunately, I see a rising tide in America based on liberty, freedom and individual choice. Note how those words themselves are somehow thought of as evil.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       In the socialist lexicon, liberty, freedom, and individual choice must all be sacrificed for the greater good. The what they're not telling you is that the greater good is usually for the tiny minority in the elite protected class. Their ideas have never worked and will never work because a system built on stripping our humanity is in direct conflict with what it means to be human. I've said it before and I'll say it again. This perfect system which they wish to create can never be perfect because we humans as flawed as we are, are part of it. Imperfect beings cannot create a perfect system, but what we can create as a system that always does its best to further the advancement of human freedom for all its flaws. This is what capitalism is, which is why if you're watching this from a capitalist society, you should consider yourself one of the lucky ones.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       Of course, in America, politicians don't outright call themselves socialists. They say that their democratic socialists, this is Bernie Sanders Mantra as he calls for a revolution of every kind to be a political, social or even environmental, whatever that means. What Bernie forgets or intentionally obfuscates is that the democratic part of this, of course, will always be tossed away as socialism takes root. It's also why there's no doubt in my mind that eventually the social justice movement, we'll turn on Bernie himself and I think there's already plenty of evidence of that. Democracy is the enemy of socialism and Bernie's trying to have it both ways. There's also a reason that the social justice movement has such a socialist strain within it. Both of these movements based on frowning, on achievement and accomplishment, and a resentment of those who break the mold, need people to be oppressed or at least believe that they're oppressed, to survive creativity, free thought and the pursuit of your own happiness is the antidote to both social justice and socialism. It's either that or a life of bitterness, resentment, and jealousy, which in my view is less socialism and more just antisocial.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       Joining me today is the founder and director of turning point USA, a student organization for young conservatives, which advocates for free markets and limited government. Charlie Kirk, welcome to the Rubin report. Glad to be here. Big Fan. That's great. Young Conservatives. I thought there was no such thing and that was like the Yeti or the Unicorn or Falcor or something. There's more of us than you might imagine. It's not all conservative. Some are libertarians, some are free thinkers, independence, people on the center. Right. We just had that amazing conference that you were nice enough to come down and speak at in Florida. Uh, 2000, 600, 700 students from all 50 states. And it was so funny. I couldn't pay the media outlets to cover this. Then you know, I was calling up the New York Times, Washington Post here. We had, you know, thousands of students given up their winter break to come here from you and me and the best speakers, you know, that advocate for freedom and none of the media outlets in the traditional media outlets covered it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       But it's amazing. There is a, there is a revolution happening on these campuses but it's not, it's not against, you know, conservatives, all this, it's, it's, it's a new train of thought that we want freedom, we want smaller government but it's also fighting the culture war, which is for free speech, for diversity of ideas and really against what these college campuses have created. Yes. So you're in the thick of a lot of the things obviously that we talk about here. So first I just want to talk briefly about how we met, because I think it's kind of, it kind of shows sort of how you operate and why turning point has taken off. So we had met about a month and a half ago at the is freedom Santeria then in palm springs. Where you, where you at panelists? There I was a panelist and he's kind of helicoptering around of a lot of friends that, you know, attending that conference you were there and everyone was like, oh you got to meet Charlie [inaudible]. Got To be trying to hurt. We met for two seconds. You said a couple of Nice things about me and you're like, know we're doing this,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       uh, our gig in palm springs in a couple of weeks, why don't you come down and talk and, and then, and immediately we worked it out and your guys send me the paper work the next day and it was done. And I think that does illustrate something cause we're going to get into some of the issues that should be agree on and some of the things we disagree on. But basically you were like, look, you're, you're down for free speech. That's the main thing here. And I want my audience to, to hear you talk about it.

Speaker 3:          00:09:19       Well, I, you're a rational thinker, which is really rare to find them. California. I'm kidding. But no, I mean I'm a big fan of the show and I watch a lot, every interviews and I know you're, you know, you have a huge following amongst young people and I mean, I met you, I met you. I was like, yeah, let's get you on board. I'm a, I've always been a gut player for better, for worse. It's gotten me into a little bit of trouble at times, but I think it's been positive. You just have to, you have to go with your gut and make quick decisions and similar, that's where I met kandace owens to who's now doing a wonderful job with us. And it took me about 45 seconds until I offered her a job.

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       Literally, I think it happened right in front of me. And then you walked up to him. That's right. Candice was like, I just got a job. And you were like, let me do something with you. And it was just like, all right, look, this guy's obviously open to some different people in total in the Schema, what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       You need the diversity of ideas, right? If you, if you're in a room where everyone thinks exactly the same, that would be a university. So, uh, you, you need the diversity ideas and you need, you need to be able to challenge your viewpoint around a broader theme of freedom. Um, that really is okay to have that sort of discussion.

Speaker 4:          00:10:22       Yeah. So to, to illustrate that point. So then about, uh, I think it was the week before Christmas, you guys do this. I was it the largest conservative college group we're waiting for.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       We're waiting for someone to correct us. We've done some research. We have never found anything even close and you'll have 2,650 students from all 50 states. No one's really found anything even comparable of size. So we call it the largest until someone corrects us.

Speaker 4:          00:10:47       Well, there you had some protesters out there, you know, they show up all the time to everything. But, but there was true diversity of thought there. It was also sort of a Reuben report and reunion for me because prager was there and Gutfeld was there. All my best friend candace was there obviously and and a whole bunch of other, sure. Well trump junior was there. Is it just a series of people? I went up there and I talked about being gay, married and I talked about being pro choice and a and a bunch of other things that if you were to poll the average conservative that perhaps they're not for I think gay marriage. Maybe it's a little, a little different at this point, but I got a standing ovation and everywhere that I lost. Yeah, a bunch of times and, and everywhere that I went for those two, three days that I was there and it, and by no means was this just me. I mean Ben Shapiro came out, it was like, it was like Elvis. I going to say it was like the rolling stones is nuts, but that happened to everybody. I went for breakfast, I need coffee before I talked to people. Yet I'm literally, there's a line of a hundred people popping up. It's like they start swearing. But that said something to me beyond the, that there's something

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       else going on with young people right now where they actually, as the young people say, they're, they're really woke. So what's happening here? And it's that diversity of ideas that I think illustrates what makes our organization so unique. So a reporter came up to me and he was totally dishonest guy. Like, well, this, this feels like a Donald Trump rally. I said, how could you possibly say that? Sure. We have trump jr. We have Gorka. We also Austin Petersen who ran for president in the Libertarian Party. Yeah, we have Ruben who is not a leftist anymore, but he's somewhere out there and he believes in freedom, right? We've been Shapiro who literally led the never trump, right? We, we, we have a huge diversity. Dorsey of ideas. And each speaker was respected, was given, standing ovations, was challenged appropriately. And I think that really says something about this new conservate terrian movement that we're helping create, which is we don't have to agree on 100% of conservative dogma.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       Let's just get the big stuff right. The big stuff. Is America a great country? Yes. It's free enterprise a good thing. Yes. You know, it's freedom. Something that we should really embrace as a general idea. Yes. It's socialism bad. Yes. That's just pretty much the main key points in the rest of the stuff we can argue and disagree with. Respectfully. Yeah. When did you wake up to some of this stuff? So just tell me a little bit about your growing up and your situation. I was ugly. Politics, current, crazy, crazy kid growing up. Grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Um, always as a conservative Republican growing up around a lot of leftists and liberals in my public high school. And I was young and conservative like, cause I actually, I loved history and I was always contrarion. Right. So I'd always be challenging my teachers.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       My parents were generally republican, right. They weren't, you know, necessarily political, but they were center, right. Bill O'Reilly factor watching, you know, Republicans that I always used to say. And then I would always just challenged teachers that would say that, you know, all conservatives want to do is kill poor people and you know, pollute the environment. The typical talking points, right? Yeah. And being the kind of, you know, red bull, I guess you could say. I'd always challenged the teachers and say, well no, Ronald Reagan lifted more people out of poverty than you're crazy social programs that Jimmy Carter, it drove them nuts and I found enjoyment in it. And uh, you know, the, the further down that rabbit hole you get, the more you read Milton Friedman, the more you understand the foundational principles and ideas. At a young age. I just became on fire for politics and for economics.

Speaker 3:          00:14:14       And Long Story Short, I started this organization when I was 18 instead of going to college and ended up being a wonderful decision and helped really place myself in a movement that was waiting to be grown. And this is something a lot bigger than just politics. This is the fight for the soul of the country and it has to start on college campuses and it's really the struggle for our generation and it's, it's really, if you divide it, it's do we want, do we believe America's the greatest country in the history of the world and do we believe freedom is a good thing or do we want to go a completely different direction that looks much more like a European socialist democracy that does not honor civil liberties, that does not honor private property and really deteriorates everything that made America great place that that's the decision our generation has to make.

Speaker 4:          00:14:58       It's kind of funny, you're sort of like the non Silicon Valley version of like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, the guy that didn't quite flattering but didn't go to college or dropped out of college and now you're talking to college people. When did you realize that that was the place that this battle had to be? Right.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       The first couple of years of starting turning point USA, it started as kind of a generic student organization, but just like any good innovator and entrepreneur. I listened and I learned and I realized there was such frustration amongst self identified conservative Libertarians on campus that were not being properly channeled and organized. They felt as if they were being targeted and that they were being suppressed and their ideas were not being allowed to be heard. And we made a decision. That turning point after a couple of years is let's not just fight the political war. Let's double down and fight the culture war and that we, we can be the champions of free speech and we can be the ambassadors of freedom. Where really you see these campuses, I call them islands at totalitarianism. You know, their idea of diversity is a group of people that all look different, but they think the same. That's not diversity. And so turning point has benefited tremendously over the last couple of years of really being the champions of free speech and also saying, Hey, we're not, Republicans were not conservatives. We're not libertarians. You can call us all that stuff. That's fine. We have members that are across that whole spectrum. As long as you believe in freedom, you believe America's a great country. Welcome aboard.

Speaker 4:          00:16:21       Do you think the idea of having that kind of wide tent is part of the appeal? Like I think people are so sick of the labels and all that. Total is cool. I spend actually most of the weekend hanging out with, with Austin. Uh, but part of it also hanging out with Tommy and candace and a whole bunch of other people and I was like, there really is. And then, and then uh, you know, Alison Stuckey was there and a couple of other people and I was like, wow, these people actually really do think different things. Totally. [inaudible] and my libertarian side usually goes to kind of where Austin's that, but I was like, we were all having dinner after and having some great thing. Then I was like, this is great. We're having real discussions about, we're really big and into this. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:16:57       And there is that disagreement, but if you put them all in a room, they built, they get the big stuff. Right, right. You know, do we believe that free enterprise has been a net positive for humanity? Do we believe the constitution is a great political document that should be preserved, protected, and better understood. Do we believe America has been a wonderful, you know, net benefit for humanity. You know, over the last 200 years they probably agreed wholeheartedly and all that. It's the other stuff where they start to have a little philosophical differences, but that disagreement is not being found on the left right now. If you disagree with one core tenant of leftist dogma, you're ostracized. You're kicked out, and that shows their, they're not a diverse political movement. The new modern American left, they're extremely intolerant of differing opinions. And I don't have to talk,

Speaker 4:          00:17:39       I mean I love this, let you take this day around my agent, but listen, I would gladly, I said this when I had your online last week, I will gladly give you the exact same speech that I gave to you guys

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       a couple of weeks ago. I would love to give that exact same speech to any progressive or Democrat and you guys are standing ovation, but I'm not going to get with my maggot hat wearing the students. Right? Yeah. And that's it. But you give that speech to the young Democrats, socialists of America conference coming up in a couple months, you'll get booze and you'll get weak. Shouldn't hear things. We disagree with, you know, Bolshevik, you know, forever. It's, these people have have translated into total authoritarianism. Do you see a moment where both of the movements sort of where you would argue the conservative sort of lost their place, thus lost the culture war or, and where the left Sorta went bananas? Yeah, I think the [inaudible] has gone bananas just by default of their positions. They really, inside of every leftist is a totalitarian waiting, you know, screaming to get out is a great quote I always use is because when you argue for total government power and total government control of health care in schools and private economic decisions, that can easily be translated into the monitoring side of personal capacity decisions, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:53       That that translation is quite simple. And I always say to a leftist that says, well, I believe in, you know, civil liberties, but I also believe in government run schools and health care. And as I say, if you don't trust the government to help you know, to monitor your own personal life, why on earth would you trust the government to run all these other institutions? Where I think conservatives have gotten it wrong over the last 30 years is where conservatives have become mislabeled and sometimes some concerns of believe this to want to do social engineering. I think I'm going to have angelical Christian, I'm a pro life conservative, but I also believe government should have barriers and trying to instill those values upon society. I think the best persuasion in the best capacity for good is done through churches and local community movements and individuals persuading individuals and writing books and doing podcasts, not through government doing massive social engineering programs.

Speaker 3:          00:19:40       So I think that's where conservatives have lost their way and that's where the left is currently trying to stake their claim. Is there anything that you think government does well? No. No. I think government is a necessary evil. I think it's necessary for providing for the national defense because that is something that whether we like it or not, you have to, you have to delegate some of our personal freedom to, you know, have a, some sort of a civil society. But government by its essence, if you read what Milton Friedman has said, they're incentivized to be inefficient. They're incentivized by definition to not be able to provide the best possible good or service for the individual. So look, the private sector does everything better. Whether it be the inefficiency of the post office or a Medicare is bankrupt. Social Security doesn't serve the people, you know, effectively everything government touches goes to crap.

Speaker 3:          00:20:29       And the private sector is by definition more efficient because if you don't do it well, you're not going to exist much longer. What do you think is the best way of getting that message across then? Government just doesn't do things well cause I think it's just so built into people partly because our education is term screwed up or whatever, that they just feel the government should just do things. So I saw Bernie tweeted the other day, this video of all these millionaires saying, I responded and so I retweeted it, which got like 20,000 but we read tweets because it was like, it's all these millionaires saying we should be taxed more. We should be taxed more. Well, what's a lectural hippocrates such lies. It's like, well, Hey, what's stopping you from paying more money to the irs? Numb scores, right? But it's like, but okay, so, but yet Bernie's tweet get something like 50,000 retweets.

Speaker 3:          00:21:16       And not that it's all about retweets and all that, but it's true. He has high engagement with this. But to me it's just lazy thinking. It's that is lazy. So virtuous. If it's so virtuous to keep giving money to the guts. Right. Why do you need the government to tell you to do it? And really at its core, if you look at the philosophical difference between really the culturally Marxists left, which is what they're becoming and the free thinking, individualistic, you know, individual Libertarian, conservative, right? Which is the new intellectual position that is growing, you know, quicker than even the left. It's, we might want good things to happen in society, but don't tell me to do them at gunpoint and the left on the other hand, I don't think their intentions are very good. I think they want permanent political power. But Bernie Sanders for example, he is so convicted that he is right.

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       He wants to use the absolute authority on and unlimited power of the state to put a gun to your head and say you have to have a 70% tax rate because someone is starving on the street. I would rather live in a society that has the same tax rate for everyone, 10% and we dig deep. We say, are we going to take care of that person on the street through charity, through private philanthropy and through being better people. And if you look at when socialism's implemented, you see the moral disintegration of society. You look at Spain, you look at France, you look at Europe, they don't have anything as private philanthropy anymore. Private charity has disappeared and Europe because government takes care of it and that, I think that is such an important point to make. So, going back to your question, how do you illustrate this to a young person?

Speaker 3:          00:22:42       You ask the fundamental question, do you trust the government? That word trust is so important because then in that word trust, that really feels personal, right? Do you trust the government? 99% of young people will say no. Then you ask the next question, then why do you want to make government bigger as soon? And then they'll say, I don't. Well then you're not a social, so you're not a leftist. Then let's talk about how we can really shrink the size of government and put power back into the the hands of people. And it's important to note also, even though you think government white want might want to do something, it doesn't mean federal government has to do it. Local government is much more accountable to the citizens than some bureaucrat in d c that you're never going to meet. And so those are, those are arguments that, you know, we found to be very effective.

Speaker 3:          00:23:25       Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned intentions and I always try my best not to impune intentions of others. I think that, especially on the left right now, obviously I think these people have a lot of bad ideas now. Of course, some of them have bad intentions, but most of them don't. Most average people don't wake up thinking I'm going to do bad today. They actually think they're doing good. They most of them. Yeah. Do you think some of their leaders actually have bad intentions? Without a doubt, yes, absolutely. And not all of them, but some of them. And you look back to the original writings and the original thought process behind the great society and Lyndon Baines Johnson who bragged on multiple times that the implementation of the great society and all the social programs around it, we'll keep African Americans dependent and keep them voting for generations documented in the presidential record.

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       Lyndon Baines Johnson said that. And so I think the Democratic Party is full of people with great intentions, but its leaders have realized and calculated. But if they can keep the government programs continuing for just long enough, not getting people out of poverty but keep people survive and within poverty they will have a permanent political base. So if you ask the question, if African Americans actually rose out of poverty and saw their wages get higher and their schools get better and their communities, you know, flourish, are they going to keep voting for government welfare programs that are the basis of the Democratic Party? Absolutely not. They're not. They're going to break out of that. So I think the intentions of the Democratic Party, the followers, I'm never ever going to impugn them. I'm not going to call them deplorables or anything like they call us. I think most of the followers of Democratic Party actually really good people, but the leaders, we must question their motives because if you look at the failures of the welfare system in this country, it is undoubtable that they're protecting a system that benefits them politically.

Speaker 4:          00:25:01       Is this also a partly why the media is going so hysterical right now? Like have you noticed just in the last couple of weeks we've shifted a little bit out of Russia hysteria, but now it's about trump's mental capacity and they, and it's like you can see how they coordinate it. I mean, you really, if you just look, you can see you,

Speaker 3:          00:25:17       they got, they got like a group text message chain going, I'm telling you, they got like John King, Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon, Rachel maddow. I think they're all just group texting. I'm not kidding. I want to have that fear down, that conspiracy theory. Can you give me, when you, when you start to have all three television stations open of CBS this morning and CNN, you know, with Cuomo and MSNBC, morning Joe, and they're talking about the exact same thing. Literally the segments are literally produced the same. I don't think that's a conspiracy. There's gotta be some sort of talking points memo they send out early in the morning, but does that actually you were talking points memo or just general group thing? No, I think it's general group thing, but I also, I think they understand that they have to be coordinated to be effective, which there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       Effectively we conserve it as do the same thing without even realizing it. You listened to rush Limbaugh, you listened to Dennis prager and you listen to Sean Hannity. The talking points are usually quite similar because you know, you watch Fox and friends in the morning. That kind of sets the agenda and I'm not, I'm not attacking the Democrats for being that, but if you look at why the media is going so far off the rails, it's they will never accept the fact that this presidency is actually large. In part a wonderful success is that the president is fulfilling his campaign promises. We're seeing unprecedented economic prosperity and you're seeing people's lives actually get better, and so they have to go down to this tabloid journalism and report on this fake book. They have to continue down this Russia hysteria because if this president succeeds, which he is, and he will, what else do they have?

Speaker 3:          00:26:41       They have gone so far in that this guy is a psychopathic nutjob. They will, they will lose all institutional credibility and political relevance. You know, it's funny, right when trump started the campaign, I kept saying that if you keep calling this Guy Hitler, you are painting yourself into a really bad quarter and it cheapens Hitler to think about that. Hitler's was one of the worst mass murderers in human history who killed 15 million people, and they have people once a week on those networks, equate him to the rise of the Third Reich. What does that do is it cheapens the evil of Hitler and isn't that one of the worst things you could possibly do when we're trying to educate the next generation, everyone's Hitler, no one's Hitler. Then maybe what Hitler did wasn't that bad. Maybe Hitler was democratically elected and had a supreme court that kept them in balance.

Speaker 3:          00:27:25       You see what I'm saying? That it cheapens the evil of the Nazi empire when they start to make these comparisons to Donald Trump and Hitler. It's really, and also the way this stuff just goes downstream. I mean, because then it's you start calling all your intellectual opponents Nazis. Then you say, it's okay to punch Nazis. Well, where does that end? Can we punch the knots and like life? Can we blow up their car? Exactly. I'm called a Nazi all the time and I mean it's one of the most intellectually just dangerous arguments to make when you and when everyone becomes a fascist, even though there is no evidence of that. What really has your political movement become? Yeah. Where'd the words freedom and liberty and the words that I now use a lot, how did they get so mucked up that they started feeling wrong? You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:28:12       Or the cultural relevance of things. Well, I think, I think it's starting with the misrepresentation of what freedom and liberty really is. I mean, the left tries to be the movement of freedom. A lot of young people that follow Bernie Sanders actually think they're on the side of freedom. They think that Bernie Sanders is fighting for political freedom and economic freedom and that he's going to fight for the little guy. When in reality, when his ideas are implemented, which he's an open socialist, the power always gets concentrated at the top. The rulers are the ones that get rich. The people that have the best connections, the best lobbyists are the ones that benefit tremendously. You look no further than Venezuela or Cuba or anywhere we're socialism has tried. It's the poor people that voted these guys in the power that get that are worst off. And so we have to be able to make the argument.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       Freedom is not only a really cool thing. Freedom is not only a great idea, but it actually works like freedom when implemented actually makes people's lives better. You know, freedom would be a difficult argument if it was not only like really cool to make the argument like, yeah, you can do whatever you want to do when you want to do it, how you want to do it, that would be great. But we actually get to make the argument that in practicality, freedom is the greatest thing to make people's lives better for innovations, for medical advances, for technological, you know, prosperity. Nothing comes even close to allowing freedom to, to ensue. So what do you say when someone says, I, I hear this all the time. You know, well, if the government doesn't do these things, these social programs, or if the government takes away food stamps or whatever it is that just don't

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       know if the private sector or churches and synagogues, whatever else, we just don't know that that will pick up the slack. And then if that doesn't happen, we end up with this permanent class of under, uh, you know, economically underserved people that have no way

Speaker 3:          00:30:00       fundamentally disagree with that. And so this is where the world views, I think collide is where the left, they try to build this. I think a lot of it is trying for guilt, right? They actually want to help as many people as possible. They feel so bad that people are suffering. They want someone else to do it for them. So the first thing I do is I challenge them. How much money are you giving to charity? How much are you doing? Actually helped the homeless guy in the side corner. And then what if 10 million people did what you did? Secondly, never underestimate the good that Americans will do when people are in need. Hurricanes, natural disasters, famines fires. Americans always step up. Americans voluntarily gave $500 billion away to charity last year. Imagine if our tax rate was 10%. Imagine if there was really a national rallying call to double our charitable efforts.

Speaker 3:          00:30:43       We can easily get away trillions of dollars. Wow. Trillions of dollars. That's the size of the welfare state. And I would make a compelling argument that local churches, charities, and municipalities do a heck of a lot better job of serving the people than the federal government bureaucrat a lot better. You know, sending money to Washington DC, is that actually going to help the poor, single mother and Miami or it's going to the local Catholic Church and getting $5,000 which might be a lot of money to you actually going to help them a lot more than sending that $5,000 a Washington DC. I will argue fiercely against someone who says that a government bureaucrat is going to help an underprivileged individual better than a private charity or individuals helping individuals.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       So you said a couple nice things about trump. So I want to get into some of these, some of the specifics on that please. But, so one of the things that I've said is that trump basically was the bull in the China shop and he just went in and just up and did everything. And I actually think that right now that's a net good because there were a lot of bad things happening before and there's some fertile ground for good idea. So on that level, um, for what's happening, when I had Eric Weinstein sitting in that chair, he said that he would have preferred it to be a panther and a China shop, meaning it would have just knocked over a few things, maybe not the old. Sure. I don't think that that exists. That's, that was the point of our disagreement. I just think it just doesn't exist where you get to selectively choose which things are going to be knocked off the shelves and all that.

Speaker 4:          00:32:03       Seb Gorka was speaking at the turning point event. Yeah. He's here. He really Gutfeld is doing this whole thing about how he sounds like somebody was doing it on status can stop. But, but Corco was saying how trump was the, I think he said the icebreaker going sure. The glacier basically. And what I noticed though is there was a theme with the speakers. Were everyone basically acknowledged that there are issues with trump. I don't think anyone went up there and said this guy is the perfect thing or you know, this is exactly how we wanted it. But there was a sense of this was the only way it could have happened. Is that where you would,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       so I'm one of the few, you know, outward and vocal millennial trump supporters out there. Not few I should say. And kind of this word world, the conservative punditry if you will. Everyone tries to hedge, right? And there's some good and some bad and I've obviously gone all in and I'm, I'm glad I have and I'm happy to walk through, you know, the philosophical, you know, reasoning for that. So look like Donald Trump was never supposed to be present. United States, me just look going back a little bit, running in a crowded field of republican candidates and announcing the day after Jeb Bush announced his candidacy, which I think was no coincidence, and I think he saw Jeb Bush announced like, screw it if that guy's running. Government took down the Bush, dynasty that out $110 million to spend and then took down the Clinton dynasty, took down the media dynasty in a way that's totally unprecedented and if you look at the values that he represents, in my personal opinion, he is one of the best chances Western civilization has to continue.

Speaker 3:          00:33:32       He believes America's the greatest country in the history of the world. He's been a fierce critic of socialism, has visit this. Poland was a 40 minute critique of the fall of the USSR. He believes that the constitution is the greatest political document ever written. Look no further than his appointment of Gorsuch and the circuit court judges, but more than any of that, he believes that America as an idea, it must be preserved, protected, and advanced. And is he an imperfect vessel? Of course, we're all imperfect vessels. Does he tweet things that I might not always agree with? Yeah, sure. But, but the idea is that he's implementing, I would make a compelling argument. He's the most conservative president in a hundred years, even more so than Ronald Reagan. He is doing more bold reforms and he's fighting to do what he said he was going to do even in the face of unprecedented opposition, whether it be the embassy moving to Jerusalem, opening up our natural resources, getting out of TPP, getting out of the Paris climate court agreement. This is stuff that is not supposed to happen. Right. Do you think Jeb Bush would be doing this then and give me a break? No. Wait,

Speaker 4:          00:34:30       so basically, do you think he was the last chance for conservatives say that? But I kind of think that's a compelling argument that know that if you look, when mccain ran or Romney ran, Romney was against women with his binders of women. They said, you know, mccain was racist, blah, blah, blah. That to me, the most compelling argument is that none of these guys, you think Marco Rubio wouldn't be a brow beat. Hillary or Jeb would have somehow beat Hillary. So that putting aside some of my reservations for a moment, this was the only way that any of these ideas we're going to get. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:35:01       that's correct. So we play out the alternative scenario. Hillary Clinton is president and she has control of the Senate and control the house, and she's just advancing this radically destructive Obama agenda. Instead, Donald Trump, for any of the disagreements people might have around him, the results really speak for themselves and the economic prosperity that we're seeing right now that you can the $6 trillion of new wealth created in this country. But even more than that, I'm telling you, there was a referendum on the ballot and I was there and Wisconsin. I was there in Michigan. I was there in Pennsylvania with Donald Trump jr for weeks on end. The people that showed up to vote that vote in 30 years, you know what they were really voting for? They were voting that America is the greatest country in the history of the world. And here's finally someone who is going to fiercely defend it against the permanent political class.

Speaker 3:          00:35:44       That's important because who else to represent that permanent political class than Hillary Clinton? She was the worst person the Democrats could have put up in a change election. Here's someone who's husband was impeached, who constantly cheated on her. She's the most uncharismatic possible person to put up and here's a guy who, you know what? He's going to blow it up. Great. That's who I'm gonna vote for. And you look a lot of what he's doing. He's sure he has shrunk the size of a lot of these federal bureaucracies and he's fighting a lot of these entrenched media and political establishments that honestly, I never thought we would see such a champion against, which brings me great satisfaction. What do you think about the intellectual side of trump? Like I get what you're saying that the broad ideas of freedom to in America and liberty and those things, and I basically agree that that's, he does understand those things.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       In terms of just like the intellectual or philosophical side, do you think he really has an understanding of the issues or do you think that may be isn't even important? I don't think it's that important. I've spent considerable time with him and his family and I can say this, his, his understanding of why America's the greatest country in the history of the world, why free enterprise matters and actually how to benefit country as a whole is, is just as good, if not better than some of these politicians and might be able to recite all these intellectual and philosophical quotes because this is a president. But you know what? He's been through bankruptcy trials, he's been through hiring and firing hundreds of people and you know, you running a business and me running a business that, that develops character in someone. You just got to say making payroll, dealing with regulators minus versus some of these senators that have been, you know, orders and thinkers their whole life.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       Give me a break. Right? Yeah. So I have a deep amount of respect. It doesn't bother me that, you know, CNN says, oh, we talks at a fourth grade level. Give me a break. You know, seriously, he talks the way that the guy in northeast Iowa has been waiting for someone to talk to in awhile. So I completely dismissed that as an argument. And I look at what he's accomplished as a person, which is totally amazing and what he's fighting for every single day. And he gets the big stuff correct. He really does. And I, and I challenged them on my, you know, critics on the right who else in that field of 17 Republican candidates would have nominated gorsuch to the supreme court move the embassy advocated for the greatest, you know, middle class tax cut and American history, not back down on some of these core issues.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       It's really, if I would have said, here's Xyz candidate, let's just pretend this is, you know, in the Republican primary and in the first 11 months we'd get this done. Most conservative pundits would say, we're at, where do I sign? You know, seriously, you know, and he's, he has, he has advanced more conservative pro freedom, libertarian ideas then any of these candidates, what most of these candidates would. So then what do you make of the conservative class that hates him? So I'm talking about like the David from crew, that that whole French, the rest of these guys that really just hate him. Even though I agree he has put forth a lot of the, I'm sure they've been yammering about for the last 20 years. I mean, look, I, I, I have a lot of respect for those publications of their history. I'm just, I'm challenged to, I, I'm really wondering is it a personal vendetta they have against this guy?

Speaker 3:          00:38:42       Is it a personality disagreement? Because policywise and implementation of the people he's put in place to make decisions, the cabinet positions, I mean this is a much more conservative president of the George W. Bush and remarkably more effective than hw and already in 12 months, much more consequential than Ronald Reagan. And, and so I, I'm, I'm wondering, I w w the ball's in their court, right, because to be so hypercritical just automatically against someone who is fighting for your ideas every single day. I, I'm just, I'm, I'm really wondering why is it, is it a personality, this agreement or is it kind of just, I don't want to be wrong type of thing. Like I'm cheering for his demise cause I'm a po up opposed him for so long. I think it's also, I just want to be liked by mainstream, which, which is the other thing, right? Like I, I've now created a whole new form of enemies I never thought possible, which is like these rabbit welcome to my world, you know, seriously, like these rabid media leads that are like, oh, he's close to the trump people. We must try to destroy him. I'm like, all right, fine. Whatever. You know, and the hatred for this man is, is uncalled for.

Speaker 4:          00:39:41       Is there anything that he's doing that you're not happy with? So I'll give you, I'll give you this. That's a great question. I'll give you something that just in the last, and I think you know what you're gonna say and I'll probably agree with. Okay. So in the last 10 days, so he basically instructed Jeff sessions we're going to agree on, okay. So to me, states' rights, if you care about that constitution that you said he loves so much and all of those things, the states should be able to make laws that they want and the federal government should not impede on that story. We have something called the 10th amendment, et Cetera, et cetera. So in a case like this, what's happening there? How is there such a disconnect between the ideas of freedom that you laid out so eloquently and then what sessions is doing in practice?

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       I, I can't, I can't explain it well and I won't defend it because I don't agree with it. Look, I'm a big defender of individual freedom and liberty and I get a lot of hate from my social skin are conservative friends. When I argued for decriminalization of drugs, I've never done drugs in my life and I don't plan to, but someone wants to do it. Cool, right? Whatever, you know, put whatever you want to put in your body, as long as it doesn't harm someone else. So this is something that I think actually not making the correct decision on, but you know what? I'm happy to say it. I've said it publicly and you know, if I, if I find someone like jeff sessions who's gets most of the stuff right, he's been great on guns. He's been great on some of the other stuff, but I don't think he's correct on this, this marijuana.

Speaker 3:          00:40:51       She, and I don't think he's correct politically. It's just the majority of Americans don't agree on this issue. And to go after people that are peacefully doing business, that's really what they're going after. This is the financial transaction side. I, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. That's not on the correct side of economic freedom. But you know what? Disagreement is a healthy thing, right? And we need to challenge our cabinet officials and challenge our leaders when we don't see eye to eye with them. And I think this is something that I think runs in the face of some of our core beliefs and tenants.

Speaker 4:          00:41:20       Yeah. It just seems like so ideologically inconsistent. I think it's fighting for states' rights. He's been fighting for states' rights in that look. Even now you've got people on the left fighting for states' rights. Ridiculous. It makes no sense. Now they're, they're trying to defend sanctuary cities. So now their phones work doesn't change, right? It's going against the federal government. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       But, um, I will say this, I think a lot of it is stemmed from this kind of old holdover war on drugs that Ronald Reagan declared in the 1980s which was an abysmal and total failure. Right? The statistics speak for themselves that, you know, the war on recreational marijuana has not been a net benefit for the taxpayer, for such society in general. Again, I come from the general worldview at the greatest change does not come through government policy or through gum and bureaucrats and sort of be intellectually consistent. I want the fend penalizing people that are peacefully selling, you know, cannabis to other people, whether it be for medically or recreationally and, but here's the thing, I want it to high school in northwest suburbs of Chicago. This is the story I always tell people, say, Charlie, your concern, but how can you possibly hold his position?

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       You know that it's always at these tea party groups, which I love. I love the tea party. I love these people, right? But they're there. My, you know, I called them like the hardcore group, right? Like they're the Alex Jones, you know, flag carry and people that are really hardcore, they're really big in the conspiracy and you know, there's, they're always asked me, Charlie, how can you possibly be on the side of decriminalization of marijuana? I said, listen, I went to high school in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Okay. I remember after football games, like kids had backpacks full of marijuana. Now marijuana is illegal in Illinois. Marijuana is illegal in Cook County. And there were cops in our halls looking for it all the time. It was not working. Okay, let's just put it that way. The kids who wanted it found it. The kids like me who didn't want you to do with it, just walked away. What, what other better illustration of freedom than that? You don't want to engage with it, just walk away, find somewhere else to do it. We didn't need to pay, you know, the dea or FBI units to go do locker room rates is something that kids were recreationally and peacefully doing. I'm not a proponent of it. I would support a charity to try to educate students not to do it cause I think at root, you know had a net negative, but why is it government's role to social engineer us, especially when it's a nonlethal substance.

Speaker 4:          00:43:24       I always think it's so interesting like look I now I'm in California where it's now now recreationally legal, but I have a medical marijuana card. Got To hurt my knee playing basketball a couple of years ago. The places right over there, I'd like to walk you in there just to see what's going on. Then before it like you're not going to persuade me to do it, but I think it's fine. Like whatever. I just think it would be fun to go in there with you. Yeah. That would be what was going on in the camp where my mango hat that would not go well in La. Um, but I think it's funny because anytime that I ever bought weed illegally, like when I lived in New York City and just get it from whoever the weed guy was, I don't even know who the weed guy when exactly, but I never once in 15 years or whatever, I never had the guy selling. We'd say, Hey, you want to buy crack? You want to buy coke you. And yet we can go to prescription play. You can go to a psychiatrist, push every button rug and it's a hundred times worse.

Speaker 3:          00:44:17       And it's an and it's chemically addictive. Yeah. Right. So look, I know plenty of people that have had stories to tell me, Charlie, if it wasn't for medicinal marijuana, I would have gone to narco substances and I would have been a really a worse place. Right. And so fine. But that's the core tenant of freedom. And I think what you're seeing here is most of our turning point followers would find sympathy with my argument. And this is okay, this is a natural change and a political movement as time goes on. But, and, and the, the fact that jeff sessions holds that position, maybe he has an experience that I haven't experienced, right. That is really personal to him. Maybe he's seen, you know, marijuana do something horrible to a family member or people in local community, Alabama. I'll disagree with that. Probably not right. But you just have like whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:44:58       I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt because I think he's generally a good person. I always tried to give the benefit of the doubt when people hold these positions. Um, I just think it's not the right policy, but you know what? In 20 years you're going to see the conservative libertarian majority similar to rand Paul advocate for this. And then we'll be able to point out the hypocrisy of the left. Say, okay, hold on a second. Like we're cool with people being able to sell it. They want to sell it long. It doesn't harm someone else. Why are you trying to tell me I can't frack this oil field and the Permian Basin? Right. Right. If you want to have like an intellect, if you want to be intellectually consistent, right? Yeah. All right. I want to do one other thing on the social stuff and then we'll move over to some I'm cool with.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       So I know, I know. I said, listen, I never had like I guess agreements that you immediately sat down. You're like anything, let's go. All right. Seriously challenged me here we are. So, well I don't think this one will be too much of a challenge, but I think it's an interesting shirt. It just shows how things have shifted. Um, so at the Republican convention, Peter Teal and openly gay man spoke before trump. He said, I'm a proud gay man, got a standing ovation. Then trump gets up there and talks about points, amount trow right points him and he said, it makes me very happy. It was the exact quote he said because he makes me very happy that they with the hand, but okay. But that, that the fact that there's been such a wholesale shift in that, that even right now, ted Cruz or the guys that you might consider a little more of the Christian conservatives, which I'm one I could be.

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       Right. Okay. So, so where you come from basically as far as I can tell, don't really see this as an issue anymore. Is that a fair, I think that's correct. And so let me dive deeper and also pose a hypothetical to some of the leftest watching this. Peter Teal openly gay man gets a standing ovation at the Republican National Convention and then pointed as the, uh, you know, pointed out by the candidate. Do you think that an evangelical pastor that was pro Israel that might be a Democrat would have even been allowed to speak at the Democratic national convention or giving a standing ovation? They booed God when he was doing that was when it was mentioned. Okay. They literally, what is the shift here? The shift is the Republican Party is beginning to realize, hey, we're the party of freedom. Like, it's cool if you want to do that. And I think it's, it's a real sea change because even if you see ran Paul big, getting to, you know, endorse more of those, you know, favorable drug policy positions on the side of freedom or gay marriage, you know, you're starting to see a sea change where it's becoming the sole searching the Republican Party as we don't under the last 30 years is what's the one thing that ties our party together.

Speaker 3:          00:47:24       Freedom, freedom, freedom. And I think that's why you're starting to see that. And the left, they can't what ties them together. Oppression. You know, like it's the oppression Olympics. It's like who suffers more, you know? And I think that's a really good thing. Segue to one final point is what I think is the position that needs to be articulated better is I have no problem if, you know, gay marriage, whatever, like I believe marriage one man, one woman, that's my own personal position, right? But I'm never going to tell government to have someone live a life. I think it's cool. You're married, I think it's great. And you should have all the same tax benefits adopt children. It's great. Right. But you feel the same way about you? Well, it's fine. It's like whatever, like, but that's, that's more of like a generational perspective. Here's where I think Republican conservatives need to really fight hard.

Speaker 3:          00:48:03       And I think you agree as the religious liberty stuff is, are you going to force a Christian Baker to make a cake for a gay couple that is not the same thing as being cool with gay marriage. And the left is trying to make a moral equivalency argument of the civil rights of the 1960s and someone would having to violate their religious conscience to make a cake for a gay couple because they want to and they want to have fascism where you can go into a private company and so you have to produce it product or service because we have a certain, you know, lifestyle that's dangerous and wrong. And I think that's where the fight needs to happen and that's where I think we can actually win conference over. Do you think also the technology is the answer to some of those problems where we'd kind of sucks that, you know, I did in my prager u video from last year, which was excellent.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       Thanks. I mean that was the line that really caught on because I don't want to force that Baker to do something just as if there was a, um, you could use any example here, but if there was a Jewish artists who had a website that they take commissions for paintings, I wouldn't want the government forcing them to paint neo Nazi paintings. I mean, it's exactly the same thing. Yeah. And would you want to force, you know, a Muslim, um, wedding hall to have to host, you know, um, someone that is a great critic of Islam, right? That would violate one of the tenants, one of the pillars of Islam, right? Yeah. But for whatever reason, the left is way overstepping their bounds. And the circuit court of California was like lost their freaking mind seriously. Where they don't realize the slippery slope that they're engaging in here where if you have a private business with their own private conscience, they should be allowed to accept and denied business as they see fit.

Speaker 3:          00:49:42       Especially if it's business that takes preplanning like such as a wedding cake or photography. The only argument they might make as if you're, you know, running a fast food restaurant, but you know what, if someone wants to be a racist or a bigot, they have that right. No one's going to go buy products from them anymore. Right? That's how you win arguments without having to use the government gun on people's heads. Which again, I think that's the argument that we have to make. But if look, if a gay couple wants to get married, that's cool. Like whatever. That's the law of the land. Move on to bigger battles like religious liberty and freedom. All right, let's shift a little bit to some religion. Okay. You are a Christian conservative. That's correct. Just that phrase triggers a certain amount of people. So first off, what, what is a Christian conservative?

Speaker 3:          00:50:26       Which always, which always stuns me. So I do a lot of campus too. Or I'll tell you a quick story. A lot of campus tours, and I go through my litany of what I call hard truths told by Charlie Kirk. And I'll say, you know, socialism is the greatest killer of humanity in the last 100 years. And I'll say free enterprise is the greatest economic system ever. And then I'll say three words and it drives them so crazy. I say God is real. And it's like they just start shaking. Then the left, they think they don't, they don't know how to handle it and half the place loves it. Half the place hates it. I don't know why that's so triggering. So I'm a Christian first and foremost. I believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. And he came down and we, you know, he died for all our sins and we have a good documentation of that and we could debate and discuss that, whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:51:06       But as a Christian, I'm, you know, I believe that, you know, we are called to try to advance the Kingdom of God and the Ministry of Jesus Christ as many people as possible and as peacefully as possible, obviously. Right? So that's how I try to live my own personal life and make my own personal decisions as a conservative, I'd say, let me go ahead. I don't see you proselytizing religion though in the public way. I, I've heard you speak before. Sure. And I've never heard you pushed that. So I say it every so often when, when asked, but I look at my speaking no different than sometimes doing a job, right? So a plumber, electrician, that is not going to tell every person he turns around the corner like, Hey, have you heard the name of Jesus Christ? You know what I mean? So you have to, you don't want to be two offsetting and off putting.

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       But I also try to, you know, through my, some of my platforms, you know, talk about my personal beliefs, no matter how triggering it might be to other people. And I'm like campus tours. I try to, you know, advance, but of course I could probably do a better job of it. But with that being said, um, I would consider myself more as a conservatorium, which I find to be a new breed of, you know, ideology, which you and I talked about. And some people have already been labeling themselves as such. And I find no contradiction between my Christian worldview and my political philosophy. In fact, I find, um, great amount of, you know, synchrony actually between what I find, what I believe theologically and what I believe spiritually and religiously, um, to also what I advocate for politically, which is essentially the nonaggression principle. And, you know, believing in productive people in free societies should be able to make your choices as you see fit as long as you're not harming someone else.

Speaker 3:          00:52:37       How did Christians and up as so much of the butt of what the left hates? Because you can open up every day another buzzfeed article mocking, isn't it? Right, Chris genomes and Mike and huff po and the, they all love me, but boy, oh yeah, they must, they must. The fact that I'm a, yeah, it's nuts. Um, but how did that happen? Well, so I think what happened is that Christian conservatives fell for a trap that they really should have rejected, which is we might hold these truths very near and dear to our heart, theologically and biblically and spiritually, religiously. But I think where the line was crossed is in the sixties and seventies and eighties where we tried to impose those beliefs through government policy where people then inherently have a rejection to it. Similarly, how people are the left and posing their crazy worldview upon us. Right? I think that was a big mistake because it created this kind of counter revolution, which is, I don't want to have to live the way some Christian and Alabama wants me to live.

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       Does that make sense? So like it's, it's the imposition of those values through legislation and government, which is something I don't necessarily support, right? So I try to always advocate for everyone in my political positions through a secular worldview because that is the vast majority of people. And that's the actual, the government system that we have. All you know, decided to create, we do have a separation of church and state and we should support that. With that being said, I can still have my own personal opinions and my own personal, you know, um, ways to go about changing public policy. But when we start to say we should support this law because it's the Christian thing to do, that is, I think beginning that has turned people off for the last 30 years. What does it say also about Christians that, you know, we talked about gay marriage before that there was a shift.

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       Sure. There actually has been a shift. Now you're basically arguing it's a political shift or utilitarian. Yes. You're just, you're sort of giving me just the realist argument. Yeah. But is there something else going on there too, where there is some, could be, I mean, the tolerance to tolerance in the truest sense. And here this is the other problem with Christians and me being a card carrying member of this community and I try my hardest and I fail is, and I'm around a lot of these Christians and I sometimes fall into it. It's this legalism, right, is that I'm somehow better than you because I'm a Christian. And I really think that's done such a disservice to the Christian community, especially the Christian conservative community. It's the sanctimonious approach to lifestyle that I find to be really off putting to a lot of non believers.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       And people say, well, I don't want to be a Christian because they're always going to talk down to me, or they're gonna make me live by this set of beliefs. So they think they're better than I am. It's a number one critique I get. It's not that, oh, I don't believe Jesus Christ is actually the son of God, or I don't believe the Bible. You know, those are actually things I think that can be ironed out. It's more so like I've always been talked down to or why when I was a young kid, I was in Catholic school and they gave me these 15 things I couldn't do. And because of that I rebelled and rejected. So I think this idea that actually Jesus Christ advocated for, which is, hey, I dined with the tax collectors. I was best friends with the prostitutes, right? Like I never thought that they were any better than the my disciples.

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       Right. And I, and of course I don't live this out the best I should, but we're Christians have gotten it wrong. Is this fierce fire and Brimstone legalist, thou shall all homosexual. You know, like that's wrong, man. That's not, that's not what the, the, the teachings and the evidence we have of Jesus Christ's life ever taught us. He was welcoming, he was tolerant, he was accepting, he had standards. He was fierce when it came to eternity in the standards of God. But he wasn't afraid to go chill with tax collectors, which were considered like the lowest form of individual possible in the Middle East during that time. And so I think we as Christians can learn a lot of that in modern society. And when we wrap this thing up, you want to go have lunch with some prostitutes. I mean, if they want to hear about the good news of Jesus Christ, even so, right? He's sometimes, some people are like, oh, you know, but the point being is we should, we as Christians have to do a better job of not being the sanctimonious moral conjectures, which we get labeled at summit and so much

Speaker 4:          00:56:39       so when you see a guy like Shapiro or a guy like prager prager's more than my heroes, prager basically a secular Jew at this point, but grew up Orthodox Shapiro, obviously observant, religious, there've been orthodox Jew, you guys basically, from what I can tell, agree on pretty much everything politically. You're obviously more trump than then. Shapiro isn't. I think it's pretty on any given day, prager definitely is more pro trump, but does, does any of your religious differences does, I know that doesn't matter to you in terms of policy, that's very obvious, but just in terms of like your humanity or the way your worldview, does any of that matter to you?

Speaker 3:          00:57:13       I've had wonderful discussions. It's Dennis prager about what he believes theologically and I mean, look, first of all, I think Dennis prager is like the Yoda of the conservative movement. He's like unbelievably brilliant. Isn't that? I know exactly. He, he's, he's fantastic. And same with Ben. I mean, I listen to their stuff every single day and prager university does a heroic job, but it doesn't bother me at all. But I'm, I always challenged. Right? So I challenge, um, you know, religious and observant Jews with some pretty good questions. I think because I'm very big into apologetics of the New Testament in the Christian, you know, the evidence for Christianity. I ask questions, I'll say, and then do you believe Paul existed in, do you think Paula Saaris existed? And they'll say, yes, I'll say it doesn't do anything. It's kind of like weird that a Roman Jew dropped his whole amazing lifestyle and like went all in for this Jesus Christ thing and then got persecuted, put in jail six times and then reverse crucified like with someone do that if they actually didn't believe this.

Speaker 3:          00:58:10       That's a provocative question obviously. Right? But I love that and I love that kind of, you know, um, discussion and look, Paul said very clearly in the New Testament, blessed the Jews. You know, these are your brothers. There is no new testament, the old testament. So we agree, you know, with the Jewish people and all that. And look, I think we need more Jews to actually become more observant and to understand the roots of the Torah and the roots of what God commanded through Moses and through David and the, the major and minor prophets. And I have such great respect for them because they've done a great job of I think awakening, um, people that there are, you know, Jewish conservatives out there and it's okay to believe these things.

Speaker 4:          00:58:47       Well, it's interesting because there's someone that doesn't come from this from a religious perspective. I agree with the wider principle that you're pushing here, which is that some of these minority communities. So in this case you're talking about Jews, but you referenced black people earlier, which I want to talk a little bit about capital working with candice. Um, but now I see it with the Asian community. I don't know if you just saw it in the last couple of days. There's this email that got leaked from Google where they basically were saying, we're going to hire people but not white men or Asian women will be treated like white women or something. Something to that effect. Like this lunacy horribly racist. It's the real race

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       and racism though. It's this kind of like, it's just there's this ranking of oppression. Olympics, like some of your skin color makes you somewhat more, you know, worthy of a position in the company or in a university because you've been through more. Just because you look different or the scary part, especially for the Asian community is that your skin color and the way you look is it makes you less worthy because you're going to work real hard and you're going to hack the right decisions. I mean, make no mistake. It's like an anti Asian American worldview that the left has now essentially embraced. It's like, Oh, they've been successful enough. Now we must discriminate against them so we can help the, it's like it's, it's, it's lunacy. But going back to your point of the Christian conservative kind of Worldview, I think that there's a lot, there's a lot of us that hold these beliefs very personal.

Speaker 3:          01:00:08       But also that's, that's kind of where we draw the line is, and you know, we have these personal beliefs and they're gonna dictate how we want to live individually. But how do we advocate for a society that allows the most amount of people to advocate for their own personal beliefs, whatever they might be, as long as it doesn't harm someone else. So your basic argument, and I think you hit on this a little bit earlier, would be that the part of the reason that Europe is crumbling, which is crumbling, the West is crumbling except for America. Yeah. I mean, we're, so we're taping this, it's going to go up next week, but we're taping this today is the three year anniversary of Charlie Hebdo was a couple of years ago, three years. But today was the day that they finally caught the guy, and then there was the shooting at the Kosher supermarket entire summers and all that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       Today a different supermarket was burned down. I mean, this is, this is still happening in Paris right now. Uh, and this is happening all across Europe. We know what's going on in Sweden. All this, your basic premise would be that if they had held on to some of their judeochristian values instead of trading them in, or what, what do you think is essentially statism right. But yet you're also a secularist, which is an interesting, I don't think it's not, I don't think it's contradictory because I would make an argument that actually the separation of church and State found in America has helped the church. We still have the highest churchgoing greats rates in the west. We still have the highest levels of private philanthropy have more churches opening than ever before. The evangelical community is growing in most states, as Alan Dershowitz would say, the separation church and state has been the best thing for the church.

Speaker 3:          01:01:31       Uh, because it's not imposed upon people. It's not mandatory. As you and I both agree, when as soon as you start to tell someone to do something, it becomes a lot less sexy and appealing. It actually want to rebel against it. You want to reject it. I would argue Europe through their social welfare programs have deteriorated the church be as soon as they start to say, government is going to take care of people, government is going to be the most important thing in your life. Government's gonna fix these vastly complex social problems. Then all of a sudden the church and the individual becomes far less significant. As Dennis prager says, the larger the government, the smaller the citizen, and you're seeing that play out in France and Spain and Portugal and Italy where you have individual philanthropy disappeared, where you have business startups, ness totally evaporate.

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       And the final point is what it really lends itself to is more dangerous ideologies to take forms such as radical Islam, which is I think one of the most dangerous widespread ideological movements happening in the West that no one is talking about. And here's what I said. I mean you're, you're, you're a gay guy. I mean, I would probably be worried if I start to see, you know, radical Islam start to take root in Europe. Right? You're a Christian. I'd be worried too. No, I mean trust me, I'm on that program. Okay. They want us both that and my friend. Right. I mean the, and that's something I find to be horribly inconsistent with the left as they try to be the champions of all these minority groups and all these supposed to depress groups yet here they are kind of joining forces with countries and movements and you know theocratic fascists in the Middle East that give homosexuals flying lessons on the top of buildings.

Speaker 3:          01:03:05       All right. So then how do we, I spent I think a good chunk, especially the first year of this show trying to talk about radical Islam, making a distinction between radical Islam and the nominal Muslim person who practices in faith privately. However they do just like most sure people, I try to separate Islam as a set of ideas worthy of criticism as Christianity is and you is and republicanism and all of that. Okay. Versus people versus criticizing people and treating people differently. I think a lot of people in our space have tried to do that. And you don't get a lot of credit for it, but okay, fine, I don't need bonus credit. But how, how do we talk about radical Islam in an honest way? And I do. There is a differentiation that needs to be drawn, but it also, we also do need to talk about the broader implementation of an oven, Islamic government and world view, right?

Speaker 3:          01:03:55       So Islam as its core at its core has always been and will always be tied into the state. And as soon as they can demonstrate that they can be a majority in a country and not be a theocratic government, then I'll start to seed some territory against that. So for example, Saudi Arabia, right? So if you are a Christian in Saudi Arabia, you lose your head. If you're a Jew, they'll find your family and kill all of you. That's, there's something wrong about that, right? So I think we need to draw a great critique of that same in Iran, which is Shia and Saudi. Um, which was Sunni. And there's something really I think, not correct about in modern society that you have obviously a Muslim majority country and you know, there is no Christians and no Jews and no churches and no synagogues. There's something very intolerant about that.

Speaker 3:          01:04:37       However, people that want to reform Islam, I'm your biggest advocates, right? People that want to go through reformation of Islam and try to differentiate that no, Islam does not have to be tied to the state. And yes, Islam can be tolerant of Christians and Jews and gays and the modern feminist movement and they should be allowed to vote and drive and you know, be able to make decisions that they see fit and not have to wear a full his job. I want those Muslims at succeed frightened that the more radical voices, which are in the tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, are actually getting more, more of an audience. They're there. They're creating, you know, sectors of Europe that are quite troubling, that are advocating for the advancement of these more dangerous ideologies that support honor killings and don't think women should have the right to drive or to vote or to be able to have representation, any sort of form of government.

Speaker 3:          01:05:28       And so I think a broader critique of Islam needs to be put forth because they've been doing it against Christianity for the last 100 years. I walk into a lecture hall and I hear about how incredibly intolerant Christians are and how they're terrible people find hard stop. You go to the Vatican, a woman is allowed to wear shorts and you know, a cutoff tee shirt. You go to Mecca and you're a Christian, you get your head cut off. I mean, you literally can't go. No, you literally not allowed there. They're literally not allowed. So there, there's, there's a discussion that needs to happen where a broader reformation is necessary, but the more radical voices of Islam are actually succeeding. Right now. You look at the most viral, um, members of the youtube community and the Sunni Saudi region, but they're the ones that are advocating for a holy war and the extermination of Christians. They're the ones that are really taking root. We have to support, we have to reinforce and we have to really encourage the more ref, the reformist Muslims to get a broader, you know, platform. But I'm just not seeing it. Yeah, I mean I've tried to do the little bit of it. You know, you've done a great job,

Speaker 4:          01:06:29       some reformers and some ex Muslims and things like that, but the problem is that they're constantly undercut by their own supposedly their own people. Yeah. I left every time is one of them talks about this. They say you're a sellout or you are sure evil or you know, whatever. It

Speaker 3:          01:06:42       does beg the question like that, that the, the center of their faith is the most intolerant city in the world. Like someone's got to take a broad stand against that and maybe we'll see it in the next hundred years, but how much had been some on, you know, the new crown prince of Saudi Arabia is trying to do some more, you know, modern changes. But you're also seeing extraordinary radical voices in Saudi Arabia continually rise up. You're seeing protests in a ran, which is great, but then you're seeing a lot of the western world not stand with these protests or see, president trump has done a great job of it. Obama who was totally silent. So look, Islam in general. Um, there's, there's wonderful Muslim friends that I have and productive members of the American community that embrace this idea that you can hold your beliefs without having to have them push through estate, which is great.

Speaker 3:          01:07:26       But you're also seeing the exact opposite with the, you know, the Muslim Brotherhood taking further root in Egypt and in Turkey, you're seeing, you know, Saudi Arabia want to continue its influence throughout the Arabian peninsula. It's gonna be a conflict of ideas and it's the largest religion, I believe in the world. Correct me if I'm wrong. 1.2 billion people Christianity's right up against. But I would argue that Islam has a lot more power in countries and Christianity does. It's a reformation that needs to happen. So is the demographic time bomb and in Europe, is it already too late? It's troubling. It's very troubling. So as a byproduct of supporting social welfare programs and the sixties and seventies that deteriorated, the influence of the Catholic Church and in protestantism throughout Europe, and really just kind of making people so apathetic towards private philanthropy, apathetic towards value creation, entrepreneurship rates disappeared. And you really created a lazy European society.

Speaker 3:          01:08:14       Hate to say it, but they are not highly productive people. They take the month of August off, they have very little ambition. They're okay being average. That's not the society I want to live in. America's always been aspirational. We've been the most productive. We've been the risk takers, we've been the, we've been the entrepreneurs. So because of that, they've laid themselves to be remarkably vulnerable to a takeover culturally and demographically. And you're starting to see that with the millions of relocations from the Middle East of people that don't hold these views that the Europeans hold. And honestly they come from a background, whether it be Syria or Jordan or Yemen or Oman, Yemen, there's a huge humanitarian crisis happening. They've known nothing but government being Islamic. And so they inherently support that. But if they want to go through a reformation and they can demonstrate, they can do that. Great.

Speaker 3:          01:08:56       I, I'm, I'm not seeing that though. I'm seeing vast demographic clashes happening all throughout Europe. There's also an interesting generational piece to this, which is that you find that a lot of the older people that came from those countries, you know, 30 years ago, they actually are more westernized in their total drain are now they're sort of making up that there was something imaginarily great about Saddam that's correct. Out where their parents and we need to, we need to reform the, you rebuild the califate and very dangerous. Right. And so you look at the reformation that Christianity right rightfully went through in the 1500 and 1,617 hundreds it's as soon as you embrace the idea of personal freedom and individual liberty and you try to restrict the state. So put your, put yourself in the, in the, in the seat of the founding fathers. They intentionally removed any sort of mention of Christian dumb in the constitution, which ended up being the best thing for Christianity, which created the most Christian nation in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       It does America think about how ironic that is, right? Whereas Europe didn't always do that. They actually created these theocratic governments that led way to, you know, horrible conflict and you know, ethno nationalism and eventually in the sixties and seventies like I mentioned, the huge proliferation of the welfare state, which was the worst decision Europe ever made. They turned a highly productive people into a mediocre, Lazy Society that rejected all sorts of religion and any sort of, you know, connection to higher being and has now led themselves to a demographic takeover that I think is the worst. Some people think it's for the better. I just don't see any evidence of that. But again, there's nothing, there's, I get, I get, I get criticized as being a racist and all this. I'm not talking about a set of ideas that when implemented through the state have proven to be extremely dangerous to human rights and economic productivity and private property rights and really cumin, you know, human dignity.

Speaker 3:          01:10:46       So when you've mentioned the phrase oppression Olympics a couple of times, which obviously I totally buy in on, which is from your video, I stole it from you by the, well, I think I stole it from Faisal site on guitars and he probably stole it from somebody. So that's how these ideas get around. But um, this idea of this, this intersectional nonsense, which is all nonsense, how do you, do you think that the average left person in America that says they're a feminist and therefore, what do you think that they don't recognize any of the stuff that just said about that? Obviously don't talk about it or they might, they might, they might recognize it. They might know about it. They might be able to answer it in a trivial pursuit game. But the question is here. So your, there's the international feminist society, which is growing huge on campus and I always challenge them.

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       They advocate for women's rights across the world and then they're like right next to like the Muslim student association, which is fine. They should be friends. That's okay. Like, but why are they not demonstrating wide said pr widespread protests against how women are treated in Saudi Arabia, but the international feminist society is protesting for against Israel. It's weird, right? It's like because intersectionality, it's like they have this weird construct that we must advocate against Israel because Israel is a friend of America and America hates women. It's like this weird, like I, I need like this big map. Like where they kind of try, it doesn't make any sense, but where is the outrage? They say there's outrage when I challenged them. Oh yeah. We're really outraged about it. Yeah. Okay, sure. But no, we're, we're, where's the, where's the, where's the Oprah Winfrey's, right? Where's the Hillary Clinton's who spoke multiple times and Saudi Arabia and took millions of dollars from them.

Speaker 3:          01:12:16       Right? We're women can't drive where women can, we now that can drive and that's going to be a real disaster, you know? No, it is because all of a sudden they're just wait for the moms to get your hands up. Hands up there. The women are, what do you mean? Oh, because they're going to have a total religious clash about this because Hamad had been some say it's said by decree that women can drive and there's going to be all these religious fundamentalists that are not gonna allow it to happen and it's going to be a total conflict. They were bragging that women are allowed to go to movies now like that to show you how medieval Saudi Arabia's, right. But anyway, Hillary Clinton made this like her pinnacle, you know, point of her campaign is like, I'm going to really have good relations with Saudi Arabia. Her Foundation took tens of millions of dollars.

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       Here was a woman that ran on the idea of like feminist representation. Right? And she can't critique Saudi Arabia once. Right. But she critiques Israel for the settlements. Right. So I think there's unbelievable hypocrisy there, but it's not just Saudi Arabia, which I'm focusing on. It's Egypt. It's a rant. It's Iraq, which is changing. It's Syria, it's Jordan, it's on mine. It's Yemen. The only countries that get it. Right. Or Katar. Right. And maybe the UAE. But you have, you have a geographic dis, you know, disposition of hundreds of millions of square miles where women cannot vote. Women cannot own property. Women cannot start businesses. Women cannot serve in government. Men have total and absolute control over society. Gays. They asked [inaudible] shot. They said, how do you, how do you treat? Don't have it. No. Yeah. How do you treat gays and your society? We do not have homosexuals in our country.

Speaker 3:          01:13:41       That's great. Where's the, where's the LGBT international society protesting against that, right? Yeah. It's like they have this kind of like handshake, like we're not going to mention this. It's all good that I can't stand anymore. And then what? What country did they hate the most? Of course it's Israel where they were days are open or openly productive members of society. I think they can marry in Israel. I'm not sure, but I, the West has been the best to women and to gays and yet they want to destroy the last, which doesn't make any sense to me. By the way, you mentioned settlements a minute ago. I think that Jesus guy you referenced before, I lived in a town called Bethlehem and where he was born in that lands in the West Bank. Yeah, exactly. Jesus of Nazareth. Minor details here, right? Yeah. History though. He's just lost on people, right?

Speaker 3:          01:14:25       Is that like, to me that's one of the most horrible things like that. People don't know basics about history and even it's, it's the basics, but it's just like the ignorance of understanding the, the blessings we have, the live in western civilization and how unique what we really have here as a country and it's being taught in our universities how America is a racist, xenophobic, imperialist, horrible country, and you really have to try. It takes effort to try to make that argument because America has been one of the greatest, if not one of the greatest ideas ever implemented in human history and civil society. It's had more respect for human rights. Instead more economic productivity. We have freed more people from serfdom and from bondage in any other country. We voluntarily sent our citizens and our civilians and our soldiers to die for the freedoms of others not asking for anything in return.

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       You look at the Korean War, we send, you know, our boys from Iowa, Kansas, South Carolina and Florida to go die in the Korean Peninsula, 50,000 of them so that South Korea can exist. We asked for nothing in return if we were in pure lists where the worst imperialist ever. Right? And so yet it takes the effort to really look at, look at history and say that we're a horrible place. And this is what the modern American left is trying to do is like, remember when I send the beginning of the video, we have a choice. We can either go the way of Europe and totally fundamentally transform this country and embrace a set of ideas we've never had. Or we can defend respect and advanced American ideas here and really try to make the 21st century the greatest who've ever had. Is there an inherent risk in some of that though that yes, there are things like South Korea, that workout.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       There's also, it's on foreign policy. I mean there's a lot of instances we've had, we tried the kinds of blunders, I mean I'll, rack war was a total mistake. It was a disaster. So they, so that's just the inherent risk in this space. I don't know. That was sanctioned by the way, by Congress and the Senate and sure the united, it wasn't, it wasn't actually an effect of war of authorization. It was a conflict. But so what I meant there is a broader point that throughout the 20th century America has stepped up and fought for the freedom and liberty of others I'd ever asking for something in return. I would argue that Iraq was a, was a horrible response to nine 11. It had nothing to do with the actual existential threats against the homeland. That was George W. Bush trying to rectify a mistake that his father didn't actually make, which was takeover, you know, Saddam Hussein's empire.

Speaker 3:          01:16:39       We got next to nothing. We lost 30,000 American troops. We spent $2 trillion we didn't have, and we helped create isis to boot. Um, so imposing American ideas worldwide is not something that I would have ever advocated for, but argue what, when, when the chips are down. For example, you know, in World War II and you know, the Nazi empire is on the March and they're 16 miles away from Moscow and you know, Winston Churchill is on his hands and knees begging FDR to send troops. Then we send, you know, half million ground troops to go through Normandy. We stepped up, right? And we help push back European fascism. So look, there's been a lot of mistakes. Some of our incursions in Central America were total disasters, but net positive America's, you know, um, decisions throughout the 20th century have helped, you know, advanced human freedom and, and release people from bondage.

Speaker 4:          01:17:27       So to that end, you must love what trump's dealing with the UN, right? Oh, it's fantastic. Are you kidding? Really is a freaking all stars.

Speaker 3:          01:17:33       Here's what I love about Nikki Haley to my left is people watching this. How can you not recognize she was everything you pretend to advocate for? No, no, seriously, because she's, she's a son, daughter of an immigrant. She's a minority and she's Indian like from actual India. Right. Which is one of their, I think oppression Olympics groups. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:17:50       Well, you saw this thing like a couple of weeks ago where they were trying to mock her for using the name Nikki, and it's like, that's what her parents call.

Speaker 3:          01:17:56       I know me. Imagine if a Republican said that there'd be March. She's totally self made. Her father literally owned convenience stores, started at as state senator ran as an insurgent for governor twice elected, eradicated the confederate flag from her State Capitol, balanced the budget, created South Carolina into this unbelievably prosperous state in a very complicated political state. By the way, by the way, they always said, you know, the south is so racist. Well, they help twice elected, you know, a woman, minority governor of a state that you call, you know, the new, you know, confederacy. Anyway, Tim Scott Guy. Exactly. Yeah. One of the only, there's only two African American senators and one of them's from what they call one of the most racist states in the country. That's beside the point. Yeah. Then she gets selected by president trump who supposedly hates women, but he has a represent us in the UN to go fiercely fight against all these globalists forces at the UN cuts aid to the Pakistan. She is what the left is supposed to love. Right. She is the, she is this absolute bodymind of modern day feminism. Yet they hate her.

Speaker 4:          01:18:55       Did you see this tweet the other day by the at Democrats? You know the official, Oh yeah, well all the check marks women have a qualified woman. But the bet, well that of course that's the, that's like the blanket response but the best was so it was like, you know, do minority women and Brown women, but the amount of people who just wrote it all right, you're endorsing Nikki Haley and it's like, man, you guys, this is what you idiots have created. Yep.

Speaker 3:          01:19:18       It's right there. They are. And I can't tell you, it's really interesting because so many of our turning point members and our turning points students, I say, why are you conservative? I'm a student. I'm not concerned because of the left. I left the left because the left, because they have lost their freaking mind. Like if they were just like normal democrats and didn't say the stupid stuff and an intersectionality politics and like they argued like, well we can run govern better, but free enterprise is a good thing but flawed and we need pr. We need to perfect it. And you know, if they actually had some humility for it instead of just like embracing cultural Marxism and doing the oppression Olympics, I think you might still be on the left instead they created the greatest gift. Thank you liberals for doing this leftist. Cause now we have like former Bernie Sanders supporters running our chapters because they are now cultural marxists that look at people at the color of their skin by how much value they have in the world or how great can understand someone's, you know, v, you know, degree of suffering, which is everything that Martin Luther King argued against, which is everything that is fundamentally created this country.

Speaker 3:          01:20:16       And so thank you. Left us for helping create this movement for us. Are there any good Democrats left? Oh sure. They're like, I have my issues with plenty of Republicans and I'd be more should of a rand Paul Republican and a libertarian on board join the, the, you know, I call it on the sif evil empire. You could join the resist the real results, the real resistance. I mean, look for the stuff that I like about Rand Abi at Rand Paul obviously has all the Libertarians of course, sadly in that collection of 18 people that were running against trump, he was seemingly on the wrong stage. It's just the party had nothing to do with that time, what he wanted. Even if, as you've said before, trump may be doing a lot of those, those things right now we show you how complex this whole very convenient. But um, the question I think you had was, um, but the new generation, like who do I need?

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       Good Democrats. Is there anyone now that you can, sure. I, I'm still looking for that kind of like blue dog Democrat to rise up and be like, you know, I'm a democrat. That is pro choice, which I disagree with whatever that is. You know, all these things. But I still think America's a great country and we need to like rid our con, our country of Antifa. Alan Dershowitz is probably the only one I could think of right now. Who was built the way he's getting kicked out of the Democrat party buddy abuse. He's taking them saying this every week since when has it been a bad thing to be Alan Dershowitz? I mean, the guy is freaking brilliant. You might disagree with him, but he's like the smartest lawyer and human rights attorney that you could possibly find. And now the Democrats have been like, he's our cues being paid by the trump camp parenting.

Speaker 3:          01:21:38       Like, are you kidding me? I mean, he's brilliant and they're kicking them out. I love that man. So yeah, there are some good Democrats out there, Charlie. I suspect we could do this for a couple of more hours, but I'm only going to ask you one. Okay. Because I want this on the record, on this show, because when it happens, uh, it should be that I asked at first, you're going to run for Senate. No, not for political office. I want to, I want to be a commentator and a movement driver. Does that have anything to do with the clown show that that running? Is that a guy like you who you obviously have a great understanding of the issues. You have a consistent line of thought whether I agree with you on every far too principled. No, but there's something to be said for that. Right? So I mean that goes to what coworker said about he's the broker, right?

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       But in all reality, I love what I got to do. Seriously. Like every day I get to create a movement and helps facilitate a moving out, create and say what I want to say and be able to have conversations with you on all this stuff. I've met very few Congress people or senators or governors that actually enjoy what they do seriously. And it's always about meeting with lobbyists or cow towing to leadership and fundraising. It just makes me sick to my stomach thinking about that. But let's pretend it was a great gig, which some of them seem to like it. I don't know why they liked the corruption or something I like. Is that really a place where I can do the most amount of good for my worldview? And I would say probably not. No. I'd say look, turning points, doing a great service for the country.

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       I think right now I love what I get to do. I have, you know, have some influence in helping shape this policy in this agenda. And that doesn't seem like fun to me. I do. It doesn't seem like that would maximize my amount of happiness. Yeah. All right, well it's on the record now. It's on the record. I still, I hope I don't talk like a politician to, uh, I think we're doing a gig together in New Hampshire. Yeah, that'd be fine. Not too long from now. So we'll, when we get in canvas will be there too. And Canada's Owens. Oh, real quick. Yeah, sure. Let's just finish talking to the candidate I backhand is for a moment. So when I, when I met you that day, I referenced that and literally a minute before you had, I saw it from a distance you, we can just talk for about two minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:23:42       And then she walked over to me and she's like, I just got a job with turning point. Charlie wants me to, you know, help talk to the black community and Blah, blah, blah. She's quickly becoming an all star in this space. I think she escaped some of the Youtube Madness, which I'm somewhat aware of and you may have seen my insane debate with her and Blair white and blah, blah blah, but she's quickly becoming a real powerhouse hodel voice because the black community has needed more p, you know the Thomas Souls that Larry Elders and David Webb's and who have Allen West, whoever else there, it's a different generation. She's coming at it from the firm at young place. It's kind of beautiful. She's unbelievably talented. I'm spent a considerable amount of time with her now minus the five minutes I hired her, but she's a passionate driven person. Look broader than that.

Speaker 3:          01:24:27       She like, like all of us on our team believe and understand there is a movement happening in this country and it's something the media will not report. It's something palpable when you experience it, you saw it in Florida. There's something happening in the story. Something crazy. Yeah, it's, it's almost squaws I spiritual political. It's, there's something happening because the left has tried for far too long to suppress the movement of ideas and it's free speech and dialog and discussion. But what candace believes, which I'm in full support of, and I want to help her in every way possible, is that the African American community has been totally, um, dis served, for lack of a better term by the modern Democratic Party and that they are disproportionately more poor. They're disproportionally in worse circumstances than people of every other ethnic or racial group. But why is that? It's not because Americans are more racist country then we were in the 1960s in fact, no one with a straight face could possibly say that yet African Americans are poor today than they were in the 1960s.

Speaker 3:          01:25:21       So what happened to use a Hillary Clinton term? America did not get more racist. America got significantly less racist. There's still racism in this country, but a lot of it has been eradicated if not reversed it. What happened is that we as Americans supported one of the most, you know, I would say contentious political and social programs, which was the great society where we deincentivize the black community from making good choices. We incentivized women to say single and have babies. We destroyed public sector education by reinforcing the public sector, teacher unions and disallowing school choice. I'm rewarding bad teachers and keeping communities perpetually poor. Um, we I think really did a disservice by um, starting this war on police in the last couple of years, which most police officers are there for the betterment of the communities that they police. And we have started this narrative that America somehow an inherently racist country and African Americans are poor because we're a racist country.

Speaker 3:          01:26:19       The data does not reflect that. It's because we have created a, a set of government policies and ideas that have not incentivized African Americans to continue, like make good choices that breakout of poverty. And as Ben Shapiro says, you make these three choices. You get married before you have kids, you graduate high school and you get a job. You can break out of poverty in this country and we, and you can look to all three of those things. We have government programs that either discouraged or deincentivize every one of those choices, especially for African American community and candace growing up from the poor family growing up as a, you know, African American woman in this culture and the society can talk about it a lot better than I can. I can only talk about it from an outsider. She's an insider, which in today's time unfortunately buys you a lot more institutional credibility, which it really shouldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:27:04       I mean that's the irony. It's, it's, it's sort of using identity politics against itself. Would you almost half, which you almost have to do it because if, for example, you always say this, if I say free enterprise is the greatest way to solve poverty, and candace says it, it doesn't make it any more or less are true just because she's a black woman. Right? Truth is truth. No matter who says it, but the left somehow has a value, you know, um, a lot higher of certain people saying it. But you know what, if identity politics is what we have to play, then so be it. And candace understands that, especially on college campuses. Black students will listen to her a lot more likely than they'll listen to me and I believe that she can continually build a movement around these core set of ideas and values and principles and she gets it.

Speaker 3:          01:27:41       Cause she used to be one of them. She used to be a leftist. She understands who these people are and she understands how to fight them and how to persuade. And we're lucky to have her as our director of urban engagement at turning point USA. I know you don't like drug references, but when I had her on I said, you know, for me it was like the red pill is like, I was like slowly drinking it like tea. She said she snorted it all the power to hurt you as long as done in the harm. Someone else do whatever you want to do with your life. I want it to end with you in a slightly awkward position. Here we go. One of your employees that, there we go. It's very good. You're doing great stuff. I'm thinking forward to, uh, getting out on the road with you and what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:28:17       I'm awesome at the end of that week because you were smiling. So I'm like, I literally, at one point, I could not smile anymore. I can't, we're, we're in our students. Just great. I mean, they were just, and by the way, speaking of standing ovations, I mean, candice got a massive, massive ovation. Should be about a cent. I mean, here's the thing, that's the diversity of ideas is we will give a standing ovation of people, even if we don't agree with what they have to say completely. Right. And that's, the left won't do that. It's like, get out of my room, get out of mice, get out of our, you know, lecture hall. And, uh, it's a movement around true tolerance and true discussion of ideas and we're going to win.
