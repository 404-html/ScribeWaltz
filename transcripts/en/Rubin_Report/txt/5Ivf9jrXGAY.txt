Speaker 1:          00:05          We're live on location at Stanford University and joining me today is an economist, author, scholar, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and living legend Dr Thomas Soul. Welcome to the Rubin report. Well, thank you. Good to be with you. I feel I have to get the gushing out first. That way we can focus on the book. I don't know that there is anyone on this mortal coil who's writing and thinking has influenced me more than you. So this, this is truly an honor for me and I just have to get that out right at the beginning. I just hope I have ms dot Lazar. We'll find out. I'll let you know at the end. Um, so first I thought I wanted to do a little bit on your history and I want to focus on your new book, but I was curious if you have a sense of the sort of renaissance that your writing is having right now with young people because when I tweeted out that we finally had you on the show and we've been trying to make this happen for quite some time.

Speaker 1:          00:55          I mean, thousands of responses and I had tons of people just say, please tell him this, tell him this. My awakening was because of Dr. how all of this are you noticing something happening right now because of the unique place where I only know what people tell me that's even true at Stanford. Uh, I only know what my, my research assistants told me. Alright, well I'll certainly accept that. Will take my word for it than a. So I want to talk a little bit about your history for a bit and then we'll, then we'll move on to your new book. A born North Carolina. Grew up in the bronx to Harlem in Harlem. Sorry, in Harlem. Uh, tell me a little bit about some of your formative years. Well, you know, I thought about is I was doing the research for the first chapter where I get into birth order thing now had my, uh, my parents, uh, loot a normal lifespan.

Speaker 1:          01:51          I would have been the sixth trial in the family. They died young. And so I was adopted in infancy, a family as an only child, raised as an only child in a home with four adults. And in terms of what I found in the other researcher on birth order, clearly that was a huge advantage, uh, until their misfortune was my good fortune. And Moreover, the family in which I was raised, moved to New York, which at that time had a far superior, uh, educational system for that in North Carolina and foster period of what it is today. Were you always interested in education? I mean, even as got to kill it, a little kid, there was nothing in my background that would put me there. Uh, but fortunately when in Harlem, there was a kid named ready that the members of the family had run into before I ever arrived from North Carolina.

Speaker 1:          02:47          And he was, he came from a highly educated family, uh, and they immediately saw the implications if they could get him to, uh, to, to sort of mentor me. And now I had, I had met Eddie on my own chances. I would never have seen any significance. He was one of the people I pass by, but of course the, the, the adults understood what the future was like and then thinking about things that kids don't think about despite the great worship of a child talkers these days. Uh, and so, so he, he took me to a public library and I had no idea what a public library was when I was eight years old and I saw all these books and I had no idea why we were there when I didn't have any money to buy one book. And so what am I going to do with all these hundreds of books out on the shelf?

Speaker 1:          03:39          And he very patiently walked me through the whole thing. And again, I was very reluctant to take out a library card because I didn't know what, what all this is about that. But he talked me into it and I, and I bought a couple of books and really had I not encountered him, the entire rest of the story could not have been the way it was. I mean, at some point I would have learned what a public library was, but by that point it would be too late. Yeah. I mean, when, when you start getting in the habit of reading when you're eight years old, uh, that's a different ballgame than if you had to wait till you're a teenager and it's too late now. Dare I ask if you have any recollection what you might've taken out of the library at eight years old?

Speaker 1:          04:22          Uh, one of the books was adopted. Do little books. Uh, I don't know if you even know what those are. He could talk to the animals, Alice in wonderland and uh, the rest of them. But, uh, I came in on May and there wasn't. School wasn't open until September, so I had no one to play with and I was just bored to tears. And so I started reading really for the first time and I got the habit of reading and on that, you know, that made the rest possible. Yeah. Were there any other formative things that happened to you over those, those younger years? Yes. The same fellow. It was a very knowledgeable about the school system, so when I finished elementary school and they assigned me to a junior high school in a very bad neighborhood and he told me that you, you can get transferred.

Speaker 1:          05:08          And I in fact got transferred to a much better school. I had, I gone to that other school. Uh, I again, the story would have been entirely different. Uh, and I, one of the, one of the themes or the early part of the book here is that there are a whole number of things you have to come together and if you don't have all of those prerequisites, then whatever good qualities you have don't matter. And I mentioned illiteracy that uh, you know, in the middle of the 20th century, something like 40 percent of the adults in the world was still illiterate. And so it doesn't matter what the native talent or any of that came along, you can't read there a whole lot of, uh, occupation. You just simply can't get into. So. And it's pretty clear from all the reading of yours that I've done, you put basic education basically is number one, right?

Speaker 1:          05:56          I mean, is that the one thing that you can do as a human being? Get educated, I guess, although I wouldn't carry it too far because some of the most disastrous notions in the world who come from highly educated people with, I'm sure high Iq. So perhaps critical thinking with a little education. I am, I will settle for almost any kind of. Yeah. It's so rare these days. It is oddly rare. So, uh, one of the things that I found out that was sort of amazing about your history, you briefly mentioned it right before we started, you were a Marxist at one time in your life. Most people will find this hard to believe, but it is true, but it's not that unusual. Uh, most of the leading conservative thinkers of our time, uh, did not start off as conservative. You've got a couple of like a Bill Buckley and George will, but I'm A. Milton Friedman was, it was, it was a liberal and a Keynesian.

Speaker 1:          06:53          A High Eq was a socialist. Ronald Reagan was so far left at one point the FBI was following him, you know, uh, so, uh, the, the, there's a huge movement from the left to the right as people get older. Yeah. I'm, I'm well aware, as I mentioned to you earlier, as a former progressive, I understand that, that movement in the modern sense. Do you remember sort of what you were thinking? What appealed to you at that time about artism? Yes. I mean, there was no alternative being discussed. Um, my first job was as a Western Union Messenger and uh, I would come home on some nights. I would take the fifth avenue bus which cost all of fifteen cents in those days, but I figured I splurge now and then and I would drive, it would go all the way up fifth avenue past always Lord and Taylor and all these fancy places, and then cross 57th street past Carnegie Hall and down Riverside Drive.

Speaker 1:          07:50          And that was sort of the Gold Coast area. And then yes, I came across this long viaduct and that turned into 135th street. Suddenly there were the tenements and I went into why is this? I mean, it's so, it's so, it's so different and nothing in the schools or most of the books, uh, seem to deal with that and walks, dealt with that. Uh, so it's, it's, it's like winning an election when there's only one person running. So then what was your wake up to? What was wrong with that line of thinking? A facts? Facts. We could probably end the interview right there. Specifically. My first professional job, I was a, a, a summer intern at the US Department of Labor and I realized from dealing with these people that the US Department of Labor, I'm one of my biggest concern was about minimum wages. It has been for a long time. And so my, my.

Speaker 1:          08:48          At first I thought, well this is good because all these people are poor and it'll get a little higher income and so that, that'll be helpful. And then, uh, as I studied economics, I began to see, well there's the downside. They may lose their jobs completely. So as that. And so I try and I, when I was at the Labor Department, I tried to talk about that to them and eventually I came up with some test of it and uh, uh, when I came up with this test, how we might test this, I was waiting to hear congratulations, you see that it had this and I can see these people were stunned as oldest idiot has stumbled on something that will ruin us all.

Speaker 1:          09:25          And I realized the US Department of Labor had its own agenda and interests. Uh, and that didn't necessarily not necessarily mean that the were the four people lost their jobs for minimum wage and it got higher pay was their highest priority. Yeah. How much longer did you last after that was? No, that was really the turning point. And then I began to see that all these government agencies were not, they have their own institutional incentives and you cannot say that the government will step in and do what's right for these people and whatnot because they'll do what's right for themselves. So I think a lot of people watching this and I know because I've been so open about my own sort of awakening, are going through this right now, they're realizing that the things that they've been taught for so long are not the truth and are not based.

Speaker 1:          10:11          In fact, when that happened to you and you started telling other people, not just the people you were working with, be it family or friends, what kind of pushback did you get because it was sort of radical ideas in a way that you were talking about that. Well, I actually, I didn't, I didn't feel any need to, uh, uh, do a lot, a lot, a lot of proselytizing. Uh, it was enough for me that, uh, that I was now beginning to understand things I hadn't understood before. And uh, you noted that in the book I have, I mentioned minimum wage studies and really they are incredibly flawed. There's a whole chapter on numbers, uh, uh, and, and the other thing, getting back to my personal development. I mean, I left home when I was 17. Uh, no high school diploma, no skills, no job experience.

Speaker 1:          10:59          And I discovered that there was not a huge amount of demand for people like that, uh, but in retrospect, decades later when I do research, I realized that in 1948, the unemployment rate for black 16 and 17 year olds was nine point four for whites, the same. Asia was 10 point two, and those numbers are much smaller than we were used to in recent decades. Uh, and there's no serious racial difference. In fact, the blocks in my age bracket we're doing just slightly better. Uh, and of course, one of the things that the minimum wage law does is that it creates unemployment, raised it to multiples of what it was. Nineteen 48 was, it was a special time because the minimum wage law was passed in 1938. And in the intervening 10 years there was huge inflation in the law, hadn't gotten. And so for all practical purposes, there was no minimum wage law.

Speaker 1:          11:57          But had we had these wonderful liberals, uh, insisting that I be paid a living wage. They were supportive. Family of four, I would have been unemployed. And I don't, I don't know what that would've looked right. It wouldn't probably would not have led up to everything else. So when you, when, when you think about these wonderful liberals as you just said, you know, I think there's sort of two lines of thinking. One is that, you know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I try not to a highway. It's a super highway. Exactly. I try not to besmirch their intentions, but then I think there are people that are either can have confused thinking or have ulterior motives or what else? What do you think it is as someone that is so based, in fact, and we're going to get to a plenty of that fact in a moment.

Speaker 1:          12:39          What do you think the thinking is the flaw in that thinking? Oh, I think it's the idea that you don't have to check a good sounding idea against what actually happens. Uh, the whole 90 zero people to this day who thinks that the 19 sixties was just a great period and a, and I'll send them. Do you realize how many good trends there, the, the murder rate among black males had gone down, it had been going down for two decades, you know, by 18 percent in one decade, 22 percent in the next decade, and in 1960 is suddenly it takes a uturn straight up and that was not peculiar to blocks or even to the United States. A pinker's book about, about, uh, violence that, you know, that throughout what the Western world, the homicide rates did a uturn in the 19 sixties. So the question is what actually happens when you put your wonderful ideas to work?

Speaker 1:          13:40          Do they produce the kind of thing you thought they were going to produce or the produce all the opposite and many errors and they produce lots of opposites. Yeah. I'm glad you mentioned Steven pinker. I had him on the show a few weeks ago and I think he's, you know, he's one of the clearest thinkers we have and you know, his new book enlightened me now is that things are trending more positively, but even hearing that is, is very hard for a lot of people. Well, it depends on what your baseline is, a pancreas much more optimistic than I am. Uh, I, uh, I happen to be very pessimistic about the future, but I hope the optimists are right. Do you think you're a pessimist by nature? No, but I think having studied with so many things that sounded so good and ended up so bad, uh, it makes me a doubt, especially when there are people who are anxious to spout off with very little study of what, of what they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          14:35          Yeah. We've got a lot of that these days. Do you think that has ramped up or. Yeah, I think social media seems to amplify things, but do you think it's always been that way about just sort of this endless pontificating of people that really don't know what they're talking about? Well, there's always been that as long as there have been human beings, but the question is magnitude of it and the ability of various institutions to shut out on any other viewpoint of which the universities are the worst examples. Yeah. That, uh, I mean, when I, when I, when I see the riots with Charles Murray shows up and I have a notion I was blurry. I mean, if you can demonize wherever you can demonize anybody. Yeah. I mean, and uh, and I, I listened to see what are they going to quote that he said, I've never heard a single quote of all the books the man is written.

Speaker 1:          15:19          They, they never caught anything he said. And a lot of what he said is the direct opposite of what they claim. He said that tells you a little bit about state we're in right now. So, so this, this thing that's happening on college campuses right now that everyone seems to think it's freezing free speech and, and it seems to be speeches, speech that's generally thought of as, right? So it's conservatives, Libertarians, further people on the right than that. You're saying that's really not a new phenomenon, you, you were kind of. Well, it was not that bad in the 19 fifties when I was a Marxist. And when Senator Joe McCarthy was Kara was tracking down anybody on the left. But uh, I said whatever I felt like where I arrived, felt like it and I got no such blow back. That's really interesting. So McCarthy's talking about all this stuff, but you had no problem being an open in Washington.

Speaker 1:          16:10          I was in Cambridge, so be it. Yeah. So you do think of something has gotten worse now? Oh No, there was a number of things. Venereal diseases, for example, we're going down a very steep worried it was either syphilis or gonorrhea that was one half or as prevalent in 1960 as it was in 1950. That brilliant idea was to bring in sex education, you see, to avoid unwanted pregnancies and so on. And a venereal diseases skyrocketed. Unwanted pregnancies, teenage pregnancy skyrocketed. It's amazing that so many people on the left are able to just ignore any facts that go against their theory. Yeah, it just does not. Uh, my uh, my old mentor at the University of Chicago, a joy stigler argued however, that economists have early influence and what they, what they say makes very little difference. And he was giving a talk at the hoover institution wants.

Speaker 1:          17:08          He said, thanks to years of dedicated work by Tom, so, uh, the next minimum wage increase will be five cents an hour less than it would have been otherwise. Well, that's what's interesting to me is because, as I, as I prefaced this with you, I think that the writings that you've done all these years and these books, they're becoming culturally relevant maybe in a way that they weren't, I don't even want to say it this way, but maybe in a way that they didn't, weren't economically relevant. Why do you understand the point there that I think there's a cultural relevance to all the things that you've done for these last 40 some odd years that seems so actually powerful and impactful to me right now, which is incredible when it comes to the impact that that's a different story entirely. I mean, long ago I stopped accepting invitations to testify before a congressional committees.

Speaker 1:          17:59          It's an absolute waste of time. They have made up their minds and they just want to be able to say they've heard all points of view and then it pretty much stops there. That's right. And I, I remember once or Kenneth Clark was, I was debating him and he was beside himself because of the mindset, supposed sinister influence in Washington during the Reagan administration. I told him if my, if my influence in Washington is all you have to worry about, very fortunate, bad because I've had, I can't think of anything that happened any different than if I had never said anything to anybody that you're being very humble sir. No, I'm realistic. I mean, I, I can't, I can't find it. I can remember testifying before one committee and uh, the audience was so rowdy that the chairman had to bang the gavel to keep them shut.

Speaker 1:          18:51          The shut them down and they put some little tiny thing in the law. They were building a. and I would bet their rent money that, that provision is gone now because there was so many people who did, who didn't, why? I was saying that if you're going to help up for kids, then give the money to the kids. You know it. For where, where were they go. Don't turn it over to the institution because they will then use it in an entirely different way. Are there any examples where the money is turned over to the institution? Whatever the institution might be, where it really does work? Are there any aberrations? There must. There must be somewhere by the law of averages, but a is not prevalent. Yeah, so a couple of times you've mentioned liberals and one of the things that I talk about on my show offing because I wa, I was a progressive.

Speaker 1:          19:37          I was, I was a lefty. I now call myself a classical liberal and I've tried to make the point that being a liberal in the traditional sense has very little, if anything to do with the left anymore. Yes. Are there any, do you see any sort of meaningful distinction between classical liberal and Libertarian at this point or, or DC even? I'll ask you a couple things at once and you can go any direction. Um, do you see any, are there, do you see a difference? Of course between liberals and the left. I mean the words have all sort of afraid. When I used to always say that he was, he was a liberal Senator Hyatt, and of course in different countries, the word means different things in Australia. Uh, if you said you were a liberal that they would understand what you saying, but in a liberal and is Australia is different from a liberal in the United States.

Speaker 1:          20:24          So when you say liberal, you mean leftist basic. The American sense of the word. Yeah. Um, what do you think there's any sort of real distinction that needs to be made between classical liberal and libertarian that that's one of the things that people ask me all the time and I know you're not big on labels generally, but I did read something where you said that the closest thing that you could be labeled as his libertarian, is that still where you're at accept a course in foreign policy? We can talk about that too. And I mean, I guess also the Libertarians seem to have this atomistic view of the world, which I think is a completely unrealistic. Yeah. So it's a good because not only in my life, but in the lives of people around me, uh, the surroundings might make a huge difference. Uh, one of the things I get into a lot in the book is this, the disparities imply either either discrimination on the one hand or genetic differences on the other.

Speaker 1:          21:25          And disparities are the norm. I mean, I was just reading something the other day, you know, that, uh, Latin America has eight percent of the people in the world. They commit 38 percent of all the murders and in Latin America at 80 percent, no 30, 38 percent for that. But in Latin America, 80 percent of the murders occur on two percent of the streets. Wow. So, but you find that when you look, look up facts, that's what you find over and over again. Uh, and, and in all the discussions of a income differences, they acted that day. They never take into account. Age and age is huge. I mean, Japanese Americans have a median age of 50 Hispanic Americans has immediate age of 26. Now, when you see a Hispanic Americans greatly overrepresented among baseball stars and not a single Japanese American baseball star and the major leagues, I don't believe in the entire history.

Speaker 1:          22:24          Well, we had each hero on. No, no, no, no. That was. There are people of Japanese ancestry who've come baseball stars. All of them are from Japan. None of them are Japanese American. Okay. Fair enough. Right. He played, he was a star in Japan for that. That's right. Yeah. Uh, so, so, so how many 50 year old men are going to be baseball stars? Uh, and by the same token, how many 20, 26 year old men are going to be surgeons or ceos, uh, any other kind of job that requires long years of study or, and slash or long years of experience. And so even if they were the same, the two groups were the same in every other way. And if there was absolutely no distinction though, discrimination and whatnot, they still would be a huge difference in income simply because of age. And that really is what this book is about.

Speaker 1:          23:13          And you know, the book itself, it's about 160 pages, but what I loved, you know, how many pages of notes you have in there, do you have, do you know, off hand veins, 127 bay pages are texts and the rest of it as notes. So you had about 30 some odd pages and notes and I actually started going through the notes because I thought this is, this is exactly what we need now. We, you know, like when I was reading it, there were pages that I had to read more than once because you're obviously giving a lot of numbers and facts and you have to look at these things from different angles and we're not very good at that these days. Right. We're, we're sort of from one angle and then you start the screaming and I think that's what you're, you're really a master up here.

Speaker 1:          23:50          Yeah. Well thank you. I'm trying, I try to but we'll see. We'll see how it works out. We'll see. Um, do you make any meaningful distinction between sort of a classical liberal and a libertarian? Is that, is that just sort of a, that's a wholly peripheral as far as I'm concerned. I'm just trying to get a few simple facts that crosses a full time job. Yeah. All right. So now let's talk about some of the facts that you learned in the back. You talk about two types of discrimination. Uh, could you, could you lay those out in the world has almost opposite meetings. I mean the first meeting when they say you have someone has discriminating tastes, you mean he, he can tell what is a good wine from a bad wine, what is a good camera from a bedroom and so forth. And that's almost the exact opposite of the meeting and the law where you mean someone who judges someone by what group he comes from irrespective of the individual's actual personal qualities.

Speaker 1:          24:43          So those are two very different things. Uh, ideally you would like every person to be judged as an individual, but as a practical matter, that becomes impossible because the costs are prohibitive. Yeah. I use the example where if you're walking down the street at night and you see a shadowy figure in, in an alley up ahead, I mean, do you judge him as an individual or do you cross the street and go across on the other side because, uh, the cost of, of judging him as an individual can be very high including your life. So, uh, so we make that distinction, but then I say that I call that discrimination discrimination. One one is when you just have a, a, a very good understanding of what the facts are. And so if you judge these persons and individually I call that discrimination one a and then if you judge them by the group they belong to, that's not as good, but that's discrimination wouldn't be, but it's still based on some facts, uh, discrimination tool, which is one reason we have anti discrimination laws is that you don't worry about that at all.

Speaker 1:          25:45          And he's someone that you don't like for whatever reason. Uh, then you, uh, you know, you're biased against them. Yeah. Are you shocked when you look at what's going on right now? And see so much talk about race all the time. So much talk about all of the things that separate us, the very things that you've been arguing against based in fact for so many years that seemed in an odd way more. I don't think there's more racism now than ever or more of dividers, but there's more talk about it. Yes. And it's devastating. I mean a was in general a much easier to start than they ought to stop. I mean, when, when, when that a fellow in, in, uh, in Serbia shot the archduke, I mean, who knew that that was going to millions of people around the world, including people from the United States about to about 10,000 miles away and I called with and start shooting the great war and you can't get in.

Speaker 1:          26:41          You get an a and worried about the current trade war. You start a trade war. You may never be able to stop it. And then in the next decade, because there are too many people involved, too many cross currents of interests and so on. Well, what would you do about our school systems? Oh my goodness. I'll try, I'll try to be rational. Do try. They are so awful. Uh, the public has no idea what I'm reading a book about the schools and the woman who writing a Diane Ravitch is talking about how teachers have due process before they can be fired. Now know when you look into the facts of it right down here, and I think it was afternoon the, it cost a half a million dollars to fire one incompetent teacher, uh, you know, you, you, you don't have a big enough budget. You know, New York, he has something called the rubber room.

Speaker 1:          27:37          This is the teachers who is so incompetent that the principals don't want them in the classroom, you know, and they get paid full salary and they show up and they accrue a pension rights and so forth. And the last time I forget how many millions of dollars I spent a year in New York paying for teachers who don't teach and in fact don't do anything but show up at at the same time as if they were teaching and they read magazines or whatever. They feel like doing a. and this forest goes on a, at a time when they don't have enough money to provide the kids with a decent supply. So how do we scale back this? I mean, you can talk, we can talk about it through the lens of education, but in any mna area where the government has taken on a bigger role than it's supposed to do, I think one of the things you hear all the time is it's sort of too late.

Speaker 1:          28:26          I think a lot of people think it's too late to take back. No government power. No, you heaven's a during the Reagan administration. That was the only time I know of when the Federal Register grew. Smaller that where they compile all the laws that had been passed in a given time. So it can be done. It's not, it's not, it's not. Uh, it's not easy, but it can be done. Someone wants to. There was some issue with Reagan was discussing and someone said, you know it, it's complicated. He says, not complicated. It's just not easy to do. I mean, right now we, I, I, one of the big forces out here or talks about affordable housing and they're appointing a blue ribbon committee is to look into why there's no affordable housing and I think that that's, that's like appointing of Blue Ribbon Committee to, to, to, to explain why the ground is wet after, after a rain.

Speaker 1:          29:22          I mean it's very simple. If you prevent people from building housing and the population is growing, you're going to have a housing shortage and you won't have affordable housing. It's really, you know, economics one during the first, first two weeks. They're not very good at taking economics, widow and I don't think so. So when you're answering, be in almost every case to just scale back government scale back regulation, it depends on what they're doing there. There were some things, uh, the government is necessary to do. So what, what are those types of things that you done for security? First of all, having, having dependable laws up. Some people think that if you're a, a for free, that means you don't think the government should do anything. No, you get the free markets don't operate except within a framework of laws that's wholly different from having them operate with politicians jumping in unpredictable times to suddenly pass some new legislation.

Speaker 1:          30:17          Yeah. What can we do right now? I mean, so really this would be about just sort of electing more libertarian minded politicians then. I mean, is that really the only way we can change things, do you think? No, I think the main thing people have to know what the facts are themselves. Uh, if, if everyone knew what all the facts were, I think you'd have an Italian different set of set of people elected. I, I can't believe that either of the presidential candidates in 19 in 2016, uh, would, uh, would have been the candidates if you had an informed public. We're not very good at that. How much of this do you think is part of the media's fault? That's one of the things was the media are mostly uninformed. No, no. They're not uninformed or misinformed. Uh, and, and, and they simply do not shut.

Speaker 1:          31:02          Check the facts on the large issues of small. Yeah. What, what can we do to fix that, do you think? I mean, I suppose this, no, but I buy books like this as well, but I think more fundamentally the public that votes has to itself become informed and not be so easily stampeded by slogans in a few numbers thrown around. Like, you know, women make x percent of what men make and so on. Yeah. Uh, when I started studying that some years ago, for example, uh, I found out that a young, young female doctors made much less money than young male doctors not seem like a very odd. And so I. But when you're looking into it, you discover that young male doctors work an average of 500 hours a year or more than young female doctors and they get paid for the 500 hours. But, but there, there's no reason why the women and men should be doing the same thing.

Speaker 1:          32:01          Their circumstances are different. So are there any laws that are in place right now that you believe are discriminatory one way or another toward, towards any community or against any community? I would have to write a much larger book to cover them all the minimum wage laws, absolutely devastating, uh, the policy of saying that you cannot have more kids from one ethnic group disciplined in the school and from another is nonsense. I mean groups are different for each other and umpteen ways and then just have the presumption that they are the same except the way they're treated a is nonsense. It's never been true. And I don't know why we would think is true here today. So I do sense that some of what you just said there is bubbling up into the national conscience because I get a ton of email from black conservatives now.

Speaker 1:          32:53          People that feel that they haven't been represented fairly or that the, the, you know, the so called leaders of the black community that are on television all the time are actually preaching the complete reverse of everything that you've said here. Do you sense that there is some sort of growing conservative movement, black community? There was a time when, when, uh, that community with a consistent of million. Walter Williams, uh, I know all these to say we were the tuition of a fly on the same plane, otherwise a whole will disappear. Disappeared, goes down. Well, I mentioned to you before we started that Larry elder caused my awakening because I was a progressive and I said something to him about a systemic racism on air and he beat me senseless with facts and I had to go back and reassess what was wrong with my thinking. Well, you know, in one, in one of the, in one of the chapters, the, I have a little section about, uh, uh, the era of apartheid in South Africa.

Speaker 1:          33:53          And I had that in there because there's so much argument. How much racism is there, soap when I say let's test this hypothesis in a setting where there's absolutely no doubt is a, a Raga and that's apartheid in South Africa, uh, with the government where blacks were not allowed to vote, so forth. And you then apply the economic principles and you find that the economic principles apply in South Africa that, uh, there were some occupations. See, blacks weren't allowed by law to be in certain occupations, is more than a certain percentage and in some occupations couldn't be hired at all in some of those occupations where they couldn't be hired at all illegal to hire them at all. There were more blacks higher than the whites because there are economic factors that could come in and you don't just pass a law and not automatically produces the results you want.

Speaker 1:          34:40          Yeah. Can, can you go into some of the economic factors that you mentioned there? Because I thought it was sort of interesting about the types of jobs that I had and why that would affect. Well, it's no, it's the competitiveness of the industry and the competitive industry. A discrimination and then the, in the sense that we use for entity discrimination laws, uh, it costs the discriminator as well as the others. Now in so far as the price can be invaded by the discriminated, he will, he will describe, for example, minimum wage laws let, when you have a minimum wage law, you have more people applying for jobs in those categories than there are jobs available. Because the raising, the raising the wage rate cause more people to apply and employers to hire fewer because if more expensive and so you have a chronic surplus. Now if you've got a chronic surplus in an industry, it costs nothing to discriminate but it and but it.

Speaker 1:          35:34          But if you have a competitive market, then of course it does cost something that for every person that you discriminate against those qualified, you've got to hire somebody else and you got to raise that paved cap rate in order to get people in. So I show how how competitive industries have much less discrimination than say a regulated public utilities. I was wondering when I was reading it, if you were ever going to talk about how now technology is also changing this, so we see a lot of these movements for $15 minimum wage and I know why you don't think that's a great idea, but even now where we see Mcdonald's and some of these other places just replacing people with IBS and computers. This, this has been happening. I don't know, when I grew up in Harlem, when you went into a movie theater, this is a little neighborhood movies, theater in Harlem.

Speaker 1:          36:21          There would be a kid who would walk by down the aisle with you with a flashlight and show you to your seat. And so now, now that we have so many compassionate people who want people to be paid a living wage, you actually stumbled down this down the aisle to your seat the best way you can because they're not going to pay that kind of money. You know, the that's unrelated to productivity. What would you say to the people I hear a growing movement of people saying, well, this is why we need a universal basic income because technology is going to force for so many people out of the workplace. Oh, that has, that is that the island has been made for centuries and has been proven wrong for centuries. Uh, I would ask the question, what has happened? We've moved in that direction already.

Speaker 1:          37:10          We have lots of people who can live off the welfare state and not and not and not have to be productive. Uh, and how, how are they better people as a result of that? Uh, one of I saw some time back and have, haven't follow this, that a young pete, the suicide rates among young people were among the negative consequences of the 19 sixties, uh, people, uh, you, you, you've taken all meaning out of people's lives. And so they find all kinds of crazy things to do drugs, whatever. Uh, and again, it's not peculiar to the United States and you find this in Britain, other countries. Uh, and so again, people who say this almost never look at any facts about what's happened as we expanded the welfare state, that people behave better. No, you know, I mean, when, when one of the, one of the things that one was that I remember very well when I was, I was back in the school in Harlem for some reason maybe doing research and I looked out the window and I said, said, you know, when I was a teenager, I used to walk a dog, my dog in that park.

Speaker 1:          38:18          And look, it look so hard. I came up with the students' faces because that was, that was a different world. And so, uh, and, and when I tell them that I used to sleep out on the fire escape on hot summer nights, but who, who could afford air conditioning and they think I'm a man from Mars. People did that all over New York. They did it in Washington. They did it in North Carolina. Relatives in Washington used to go down and Haynes point down here, the Jefferson memorial on hot summer nights and sleep there. So sometime after midnight when, when the, when the heat wouldn't be so bad and he'd go home at that time, it'd be out of your mind to do that today would be too dangerous. Yeah. So how do we sort of untie some of this? So my sister right now lives on the upper west side in Manhattan, not too far from Harlem and she's in a half a rent stabilized or rent controlled building and, and half market price.

Speaker 1:          39:13          She's on the market price. So she's paying to be in a bedroom in New York City. I don't even want to tell you how expensive it is, but then there are basically half of the building that's paying next to nothing and that of course incentivizes people not to get off the Dole because if you're living in a nice area on the upper west side, very cheap. Why in the world would you ever get off the Dole? How do we start solving these problems? And I know, I know facts is your is your bedrock ans yes, but, but what can we do to get people to understand some of this stuff? Because it's easy. It seems so basic to understand. If someone was giving you something that you didn't earn this, this again is, this is common in Europe and England especially is a, it's a, it's a special problem because you have the, you have this place where your rent is subsidized and say you're in London and jobs are disappearing in London and they opening up in Manchester.

Speaker 1:          40:08          Now, if you go to Manchester, you know, you don't, you get on a waiting list for that kind of, uh, uh, as you stay in London, you're unemployed, which rent is low, and so pete, you, so you slow down the movement of people, you slow down the turnover of people in these apartments. But again, most people who talk about this don't even talk in terms of if this then that they talk about it is, this is how the world ought to be. Well, heck, I can think of all kinds of things we'll have, I think the world ought to be. But unfortunately most of those things involve a cost trade off. Do you think there is a system or a government that's doing it better, doing freedom better than we're doing it here for, for all the flaws that we have in this, in this system?

Speaker 1:          40:50          Is anyone doing it better than us? Although there may be marginally solved, but I think most of the Western world is less free than it was, say 30 years ago, 40 years ago by, by what measurements do you view that? Oh, just the amount of regulations. Uh, things you could use, and also by consequences. I was reading a Milton Friedman, he and his wife had a joint autobiography and she, she's looking at one point, she says, looking back on the days when she would ride the ind subway in Manhattan and what a joy it was. And she said it knows long gone days and uh, the ind subway goes through Harlem and Milton Friedman and his wife when they were still according used to go dancing at the savoy ballroom. A very, very few people want. And you know, the famous theme song of Duke Ellington, take the, a train the, a train goes right through Harlem on the I and D line.

Speaker 1:          41:55          And uh, so Friedman who was only five foot two, he had no fear of being mugged or even a costume. And go there. There were. And this was common, there was a, there was a black actress who used to get finished with Pele and her socializing afterwards at 1:00 in the morning. She said she would be taking the subway up to 155th street and St Nicholas Avenue by herself. And one walking home, nobody does that these days. And so you have to look one at what are the facts, how did they change? And, and, and he don't simply say the other thing is that the same, the no child left behind thing with Bush. There are kids who go to school to raise hell. And a handful of those can present the whole classroom learning anything. Now the logical thing would be to separate those kids out.

Speaker 1:          42:51          And the ones who want to learn something, learn something. You can't do that because the ideology says no. And he goes, so and so you sacrifice whole generations of poor and minority kids for this ideology and this utopian notion. Yeah. And we. And we ended up in an ID, dystopia. Probably Friedman used to say, uh, the best is the enemy of the good. And of course it would be better if everybody could be educated at the same time. It can't be done. So as someone that has survived the arrows and, and the venom that the left can throw at you, because I see a lot of this these days. I see even when they, they say to me, um, I find I get a lot of email from people saying, well, how, how can I be brave enough to do it? And I think it's particularly a unique situation for a minorities that consider themselves conservative or libertarian or a little bit to the right.

Speaker 1:          43:46          So I mentioned Larry elder before and of course you and my friend David Webb and I, you know, there, there are some more black conservatives than perhaps there used to be. Um, no question about what would be if someone's watching this right now and just needs that little extra bit of courage to start saying, no, no, no, no. You have to look at the circumstances. I mean, I've advised some young people, uh, do not go into, ended up teaching in public schools because, uh, the odds are so stacked against you and people can write bad references from you. For you, when you touch him, when you're young and you, and what they say about you is all of this someone sees now, by the time I was a teaching at some of these schools, I remember one place where the department, she haven't used to threaten one of my colleagues who, he wouldn't write good rob references for him.

Speaker 1:          44:36          I had, I had, uh, you know, I'd, I'd published stuff while I was still in graduate school. I had Milton Friedman and enjoy joy, stealing the right references for me. What this guy said there as chairman of the department wouldn't, wouldn't matter a bit, but, but most people don't have, don't have that, uh, situation. And so you have to pick you, you have to pick your fights. So I want to, uh, time is limited here. I want to mention one thing that you say right at the end of the book that really what we need more than anything else perhaps is common decency. And we've Kinda lost. That isn't common anymore. I mean, uh, when I was going to school and we'd have fights on the school yard grounds, when one guy was clearly a beaten, whoever was the toughest kids in the crowd, which simply step in and stop it.

Speaker 1:          45:26          The other guys said, you want to fight, you can fight me. You know, that's what we needed in the public square. Now. Yes, yes. But, but what I mean the, there's only so much the police can do if you, if you don't have common decency that the cops are not, not, not going to be able to, to handle it, especially in when everyone is second yesterday. I love it when people who have never fired a gun on their lives, uh, say, why did the cops fire so many guns now? At one time I taught pistol shooting in the Marine Corp. It doesn't surprise me in the slightest shots fired so many things under those conditions, but people, people can't be knowledgeable about everything, but they can be knowledgeable about the extent of their own ignorance or even if they have phds. Sarah, thIs has been a true honor and a pleasure. And I know I can see it in your eyes, even the, the sort of humility that you have in humbleness, but you've, you've affected so many people and are still continuing to affect so many people. And I hope that we might have just given that a little extra bump today. So I'm, I'm truly honored that you took the time. Thank robots.
