Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I want to start this week off by abiding by one of the rules that I set up when we launched this operation. I said that if you guys fact check me, I would address it on the show. I did actually make a minor error last week, believe it or not, while talking to my guest marginalized. I mistakenly said that Ben Carson was a neuroscientist when in fact he's a neurosurgeon. A that was really just a slip of the tongue, but a couple of you called me out on it, so I wanted to correct myself. Of course, at the end of the day, whether he's a neuroscientist or a neurosurgeon, one thing I hope he will not become president of the United States. We've got a really great response to our interview with Magii last week. Actually, when we finished, I felt like, again, we had been part of an important conversation that needs to be had more.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       This of course is the irony of the regressives that bash people like Majid and Sam Harris here, you have two people from very different walks of life trying to promote secular values and coexistence. Whether you agree with them or not, on every point is totally irrelevant. It should be obvious to anyone with half a brain that these are the guys trying to find a peaceful way forward. Don't take my word for it. They'll listen to them speak themselves and by the way, you can disagree with them on where they stand on certain issues, yet acknowledged that they're having a very difficult dialogue, unexplainably, heated topics that most people are completely afraid to have in the first place. When a journalist called modular porch monkey and Sam a racist, it exposes who the real extremists are in case you missed it on Friday nights realtime. Bill Maher had an excellent sit down with Richard Dawkins on this new split on the left.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       I was thrilled to hear Bill Maher actually use the phrase regressive leftist bill credited Sam Harris for coining the phrase though, from what I understand, Majid was using it as far back as 2012. In any event, the fact that it trickled up to bill shows you that the discussions we're having here on the show as well as the ones that you guys are having on twitter and youtube are actually making a difference. That's the beauty of the Internet. You can get issues to actually bubble up until mainstream takes notice. There is evidence of the awakening that I've been talking about all over the place right now on twitter. Someone asked me if by calling these people the regressive left, if I'm just resorting to the same type of name calling that we accuse them of my answer to, this is a hundred percent no. We're giving a name to a problem we've all seen growing for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Now we can debate with them on facts if they accept facts as such and not just cherry pick them when suitable for their narrative. The reason I feel like naming them is so important is because I now view these regressives as the left's version of the tea party. The tea party went unchecked by the right until it was too late, and now the Republican Party is a fractured mess, often only held together by its worst beliefs. I really believe these regressives are doing this to the left and if we don't have the courage to stop them, then a year or two from now will wonder why our system is even screwed up more than it is now. That's why talking about all this stuff is important and that's why we're going to continue to do so. With that out of the way, it's time to sit down with the outspoken Breitbart, conservative Milo Yiannopoulos and fear not. I won't let any of his sif like logic screw with my thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       My guest this week is a writer for Breitbart Dot Com and a general rabble rouser and renaissance men, Milo Yiannopoulos. Welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me. So when I tweeted out originally that you were coming in, half the people told me I was going to absolutely hate you. Half the people told me I was gonna. Love you for wrong. They're the first half or wrong. Yeah. All right, so uh, so we actually had a drink the other night. We want to be totally transparent here. We had a drink the other night and we talked a little bit. So we've gotten to know each other however much you can in an hour. You are a gay conservative now. I want to repeat that just so that the audience can be clear. You are a gay, you think you need to repeat anything? It's weird. Conservative people. People will be strange. Well, people freak out. So let's just start. Let's just start. What is a conservative to you in 2015? Because I think people don't even know what sort of basic terms anymore, much less the gay part, but let's just. What is a concern?

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       I think the reason people surprised about a gay conservative is because we have a slightly outdated notion of what conservatism is now in the religious right in America doesn't have the same purchase on the public imagination anymore that it wants did. So it's a sort of part of the ripe but not hold of it. And the rice in Europe is drifting quite quickly to the left. So conservatism as a movement, as political philosophy is a bit lost at the moment. One thing we can say for sure is that people on both sides of the political spectrum are moving toward a sort of center right libertarianism, and for me the big gap between people, the big sort of defining political, a schism, particularly on the Internet, but I think if everybody really is not left and right anymore, it's becoming between authoritarians and Libertarians. The issue for the left being that there isn't much space for Libertarians, they're conservatives who don't know, honestly very religious or find their own party drifting to the left are beginning to call themselves conservative or began to call themselves libertarians or conservator Darien. So I think it's an interesting distinction to talk speak in terms of personal liberty and freedom now. And when you understand it like that, it makes much more sense why a gay person would be one.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       Right? So the part that we sort of fall out on the, on the same spot is the authoritarian and libertarian part of this. Right? Because we don't like the authoritarians. I think both of us are sort of libertarians, libertarians are thought more of in the conservative space, but if you were to give me like a three sentence synopsis of when you say to someone, I'm a conservative, what are you, what are the principles there? What, what are, what is the basic bullet principles?

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       I think you believe in individual personal responsibility. You believe in freedom of thought, of expression, of creativity. You believe in free markets. You believe that the relationship, the individual in the state should be circumscribed quite clearly and quite crisply. So you believe that state has a limited and quite well defined set of responsibilities beyond which it should not stretch. Um, you believe in the power and value of institutional authority and community structures. So you believe that even if you may, for example, believe that even if you're not a Christian, you still recognize that the church has something to offer that is a valuable institution that keeps up kids that we'll get to that. But likewise, institutions like monarchy, you respect them because you understand that even though, for example, it would be very difficult to defend the monarchy in purely logistical. Oh, purely a logical terms these days. Nonetheless, it works best in Britain. It is the best system yet devised and it works brilliantly. Impression, even if you, if you were to design a state today, you wouldn't come up with it and consider a lot of the commenters. Are we on the wrong, obviously wrong. Conservatives instinctively understand that the value of tradition and authority and um, and of course levels wants to tear all those things down. So I think those are some of the things that people mean when they describe themselves as conservative.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Right? So the reason I think it's, it's sort of a confusing term or that all our terms have become confusing, I think is because a lot of times now, as you sort of alluded to in America, we think of conservatives somehow as an attachment to the religious right, which is weakening a little bit, which I think is good. And you're saying in in England it's a little more of a respect for the monarchy. Monarchy has respect for traditions, but I think a lot of people would say, well, you're just in it for the man,

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       right? Well, I think it's preposterous. And if you look at the, look at how many working class conservative voters there are, why would all of these people be voting against their own interests if that were true? And if conservatism are really about protecting rich people, why would millions of of people who struggle to make rent or struggle to put their kids through college or struggle even perhaps to, you know, to feed their families, vote conservative. They do it because they appreciate the value of, of some of the structures around that they love and they do it because they, they believe in a certain limited the state's power. They believe in other things that go with conservatism. You why would so many people vote against their interest and it's just absurd characterization of childish characterization of conservatism to suggest that it is in some way just assist them to protect them and protect the Richard protect corporations. I think we can all agree that corporatism and I'm mature late capitalism, which existence of intricate symbiosis with the private sector and in some cases quite poisonous in that respect, the bailout of the banks in the UK, the sorts of corporate cronyism it happens in America. Plenty of it here too, right? If course. I think we all agree that's a bad thing, but it is by no means restricted to one side of the political spectrum.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       Yeah. Well, I always say there's a reason that at least in America, you know, the one percent give basically 51 percent of the Republicans and 49 percent to the Democrats because they're, they're hedging their bets. So yeah, I don't believe it goes down to either

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       already know. And I, you know, if, if you, if you take the view that conservatism is about, you know, uh, sticking out for the man, you have to explain things like why conservatives give more money to charity, why even conservatives who aren't religious give more charity. There are lots of very difficult questions you have to answer. If you want to make that argument for me, it doesn't hold water.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       All right, well that's, that's sort of where I wanted to jump off from and just get a basic, a basic set of rules that were sort of talking about here and I think we, I think we sorted it not remotely the most interesting thing about it. Yeah. All right. Well now we're going to get into some of the interesting stuff. So first thing I want to ask you about is, I think I found out about you originally because of Gamer Gate that I've done one video on gate. It was about a year ago and so basically I said to the audience, I said, I said, guys, look, I don't really understand this thing. I don't know what's going on here. I have a sense it has to do with some people that were upset at some of the publications and then all this doxing and all and massage and yoga. But I, this is, I don't know, so I don't know that I can address it. Now you're in the thick of this thing. So I thought if we do one thing I gained very, can we do like a five minute really hash it out? Honest

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       what Gamergate was really about five minutes for you. We're all used to seeing these social justice warriors to police language. You say that

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       we're going to do plenty on that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       Very random things or sexist or racist or misogynist or whatever. I think we're all used to. Now I'm the press in some cases, reporting on things extraordinarily badly now. Gamergate has been a huge controversy with people who care about these things because both of those things have come together. It is a consumer movement that rejects sloppy standards in, in reporting about video games and video games by the way, are very important part of the entertainment industry. They're bigger than Hollywood now. It's 97, 90, probably about by now $90,000,000,000 industry rejects sloppy reporting about that and all sorts of horrible infractions of journalistic ethics and conflicts of interest. Almost it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       Wait, just to stay on that though for a second. So basically the game companies were sort of paying the writers to give them better reviews. Is that

Speaker 2:          00:10:13       things like that going on if 10 people sleeping with people and writing things about them a bit too closely, they shouldn't have. Basically. It's a very fast growing industry, so the presses nascent, the presses grown up very fast and what was previously a trade press, you know, like you know, tree cutters weekly or the stamp collectors monthly or whatever has suddenly become a consumer press and it hasn't necessarily improved it standards commensurate with that. The second half of it is the social justice warriors who mentioned briefly. There is a sort of insurgent move in video games from a couple of wacky left wing feminists and these are sort of far left Israel hating Socialist Weirdos. I'm fall a feminist to say that every, every video game is problematic. That there is something wrong with all these video games and if for some reason the journalists have sucked all this up and have bought it all in a digit, the same journalists who protected video games when the religious right in the 19 eighties and nineties said that video games turn kids into killers and violent, which there is no evidence of right. We have one more slide. None whatsoever. None whatsoever. Yeah. Those same journalists nonetheless have rolled over and accepted the feminist critique of video games and said, oh, well, video games got me get violent, but they can make you sexist now. Again, there is no evidence whatsoever. That's the case. The research is the most generous you could be is to say the research is that the jury is out, but most of the most, most of the most credible research. There's. There's nothing

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       to be real clear on that. So that would be like for example, in a game like grand theft auto where you can literally grab a woman out of her car hunter, but you can do that to a man too, so you would. You would argue that that that's not what the anti woman because they're there. It's a festival. It's a festival. It's imaginary. It's not real. And second of all, yeah, it's on his computer

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       screen and second of all, what much of the evidence shows actually is that people who get stuff out of their system and it's mainly boys who get the stuff out of their system playing video games on nicer to people in the real world because it's that sort of boyish testosterone thing. I mean, even as homosexual is we have some understanding of that male need to sort of win and crushed and you know, and do that kind of, well, you know, you know, you probably play sports. I don't, but you know, I, I, I, I take that out horizontally. But there is, there is that sort of male need to get, you know, get that sort of testosterone energy out for system. Uh, and when boys do that in video games, much of the evidence shows that they behave nicer and rural life. Now some have some studies say that video games can make you hyper competitive.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       So the FIFA Games, the football games can leave somebody a bit more competitive, can raise testosterone levels. But that's a very temporary effect. There's absolutely no evidence whatsoever. The video games can make is sexist and these sorts of Cherry picked insane feminists. I mean just just, just the most barmy bunkers, all of the. We'll get onto feminism later, but it's coming. If you imagine the most wacky, stereotypical blue haired, overweight, furious, you know, fact free, terrible lesbian. I'm a lesbian and a feminist whether or lesbians. Now I'm lesbian, feminist kind of lunatic. That's the sort of person that's criticizing video games. And very often the people don't even play video games. This is, this is another chapter in the culture wars which were used to from the movies and from books. And so the gate know game. Ordinary gamers have put up for 10 years or more with their own press calling them man babies and misogynists beating up on them basically because it's the trendy thing to do because these days, progressivism and um, you know, sort of hating on men that kill all white men, kind of these feminists hashtags are socially acceptable.

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       I mean, you, you, you, there is no, you will get no social censure from your peers as far as a member of the media today for tweeting one of those hashtags. Now, obviously if you did it the other way around, it would be a problem. Um, that's become fashionable. It's become trendy for White, sort of white guilt, right? White middle class girls become fashionable for these people to beat up on themselves, prostrate themselves before the altar of womanhood and say that everything that they are and everything that they do is terrible. I'm so sorry. You know, mother guy, or how can I make it up to you? Um, the reality is that actually these video games quite good for people.

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       That's the crux of it. Then it's, it's these people, it's the gaming community that

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       that is a risk that has risen up because it's, it's, it is tired of being lied about and slandered by its own press press. The did a really good job of defending it when the violence stuff is going on. Jack Thompson in the nineties were saying, but again, it can make you violent. The press did a really good job of rebutting him because he was conservative, but when, uh, a liberal and progressive critic comes along, they fall over themselves to agree and start hating on their own audience.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       Right. And that's really interesting. And it goes to really what, 90 percent of what we're going to talk to talk about Isabelle, because right. I remember when Joe Lieberman, who's, you know, was on the right at that time, I guess he's an independent now when he was railing against violence in video games with mortal Kombat. I remember it was very cool to say what, what loser he was

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       and so added touch and. Well, the problem with some, the problem with video games from the gamers is they have no social capital. Everybody hates them. The right hates video games because it says they call a school shootings and because they're violent and a bit and deviant and Dorky, and you've got the sort of from the religious right that complains that they, you know, can introduce dangerous, uh, you know, thoughts of, into people's minds, to nobody was killing anybody in the name of God before video games. Right. I've never happened. We can talk about that. I, Oh, a, some sort of thing. Atheist, serial killers will get up there. Isn't, you know, be we're doing this in the nineties. Right. And the game's press did a great job of defending, defending video games against those charges. They've done a much less job, a good job.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       In fact, they've done no job at all of defending it against feminists who are just as wacky and just as crazy as the old religious right. And in fact, the feminists say all the same things. They hate the same things they hate. Nudity and violence are all the same stuff. This is why some very clever Brendan O'Neill, who is a wonderful economist and Britain wrote in the spectator. A great thing about it was a provocation, but it was, it was interesting about how feminism looks quite like Islam. Islam in some regards there because it hits the same thing it hits female nudity to and it asks for the same staff and it has, uses the same language I wrote, I did a silly quiz online in my column about, you know, Anita Sarkeesian and was the leading feminist critic of video games or Jack Thompson who was the nineties.

Speaker 2:          00:16:09       We'll just write guy and I just sort of a lined up a lot of quotes from each of them and asked to go in here to pick which you, who said it and then, but never got more than five out of 10, uh, which, which is my point, you know, they say the same thing, same language and it goes to that. That difference is not really about left and right. It's not worry about politics anymore. The most important political distinction in people since more of our, as more of our lives move online, more of our discourses online as more people navigate the Internet. What the Internet has done to politics is very interesting, is turned every major culture, war and every major discussion into, around between authoritarians want to control how other people live, and Libertarians who either want to escape into fantasy worlds because they want to escape, you know, was going on in their life or simply classical liberals like me who believe in freedom of expression, freedom of thought, liberty of, of idea, and, and, and believe that it is essential for the good of our species if you like it, if you want to get serious about it, that we can talk about everything openly and honestly and that there are no, no go areas.

Speaker 2:          00:17:09       I'm more what my colleague at Breitbart Alim Bukhari Cause, uh, a cultural libertarian. I'm not a libertarian politically speaking, but I believe that in culture there should be no boundaries and that we should be able to explore everything. Um, video games are sailed on all sides from the left, from the right, from everybody, by people who want to restrict the acceptable limits of a creative expression. I think that's dangerous. I think it's dangerous wherever it happens. I think video games are the most interesting entertainment medium in which it's happening now because it is the because gamers are the first people who rose up and said no to the social justice warriors and it was a horrible and humiliating defeat for them. Right. So it's actually interesting. And then we'll move on to feminism specifically, but it's really interesting because this is sort

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       of the awakening that I now see happening in our political discussion. People are now hitting on this libertarian thing and fighting the authorities, but it's. But it's still relate. The machine is

Speaker 2:          00:18:01       Saunas. It's trump, it's farrage and Corbin in the UK. All of the populist political movements on the left and the right, they come from all over the counter counter cultural antiestablishment libertarian leanings. Right now Corbin in the UK is much more of a socialist as much more of a of a of a prescriptive kind of guy, but his supporters, you know, want to be able to behave terribly and they do behave terribly. Just this week there was spitting on people in the to the Tory conference in Manchester. They want the right not just to think terrible things like I'd microbes to cultural image and they want to be the right to behave abominably. All of this stuff, you know, is, is it comes from the thing I think something we've all known for 10, 20 years. It's increasing dissatisfaction, alienation from the political and media relates that the lot of ordinary voters feel ordinary people.

Speaker 3:          00:18:46       I think pretty much everybody feels that regardless of what they do and even,

Speaker 2:          00:18:50       and I think we'll get onto this later, even those of us who work in the media and have quite nice lives and come from Nice homes and you know, and don't really have much to complain about. Still feel that quite acutely and you and I think are examples of people who are a bit more alive to that. A bit more aware of the fact that you know, that political discourse and cultural discussion on television has become really, really dull. And you've had people on your show already and the first thing, right? And you've had people in the old show and the first three episodes who are very insistent about free speech and free expression and the importance of, of old victorian style, classical liberalism, but also the importance of mischief and joy and a little bit of fun like marginal, Eh, marginal monster you had on. Sure it was a great lover of fun and mischief and loves to tease people who want to lecture him and bullied him. And in the leftists who say to him that he's not a proper Muslim or whatever, you know, because he doesn't want to pick women in Burkas or whatever it is. Or what is this?

Speaker 3:          00:19:38       To me it seems racist if you say, well, he's not being good enough. Alright. Racism. But you see, we started with Gamergate. We did. We see where we ended here. This is what they hit us. And I'll tell you why. Then bring it home. Typically the reasons. Yeah, it

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       does this, this Gamergate is, is the sort of final, um, it's almost like the final chapter in two decades worth of Internet wars. And those Internet wars have been about thought speech, culture, politics. You name it, every community on the Internet and every sub community within those sites, which for channel Reddit, whatever has a dog in the fight and Gamergate because they all either have a vested interest in free speech and anonymity or they have an interest in protecting the integrity, integrity, and creative expression of certain attainment mediums or their, um, their individual people who have behaved terribly on the Internet, who saw Gamer Gate is a redemptive opportunity. So if they lined up with the, you know, the women and went in with these mostly fake frets about death and rape and all the rest of it. Um, it typical leftist feminist tactics that don't stack up when you look into them move, she will get into, I'm going to challenge me.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       A lining up on one side of that debate was a way of indicating whether you were for Authoritarians or libertarians. And it was a sort of confluence of all of these arguments and wars online and, and, and it takes you in these crazy directions because in a way it's sort of the most all encompassing a war and the most all encompassing event that's ever happened on the internet because it brought in everybody, all of the old battles, you know, something people don't realize is when you range up the sides on Gamer Gate, there are people who were involved in was five years ago. You kind of take picking the same sorts of sides. This is a, this is the best example we have yet most exciting example. Culturally we haven't journalists. There's on such a terrible idea, terrible job of reporting on this concentrated these fake rape threats.

Speaker 2:          00:21:20       Conservatives or miss the miss, the huge cultural opportunity here. I'm shamefully so leftists have not even bothered to make the arguments because they know their arguments in nonsense and they focused on the threats. This was such an interesting example of what I was saying earlier, the fact that on the Internet that it's not about left and right anymore. It's about authoritarians and Libertarians and cultural libertarians are the rising power, and they're the people who love me. They're the people met. I think much of your audience falls into the same bucket. Actually, the people who love Lauren Southern, the libertarian candidate, Canadian politician, they love Cathy Young, a great veteran journalist of Christina Hoff summers at the American Enterprise Institute. Adam Baldwin, the actor, but all of the, even Eli Roth, a director is making a movie about social justice, where right now, you know, um, cultural libertarianism is on the rise because people are sick of political correctness. People are sick of being told they're racist, sexist, misogynist, transphobic when they know they're not.

Speaker 3:          00:22:06       Once again, I think by asking you about Gabriel, we just hit on a zillion. We hit on a zillion. It's a huge topic. That is the best I can do. All right, so we're going to leave it there and I'm sure the commenters are going to have a field day with it, which is great. So let, let's talk about some other stuff. So feminism, which you've already enlightened me a bit on, you really, really are against feminism. And before I let you do your piece, now my sense is that feminism, at least the way it started, was that women wanted equality. They wanted the same equality of opportunity that men had. There is no doubt that, uh, most of these roads in our society have been easier for men. I think you would argue that that's changed now. But so what, what do you think of the feminist movement? You were just kicked out of the Amber Rose sidewalk, uh, two days ago. He was in your situation with you today. We didn't run into him because he's given her a piece of my mind. Why would you hate feminists?

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       Well, the picture you painted perfectly accurate, or at least it was until perhaps 10, maybe 15 years ago. Certainly recently. It's changed very recently. I think most people instinctively agree with the equality of opportunity. And of course you have access for women. They want women to have the opportunity to do anything. They want to rise as high as a man, if they're prepared to work as hard and put the same amount of hours in. And of course I agree with that. I think everybody agrees with that. That's not what modern intersectional third wave as it's called feminism is about, which seems to me and I think to a lot of women, to primarily to be about man hating. It is a very angry, bitter. I'm a profane. I'm lesbian of feminism.

Speaker 3:          00:23:41       No, like right to be angry though. I mean as the other

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       dinner, an oppressed class. Well that women don't make equal money as men or is that a myth about this all the time, but of course it's a myth. It's one of those feminists missed that won't die. Basically. If you take all of the earnings of men and all of the earnings of women and you do a simple bit of maths, then you'll get something like a 77. What? This doesn't take into account as the different choices that women make. It doesn't take into account a variety of factors. No reputable economists takes the wage gap seriously, but it's repeated because, um, you know, I mean we still, we saw where the stuff comes from just this week for slut walk. I was kicked out of. I'm a journalist for Time magazine reported that 50,000 people that come out in support of the slut walk, I was there.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       It was like maybe 250. She blathered she, you know, started to sort of blame other people and eventually they changed it to thousands, but it was still wrong. This sort of like sloppy ideological reporting. And I'm sorry to say that the most brazen untruths always come from the left. Just like most of the major plagiarism scandals come from the left because they believe in narrative over fact. This is how rollingstone happened. Um, you know, the, the, the fake rape in rolling stone, it's our Duke Lacrosse happens. It's how, you know, all of these things happen because these liberal journalists believe that even if this one's not true, it's really important for us to talk about. So I'm with you on that because even with some of my prior guests like Sam and budget, this is what they've done is what they experience, you know, and they're getting the receiving end of it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       Um, you know, the, the, these, these memes of like, you know, there's foot, whether it's three, four or five women, one in three, one in four, one in five women are going to get sexually assaulted on campus, which is just nonsense. Whether it's the wage gap, which is nonsense, you know, these things become established as part of almost almost. They won't become almost folkloric and look right up to the president. I mean Obama repeat some of these statistics, but they're not true. And if you look at the work, for example, Christina Hoff summers I mentioned earlier, the American Enterprise Institute who to very crisply and cleanly and entertainingly debunks this stuff I'm working on getting well, she's great and you should, I mean she's, she takes a scalpel to these guys and it's, it's clinical and brilliant to watch it. None of this stuff stacks up. So if you're trying to make the case that women have a right to be angry, that they should be angry because women have all of these injustices will ask you what are these injustices?

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       And every single one that's given by feminist, every example, it's giving me a feminist does not stand up to scrutiny. Women are not an oppressed class in the west. There is no rape culture in the West. We don't celebrate rapists. We put them in prison. Women don't earn less than men for the same work. That's illegal. It is true that you know, because women are mothers. There are consequences when it, when you get into the workplace on that. But a woman is paid the same work as a man. So when you, when you, when you say there's a way this confusion between wages and earnings, you know, when you say seventy cents to the dollar, what women here is, well, I'm going to get page seventy seven cents for a man's pound. No woman has that experience. It doesn't happen. You know, there's some women who work part time because they have children.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Well, they have children. What do you expect? You know, the important thing is that we make sure that when women come back to work after they have children, that they're not disadvantaged for that. Now where that's happening, that's wrong. But it is not, it is not a problem on the scale of what, uh, you know, Sam Harris and Majid we'll talk about, you know, happening to women in the Middle East and feminists will never talk to you about this difficult stuff because they don't want to be, they don't want to be put in a difficult position of having to rank Islam versus women.

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       Right? So that, that's where I'm western Western world. It's a western union,

Speaker 2:          00:27:03       western world western feminism complaining about manspreading mansplaining, this constant, this constant message that men are evil and broken and wrong, toxic masculinity. This is offensive. It's irritating, it is wrong. And it's district.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       All right, so let's, let's go right to that. Um, you wrote a piece this week about this, about the shooter in Oregon, and your, your piece basically was saying that men are being abused in the media or so are so easily dismissed in society, uh, that, that they're acting out in crazy ways. And we have to stop treating men like I know. And I know a lot of people on the left for a lot of the reasons you're describing will read something like that and say, you know, this is nonsense men. Men have all the power.

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       Yeah. I mean what I said was that it at least part of the reason that some of these young men are acting out that we have these shootings, these shootings happening at least some of the reason for that is the horrible position we've put men in. Now you can read everyday and major new media publications, um, that, um, there is a, there is a problem intrinsically with being a straight white male or just being a white man, um, that somehow that gives you privileged access to certain institutions that you are somehow problematic. That's not the experience of young men today who go through university. And our one in seven of them is, it were put on Ritalin or adderall because they are held up to a female. But a female behavior standards. It's not the experience of boys. There's a direct connection between the medication and the and this.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       Well, of course there is, of course, of course there is a behavior not be upstanders babies standards. Of course there is because behavior has done, I'm, I, I meant behavior, behavior standards. Um, and we're not just doing that, but we're also changing the way the exams are mark, to make them easier for women because women don't test well and exams. So boys are struggling, boys are falling behind. And this is not a controversial thing. Everybody knows this boy's are falling horribly behind girls in education. Fewer men are going to the university, more women graduate when we get higher grades in the workplace. For example, Cornell study from 2015 showed that women who have a two to one advantage going for the same job just because everybody's desperate to hire women. The experiences of men growing up now do not reflect these horrible headlines, um, about straight white men. And frankly, I think progressives have got themselves into a really weird corner. They don't seem to appreciate the irony of criticizing somebody for their skin color and their orientation, but they do it anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       right? And they would say, well, this is the group that's in power. So if they're being well, they would say yes,

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       the only claim that there is a sort of mystical force in society known as the patriarchy. And what these feminists will claim is that the patriarchy is responsible for keeping women down and all of these crazy expressions like toxic message in whatever flow from this, this tired old ideology, um, about male power and an overseas. Now, as Camille Paleo, that wonderful dissident feminist critic says, you know, if society but left in the left in the hands of women, we'd still be living in mud huts. Thank God for the Patriarchy Patriarchy that got us to the moon. It's the patriarchy to built the Internet, the patriarchy that built this floor and the ceiling women didn't want to do that is the patriarchy that drives oil trucks in a steeple jacks. You know, women don't want to do that stuff either. We're perfectly happy to complain about gender representation when there aren't enough women, when, when there aren't enough women in a, in a particular subject field for our arbitrary quotas. But we don't make it the same complaint the other way around,

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       right? But all of this stuff, we're the ones that were going out and hunting and women were taking care of the home. So I find that argument is a little flimsy because

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       are there are people who say that's not a bad way to structure society. I mean when we start to break down those gender. Look, this all comes from this sort of credited leftest idea that gender is socially constructed and agenda is socially constructed, right? If you're taught to be a boy or taught to be a girl, rather than having a lot of that behavior, genetic behavior sort of encoded in you, if you like, as a virtue by virtue of your chromosomes, if you, if, if gender is a performance and it's a social construct, there's no reason why girls compared to boys and boys can't behave like girls. Now we're beginning to start to see that fall apart. Now, one of the ways in which it falls apart as the transgender debate, we know now, now progressives are telling us the baby can be born with the wrong brain. Um, if you could be born with a female brain, there must be such a thing as a female brain. So surely femininity can't be as a copy of social construct. Make your bloody mine's up.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       The thing that you see on this was that, you know, everybody was saying that Abi or most sane people I think were saying that obviously Rachel Dolezal couldn't choose to be black. She was white and she pretended

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       created by progressive. So you said that blackness was a performance that you could, that blackness was a social construct that race was. Now that rat race is a social construct. Of course it isn't, you know, we know now because we have the computer processing power to do it. We know that the, you know, when we look at the genome, that there are clusters of clusters of, of information that map onto certain geographies in that's in that statistical sense. We know now that race is real. Um, and you know, we know from ordinary people know from common sense of our eyes and ears, you know, we know that people look different and behave differently. Um, we know that stuff, but progressives for Mr, variety of barmy reasons, best known to themselves have been claiming that's gender and race are social constructs. All this stuff is starting to fall apart now.

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       Is the gender one falling part? I don't want to Belabor this point, but the gentleman's fully believe that people can be trans because I, I know, I know some trans people. I have no doubt

Speaker 2:          00:32:21       I didn't say that. I want to say what I said. What I said was I'm transgender debate is very interesting and very dangerous for progressives and they haven't yet dealt with this. Um, if you can be born with the wrong brain, if you can be born, if you can be born a man with a woman's brain, that means is such a thing as a woman's brain. Right? So what, what transgender patients will do is they start hacking away at themselves to make them, you know, and it's an anatomically more like women. So they're somewhere between the two genders, by the end of it, right? And they're not functioning women, but they look a bit more like women. Um, and some of their, some things work a bit more like women and they have the appearance of women and they say they have a woman's brain. If you're gonna have a woman's brain.

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       There is such a thing as a woman's brain is there's a biological basis for certain behavioral differences. Now you were asking me about sort of men going out to forage may not maybe no bad thing that we let men be career, you know, be the hunter gatherers and women may indeed be happier focusing on bringing up, bringing up children and building a home. Certainly the women that I know that are in their twenties that have been told, especially in their thirties, have been told they can have it all. They can have a career. They're living in a horrible apartment. They don't live with a cat. They're miserable or hay or their friends. They're not happy people. They've been encouraged to be single, encouraged by feminism particularly to look how they want it. So this, this fat, but fat positivity. That is another feminist trope is that you can look like what you want their self esteem shouldn't depend on what a man thinks of you.

Speaker 2:          00:33:43       Well, yes, it should because if you want to, you know, if you want to settle down with a manual, like, and have a nice happy life. There are certain things that men liking women like stay thin. Um, you know, and you may not like it, but it's a fact. As gay men, we know that men are visual animals right now. Some, some guys like fat girls, but not many. Um, and if, if you, if you're listening to feminists who were telling you can grow blue armpit hair and you can burp and Fart and swear, you can be Lena Dunham, this disgusting, quivering, massive horror. Um, you know, and men will like you. That's a lie, will not like you and you'll be alone and you'll be miserable. I know a lot of people here are going to say, well, this is sort of somehow this is some of your gay rage or misogyny coming out in some of this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       So let's say I don't have a dog in the fight, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care if you're thin or fat as a woman, I don't want to fuck you either way. I don't care what I want is for people to be happy and I see people not being happy because I see that women are moving in a very, very dangerous direction. Told lies by Wacky fall f feminist crazies who want to control other people because they're hurting inside. I think in many cases very often it's 30, 40 year old bitter old woman trying to lecture 20 year old girls on how to behave. It's an ugly woman on woman form of violence if you like a modern feminism. It is a nasty thing to watch. And I see women get drawn into this and I find it sad. But there is of course one great hope and, and a silver lining to all this, which is that, um, feminism is collapsing in popularity among women.

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       Um, in just a few years. The number of American women who described themselves as feminist has gone from 28 to 18 percent. You can read in Vox is not somewhere that would advertise. This may just be because of the success of the movement. Women who don't identify as feminists and they don't identify as feminists because they see in feminism or IC, which is turned into a bitter, nasty, ugly man hating empty horror show and frankly you read these blogs like Jenzabar, which you know which a rail against men. Most women don't hate men. Most women don't want to beat up on people for being straight or being white or being a male. Most people quite like a boyfriend, you know, so they see it. They don't have anything in common with these angry gender warriors who want to deny basic human nature and who make claims and give instructions that are almost designed to make women miserable. And I think most women recognize that, which is why feminism is falling off a cliff with women.

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       I love how you wrap up. Even the things I disagree with in the, in the social justice warrior prism, because that's my. That's my weak spot because I'm so against that that I have to sort of acknowledge some of what you're saying here. Um, all right. So let's, let's do one more thing and then I, and then I want to spend the whole second half of this really on, on one topic specifically, and I want to talk about atheism because it's been one of the so boring. All right? So just a couple of people wrong in a room being very angry on the Internet. So you don't, you, I sense, you almost think that atheists don't exist,

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       that there's some lesbians don't exist. They're already. Unfortunately there are. They're going to force you. There are. So there are a, you acknowledged that there are lots of wrong people in the world, you know, and one of the wrong kinds of wrong people are atheists. Now the thing I find fun about it, I didn't really care if somebody believes in God and I hope they do. I wish they did because I know it'd be quite nice if they join me up there in 40 slash 50 years, but there's something up there. I've got a first class ticket. She loves me. I'm very confident. There's nothing up there. There's a lighting grid have been built by men. Uh, no, but I mean, the reason I. The reason I haven't go atheists because it's fun because they're so thin skin. They're like, come. They're like libertarians or they're like cyclists or Liberal Democrats in the UK or you know, any other sort of feminists. In fact, they're so easy to wind up. I mean, you know how many atheists it takes to change a light bulb and before you've even given the punchline, people are furious and there's a reddit thread about it and they're just so much fun.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       I understand. But why will you be going after the people that it's easy to go after? I mean, every poll shows that the most hated

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       my in the country. People would know these victims. These, these people have some of the most celebrated public intellectuals on their side. Richard Dawkins, the late Christopher Christopher hitchens. These people have huge public intellectuals on their side. Millet, militant atheism, if you'd like. If he is Mr trendiest thing in the world. Every journalist is an atheist. Everybody in the media, as an atheist, you know, you're never going to get somebody laugh at you or look at you weirdly for announcing you're an atheist, you announced you're a Christian or a Muslim or if or maybe especially a Jew. Um, you know, all sorts of bad things happen to you, right? Nobody, nobody looks at you funny except me. I'm probably one person. If you announced that you were an atheist, so don't be that victim because if you know this is, this is the, this is a privileged group in society that I find it funny to take the Mickey out of because they are so touchy.

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       This is interesting because. So when you were talking about Gamergate, part of what you liked is that there was this groundswell coming up from the bottom, fighting this authoritarian sense. I think religion people have that again now, but I don't think we're there yet. I, I get that angle and this is what all my friends on the say, that

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       the bridge is now are the ones being oppressed and Christians are being. I wouldn't go so far as to say oppressed, but saying it's basically crazy as is wrong. I wouldn't go as far as to say Christians are an oppressed class in this country because I don't think there aren't many press clusters in this country. I can't do anything. Know, maybe black people still. That's probably the only one in this country. Um, I don't think they're an oppressed class, but I do think, um, I've been very ashamed of my fellow, my fellow homosexuals in the way they have behaved toward Christians in some of the media circus that happened recently. I have so I can, I can go with you on that. Plead, plead deeply, horrifying to watch gay people treat Christians as gays were treated for barely two decades ago. Sure. So, but I do think there's some value there, but I do.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       I have noticed I did a David Webb who's going to be a guest on our show in a couple weeks from Fox News and on Sirius Xm. I was on his show when gay marriage was, was being passed by the Supreme Court and the law was being struck down to shame is shame and we'll get to that too in a second, but what he said to me, it just literally, I think it was the first day was the day that had happened was that we should really already start being a. We should start policing the gaze to make sure we don't start pressing Christian, but isn't that. Don't we have to give it a little time? Don't we have to let gays have a little time to work with to be bullied someone before suddenly accusing them? No, no, no. We don't need to give gay people anytime to be bullies. They have shown and this is a, this is what you are.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       This is something that I always find interesting about people, how they behave when they enter the corridors of power, how people behave when they are granted the status that they have asked for for so long when gays are finally not just equal in society, but held up as models of paragons of virtue. I mean, you read it, you read Gawker, buzzfeed, you would think they'd be engaged with some kind of moral objective, but being gay with someone so you know, it was better than being straight in some way. Um, you know, I'm not gonna say, well, we'll, we'll, we'll perhaps discuss it in the second half of the show, what I think on that, but um, but, but it seems like a weird proposition and therefore on the face of it. But if you read buzzfeed or vox or Corker, you'll get that impression. Um, no, I don't think gay people deserve anytime to be bullies to settle into, you know, their position or authority.

Speaker 2:          00:40:38       And I think it does gay people a lot of damage to see these bitter, hysterical, Nasty Queens bullying and lecturing and hectoring, ordinary decent law abiding people of faith. And I thought it was utterly deplorable when that couple who staged a renew of the vowels, they didn't even have a wedding, but they staged a renewal of the vows because already had the wedding solely. It seemed to get a photo opportunity with pizzas from memories, pizza, which they they, they tricked this Christian Christian pizzeria into catering their thing. Now set aside the horror, I think most gay people will feel about pizza and whether the carb would. I know I'm Greek and 13 showing I've told you a cameraman to shoot me from here. Set that aside, or how hollow and bitter, what a terror, what an awful kind of human being you would have to be to turn your special day of. Send a day of appreciation and celebration between you and your family, the people that you love into an a cheap political stump. People that you think that gay people in many cases turn themselves into the worst kind of grandstanding bigots. No, they do not need time to settle in there. Very much settled.

Speaker 3:          00:41:43       Right. So I, I'm sort of with you on that because I, I do understand that. Look this, they purposely did this for a Christian Baker had they went to have they go to an orthodox Jewish Baker or, or a Muslim baker and forced them to do this. The media wouldn't have nearly the fun that they had, but so just wrapping this around atheism and then we're going to do everything else we're going to do is gay for the rest of this after, after this final question, I know it's exhausting learning about what position of power do you think that, that I don't see atheists in any position. Yes. There are a couple cool thought of atheists out there. Right? So not about Neil degrasse Tyson or talking to someone about it because it's not about positions of power. It's about, well, what do you think? Social cache, but. So what do you think that the, the main, the average atheist, which an atheist is only brought together by the lack of belief in a deity. A what

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       brought together by um, you know, sort of whispery facial hair, terrible spectacle, sort of long ginger ponytails, terrible, terrible, thin skinned, natural sort of demeanor to hair trigger temper. These are the primary characteristics of an atheist looking at socks and sandals. Terrible cheap Chinos, you know, all that kind of stuff. That's what you want to consider. If that's what you want to respond to, then go right ahead. But you know, Catholic Catholics have all the best outfits, you know, rich, older men in dresses. What's not to love whenever you want, if you want everyone to have a sense of style and you become a Muslim or Catholic. Um, no, I mean, look, atheists are, it is not just acceptable, but it is the norm in any metropolitan city in Europe or in America to be an atheist. It is normal to be an atheist. People look at you weird if you're not

Speaker 3:          00:43:22       right. So what? So what's the problem with that? That's, that's the part I think it's funny to take the piss out of them. You just want to make fun of them. Even though I enjoy making fun.

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       The Mondrian, making fun out of everybody and you're making fun of you. I enjoyed making fun of myself. I make fun out of myself all day on my twitter feed. That's what, that's what

Speaker 3:          00:43:36       provocateurs do. All right, well I can accept that. I will grant you that, but I won Niger one, that little section, but. Well, you can have one hour if you can have that. I want to spend the rest of the time talking about a whole bunch of gay stuff because I mentioned on the show a week and we've done five of these here. I think this is our fifth episode since we've been with aura. I've only watched once mentioned anything about being gay. I don't, I don't make it an issue unless it's relevant and it is what it is. I mean, believe me, I'm gay. I'm married. You know what I mean? I'm married to do pretty gay. Okay. Um, but I, I don't know. I know. Okay. So you will selling, selling out, selling out to the Hetero picture institution. Yes. Yes. We'll get to those. Yeah. Yeah. I know you have a better game.

Speaker 2:          00:44:21       My God. Right. Anything more awful. So before

Speaker 3:          00:44:25       we do that portion of this, it's hilarious. The, the liberal here married one. The conservative one is the one railing against marriage. It's, it's fascinating. I just think it's sad that, you know, I want heterosexual to come back to the institution of marriage. I want them to realize that it's a good thing. I want them to become more socially conservative in that regard. I don't want gay people being growing up. Right? So we're just going to go all in on this. I'll reverse my question. So go, go. Alright. I didn't think being gay

Speaker 2:          00:44:49       particularly fun and I wouldn't choose it for my children. For example, I think Sally Cohen who said that they'd like so that she'd like to have a gay child. I thought it was deplorable and sadistic and incredibly selfish.

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       So meaning what if, if salsify has come to a place of realization, what she said was if she could, if she said what she said was if she could pick, she'd rather have a gay kid. And I thought that was a horrible thing to say because what? What's your last child? My Trans Life. So much more miserable. But, but it's getting easier every day. We're, don't you think that when, uh, how old are you? Oh Gee. You don't ask again. All right, well if you really aren't a proper gay. Oh yeah. Terrible failure as a gay man lady. What point b? It's a lot, it's a lot easier for you than it was for a 30 year old gay man 10 years ago and it's going to be way shobin the normalcy that will,

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       you're confusing two different things. There's a sort of practical, um, ease with which a gay person can go through life because there is no longer the entrenched homophobia if you like it in wider society. The um, the fact that gay people can, can show, can have a relationship and live together and nobody really cares. And I don't think anybody cares anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:46:01       Um, well I've said that for a long time. I'm so sick of talking about it, which is why I don't. All I wanted was equal rights. I just want to be treated better than anybody. I think gay people

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       for getting married and in relationships is a shame because I quite like the distance. I'm a naughty sort of aspects of gay life and I think that it's part of my gay privileged to be able to tumble out of a nightclub at 3:00 AM with, you know, sort of dormant on my arm and he hops off off my face. But

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       Oh, you do that while still having other people like you, people like you getting married, getting a dog, living in a little house in a horrible, horrible, no self respecting gay home, enough to feed something like that. I doesn't know what you're doing with your time. What do you think? He'll come home and come and sit down and I tell him who's cooking tonight. Oh, should I do? Oh, all right then. Well, he's awful, awful, awful. But you shouldn't be in house long enough. You've got to keep that alive. But really do you really believe that? I get it. I get what you're doing here on the snark level. I get it. No, I do think there's some value in this cause

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       I think that, and I think it's because gape. Look, homosexuality is a dissident apple sexuality. I mean that in a, in a morally neutral sense. You just mean it's the other. I don't know. I don't mean that in using the term correctly, but what do you mean? No, I didn't say apartment. I said, look, I'm, let's, let's set the religion stuff aside because I was going to get into a rabbit hole, but let's just say you know, what is not the norm. It is an abhorrent sexuality that Mother Nature May do for a variety of reasons, right? There's some evidence that people with higher iqs are more likely to engage in different sexual appetites is one of the reasons why gay people have disproportionately higher iqs and one of the reasons I think, for example, that guests would get back in the closet because we're making society stupider because gay people aren't reading anymore. Um, it was previously you could, you would have a marriage with a woman and you would have a couple of kids and gay men were still in the gene pool right now. They've taken themselves out and they don't have their own biological children anymore. Like you've got your sort of two to five percent of the smartest men in population not breeding in. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       What people keep saying, are we going to have kids? And I say, I don't know, but we're going to keep it. If you do, you should have your own biological children because you're smarter than most people in your lab. Did you catch that? What we're going to keep trying. Oh, see, you're so into your thing. They're being serious. All right. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       Um, yeah, no. Okay. Yeah. All right. Um, it doesn't, it doesn't work when, you know, it's, it's kind of a silly thing, but it's certainly true that the sort of average intelligence society sort of chugging up with slowly, but it is definitely being retarded. If a five to 10 percent of two to five percent rather have the smartest people in society aren't breathing anymore. So anyway, I think that's a silly argument. But, um, I, I do think there is, it's a shame when, as a gay is just one of those people that Mother Nature has selected to be different and to test stuff out and to push the boundaries, which we'll come onto in a minute. In respect to free speech, I think, um, that you sort of buy into precisely the sort of, uh, sort of socially conservative institutions, which I love and I recognize the building blocks of society. I recognize at the basis of elephants,

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       I'm fascinated

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       as a homosexual, not escapes that shouldn't have them as a homosexual. You should recognize that your, your evolutionary function is to experiment with different models of things. Right. And one of the ways in which gay culture and society has done is the sort of sex matt hedonism that I enjoy that I think I. I'm sorry that you didn't, you don't have any more because you have this horrible.

Speaker 3:          00:49:25       Well I've done. Wait, hold on. But you're combining different things here. So first off, the sense that a lot of what you're saying is you just, you long for the day probably when you were 22 and you were out every night and doing all kinds of drugs and having all kinds of. All right, so we'd last week, right? So you on for that day and a lot of, a lot of mainstream gay look, I live in West Hollywood. I see what the. So I think gay people have become very, very dull, but it's a shame isn't that? No, it's not good because we assess, we have equality.

Speaker 2:          00:49:59       No. Why would we want to be equal? We were already superior. Why would we want to go down to a quality? It's absurd to me. We, you know, we have gay people in the world, Mother Nature makes mistakes and make so great discoveries. That will be great. [inaudible] called the gate geniuses in history. You know, whether it's cheering or you know, Abe Lincoln reportedly, or you know, all the, the Roman emperors, you know, look at what Mother Nature does with these special people at the top end of the intelligence and sort of decisions a scale. Those, those, those, what steve jobs will called the crazy ones, right? And this is why the tech and gaming industry so disproportionately I'm gay and Trans because it's those special people that have brains wired slightly differently from others who could make those great leaps, who can consider problems differently, who could, who are generally more creative and more

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       what I'm with you on the music

Speaker 2:          00:50:46       as a why as a member of the game master race, would you want to slump down to the level of heterosexuality

Speaker 3:          00:50:53       because you should have the option. I'm not telling you what to do if you want the option, what I'm telling you as you made the wrong choice. Okay? So you don't think that a lot of these people that are doing all the things that I did them, all of those things, sex, drugs, all of that. I did all that. You know what I mean? I don't. I look back on much of it very fondly. Actually. People, people call me a traitor to my sexuality, Tracy Tracy,

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       at least that moment to fill. I think my agent would allow me to tell you why come to, but um, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:51:26       but wouldn't you? So the things that you, I think you're looking at this in this nostalgic way of fun, but there was the sense of, but wouldn't you trade some of that? Look, when you think about all the people that are having promiscuous sex and getting all that, are those numbers going to directly go down because

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       care about sexually transmitted diseases. Who gives a shit? I don't care about that. What I care about is the fact that this is a serious point here. It's not just the foreigner living those fun lifestyles, and I mentioned Steve Jobs earlier and he said, but much moment, many of his innovations come from the faculty took Lsd, right? Gay people have a license to experiment and license to explore. Um, and it's one of the reasons why I'm gay culture, which is so, so, um, to do with exploring boundaries, pushing the limits of acceptable discourse and speech and thought, right?

Speaker 3:          00:52:14       Those are all the things that I love that I know you don't because you slid, slid into, I'm honoring all the slit,

Speaker 2:          00:52:22       boring domesticity. It is precisely with those, put those horizon broadening experiences which you have given up as a, as a, as a housewife or house husband or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:52:30       I think two weeks of having home cooked meals and watching that for two weeks, if I wanted to enjoy myself, I want to kill myself and people call me a traitor,

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       my sexuality please. Um, no. Look, I think that gay people are one of the groups in which mother nature sort of one of the groups, Mother Nature's given license to go go wild. And that's why so many great artists and inventors and authors and all ever been gay, lesbian, whatever, right? Because we have a unique license and unique opportunity in insight into the fringes, into the that the edge of culture that makes stuff interesting. We have an ability to push further than, than ordinary people can. We can say things they can't say. For example, I can go on TV and say all manner of outrageous things about feminism only because I'm homosexual. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:53:16       Let me ask you this. Do you think I could get away with those same things? Because obviously we have a little different effect. People always say to me, you don't see gay, which I know you wouldn't able to you would you say it as compliment kind of my thing,

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       right? People know that I'm going to do this sort of social justice proof. It's very difficult to argue that a flamboyant homosexual who never shuts up about. How about, you know, black boyfriends is in any way bigoted, right? So it gives me, have established myself in the public mind, the public imagination in a way that you haven't.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       So a lot of that, ironically, that's what this is about you like while you were in some ways rail against these people that want to be protected like the feminists or whatever you do. Like

Speaker 2:          00:53:52       I enjoy using their weapons against them and I'm perfectly open to use a weapon against. I wish I didn't have too much. No, I don't want to be trolling people for my whole life. Of course I don't, you know, but I would much rather it were the case that everybody had free open frank discussion. But as the media as currently constituted, if you want to push forward to discussion outside the realms of academia in the public square talking to ordinary people. For example, I write for a publication that sort of mid Brown midmarket publication for everyone. The, the sort of Digital Media Company of a tabloid newspaper. Um, I wanna talk to everybody and to push debate forward in those environments. You do have to play by the rules and some of those rules are based on identity politics, which I think are absurd and obscene. Stupid. But I will certainly play along with them if it helps because it's so long as as progressives and feminists refused to have a debate on the base of the facts and insist on having a debate, you know, the basis of identity and skin color instead. Fine. I can beat them in that too. You know, I'm happy to beat you on any playing field on any battlefield you choose. They've chosen identity politics. I can beat them there if they ever want to come to the table and debate properly,

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       I think. I think you're onto something interesting there that you'll use their weapons. I don't like their weapons. And you're, that you're using their weapons against them. I think in a cheeky sense were you were, you know, that you're a wink to what, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       anybody who reads my twitter feed knows it's, you know, I know exactly what's up. I know what's going on, but they still lose. Anyway. Um, so,

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       so part of the reason why I wanted to do this is because I do find that again, while we come from different, we literally come from different countries but come from different political parts of this that you really, at least in American media, only get one gay, only one gay gets out there and it's the bravo gay that's either on tv because they're a Fashionista or they're a sidekick to one of the housewives or they're somehow involved in pop culture or something like that. Or every now and again someone can break free like an Anderson Cooper, but then sort of have to be completely asexual, right? Never talk about their life. And I think this is sort of interesting because we both break that, that paradigm.

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       Yes. And I think it's probably because we are cultural libertarians. I would certainly describe myself as one. I think you'd probably agree with that. I think that we are those sorts of insurgent, countercultural, new media personalities. We exist. You may not like to hear this, but we exist on a spectrum with people like trump and ann coulter, a motor. It probably only went more on the serious end of it simply in tapping into ordinary people's frustrations with the limits and absurdities of, you know, what they see on broadcast television and what they read in the newspapers. There is an alternative way of having a discussion which is more honest and more, um, more. I mean, this kind of thing could not happen on broadcast television for example. And that's a problem. That's a problem for the media. It's one of the reasons that, exactly one of the reasons everybody hates them.

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       Um, you know, and I think we both started taking advantage of that fact as far as sexuality goes. What I find interesting about, you know, a liberal and conservative homosexual agreeing on so much about authoritarianism is that from my point of view of homosexuality is where we experiment and you know, Drag Queen Culture for example, is all about pushing the boundaries of acceptable language and thought we see the threats to freedom of speech. For example, we see the authoritarian threat of coming over the horizon a long time before anybody else and we're in a position to warn other people about it. Um, and as a very serious point about this, which is not just that, you know, transsexuals to hate drag queens, which is one front in this sort of progressive fracturing because drag queens loves, you know, there's sort of no holds bar Joan River style comedy, which you know, is the essence of, of, of gay identity, sort of pushing those boundaries in experimentation and transgender people who have kind of fallen into this authoritarian mode, hate that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:57:30       It's not just, it's not just about that, it's not, it's about our community fracturing if you'd like, but it's also that we see some of the serious consequences to these infringements on, on culture because of course politics is downstream from culture and what becomes not unacceptable. Sans Politics becomes unacceptable to the. So what becomes unacceptable in culture becomes an and politics, right? Um, and we recognize and we see the warning signs. So we're sort of the canary in the coal mine. Yes. I think that's true. I think gamers did this too, you know, I think gamers engaged very, very similarly because gamers are marginalized people in many cases. I'm just proportionately ethnic minority, just fortunately gay, disproportionately transgender in my experience. Often marginalized personalities are often people who are retreating into video games maybe because they have great social skills, often very bright, sort of brilliant kind of autistic, you know, methodical.

Speaker 2:          00:58:18       I'm very male, brilliant minds and very funny, but sometimes don't have those social skills. And in that way they're quite similar to gates because they had to occupy a fairly unique position in the social hierarchy of society and I think gamers did in their own industry what gay people ought to be doing in public life, which is precisely that being a canary in the coal mine and saying, for example, that the sort of nannying hectoring language policing that's happening in progressive media today is a problem as a problem. Because, I mean, this is the first signs are the policing of gay sexuality. There's a piece in, in the daily beast I think that said that, um, men who express a racial preference on their grindr profile are racist now. It's obviously an absurd thing to say it's completely stupid and it was some idiot middle class white woman, um, who decided that she was going to police gay sexuality today just as well, you know, just as we were getting to a position of tolerance, suddenly there's someone coming up coming over the horizon to police gay sexuality. It's happening for two reasons. One, I'm gay. Men have high status in society. They become very molly cold, very celebrated in the media. So they've sort of acquired a kind of privilege and when the left, the left is constantly engaged in the business of ranking people according to their oppression rating. And Gay men don't school very well in those games because, you know, we looked, we looked good and we have money and we're know we're, we've basically become another kind of white man.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       Right. So you would say that basically the progressives, or as I'm now calling them the regressives basically you're done with the gays. Yes. Yes, that's exactly the world game sense. They were like, we're going to, we're all for it done with you now

Speaker 2:          00:59:48       with, you know, they've got your gay marriage and now you are going to find increasingly that they come off to you and they're going to come after you because you're being too racially insensitive. They're gonna come after you because you use the wrong pronouns. They're going to come after you absurdly and brilliantly for massage one. Um, you know, I mean people, people make arguments to me sometimes and they say, and it's not as credible in your case, but I can understand how we construct the argument as bonkers as is. And they make arguments that basically boiled down to your sacrum. Associates do, you went gay, um, you know, sort of, you hate, you hate women so much. I can tell why you while you sleep with men now happens to be that. I do think there's a large element of choice in my sexual orientation, although that goes entirely against a progressive consensus.

Speaker 2:          01:00:22       We'll do a whole thing on that in another show, but it's an extraordinary thing that they now coming off to gay people for being misogynistic, for being racist or sorts. Your no longer of any use to your own site, right? They have used you and they have a wedding ring on your finger. They have, they have domesticated view like they would a dog like you did your dog. They have put you in a. They have, they have made sure you got the right politics that you say the right things in public. They have domesticated and delineated. You know, I'm the sort of useful liberal gay idiots and put them all in little ghettos in cities like the Castro and West Hollywood. And now you are the product and the um, and the chattel of the, of the liberal. So I know both into you don't mean me specific. Now I do know they know I do many news, but you know that I stand for into all this. But you know, I stand again. So it a sort of gay marriage as a way of controlling gate.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Right? But I suspect that along the way, if you met the right person, you would want to marry that person for all the romance. No, I might move them into the west wing, but I wouldn't marry them. Okay. Okay. So we do have to wrap up here and the way we could have done three hours here and we're. We'll do this again for sure. At this point. I want to get to this, this piece that has been the throughline to everything we've been discussing here, this, this authoritarian, left this, this regressive piece where there have no problem relentless. Look, I could use the example of the gay rights groups here in America, you know, glad or the HRC who will relent, who will attack the pizza makers relentlessly. But we'll say nothing when gays are thrown off the roof in Iran. In Iran, right? Yeah. Kind of

Speaker 2:          01:01:57       gay speak out. You know, I'm the only guy there is. There is a sort of person in America today. Sorry to interrupt you, but there's this sort of person in America today who is a homosexual discrimination against it's gay conservatives. It was much more difficult to admit you're a gay conservative then you just met, you're gay, you're gay, you're gay, you get slaps on the back, you get applause. You get, Oh whoa. Is Me Brave? You know, all of the sick, all of the social signaling about being homosexual is positive with one. If you're a conservative other gays, the gay establishment and brainstorm notice wrote an amazing essay about this in out magazine. It's called something like in the rain and the magical gail that everybody should read. It explains how the gay establishment, which is basically now done with gays and it's sort of a self perpetuating a set of institutions to, to push leftist socialist principles. Got nothing to do with gay rights anymore. Um, we'll treat you as what you would call an uncle Tom in race terms. Um, you know, I have never in my career as a purposeful provocateur. I don't play the victim on twitter or in my columns because, you know, I think you should, if you should take as well as you gave them a rule, all gay people on quite early in life. Um, but you think that one thing

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       that's shifting,

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       yeah, it's a really long quietly. Uh, no, it's, you know, I think you should be able to take it as given. And I never played the victim, but I've never had so much really poisonous vitriolic nastiness as from other gays who think that my politics are wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       It's horrible. What did the ultimate success here? But you know, I've been arguing for a while now that by gay marriage being legal now in America, in the, in the longterm, you actually help the Republicans because this was such an idiotic issue for so many people have to vote us, is the idea that I had to vote on it. Not that, not that it was the deciding factor, but it was, I had to vote on whether I could get married. It's a fucking nonsensical and, and painful and pathetic way to vote. So I actually think ultimately this may turn into a net win for the Republicans because

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       I'm not sure that's the case now. I've written about this, and I call it minority, was the way in which, you know, if the last 10 years was about setting men and women against each other, the next 10 years about all sorts of other minorities. I mean, when the Hispanic population in the US who are not encumbered by the guilt of slavery become the, the demographic majority, you're going to see some pretty brutal policing in places like Ferguson. Um, you know, because they don't have the same kind of white middle class guilt about, uh, about, you know, black lives matter. They weren't, you know, Hispanic mayors in barely a few generations. I'm not going to be paying multimillion dollar settlements to black families. They're gonna be sending police in with guns. Um, you know, it's, it's, there's all sorts of horrible things on the horizon and it's driven by the identity politics of the left, which are crumbling but not fast enough. My serious point about all of this is that cultural libertarianism or should I keep banging on about, which I think is what we've sort of what we've been talking about, which is a word that I'm glad is catching on with people. Can we just do it?

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       I know you named a few of them before, but if from the article that I saw on Breitbart, I know that it was a brilliant article. We'll link to it. It wasn't like either way, but. But can we just name a couple of these people? I know you named a few, but Bill Maher was included.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       Chris rock is in there even though he does rely a lot on his, on his blackness as a source of his comedy. He noted that he is somebody, for example, who's spoken up about the political correctness or colleges and college campuses and says you won't perform for students anymore because they're too touchy. I think he understands this. I think Eli Roth, the, uh, the horror director, Adam Baldwin, who's a sort of a fancy actor and um, he said, I'm not with the Gamergate stuff. And then you've got the way these things normally work because you've got sort of vanguard of hell races like me and Katie Hopkins in the UK and Coulter perhaps here, um, now that all those, those three happened to be right wing. But I don't think it's, I don't think you can play well that thing you can place people in the political spectrum.

Speaker 2:          01:05:33       And that's why I wanted you to mention some of the names because what I liked about the article was that these people were from all over. I think the hell raisers tends to be a conservative today simply because the establishment is liberal. Right? And I think that's why then a further behind that you've got the more politically ambiguous figures like Christina Hoff summers at the American Enterprise Institute or Cathy young feminist journalist, um, who aren't so easy to place politically. Kathy's definitely a liberal, I think Christina is. Christina is a registered Democrat, in fact, um, you know, but who nonetheless recognize the excesses and they sort of in the wake of the chaos created by the hell raisers that people like me kind of winding people up and being, you know, sort of viciously teasing people I consider to be dangerous and damaging and whatever. Leave half of it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       But you're throwing bombs. No, no, no. I believe all of it. I believe all of it, but I'm perfectly happy to accept that I will say at the most productive way possible. Um, because I think the only responsible, the only appropriate response to outrage culture is to be outrageous. You know, if you're going to tell me that I can't make jokes about, about skin color, I will come back at you, you know, with, with 10 poems about me being obsessed with black penises or whatever. You know, for the record, you brought a six foot six black porn star.

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       I hired, I hired a black porn star just because it would annoy the right people to be my bodyguard because I get. But I get death and bomb threats everywhere I go. And I didn't make a big song and dance about accept to laugh at how stupid it is when I didn't believe any feminist bomb threats ever going to be credible. They're kind of in Tyler and shoelaces together, let alone wire a detonator. I'm not worried about getting blown up by feminists. Um, what I, what I, uh, am worried about is the chilling effect that they have on free speech. And just get back to the point. Yeah, I'm gay people, I think, and I think this is something in which you and I are united, uh, having privileged access if you'd like to, you know, the limits of acceptable speech and discourse. There's that great, that great drag Queen Joke, you know, which I love from, uh, from Britain, which always gets shocks and a national newspaper wouldn't let me publish, which was, um, she comes on stage and she says, you're like my new hair.

Speaker 2:          01:07:30       It's called the Whitney black and died in the bath. And we will get, sort of horrified. But yeah, it gave, gave people live and love though, you know, that sort of stuff. And we see before everybody else, you know, what the serious consequences of this sort of chilling effect on free speech can be and those consequences are, there's, you know, the sum total of human human knowledge and whatever, you know, starting to be caught off. Js mill classical liberal is unconscionable to modern feminism. They don't believe some of the central tenants of know on which British society was built. This is dangerous stuff. It's dangerous stuff because of what's happening in universities too. I mean, just look at the sorts of, you know, look at the, the feminists hegemony, you know, women's studies departments that, you know, that run rampant on campuses. Yale, I don't know if this, I hope

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       this is true and I'm not, I'm misremembering this, but I saw something, you know, Deray Mckesson, the black lives matter. This guy is teaching a course at Yale and defensive looting, you know, all this kind of stuff. This is a weird, crazy. So tweet about that. I don't know if it's real, we'll see. But the women's studies suffered, you know, many decent universities is scary. It's denying human knowledge is making people. And been this stuff makes it to government policy regarding match. You're not just talking about women's studies though, because this is coming from all over the place, like Berkeley Protesting Bill Maher coming as a progressive ISM. Generally. I have a, I've just seen, I'm supposed to speak at USC tomorrow night and I've just seen, um, you know, this horrendous blog post from somebody who says that I'm a sort of misogynistic hate speech much. And because I made a joke about, I didn't know what it was.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       It's probably some joke like, you know, feminist barbies just come out when you pull the cord. It says math is hard. Let's lie about rape. Um, you know, some, some joke like that, you know, and they. And they picked me out some sort of misogynistic worth their words. People. I think that the takeaway and that that's really where I sort of wanted to end this with you because yeah, we can. Everything I've tried to do with this show so far is show that you can disagree with people and we can, we can go back and argue the tenants of feminism or whether I think you're right or wrong about men being oppressed or, or, or the, the gay marriage thing, all those things, uh, but, but allow the conversation to happen and I think that's what's happening and that's what the cultural libertarians they were talking about are trying to do. We're trying to have the conversation. So I appreciate you coming in and I want to thank my guest, Milo Yiannopoulos were dropping by. You can check out his work over@Breitbart.com. Follow them on twitter. It's at Nero. I, by the way, make sure to tag me in all the hate tweets because I know there's going to be a lot of them. It's at Rubin report and we'll do this again next.
