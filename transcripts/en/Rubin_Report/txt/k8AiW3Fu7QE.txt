Speaker 1:          00:00:05       You guys know that I try my best to stay out of the day to day political bickering and focus more on big ideas and the philosophies which are behind all the fighting. This doesn't mean I'm ignoring the issues of the moment, be it North Korea, the gun debate or the general state of Trumpism, but focusing on why people believe what they believe is far more valuable to me than adding fuel to the fire of whatever the story of the day might be. Toss in a healthy dose of political gridlock and we seem to have lots of people who were yelling, but very few people who are doing. There's one issue happening in American politics right now, which is a great example of the stagnation we face, but that is totally flying under the radar right now. Dozens of countries, some of them key strategic allies don't have us ambassadors because the Senate has refused to vote on their confirmation.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       According to the rules of the Senate right now, the Senate needs 30 hours of debate to confirm an ambassadorship. You can imagine with all the nonsensical waste in DC, how impossible it would be to spend 30 hours debating each of the new ambassador ships. When a new administration comes in, we'd be talking about literally thousands of hours of debate for a branch of government which can't seem to agree on which flavor of yogurt should be served at the capital hill commissary. Back in 2014 when the Democrats controlled the Senate, then majority leader, Harry Reid used what is known as the nuclear option to get many Obama appointees through the Senate in effect read, change the rules so that a simple majority rather than a 60 vote super majority would be enough to confirm ambassadors, federal judges, and other positions. Though I was firmly on the left at the time and I had no issue, I can remember with the Obama appointees, I was against read using such a drastic tactic.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       To me, if you change the rules when you're in power, it's incredibly obvious and probably quite deserved when those same rules will be used against your team. When you're not in power, you can rightly blame Republicans for not voting. On the Obama appointees in 2014, just as right now, you can rightly blame Democrats for not voting on trump appointees in 2018. This is exactly why people rightfully hate the political machine in Washington. It either does nothing or it changes the rules to suit itself while usually leaving the people it's supposed to serve far behind the Republicans now led by majority leader, Mitch Mcconnell could use what is known as the nuclear option right now just as Reid and the Democrats did back in 2014. For whatever reason though, McConnell refuses to do so. Some were saying he has such an old school affinity for the rules of the Senate that he doesn't want to stoop to what reed did in a certain way.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       This seems like a principled position, but at this point in American politics, I wonder if clinging onto the old ways while your ideological opponents chisel away at those very institutions at every opportunity makes much sense at all. Let me add another wrinkle to the story. The highest ranking ambassadorship that we now have open Germany has been offered to former US spokesmen for the UN, Richard Grenelle. Richard is the longest serving UN spokesman in history, working for four different US ambassadors. He's also served several other positions in the government as well as worked for a few other high level political campaigns by every measure. He's supremely qualified and I've seen plenty of people on both sides of the aisle that praise him as the exact type of person that we need more of in politics. Richard and I have become friends over the past few years and I can personally tell you that he's truly a decent guy who just wants to serve his country.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       Oh, and there's one other piece to this. Richard happens to be gay. You may remember back in 2012, Richard was briefly a spokesman for the Romney campaign until the media decided to attack an openly gay man for daring to work for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney thus causing Richard to step down from the campaign because he didn't want to be a distraction apparently. Although Romney felt it was just fine to hire a gay man, and Richard felt it was totally okay to work for Romney. The media just wouldn't let it be gay conservatives like Richard, much like black conservatives like Larry elder or female conservatives like Nikki Haley, challenge the orthodoxy that the Democrats must own all of these groups of people I mentioned Richard Sexuality, not because it's important or even relevant, unless you play the identity politics game as so many do. In effect, the Democrats are blocking and extremely qualified openly gay men from serving his country aren't the Democrats and left these supposed to be for gays.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       Isn't that part of their intersectional worldview? Immutable characteristics, often trump qualifications. If you subscribe to this line of thinking, shouldn't. This also means supporting gay people whose political positions you might disagree with because you believe in their ability to think for themselves or perhaps the so called tolerance side really isn't pro gay or pro any minority. They are actually only pro those who believe as they do now, obviously you know that I don't think anyone should be confirmed because of their sexuality, nor should their sexuality matter in the least when it comes to being nominated in the first place. I just think that this particular cases interesting on so many levels. We have the gridlock of Washington with Democrats refusing to vote on trump nominees. We have a majority leader, Mcconnell that refuses to use his option to confirm nominees even though the previous Senate leader, Reid did exactly just that. We have dozens of qualified candidates waiting to do their civic duty and we have just as many countries waiting for our ambassadors to move there and get to work cotton. All of this mess is a good man, Richard Grinnell, who I happen to know personally who doesn't want extra credit for being gay, but just wants to get to work. How can you make a difference in all this? Call your local senator and ask their assistant at the office

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       why they are in voting on these nominees and you can also call Mitch Mcconnell at his DC office by calling two. Oh, two, two, two, four, two, five, four, one. Actually, I'm going to give him a call right now.

Speaker 2:          00:06:15       Joining me today as a guy who seen an awful lot of people get hit in the nuts, a man who's lived in a house that constantly seems to be getting fuller and a standup comic who's new. Special zero to 60 is now streaming on Amazon. Bob Saget, welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you. I'm excited to be here. You're a very smart man. I cannot keep up with you mentally, but we did have dinner and I seem to keep up with the entrees. Is that why you were applying me with so much alcohol during dinner to kind of dumb me down, so I just said that we could get on the level. I wanted to see what you were like unconscious. Yeah, we did go because that's the world we're in right now. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Opposite day kind of statement. In other words, years ago when you would say, I want to see what your unconscious.

Speaker 2:          00:06:58       That would be a joke, but unfortunately we are in a world right now where that's actually happened. So a lot of things that are a reverend and could be considered funny or not. And so there's this buffering that goes on before, but either way you did not get overly inebriated and you were more than pleasant. And we had a lovely night with both of our significant others who we both adore and we laughed and we had good food. Yeah, we will do it again. We will do it again. And that's all I want to talk about. Talking about my career. What do we have his entree, I believe. Uh, I had the fish. You did. I think you had something not as healthy. I think it was. Maybe you had some kind of chicken. So I'm to maybe. Alright, let's focus here and say I get.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       So I'm here. That's a good place to start. What you just did there. Just the state of political correctness. Let's just do a little bit on that. And then I want to do saget one-on-one. Alright. For this next hour, I'm teaching that course at a community college. How many kids are taking it? It doesn't matter. Whoever applies. That doesn't turn me in. I'm all in. Everybody comes in to the trailer. What do you think of a that you're doing this? We're live to tape so we don't edit and this did not exist four years ago. This existed, but it didn't exist like this. I mean, you've got millions of people that watch this. Yeah. This is crazy. Well, what do you think about that? Like you're used to doing. I mean obviously I went to stand up and everything else, but you do scripted series, you guys, you do movies, things like that, but you also do you do panel on talk shows, things that are sort of, they're kind of old school now.

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       Like that's very different than coming in here and right before we start I said to you, we're just going to go for it. And you were like, whatever you want. I mean, I don't have to look. I can just do that and we're, we're, you can. Yeah. Well you get a little bit back again and better. Those are the smallest cards I've ever seen your interviews on. Microfiche. It's just, I just write little silly things or. No, that looks all smart. Um, I, I love the fact that this exists because years ago, if you wanted to go on a show and have a one on one with someone, it was, you were a baby, but it was Tom Snyder and we'd be getting that, uh, that you might be tiny bit older than a baby. The camera was always very close to, is incredibly close and Dan Akroyd on Saturday night live and the very beginning we do an impression of it was this tight and he would be smoking and Tom and just talking to camera do is discourse which is very much like a podcast is today.

Speaker 2:          00:09:22       Like bill burr friend of mine gets up in the morning, talks for an hour once a week. It's unbelievable to listen to a lot of our great podcasters. That's the, everything has changed. And in that regard, this has changed for the better because you get to have an articulate conversation, um, that you can't normally have in commercial television because commercial televisions meant to be entertaining. Yeah. Only I don't know what we're meant to be over here. Well, interesting. Interesting. I guess. Yeah. And my fiance, Kelly turned me onto your show and um, I said I really like him and I like what he's talking about. And you had guests on and you wherever you're able to be a diplomat, a, which is very difficult to do when you have people with different points of view. A conservative and a liberal, which I don't understand. I don't understand any of it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       I mean I understand it, but I mean we're mammals, whereas opposed to alive, we're supposed to be nice to another mammal, I suppose to hunt it and kill it depends which kind of mammal you are. If it's delicious then you have to go for it. Yeah. Just food. Well we're gonna we're gonna dive into all that because I did notice that for you it's interesting I think because your standup is so different than your, your television persona between Americans money. So the video is in full as well that the old ones. But then entourage that was Kinda like a thing. But then. But then I did a bunch of acting stuff too. And I've done Broadway work, which was, some of it was similar to my standup, but I've always done some mean that's every seven years. There's some new incarnation that people go, who the hell is he?

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       Yeah, well that's why I think it's interesting because especially with celebrities, people like to just get an or anyone that's public that they like to just get a kind of image of you and then just run with that forever and challenging that. I refuse to be pigeonholed because it sounds like something you should not do to little pigeon now. See that's the kind of joke you guys still do. You still do that because it's not a human being. It's a pigeon, but the only people that are going to be really upset about that would be the humane society and they are right. They spcas all over the show. They're just. I don't see their name anywhere anymore. I think they're out. You think they're done? I don't know. I think it's the Aas, PCA, NRA. I think it's a combined so that you take care of the bird and then you fire at it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Is that going to fly well on this show? I think it will know we've got those chickens out there in one day. People always ask me, what are you going to do when they stop laying eggs or you just wait a minute, but they're so beautiful. I thought they were males because they had the red millet. Millay millay was to call you. We're very excited to say Kako. I said you have three beautiful Cox, but no, those are actually. Those are female hens that lay eggs and what are you doing this for? The eggs, not just as woody Allen, which was Groucho Marx. I need the eggs and the eggs, but that's the truth. Andy Hall. That's the right. Go ahead. I. This is a problem with me as a talk show guest. As a comedian. Yeah, and as someone without a script, I free associate and I sometimes do not stay on track, but you were so smart and linear.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       You were going to keep me on track and I will do my very best to accommodate you and I will do my best to accommodate. You said, okay, this is fair. Let's start at the beginning. You were born in Philadelphia? I was, yeah, in Einstein Hospital. Einstein hospital. And it's still there. Is that an honor of Albert Einstein? It is. It is. And it's on broad street and uh, and I was born there and my dad worked for a supermarket company called Food Pantry, pride supermarkets. And he was an executive. That all sounds legit. What about your family? What, what background? What business were they in? I was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Long Island, lived in Manhattan my whole life. Went to college, upstate New York. So I'm a true New Yorker. So we're both. You had the life I wish I had. I was in Philly. I lived at home during college.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       You had it. You had. This is why you are smart. And I go out and tell a bunch of wiener jokes. I know, but I'm going back into that now. As you know, you are, you're out doing stand up. I told you I'm going back into standup. You were very excited. I'm excited. You also told me you were playing the Irvine Improv and when is that? Oh, that wasn't even public just now. That's great. Is that okay to say that April eighth, April my first headlining Gig in 10 years. And this is one of the nicest clubs in Los Angeles and in, in, in anywhere really. I mean it's, it's like 600 people, 700 people. It looks like a spaceship. It looks like a Disney exhibit and it's um, it's an irvine, which is why they call it the Irvine Improv and couldn't put that together. Why do they call it the Irvine Improv and there's spit, I don't know, but they're smart people and uh, and then nice people.

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       Maybe you will bring some more people because you have so many people that you will bring your audience, which is, that's the advantage of what we do and whatever we do, whatever media we're on, that's who comes to see us. That's got to be the most beautiful shift in comedy. Right. Do you remember that moment when you went from being a guy that was just trying to get on eight out of 10 comics at the end of the night? Nobody knows who you are. Do you remember the beginning of when people were going, I'm going to see Bob Saget. Something weird happened with me, which was I started doing standup when I was 17 and I want to hear that. That was a re heal. Who uh, the 70, 73. Wow. So because I'm 104 on the freeway. Head of hair though for $100. Not Bad. No. Very impressed. But I had to do the drops.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       I take the thing. I take propecia that's supposed to take on the probation. He seems fine. Oh, please don't compare me to that. That's the hair. We'll get there. We'll get my. It's not a comb over. I know it's going to happen if we get right on trump. I actually, I, I, I believe, but I don't want to. I'm not doing. I'm not doing anything to bash anyone. I will not do it even though it's possible that his comb-over is from an onion in the kitchen that just snaggle tooth along the ground and then crawls up his back. Did you see that moment when I saw that video on the airplane that done CGI? Was that done with effects because that didn't look possible? It looks pretty. It looked pretty fake. But let's, let's put trump aside. I want to talk stand. Yes, because. Do you remember that moment when, when things change?

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       Yeah. What happened was I came out to la. I went on, I had one, the Student Academy Award for a documentary I made about my nephew who had his face reconstructed, um, when he was seven and I won this student Academy Award for documentary and then I went on at the comedy store the next night and Mitzi the owner of the comedy store. So you should work here. So I started getting spots right away. Wow. And then I started a fight for that. People fight and I didn't work the door. Wow. And I was, I guess the likable but strange, very strange jokes. Like my first joke was I have the first show, I have the brain of a German shepherd and the body of a 16 year old boy and they're both in my car and I want you to see them now. It's just an odd rambling, but it symbolizes, I think it answers the question of how did he become this because he was that you're going to be third person.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       I myself, but um, and then I started going on a college tour. She put me on a Mitzi shore for the comedy store, put me on a college tour and I was a guitar act just to parodies and I would sing while my guitar gently weeps, turn a valve and water poured out of the guitar and you could only see it in the first 10 rows. So it doesn't really work for the big stadium. CanNot play the Irvine Improv with this bit. Yeah. And then I was headlining right away. So in my early twenties, I'd go out on the road while I was taking five years of acting classes with a teacher named Darryl Hickman and La while I was doing improv classes at the groundlings while I was doing spots at the comedy store. I'd go out on the road and then headline and then make money.

Speaker 2:          00:17:26       Um, but not enough to get a career. And then it was like eight, nine years of hosting the comedy store in Westwood and that was hard. It was, but I got to be friend people that I worshiped, which were Richard Pryor and Robin Williams and David Letterman was one of my first emcees and, and so I was 22 years old and the place was packed like it was then kind of now bad sentence. But in the early eighties it was you could not get into any room and every single person on the lineup was like. And I was hosting a lot of the shows, so, uh, but then everybody went off and got tv shows and I was still at the comedy store hosting and thinking, this is it. I'm never going to make it. And then I got an, a Richard Pryor movie and then I got on a cbs show and a morning show or movie a critical condition.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       Oh, I've seen that on the young Dr Jaffe who does all the jobs that are disgusting that he doesn't want to do because he's not a real doctor. It sounds like the emcee at a comedy club. Exactly the same thing, you don't want to touch people and um, I remember holding Garrett Morris from Saturday night live by the testicles and Richard kept calling me, kept telling me to squeeze harder and that was a reshoot. They added me to that scene. I can see them when you talk about it sort of, and I've had this with a couple of other comics that were around at that time. There's like a real nostalgia for it. Do you remember thinking it was a special that was yet, but you remember it at the time thinking like, I'm really in 100 percent because usually people don't like the good old days. You only remember them as well.

Speaker 2:          00:19:04       They weren't good old days. Yeah, because you know, you're, you're in a place that is, you know, in the comedy stars a lot of history and it Ciro's is the main room and there's supposed to be ghosts in there and Sam Kennison says Esau quarter floating in the air of a dead mobster or something. And I believe all of it. Um, I spent a lot of time in there, uh, and it was struggling, you know, you'd have people come and see you. Rodney dangerfield was kind to me, put me on a young comedian special, but it was all, you know, what I was the warmup comic for Bosom Buddies with Tom Hanks and Gary and um, it was all struggling, you know, but, but you need it. But, and I used to wait in line in New York at him at the Improv and catch a rising star for 10 hours a sign.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       The lineup sheet. We'll wait for 10, 12 hours. And I think there's something if you come out of the Dugout, if you really are the trenches are dug outs fine. You're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna bat maybe. But, um, but if you come out of the trenches and you, you go through it, it's almost, oh, guy had a heart attack of the audience. I've had that happen before, you know, oh, this guy's getting thrown. Oh, this guy's got a gun. Oh yeah, yeah. That happened to me in Cleveland. I remember that. It gets to the point where you're almost a pilot on a plane, you know, it's like, I'm ready for anything, but when you want to do is make people laugh. And that was the hardest transition for me was to take off the guitar and to learn to be a comedian.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       And um, so I. What was that moment like for you? Really hard. Um, I had a guitar on for like four years. I took it off and um, I bombed for a long time. I would do it. I used the club for what it was supposed to be used for, but it didn't surprise me. It didn't help me get a sitcom if people saw me and they went, he's amicable but he's not funny and I was trying to do jokes and a lot of them were. There was a talent coordinator for the tonight show I could never get on as a comic. I got on to do panel with Johnny Carson, thanks to Gary Shandling for putting me on the first time. And then Jay Leno, I was on once with him but that I was on with carson 13, 14 times. And then in and always panel, but I never went on as a comedian because this talent coordinator who passed on named Jim Mccauley who helped a lot of people's careers, um, except mind.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       But he did help me in a way. He said you're very funny, but your act is like a stone skipping on the water. It never really digs in. Oh, thank you. Wow. That's something to really take Kung Fu. Wow. Thank you. Master. Take the pebble from my hand. So it, it hurt me because I couldn't get on the damn show, but I wasn't, I really wasn't meant to. I mean, I hate to say those kinds of words, you know, it's not meant to be or whatever, but it was hell of a lot better to sit there and todd, a couple of segments with Johnny Carson and him like me and be able to talk to a guy that you looked up to so much because he was kind of a master like that. Like I'm emanating true jealousy. Whenever I hear any of you guys talk about Carson, it's like that.

Speaker 2:          00:22:21       And I'm not even making this up because I'm not delusional. He liked me and I still can't figure that out. But I would go, I would say something like, and I, David Letterman had a lot of his amazing qualities and it would respond the same way to this because one of my patterns that I would say is, this is true. And Johnny would go, I don't care. I don't care if it's true, just tell it wouldn't be the same thing would go on letterman. And I would go, this is true. He goes, I don't care if it's true or not. It just make it funny. Just say it. I'm blanking on the title of Bill Maher's first book, the novel that he wrote about standup. Um, but the first line in it, he says something about this is true, which is exactly what a comic says when they were about to tell you something false.

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       Correct. And that's how that, that's how the novel the Hell is the name of the book. I'll get it in a second. You should know I should. This guy should I know him. I saw a picture, a, we are deleted in reading each other's books. He has a red mine. Either. True story is the name of the book. Oh, true story. That's a bread. And also think about this, but seriously folks, that is the segue into your next job, our bob hope. I want to tell you. So anyway, that's always good. But these are all the same anyway, so I'm in the car. We, you do learn tricks and it's always, if you can kill them with kindness or if you can fake sincerity with air guys during that because everyone, everyone talks about. It's like you could, we could literally spend the next hour with you just naming all stars, right?

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       You can just do that. But were there guys drop name drop for the next and they, it'll be very easy to make a promo. I'll do that. Professor Irwin Corey. See? No one will know that. Well I know, but yeah. But um, but were there guys that you thought were true? Bill Hicks transcendent? Yeah. So it of like Bill Hicks, that's transcendent. Yeah, that's the guy who a worship Sam Kennison, who was a friend of mine. I got Ms. I got Sam is for a spot at the comedy store. Was it in the documentary? No, but, um, he was, he was an unusual thing. It was an anomaly. It was, no one had ever seen that before. And Bill Hicks really thought about why are we here? And um, had a sweet philosopher in him, had, it was a, a gentle George Carlin kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:47       That was it. I mean, from a gentler version I did because I, I knew him, he, he and he was kind of, I knew him when he was really young. I met him when he was like 18 or something or 19 and he hated it. He kind of took to me and, and um, his loss was very sad. It would have loved to have seen what he would have arrived at. Yeah. If he'd been, he died very young. He was, that's the type of conduct we need more of. Right. Especially now like thoughtful, but guys that are really saying something like being, you know, I'm getting back in, so maybe I'll find them all like, well, you can't help but reckoned with Chappelle. I mean the demand is, you know, he's also arguably the best living stand up and remind you of Richard was at that time, the best living standup might be still.

Speaker 2:          00:25:40       I'm lenny. Bruce was decomposed by being arrested by not being allowed to have freedom of speech. George Carlin took it to another level where he said, I'm cutting my hair no more and I'm going to let myself say the things that are on my mind and was a lot of anger and a lot of prophecy and people. My Mother didn't like him because he was unkempt. Yeah. She wanted to kempt person. She would have loved you very much. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if every camp I'm very. It's a lot of hairspray and she wasn't. She's so smart and he's handsome. Outright Zagat enough to tell you what my mother would say. Carlin having that moment. That's like you putting down the guitar. Right. That's why I think it's. I think it's interesting when either get good or not. It's when you make that move you like, you like learn something and then you kind of start all over again because you get the, you get some chops, you figure out what it's like to be in front of people.

Speaker 2:          00:26:32       Um, and then it's not an effort. It's a pleasure. Yeah. I, um, I'm going to be 62 in May, which is crazy. So if you could delay this, that would be great. It's not letting that happen yet, but I'm able to go on stage and I had a gift. Now having a special just done that. I'm very proud of this. Zero to 60, which is from zero to being 60th. Brilliant title wordy. And it's on Amazon prime. So my joke is he was a joke with it. With two clicks you can buy the lotion to watch the special inferring that that's how aroused you'll get watching my special can, you know, I retweeted your special the other day and then I think you deleted the tweet and I thought, what, what happened here? Did you make a mistake in your tweet? I did, I made a mistake in my tweet and then I was like, oh, well we do it again.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       Let's see how the rest of this goes. Okay. I know, I understand if you don't want to. So let's not get ahead of those. I'll show myself out. Uh, but. But I, um, yeah, I, I put something wrong on there because it's, it's on many mediums. It's not, it's not a Netflix special, but it's on every platform. So it's on a spectrum. DIRECTV, Google. So it's never been done like this till now where they put it on every, on demand. So it's like you can choose between wonder woman or zero to 60. Hmm. Let me think. I'd much rather watch Bob than wonder woman. That's pretty cool though that because right. We all, in the old days, everyone just wanted the HBO special. I mean, I remember the day I started standing up, I was like, I'm going to have an hbs. I wanted one of my God.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       Now you can have all sorts of other things. There's many different ways. And, and Netflix is kind of the jewel in the crown. So it was hbo, but they mostly have a few new people, but mostly they're regular team members know bill or George Lopez of course, who is just wonderful. I just like George. But um, this has been a really cool model. I'm being on Amazon. Prime is actually in the world, has it. I just wanted it to be seen by as many people. That's how I stumbled about this thing. Let's just get it out. This, this is seen by everybody I would think. Right? As long as youtube. Let's get to the feed and Youtube and now. So every person that subscribes, you make money. No. You do make money is they roll ads on this. We make money. But you made a roll ads on this.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       It depends on what we talk about. Say you may be deemed too controversial too. I'm not controversial on fuller house. That's on Netflix is a very family oriented show. What do you need to sell? What product but help you make money on this. Will you know, whatever they want to lay in before this. I don't care what they put in before. That's the funny thing. No one associates the ad with the content, you know, so they just want me not to say anything offensive so that the advertiser won't say, okay, say I get talked about whatever, like a fabric softener because any one of those sheets, that's like a good thing. I would love that fabric. I like fabric soft. It's great stuff. We did in and said to me what a bounce you have on your jacket when it was perfect, perfect outfit and we compliment each other.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       I feel good about this. I think it's. I think it's. I think we're crushing. This is full house thing. Hit it. Had not heard of it until I did a little research for this. Right? Apparently it was a big sitcom. Yes it was. It was for eight years and I didn't know either. I just knew I had a place to go to work and that I would paid for kids private school. So I told you this when, when we had dinner a couple weeks ago, but my sister was, she's nine years younger than me. She was so, and I know you hear this all the time, but she was so obsessed with that show that we were never allowed to watch TV at dinner. My family, that was it. We would sit and, and have a good time or a bad time or argue or laughed or whatever, but my sister at some point took control of the family and suddenly full house was being watched during dinner.

Speaker 2:          00:30:36       Right. She loves stamos. Everyone loves statement. Yeah, that's true. Everyone loves statement. No. Tell me a little bit about getting in on that and how that differed from standup and then suddenly even though you had studied acting and all that, but just like doing something that was so different. Completely different. Um, I'd always wanted to be on a sitcom. I'd been around them, you know, I'd, as I said, I was a warmup bosom buddies or go visit Robin doing mork and Mindy. I would sneak into happy days. I snuck into the Bob Newhart show. I was under age. It had to be 16 or 17. I snuck into Mary Tyler Moore. I would watch them filming these shows. James l Dot Brooks, uh, producing Mary Tyler Moore show, unbelievable. And I saw Bob Newhart last night, had the name drop once to know when we can go to dinner, didn't mention you as don rickles, that, that is a direct lift of the kind of thing he would say.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       I mean, that's perfection that really is kind of very professional. He would say something like somebody very famous, you know, I saw someone last night, I saw, I saw Chris rock last night, didn't mention to you, just so you know, they could make it now just because of the way we are about. He was making it in an, as a, as a new young comedian. Impossible. Um, but there's a new way to do it, which is a way of love. And some people do it. So people will make fun of everyone. My friend Jeff Ross is the postmaster general, um, you know, there, there are ways to bash people, but it's turned mean. And what happened is, and this is an understatement, you know, the roast. I was roasted on comedy central, but I had John Stamos was the roast master. I had all my friends were there, I got to pick who was on it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Most people don't. You know, Justin Bieber Roast, no one knows him. Most of the people and people think roasting people is supposed to be mean and it's a it. If it doesn't come out of kindness and love of the person or just blind, I'm going to attack them, but there's no attachment of anger to this. It's just evil. It's just wrong. And we're in a society where people will, they'll hit you back on a tweet, they'll watch something, you will see people on the news, you'll listen to political leaders talk, you'll hear people bash each other back and forth, and it comes from Don rickles thinking that that's what he did. That's not what the man did. The man would, would just, you know, see a man and a woman in the audience and say, is this your wife? And the guy would go yes and dom and go, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       And that's just a but and his age has something to do with it, but also his tenacity and his. And he started in the lounge two in the morning, doing three shows til five in the morning and talk about the trenches and all love. So if someone comes out and makes fun of people and does it out of love or does it at a truth, that's the safest way we're at right now. That's where the Chappelle thing comes through. That's where you look at certain people. I really enjoy Mark Marin a lot. And um, Bill Burr, um, I mean there's so many people that are so good, um, that, that some people don't even know about that sell out places constantly that are just like Brian Regan and it's just, he's so. He's brilliant. I mean, he cares three, two hours. It was like, what? And it's clean. Or you go see Seinfeld do what he does and you go, that's why he's Jerry side because it's not just words Smith, he's connected to everything he did. It might be word for word in some ways, but another night. But my God, it's fun and you know, and then I'll, you know, I love anybody who is funny who just is there to entertain people and it's not only about them, which is hard because we're a very narcissistic group.

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       Right. I mean comics are particularly, there's a certain breed of craziness, right. That comes to comedy. The best line I ever heard about that was, was, I've mentioned this a few times, George Carlin on the view once and he's sitting there with all the women around him and he's talking about, you know, he was given, he was, he was selling or they had just come out with like this anthology. So that's what he was there for. But he said something about how to be a good comic you have to have a ton of shit. Like you have to have all this pain and all this angst and all this stuff. But then at some point you got to conquer it because otherwise it will conquer you. And that's why so many comics die of drug overdoses and all this other stuff. Yeah. But if you can own it, then you could be 62. And

Speaker 2:          00:35:23       why are you doing? I don't know if I'm made doing standup at nine, but I'll be doing forms of it. You couldn't stop even if you wanted to write. I could not stop working. I, I just directed this movie, Benjamin, which I'll talk about at length in the third hour, our interview. But, but I have to leave after hour or two. But you're welcome to. I'm going to stay. We're just going to keep going. It's just gonna be me and the camera. But, but I, I love working without it. I, I, I'm an artist. Uh, and it sounds so fruity. Pebbles to say that, but I just am and I always will be and I'll be making whether it be directing or writing or performing. I love acting. There's no limit as long as you can stand and walk and bend and remember things, you know, it, you know, not fall into an open trunk.

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       The memory one goes first because now there's guys on Broadway, they're using ips. I was going to say id ib is going to look at the intercontinental missiles. Yeah. Not those. No, no. That has been known and I hopefully will live long enough that had 92 years old. I'll be on Broadway and I'll have an earwig in and they'll feed me the lines and I don't care if I'm good, if it's done right. I saw Peter O'toole and Amanda plummer and my Fair Lady, the most miscast version of my fair lady on Broadway. And I think he had a thing in his ear. He was no child when he did it. Playing that character is very fascinating because my fair lady, which is a play, I don't know if people are familiar, but um, sometimes the audience could use a little tiny bit older, but it's not a millennial's favorite, but you know, she is pygmalion, which of course loses more people.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       Gen x doesn't even follow pygmalion, but it, what's amazing about it is he's 40 years older than her. Uh, no matter how you play that play. Yeah. That is a musical. Was Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn. He's 40 years older than her. He is maybe 50, but he's 60 and she's 20 and that's that and he's trying to make her a classy woman. The chauvinistically misogynistic, unacceptable way. And it is one of the best musicals ever written for people that don't know. That was the original premise of. Or that was the original inspiration of pretty woman. Right, right. That is true. I'm not making that up. No, you're not. No, you're not usually trying to make it honest woman out of, uh, an honest hooker. Yeah. Alright. Let's talk about this whole house thing. So that right from honest hooker. Hooker's you did it. I was going to let you drop one of the girls names, but.

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       Okay. So. All right. So then you'd suddenly, you're on television. Everyone knows who you are, what a lot of money is such a good edit point. No, we don't. I've got offered the job. Yeah. Uh, I was fired from a morning program on CBS, which was against Good Morning America today show for being too hot for morning TV. They had another actor play the character of Danny Tanner. Um, I always feel bad about that. The pilot we shot with the pilot we shot with someone else makes me sad, but the same producers and other people in this business have done that before with many, many shows. Robin Williams was not the first work to perfect strangers. Was was not a Mark Lynn Baker. It was, there was a gay housekeeper in the pilot episode of the Golden Girls. That guy got the boot I, but that's what I played on full house anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       But I ended up with the part because I was fired and they made it available for me. And I'm Jeff Franklin. The exec producer wanted me originally for it and Bob boy yet. And Tom Miller who still produced fuller house. Um, it's a complicated thing. Show business. It is so complicated. All you want to do is entertain a bunch of people. And then all of this stuff happens. And I played a character because I want it to be on three men and a baby had just come out. And we were talking about that before we were rolling on this. Fantastic show is we saw the Gutenberg a dinner that night out of. We did see the Gutenberg and he brings his Bible and he went over almost. He had to, he had the fish and he had enough for everyone and the water. Guess what it turned it to.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       Anyway, I'm sorry. So this, this part was something that I wanted in three men and a baby with Steven and Ted Danson and um, uh, yeah, uh, I had just come out and so we were that we were Dave and John David again. John Demos were already diapering Ashley and Mary Kate and I was not in those scenes. So they reshot the pilot and all of a sudden the show ABC fought to keep it on. Doesn't happen like that anymore. They, they put it on twice a week. It ran on Tuesdays, didn't run on Fridays and then they started to run it twice a week for awhile and then they ordered more episodes and it wasn't doing very well, but they believed in it and we were on against Seinfeld, which also wasn't doing very well. Right. That. So that's around what, like 89 90 now at 87. 80 eight. Oh Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       Yeah. Yeah. So then 89 is yes, we're not doing well. And then after four years we started to do well, we switched studios from Sony because I know people want to give their demographics right on Google maps to warner brothers to be on the same stage exactly where fuller house has done now. That's ended the last four years there. And then it was a really big hit. And of course with network television, if you look at ratings now you go, my God, how could they cancel it with that chair? Insane. And then we were offered to go to the CW or the web. I can't remember what it was first because it's all a blur. We were offered one more year to go there and we just Kinda said John and I, I kinda, I thought we did it, you know, we kinda got canceled. So why do we want to beg to go somewhere else?

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       And they do that. Sometimes they say columns and it never works, right? No, you're somewhere else. And then people find it. Would they do it for is for syndication. So. Oh, what years is that from? Everything looks different, it looks smaller, but it was the secret to that show was that there was actual affection between the cast and uh, and in good writing and good morals, things where kids could watch your sister could watch it and feel good afterwards because they had my sister, Tanya, Tanya, a, you were great in rocky and that's right. That's right. There you go. And it just, I, your brother loves you very, very much and, and really appreciate that you would make them all watch full house instead of having Nice, nice dinner. In fact, he'd make the dinner nights here. All right, let's do just a little bit more on TV and then I want to talk politics with you and just sort of, you're a philosophical guy.

Speaker 2:          00:42:16       I am a philosophical guide. It gets me in trouble sometimes. So you do fuller house. Yes. Big Star. Then you're also doing America's funniest home videos. Another thing where it's a blooper show and I'm playing on Sunday night, seven to 8:00 at night. People were in church that day, so then that night I'm hosting a show that has to be done very palatable for America and the world was number one in China. Where was that hard for you because you. I mean, you really had to. That was, that was. That had to. It was a little difficult and it was a gift horse so the tree opens up, you know, it's the number one show, the producer of into bona called me one day on my curly cord carphone and said, we're number one, and I said, you mean PP anyway? No. I said, we're, we're, we're number one show on television.

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       It was a phenomenon and the joke is if you wanted to see a man get hit in the nuts, you had to come through me. I was the gatekeeper but in a funny way and now it's all this I. Youtube will give you anything you want. That's exactly what I was going to say. That somehow all of the stuff that people click that's just quick and you watch someone get smashed with saying or he was sending her fault. It was all born out of people walking around with cam quarters just because you guys were like, well, let's do it. He had the savvy, uh, it was a famous show. It came out of a show in Japan, which I think are still partners with it. I don't know the business dealings, but I'm going to look it up. Give me a minute. Let me just get on my phone.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       Yeah, yeah, no, I'll do it right here. But, uh, it became a, a phenomenon because they took a, did it amazing. They did the grassroots approach, which we don't see anywhere. They asked in people magazine. They took out an ad. We have a new show called America's funniest home videos, full-page people magazine. I'm send your vhs tapes and you could be on television and you could win prize money. God, it sounds like. And that is how they got the first hour of tapes. And what happened to me was I was doing a year of full house. I get this tape. They said this is an amicable, a young man. The man that now is, is Walt Disney, is Bob Iger. He is ABC. He wanted me for it. Ted Harbert was at the network, wanted me for it. I'm from full house. I seemed like a very amicable guy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       They'd seen my standup. They didn't care. They didn't know it was like, it wasn't as a bluish as I became, as I got more free with myself. I was going to ask you about that. It wasn't, I didn't draw as many f bombs, it just, but it was all weird. It all had things that you can't say. So what was that like for you? Because he was still there. I mean obviously I'm not telling you anything you to know, but like he was so sacral and the jokes you'd have to make and I, and I'm proud of them. Yeah, I wrote it with two. Uh, the jokes were to Canadian guys, so there was an 18 percent exchange rate on the humor, but it was todd. Thanks brother. May he rest in peace? No, his brothers a lot. I'm Todd Thicke, uh, analytics brother and uh, Bob are not as a writer from the smothers brothers show.

Speaker 2:          00:45:17       And we wrote all the jokes, we wrote 55 pages a week. I would do the voiceovers look out. Oh, look at me, you know, just bad mel blanc, who was warner brothers, bugs bunny. That I have to explain it to the millennials. Millennial who's bugs bunny thing after this? Okay. It was bugs bunny. But who is Marvin the Martian? You made me so mad. It was Marvin the Martian. I'm not a good impression. But, um, it was a big production to. I wanted it to be a variety show, so we would have big guests on. We'd have on a Rodney Dangerfield, anybody that was a friend of mine, we'd had Leslie Nielsen on Jonathan Winters, full house, you know, we'd have and it was an hour and, and it is still on to this day, a testament to Vin and to the people that make that show, you know, it went to Tom Bergeron, went through many people that went to Richard kind hosted at wants, daisy frontage, John Fugelsang.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       And um, there was no way to stop it because it was a guaranteed laugh. And what I didn't like, what would bother me is if a guy falls in a manhole and then you see somebody in the audience to other head back laughing, but you never see him climb out of the manhole on like, is he dead? You know? So I hadn't done a charity for people's nuts. Like with Bob Saget charity for a great idea. Something. Yeah. Agates Sag. It's agates something that would have. Yeah. Because there should have been people. There were a lot of not hits and it was all the good ones were when it was a six year old taking a baseball bat and his chest just jab and his dad. Even just before this I was, I just quickly put Americans money selling videos in the youtube search and it's just not hit after hit.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       There's one that's like 600 hits in a row. I mean they just cut him real quick because one thing that got to me was someone had sent me a clip reel that I think they aired on the show, which was old people falling. And I had, when I was like, I'm glad I'm not there because that was, that was the only time I went, like, oh, come on. And they're falling on cement and stuff, which sounds funny to Bros in a bar drinking beers. But if you'll watch it, it's kind of snuff fish. But uh, as long as I know everybody's okay. I didn't want to be a where people filmed themselves hurting their friends. So I felt like I was hurting before. But that didn't matter. I, I enjoyed for those first few years of doing it. I just, I loved the hell out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       I mean everybody was talking about it and loving it. I had friends calling me going, what is this? Because no one had seen it before. But it's interesting because it's like kind of one of those things that we don't have anymore. Like we don't have shows being right. There are things like, yes, everyone watches game of thrones, you're, everyone watches this or that on Netflix. But we don't have like sort of mainstream like decent things that families can watch anymore. And they know and they put all the nonsense aside, you know, and that's what I want to do. That's kind of. And um, I'm in, I'm in talks about a couple of different things. I want to do something, a variety. I don't know what it is. You know, I, I, I love directing, so I just did this movie so we knock on wood people, go see this movie, Benjamin, which we will, we'll get to it for a second.

Speaker 2:          00:48:27       Let's get to it right now if you want. I feel that that was the right way, but I will give closure to that last thing. Just saying that I do feel that there would be, it would be wonderful to have a family sit down on a Sunday night. I mean wonderful world of Disney used to be on at 7:00 or 7:30 when I was a kid on NBC and you turn it on now and it's just another one of those people punching each other in, in big sumo wrestler costumes. And that's not what I want to see with my family. I want to say it, but that's the cheap replacement. And that's variety, that's reality variety, but real variety is we're going to entertain you and we're going to bring on guests and it's going to be fun. I mean, I guess snl is the closest thing to have.

Speaker 2:          00:49:11       Yeah. But that's not really. It wouldn't play in prime time. But you want something, you're talking, you want something that's funny, but also you can do some serious stuff. You want to staying relevant. I mean, it's, you want. I can have everything, but I think it needs to make people laugh the most and then it can have its, its waves in it. And so I will be taking pitches right after this. All right, let's talk. Benjamin and Benjamin. Benjamin comes out in the summer. It is a movie that I spent seven years on. It is an independent movie. I'm very low budget. I'm just getting hit in the nuts. Uh, no one knowing that there is a fight in it. Um, at least I can't even. I can't tell you who me and Dave Foley won't talk. I don't want. No, no. Spoiler alerts. Uh, it's about, it's really about a dysfunctional family, which is most families and we believe that I directed it and I acted in it with some amazing people that are name really quickly, which are rob corddry, who's hilarious. Kevin Pollak, Cherio, Terry, Dave Foley, Max burkholder plays my son. He was on parenthood. We think that he is on crystal meth. So it's a dark comedy. I thought you meant the actor. No movies about movies, about plays. Benjamin, we believe all the actors.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I don't know what you're doing

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       in the movie. You were on crystal meth during the making of the. In order to be able to survive working with me because I was out of my mind because we had a 15 day shoot. It was a low, low budget. Yeah, I know this show has longer to shoot my movie and I'm so my, in the movie, my son Benjamin we believe is on crystal meth. And so Mary Lynn Rice cub plays my girlfriend. She's from 24, very good comedian actress and she posts on facebook that we need an intervention for the boy. And that's not where you post an intervention. People don't post interventions on facebook. It's supposed to be kind of quiet and done properly. Maybe a note posted. And uh, so rob corddry is our family gynecologist. He leaves the intervention and Kevin Pollak plays my brother and Peri Gilpin Santa and Clara Mamet. GotTa have a Mamet.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       Uh, she's so good at it and I'm, uh, David Ho and uh, Johnny Western and uh, it's just, it's an ensemble and it takes place in one night and it's just basically the one line would be on it that the people, the person you think has the problem. It's the people. And I can't really give much more family. The family, your family is the woman, the problem, you know, people. So many write a one line for this movie quick. Yeah, we need it for the one sheet. But the people that you think have the problem, the people that are accusing someone of having the problem are the ones with the problem. Oh, that's a spoiler alert.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       That's a little bit of a spoiler. But I feel like that transcends this movie. That's just a general thing,

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       serious movie with, uh, with a, with a comedy bent to it and I, and I'm very proud of it and so thank you for letting me plug all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       Alright. Saget, we did career. That was it. That my career is just beginning. We Ngo or career ended my career completely. It ended. We never got past fuller house. It's over. No, we did. Benjamin were good. We did Benjamin. We know we got, we got other stuff coming. Yeah. We didn't even talk about a half baked, but we'll just, we'll just say that it never actually did that in real life. My real. I got it. Okay. Um, all right. Let's talk. I just want to talk about politics and just kind of what you think is going on in the world because if that's what you do here, that is what I do here. But even though I only know you a little bit from the conversation we had at dinner, I got just got a sense that like you actually, you're obviously very sensitive. Like that's pretty clear. I'm overly sensitive or you strike me as like a good liberal, like you want people to be treated well as fair. I think of myself as a liberal. I must be. Well, what do I look good?

Speaker 2:          00:53:09       Myself as a humanist, I was on a plane the other day which no comedians ever said, and transducers, that gentleman was on the plane and he had a and he was about 60 years old and he seemed like a successful businessman of some kind. And I was in the first class section because there was a cat back in coach. It was a cat for a case. You get sick. She had her

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       security animal to keep her. What do you call those animals? The, a special animal if special needs or whatever. But I'm deathly allergic. So I was upfront and allergic to cats too.

Speaker 2:          00:53:50       Think so I was saying to this gentleman and he had on big bright Red America first shirt. And so if I was uh, I guess, uh, what your brand is a liberal, I guess that shirt would bother me. But I just looked at the guy and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn't. I just said, do you have an allergy to cats? He went, no. My wife's got a cat. I said, so you have a category? No, my wife has a cat and we laughed a little bit. And what it said on his shirt, on his shirt is a shirt I would wear. It's not a where I'm at. I mean, I do believe a tube. I love America. I believe that where you live, you want to put first, you want to take care of your people, you want to take care of your hometown.

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       Oh, you're coming out with that far right craziness. Or you want to take care of your country.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       But, um, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. But I don't, but I'm not. If you're, if you're kind and you're not out doing some closet hatred, uh, or blatant hatred, I don't know. But I, I just look at my dad's whole thing was be kind to people. So it sounds like a pacifist and might bother people, but that's what we're supposed to do.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       Yeah. Is the problem with that, that you just get nipped off by both sides? I mean, I see that a lot now that I do think there's this interesting center developing.

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       I don't even know why there's sides. Of course. Yeah, of course I do. But you know, and, and, and people go, well, you're a democrat. Right? And I'm like, I'll vote for anybody that can get us out of this mess. You know, I'd, I'd bring my dad back from the grave and vote for him. He'd be such a good candidate. A grateful dead video. Yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       Are you, would you consider yourself a liberal? Is that where you are? Yeah. I still consider myself a liberal, but most of the liberal things that I believe in, I can pretty much explain from a libertarian perspective at this point and that I just don't want the government involved in my life. That's it. And I think you should live your life however you see fit and I'll live mine however I see fit and like you have a lot more money than me, right? Fair to say. I don't know, but we're going to do spreadsheet exams right after this is over. Let's be clear. I'm on Youtube. You've been on network television. You've got three chickens outside. I don't have three chickens. I don't know their value, but you could have chickens. The point is I don't any of your stuff just because you make more money than me. Right. I can't have any of your money. It would be nice I suppose, but I don't deserve any of that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       That's what taxes are about and that's where our are incredibly rich society and are incredibly poor society are at odds with each other and that has been since the beginning of time since you know castles were built with a dictator in a king living in it and everybody had to go build all this stuff and they were slaves. So I mean it's it, it does. The metaphor doesn't change. The representation doesn't change that the downtrodden or downtrodden and are disgruntled and then other people are angry at things that they should just take a frikken chill pill over. Yeah. Well that constant outreach thing. Well, there's a lot to be outraged over also because how do they all have the, the, the problem with, you know, wanting to entertain people with wanting to be a comedian is, it's nearly impossible when there's so many deaths when there's so many tragic things happening, which there always have been, but we are at a news ratio where it's coming at us. You just, you know, you hit your computer on and it says, you know, news alert and you hit news alert and you're like, you're afraid to hit the button. You're afraid to get up in the Morton and hit whatever new service you go.

Speaker 1:          00:57:52       So that's just a matter of us knowing about it more because I have steven pinker on next week who's a harvard psychologist who, and his whole argument is actually that things are better than they've ever been using empirical scientific evidence about the amount of people that are being exposed quicker because we actually have more people out of poverty now worldwide than ever before. More people with drinkable water than ever before. More people that leave the environment, uh, enlightenment values and every port. But we

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       why more people would drinkable water. Yeah. More the around the world. Know around the world more now than ever before. But that might be true. Is that, are we a hundred percent? That's true. I'm pretty sure that's true. But what about, what about more people being murdered? What about the safety of our kids? What about, you know, all these things over, but most of those,

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       most of those markers actually, they're better than ever before. It's just that we hear about them all the time now and we obsess over it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       Not that we obsess over the negative. Yeah, because we're not presented the positive and if we're presented the positive, it's through a skewed broadcast. It's, it's, it's not really presented by someone that comfort to you. The show comforts you more than most shows because of the way you handle it. That's just a fact. If you're trying to have watched you several times, you're trying to put two factions together that might have similar or report pose views, discussing opposed views and are saying, why can't it be like this? Because if you try to go toward an idealistic goal, the dream of it is how you can almost get there. That's, that's how the country was founded. Besides, you know, taking a lot of things away from the people that lived here. That's a whole other show. But you've got three Cox in your yard. Pretty good.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       So I just trying to get you out of this now. I'm not really politically astute but did I make any sense? Yeah. Well you aren't making some sense, but I think you actually articulated that. I mean you're around tomorrow at the time. That must be a. I saw just last night and he said Aloha because we were in Hawaii together. But I do say that I'd rather get my news from, you know, from John Oliver and, and Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel than the newscasters. What does that tell you about US media? We need a relief and so the news itself is already a parody and it's also so obsessive no matter where it's coming from. And we're also dealing with a regime which flip flops in the media and on twitter faster than I've ever exist because we never had a president tweet us, you know, we did.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       I mean, Obama did, but it wasn't. It wasn't like, I hate this. I love this, you know, 18, 21, 21, 18. It's like you're in Vegas, you know, just double down. Um, do you see him as the problem though? Or is a symptom because I really see the symptom. It's a symptom. It was, it was voting for a guy that was on a show that said, you're fired. So what do you expect to get? Um, you know, if you're gonna, if you're going to get the host of America's got talent, you're going to get the most out of people. This is going to be the best a procession ever. It's going to be dancers and singers. And Yeah, if you had been the president, people would be getting be at a Dick, jokes you, you would from me. I guarantee you a dick joke a day.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       And I would treat them and not three in the morning. I do not tweet, well, three in the morning, no one should note, well no one except the president because, but I, but I just think you know, what did we expect? But I think a lot of people were surprised and I think it doesn't matter. It's happening and this is it and so we want to better humanity and there are great people in the world and there are great people in other countries leading the world the best they can and there's a lot of slackers and there's other people that are just part of the political bunch of crap, but they're still great people and there's great people watching this. There's nice people watching your show. Yeah, you're a nice person. Nice people. You don't. I don't think you get a lot of haters. Do you get a ridiculous amount of haters do.

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       Yeah, because I talk about the problems that I see with the modern day left and the liberals and they don't like someone to address those things. That was once one of them by fake manner. Why can't I know they, they don't fall. Don't fall for that. Perfect shrink. You could, you could calm me down through tightrope walking. That was because we slipped a little saying in your water. There is something in my water. I'm feeling different. You notice the tone has changed. I'm not leaving them on the show tomorrow. Otherwise vibrating it. Oh yeah. Though. I bet things moved in. Yeah. Is there anyone that chart behind you? You know, that it's just Los Angeles, but it's an eye chart. Pretty clever. Huh? That's really it. We call that art. Get well done. Mr. Bond. Pretty good. Uh, is there anyone that you're paying attention to these days that you think is making some sense?

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       Because I appreciate all the comments but the compliments, but like that's what I think I'm doing here is just trying to make a little census of things. To be honest, John Oliver has been, um, I can't think of anyone political that has made me go, oh, there's a great hope there. Um, and I'm interested in something. Some people have to say that seemed wow that was noble, but they're not going to do anything about it or they're not going to run or. But I'd like to think there's so many out there, you know, I'd like to think you think that's part of it, that we all talk a lot, but we don't. Do I sense that sort of what's happening here? So is that everyone's saying shit, we're fighting always just a bunch of fucking voices. It's frequencies everywhere. All through our heads. It's just noise.

Speaker 2:          01:04:01       So trump was like, all right, I'm going to do it. None of you do anything. And trump's like, all right, I'll do it. I'll run for president. You Morons. And guess what? He was right? Yeah. And the way he does it, he can turn anything. He wants to do a rally. If he feels the moment and he gets the right South Park background behind it, but he's doing it and I don't know, I just don't know anything. It's too. You can't predict a thing. And we want that security is feeling secure that you know at least what tomorrow brings. We don't know what an hour from now brings. We have never been on our haunches more not knowing what's gonna come out of him, out of the White House. Who's going to get fired, but that's not the issue. The issue is where's the world at and where's our kids at and where are the things that really matter.

Speaker 2:          01:04:57       What really matters is people. This is sort of like you're giving me the ending of a full house episode and you want to tell you something else. I don't want you drinking beer at the prompt and you cannot have a horse in the living room. This is where the synthesizer music. Yeah. Yeah, and you know what? Always follow your gut because your gut is not wrong. If you feel it deep inside, then take imodium because any moment there could be a release. I wish I could have done full house like that. That would have been nice. Just full of diarrhea and give you a chance for bloopers like that where you could just. Oh, there. Bloopers grills that were that. I said horrific things. Yeah, there's is. I wrote a book called dirty daddy and I told. I talked about something I did on the set once and I got in a lot of trouble, but I won't say what it is because it's not repeatable on this youtube channel, but it is in that book and it was something I should not have done, uh, with a, with a, um, well I can't, I can't say it, but it was something that happened because we have been.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       Okay. I did something that we, we had stand ins for the kids that were mannequins and I was alone on the set with just the crew and the monitors were on and I didn't know that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:18       Not acceptable under these conditions or under this time. Do you ever worry about that? Because you still know because everything I've done is when someone goes, oh, someone's going to come forward wind. When's you're being bad thing going to come out. I don't know. Look at my last special. You want it? It's right there. You know, weird way. That's like your. It's like your saving grace sort of like you. I am a confessional. Yeah, I mean I, there's a story in there in the, in zero to 60 does special where I say I was given ludes by a club owner which were serious drug. It was almost like a roofie terrible drug from wolf of Wall Street, Jonah Hill and Leo Dicaprio and I'm a club owner, told me to give it to a waitress and I could have my way with her and I instead to cut to the chase and ruin a joke.

Speaker 2:          01:07:07       I actually took it myself to knock myself out, so because she was kind of hitting on me because I did it too because that's kind of guy and so all my stuff's out there because I didn't, I didn't do anything a diabolical that I can recall that roofing yourself, can you? Yes. Yeah. Can you, can you add that? I can recall to every single thing I said on this entire interview, that's what politicians do. Okay. So I'm going to come in and I'm going to voice over this new tire interview just so that I can recall. Yeah, I feel we should end this either with something hitting you in the nuts or something or a song. Oh yes, we could do a song, but you already gave me the nice full house ending. What do you think is the you. You were the one here with the brain. Tell me what you think is the hope of how we can get hope is is communication. Yeah. That this is happening now that people are doing this, that you know what I mean? Your discourse, your fiance Kelly came across me. We traded a couple messages on twitter. I was like, oh. She gets it like she's to find some answers.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       I'm trying to find some answers and we went out for dinner. We all became friends immediately and that people and that whatever the differences that we may have where you know, you're probably still a little more left than I am on some things and just doesn't even matter. I, I think on some things probably you're, you're probably a little more, Eh, I don't know. It doesn't need to. It's irrelevant. I dress left. I don't know. The accounts just doesn't even matter, but the point is that the reason that shows like this are working is because of this, that you were willing to come here, sit down to come here. Yeah. You immediately said to me that you wanted to come, but that's the point. It's like people want this now they they are so tired of the other thing and all we're doing is exactly what Tom Snyder did and he was just talking to a camera, but what were what cars. He had a guest or William f Buckley or any of these people who said, let's try to find some answers and you can get, I think as many answers from Bob Saget as you can from the guys. I think you get far more answers from listening to someone like you had some life experience and that cares. Then you can virtually listening to cnn all day long. Well you can get.

Speaker 2:          01:09:20       Well, we never got into which we don't want to get into, which is all the depth that I had in my family. So much death of friends. I just lost someone today. I'm just talking about. We can go there. Well, all I was going to say was that's what centers everybody because it seems we all go through our birth and death and they all happen differently and when they happen at an unfortunate age, like our last two sisters at 34 and 47, that's. That's what centers you. That's bigger than everything is the loss of life and when people die, when young people die, there's nothing more. That's all that matters. Yeah, it does. The rest of it is your belief. This is that this is that. It's yes, you want to solve in a civilization how to keep people alive, but the empathy is, is what's missing and just quickly to touch on what we didn't touch on, but we talked about before the show started.

Speaker 2:          01:10:21       Okay. I'm going. The talk shows that exist at night to chat shows as they call them in England. When I would do Johnny Carson Show and before him was Jack Paar who I got to meet and before him was Steve Allen who I got to meet and these are guys that they all had the tonight show those gentlemen. And then johnny ended up with it, um, that was viewed how they would tell their guests, you're coming to a cocktail party, how do I dress like a cocktail party? How do I talk? You're at a cocktail party, you're in Johnny's living room and he's sharing that living room with everybody. Well, why does he have a desk in his living? Because he wants a desk. He wants a place for his ashtray. Smokes. Got a little. Maybe he's got a drink there. Whatever

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       that, that they used to do that. I mean, there's a lot of white ones. They're smoking, they're drinking, you know, Burt Reynolds is. I mean, it's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       And then talk about what we want. We don't want to see it. Although sometimes we do. We see some strange things that happen. I mean a lot of and certainly had some, you know, Joachim Phoenix moments, those kind of things. We're still going to see more stuff like that. People are going to do whatever trippy stuff they're doing. But the truth of it is those late night shows are supposed to be entertainment. That's what this post to be. They've become a bit of let's attack everything today that we've been through because look what happened today because it's been getting ratings and people that necessarily might not do political comedy like James Corden. He's in entertainment oriented man. He's been very talented men from Broadway. He's does at Carpool Karaoke. He but he comes out and does a seven minute monologue that might have a bunch of stuff in it about the White House, but that's not.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       We're not born to do that, but that's what's feeding the beast, but it's supposed to be a time when you chill at the end of the day where you're entertain, where you relax and when you want to get that. Tom Snyder, when you want to get that, dare I say the name in a sentence. Charlie rose because that's what he did. He did a one on one, but when you say a name like that, it can't help it cause someone to recoil dot Larry King for my purposes. Larry King, I've known forever and I adore him. He's a great guy. Larry King. I'm a post to have dinner with them. Kelly and I are supposed to go ahead with him and Shawna on for dinner. We can go to that place if you invite Sean, that place that we went that place so we would, we don't talk about but a neat place. He is quite a character.

Speaker 2:          01:12:48       He, I went on Larry King Show, he read my book and every time he sees me he goes, I loved your book second. And I know I'm thinking it's because he, he forgot that he keeps telling me, but he's just, I've just known him a long time and um, and he, he was very, very good at it, you know, and we've got some really good people doing the news. So some real good people out there. I mean, Lorenzo Donald's, a friend of mine, I, uh, I, I like them a lot. Um, that name right there might flag people, Msnbc and uh, too many consonants. We hate it, but I don't know, I just see we need to be entertained. It's really complicated to do it at this time in a way without bringing up human issues, moral issues. And I'm going to do the best I can to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:39       You know, it's funny, I remember, so I was never, even though I think you know him personally, I was never a fan of Leno on the tonight show. I loved cars and even though it was my kind of very early years, but Leno to me, I always liked the bill Hicks thing or, and you know, they had that rival and I liked that sort of more raw and gravity and Lenovo to me was like he was just the corporate version. So I never liked it. But in an odd way I suddenly had this bizarre respect for him now. Well he was, he was a comedian hosting the tonight show. Yeah. And I that he wasn't overtly political all the time. Now it's always political and I almost missed that

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       in a way, even though he wasn't really my guy in terms of comedy. But I know, I know everyone says he's incredible standup, which has nothing to do with his great standup. And I was

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       in turn on the Mike Douglas show within Philadelphia at 18 years old. And I was on his very first television appearance. Wow. So I know Jay that long. And so there's a interesting history and then, you know, Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Conan, those were guys that I would go on those shows and I felt the most connection. But Jay, I would go on and promote a movie I'd worked on that I directed that I worked so hard and he couldn't have been more gracious, you know. So yeah, I don't have to do chemo is one of the sweetest people alive that does this, you know? Um, and gold bears great. I mean, it's an interesting time for media and for broadcasting. I just want to see us get into some kind of place of peace of mind in the world and we're not there. That's a big lift man.

Speaker 1:          01:15:18       I mean, that's right. Like that's why I'm doing this. That's why you want to do this or I never wanted to do. So

Speaker 2:          01:15:24       I've never wanted to perform more. I'm more motivated to go do standup. I booked these Stena, I'm on tour. I'm trying to work out trying to come up with new stuff because I know you do a special on, you deplete it, but you know, you don't want to just give them something they just bought or heard, but people really need it and I need to do it because it takes people out of. It brings them into their life. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       you think like the last sense makers these days. There's a couple others that I think there's a few.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       There's a few comedians that I would rather watch than almost anybody. Um, there are some good motivational speakers. There's some good good clergy out there. I'm not a subscriber that much. Um, I'm a comedian so I kind of listened to the people that have a lot to say and some of them really do have a lot to say. So I respect. I respect people with a point of view that aren't malicious. That would be you. Did we do it all here? I think pretty much. Unless you want to.

Speaker 1:          01:16:30       You got to walk. You want to make some vegetables, have a great walk. And I knew you had a walk me one disaster story one, like a nightmare I was telling you before about my my thing when I was on at the RNC convention and I was sweating like crazy and Larry King said it's more like, like Albert Brooks in broadcast news. I was on stage to take us out with a disaster. Say I get a disaster of standup, but anything. Give me some life. Very well. Thank you. Give me a professional. Not a life disaster. I gave you a life disaster. All right. How about one life named her name? Dropping like disaster. I'm on on an

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       airplane on America on an a 7:47 A. I'm on the video show is number one at the time so you can then list famous people on the plane in the newspaper by WHO's the most famous and how they're listed in the newspaper. But I was on a plane with David Bowie and Amman and Greg Kinnear and Richard Lewis. Or where was that? This was an American flight out of JFK to La. That's hilarious. And also mark mckeown who was on the CBS morning news and a friend of mine, um, and so the plane starts taking off. This would never exist today as we're taking off in the air. We hear an explosion and one of the engines apparently blows out. The plane goes, rickety. We then land at JFK. So a very long time ago. Um, and we find out first they take the VIP, which is people I named on two carts.

Speaker 2:          01:18:02       And Richard Lewis is yelling next to David Bowie, only a couple of us are Jews. I'm like, I'm not to this. So now we're in the club and I'm getting to talk to David Bowie. So I'm going, okay, this was worth an explosion. I'm fun. And who could not have been more gracious and um, and it was just a, it was dangerous and upsetting. They two hours go by, they put us back on the same plane, turns out it was a fuel hose that came loose, which is just like turning a screw on a gasket on your lawnmower. And they fixed it, which would never happen. Now that would get you a new plane or cancel you completely or whatever. And uh, we then took off and I made some joke, I think the movie outbreak had just come out and I said something like, there was a monkey caught in the, uh, in the engine. And then Richard Lewis yells out. That's a good one. Bob Amman is from Zaire. And so I'm called out and then as we take off, Richard Lewis Yells, thanks Bob to the whole plane and at that time you could go into the cockpit this pre nine slash 11. And um, I was able to ask the pilots what happened. So I actually told the VIP [inaudible] no one else. What happened? Well, you shouldn't, they didn't tell the other people. So that was a, that's true disaster story. I mean, that could have ended incredibly badly and I would have been fourth.

Speaker 2:          01:19:35       I would put him to settle that with Louis because we could, we could get him here and we can moderate some discussion last night. And he and I are gonna. He holds me by the face and hugs me and we're going to figure out the list, but he's going to tell me that I would have gone ahead of him simply because of that dumb video show, but he would say dumb video show in order to do it because that was probably 1988, 89, you know, it's one of the, one of the nicest moments I've had on this when I had Richard Lewis and he left and you know, he's kind of a Germaphobe is Larry and you know, he doesn't shake hands. He does this as he said goodbye to me. I walked him out and when I opened up the

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       door, he just said, he, he said something like, you're great, and he touched me on the cheek and I was like, I like melted. I was living.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       Does this rabbinical thing? Is that what? That is? Erotic rabbinical thing that I think he learned from his shrink for a jury learn differently shaped or the other story, which is a very simple one, very, very short story. I was in San Francisco performing standup. I learned that. Be careful what you do, messing with a heckler. A guy who was about eight feet tall, got up on stage and got me in a headlock. Holy Shit and wouldn't let go of me and had me and it was hurting my neck badly, no security, nobody there days and I took the microphone and I shoved it up his ass and he got so paranoid that I had done that, that he ran away. I don't know why. All I know is I don't know if he had a homophobic, frightened moment or thought maybe that I was going to go further in or maybe that he would have farted and I would've picked it up on the mic.

Speaker 2:          01:21:14       But in any case, that is scary when you are out there with the people. Now young girls will just flash me their boobs and go, Danny Tanner, you know, like that. But uh, I've had a few things like that happen where people have had to, security has had to throw people out. You've got all kinds of stuff like that. That won't happen to you in Irvine at the Improv. I hope not. You got a hell of a standup career happening because you have so many. So you say content and then you have jokes you're going to have. You're going to talk philosophically like you do on here about life, and then you button it with something humorous or you feather it throughout with jokes.

Speaker 1:          01:21:47       Yeah. Uh, I mean, I think we talked about this a little bit, but, um, you know, there's two ways that you can do this. So there's the Seinfeld way, which is like that perfect tactician laid out every pause, every inflection point. I could never do it that way. I don't think that's exactly how you do it either. No, but then there's sort of the garry shandling way, which was, you know, there's that great moment in the documentary comedian where he shows him his papers and it looks, you know, Hitler wrote it because it's like, so perfect. And then, uh, you have Gary Shandling who pulls out this crumbled piece of paper that's much closer to what I am. I have some ideas. And I did. I was on a beach last week in Florida and I wrote out the hour and some of it is stuff that I've done through the years that I've just updated, but it's all based in what I'm doing here and I'm trying to just be true. I'm just trying to be.

Speaker 2:          01:22:30       It'd be great. Yeah. And then you're, then you're hooked and then you then welcome until the next 30 years and it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll infiltrate this and might not only be stand up and you, it's an interesting thing to do to be able to go, hey, I'm going to do Vegas three times this year and, and uh, you know, and people come to see me and it's kind of fun. And can I get on the jet with you and Mar? You know what, if I, if I rock it for the next year, that'll be my goal. You saw the picture. I saw the picture. You don't want to be on that. You don't want to be in that one. That was a, that was a fun trip. That was a fun, fun. Can you guys do that every year? You and Margaret, I've never done it with before.

Speaker 2:          01:23:12       He always has a, he has eddie vedder do it, comes in and we didn't know. We had him on tape and we had Reggie Brown who did his Obama impression that he's done on a real time before and then he always had different people. He gets different comedians to come out and do it with him and he asked me to do it because he wanted to have some fun and we've always liked each other. I mean we've known each other since for 23. We all started together. I took Jerry Seinfeld to Disneyland, Jesus and Garry shandling and George Wallace and it was the opening of thunder mountain railroad. And I'll leave you with this because I've left you with nine other important. Want to keep going now to uh, but uh, there was a goat with dynamite on. Have you ever been on Thunder Mountain Railroad? I know it, but I'm not exist anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:24:00       Oh, it's very popular. So there's a goat with dynamite. A robot. Not, not much of a robot, but it's trying to exactly where the dynamite and you hear it. And all I did for 23 years old and Jerry's a few months older than me. I think I, I want Jerry. Oh my God. I go with dynamite. And Gerry would, Gerry always did, was just lay out the obvious, oh my gosh, our glass with a stain, you know, that's not a joke or I'm not him because he's brilliant business. There's nothing to clean glass. But, but he to this day I could say, oh my God, I go with dynamite and he will laugh because it's when you know somebody and you just get them, you know. And I saw a bunch of comics last night, so Paul Riser and it was billy crystal's birthday and it's just nice seeing all these people that I.

Speaker 2:          01:24:53       Yeah. So magical that time. Right? Like you came up in a time that to me and for anyone that appreciates comedy, it's like, Holy Shit, all of these guys. And then you realize there weren't that many. You go like, oh, there were thousands of comedians. No, there weren't. There were hundreds and a lot of them are gone. And then there's, you know, I'm at that two thirds point, I'd like to think my middle chapter I, it means I have to live to 122. Well, with all the medications these days, I think it's possible anything's motorized, unicycle up my butt, but no seat that seems excessive, but whatever, whatever works for you. And we lost Stephen Hawking. Just wanted to end on that. You mentioned George Wallace, George Wallace, George Wallace, his hbo special, which I think maybe he only had one, which is a real disservice, although he's had many other specialists to me might be the funniest half hour.

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       There was something about him and he was always. A friend of mine always rented Jerry's. Yeah, he's just a funny, funny guy. And um, he would mess with me one time he was opening for Tom Jones a lot on the road and I lived in Hollywood on Camino and he went out of town, but I forgot that he went out of town and we were buddies and, and, um, and he said, he called me up. He said, saget make me chicken. I said, okay. I had no life, you know, I was waiting for the comedy store that night. Know I was 24 maybe. Okay. I'll make you a chicken. What do you want to southern fried in an oven. Okay, sure. Maybe make, does make me chicken. I'll be over in a couple hours. So I make chicken and make a whole bunch of chicken is already so put that and then he doesn't come over and now I'm getting worried.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       William Holden had just died. And so I'm like scared that George died and his conduct shows you how I have grown as a human. I called his landlord and uh, I got ahold of a building and he, George is in Tahoe is nobody can Tom Jones. So I called the hotel and there's a George W. What did you do? He said, you fucking idiot. I told you I was opening for Tom Jones. Why'd you make me chicken? I said I'm freezing it and you're going to eat it. Dammit. So that's the end of that story. The George Wallace ever eat your chicken. No, I ate it. It was pretty good. On that note, saget. I've made chicken sense until I came to your house and I saw your. The way you were eyeballing the one on the left. You can have an egg. You can have the chicken. Okay. Can I have an egg?

Speaker 2:          01:27:27       Yeah, you can leave this house with an egg. I want. I'm going to give you a farm. Fresh egg and I happy. Do I cook it? You know, happy. That'll make my sister Bob Saget. Danny Tanner. He's walking out of my house with a farm. Fresh egg. But can I eat it? Yeah. This is what I will cook it. You know what? David's the chef around here. Do you want to literally the best sunny side up egg. All right. We are ending this show. This really has been a pleasure. It's so nice when you meet somebody who you know, who you know, but you don't know, and then you realize you that you know them. Something like that. That's the point I think of what we're supposed to do as people. We get to do this and we would do this at dinner. This is almost like this, except we just.

Speaker 2:          01:28:13       We would move more, didn't move very much. I was like, you know, Captain Pike a little bit. Yeah. All right. I suspect we'll do this over dinner again and we'll do it here again. And uh, and this is, I think you've got enough to edit this for three years. This is the longest. Sheila, this is actually my retirement show now. How long was this? About six hours. That's fantastic. Now really this was beyond, we went into mountain time for more on that man.
