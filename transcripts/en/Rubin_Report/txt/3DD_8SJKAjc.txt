Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Is it just me or is Internet culture? The trolling, the outrage and the endless hate starting to eat itself? This election obviously brought out the worst in almost everybody from real people to twitter, eggs and atomy avatars. People are constantly attacking others online and saying things that they would never dare say to someone's face in real life. The really scary part of this though isn't the words you guys know. I love free speech, but there seems to be no bottom to this whole of anger. Just think about your facebook and twitter feeds for a moment or they enlightening, interesting and bringing joy and goodness to your life. Or are they an endless cascade of rants and Raves, psychotic, ramblings, endless fighting and nonstop virtue signaling. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that for most of you, the answer is the latter.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Not the former, and yes, there are also a lot of baby pictures on facebook which can be quite annoying. What I think is most interesting about our constant state of bickering isn't the obvious fact that the Internet can bring out the worst in all of us, but that it seems to me that this behavior and the reaction to it is now bleeding out into the real world. I'm slammed with emails every day in which people explained to me how they're suffering real world consequences for what they post or even what they don't post online. People are getting fired over tweets, losing friends over facebook posts and God only knows what's happening on snapchat, but perhaps worse than all of this is the chilling effect that this state of outrage has on the rest of us. This is why I've said it before and I'll say it again.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       The biggest threat to free speech is that we are actively silencing ourselves. Not that the government is silencing us. The threat to free speech isn't just that protesters are violent at a milo event. It's the trickle down effect that that has. Now they're violent events for people. I conservatives and Libertarians such as Ben Shapiro and Charles Murray, but of course it won't stop there either. Eventually they'll come for liberals to while at the same time, plenty of other people who just won't want to deal with the threats. Simply won't accept invitations to speak in the first place. The outrage machine will just dull us all down to the point where we won't share any original thought because we just won't want to deal with the repercussions. This is exactly what's happening with trump right now. The mainstream media and the twitter brigade go bananas every time anything happens.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       The result is that people won't be able to gauge the proper outrage if he does do something that truly warranted. Yes, he eats his steak with ketchup. While it is well done. That sounds horrible to me, but you've got to deal with it. Remember the boy who cried wolf? Well, now we've got the media who cried? Trump, you think I'm being alarmist here? Well, do we see more politically correct or less politically correct than five years ago? What about 10 years ago? Do you find yourself censoring yourself more or less? Now than you did even last year, who is forcing you to censor yourself? Is it the government? I don't think so. I bet you need only look in the mirror and guess what? This creep of stifling speech for fear of being ostracized isn't going to magically reverse itself. We have to proactively fight it, and we should have started this a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       Take a minute and think about our current television programming. Could all in the family, arguably the best Sitcom in television history with a bigoted yet lovable archie bunker, possibly be on network television today. The beauty of archie was that we all know someone like him, whether that person is white, Brown, or blue. Only through seeing these people poking fun at them and showing the short sightedness of bigotry, can we change our society to be more thoughtful and decent for everybody? Even when I watched Seinfeld with all of its quirky, racially based characters, jokes about gays, women, and everyone else. I think that the authoritarians will come for the show about nothing, which was really a show about everything one day as well. It won't be the government kicking Jerian the crew off the air. It'll be the next generation of social justice warriors upset about the episode where George wanted a black friend or where Kramer wouldn't wear the aids ribbon or the ones with characters like ping the Chinese delivery guy or baboo the Pakistani restaurant tour beyond the outrage machine.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       There is another nefarious layer here which is a whole group of people who get off on the outrage itself. This is the group of people who react to anything in everything, so to get clicks and ultimately money from our constant state of outrage. So when Pewdie Pie makes a stupid joke about Jews as they did a couple of weeks ago, the bigger reaction is from those who want to capitalize on the moment rather than those who are actually outraged by the joke itself. Then the mainstream media gets involved with the Wall Street Journal writing about the incident which subsequently led maker studios to end their contract with Pewdie Pie. This destructive force will take anyone down who has moved up to far. The youtuber is attacking Pewdie Pie. Wish they had his 55 million subscribers and the Wall Street Journal's sees how his influence, believe it or not, is now dwarfing their own as online culture.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       It gets woven into every facet of our lives. It's vital. We all pick up and choose our spots when to fight and when to be outraged. If we're outraged at everything, then we're outraged at nothing. If we spend all day online trying to find enemies as well, then guess what? Enemies will present themselves. Making some intellectual point over an opponent has value, but we have to be careful that the value isn't because of the retweets and favorites it garners. I'm sure I can be better at some of this myself, by the way, especially on twitter. Trolls are always going to troll, but those of us who want to change things for the better have to actually be better ourselves. Final thought. I was a guest on the Alex Jones live show last week at. Some of you may have seen, I'm not even fully familiar with Alex beyond the little bites I see of him screaming and generally going nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       That said, the guy has a huge audience and is clearly influential as mainstream media crumbles and online media rises. As I've said before, this comes with both positives and negatives, but regardless, the fact is the guy is talking to a huge amount of people. Immediately when I got the request to be on the show, I thought that I shouldn't do it because of the ton of hate that I was about to get. Then I realized that if I didn't do the show, I would only be holding myself hostage to the very same ideas which are silencing so many other people right now, so I did the show with no preparation or advanced questioning and Alex let me say what I wanted to say. Well, I got the usual hate from the usual haters just for appearing on the show. I also know that I got some of the ideas that I care about to be heard by his large audience. Now maybe some of them will come here and learn more about the issues that you and I care about. If you're one of those new viewers, welcome. I don't yell as much, but I think you'll dig it around here, but for the record, I do not believe that a secret group of Lizard people are leading a shadow government, which is trying to undermine our freedoms. Obviously. It's actually a group of frog men led by pepe and they're actually a bunch of freedom fighters. Good luck to us all.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       Joining me today is the author of several books and the founder and current president of the David Horowitz Freedom Center.

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       David Horowitz. Welcome to the Rubin report. What are the chances that you ended up being the president of a place called the David Horowitz Freedom Center? That is, that is incredible. I actually fought that name, but my board said, uh, I had named it the center for the study of popular culture as a, as a leftist. I thought it's a very hard to attack a center for studying anything, let alone just. But conservatives see the word culture and they think left. So there was just confusing skype. Amy and I said, just kind of put your name on it. So. So here we are. Alright. So I don't know, in the years that I've been doing this show that I've read anyone's bio and found it more interesting than your bio, it will, at least not someone that was born in the United States. I thought it was just, there's so much richness there.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       Your evolution politically, it has a lot to do with some of the things that you write about, about going from the left to the right and all that. Um, so I want to start with your history first. Your parents were communists hard. Gary card carry everybody. We, it's like the communist that kids that think it's cool today doing an old school. These are people who are part of a vast international conspiracy orchestrated by Moscow. Um, my parents, my, my, I don't think my mother ever got a traffic ticket. They were, they were very middle class. Not break the law, but they did hide and East German communist in the basement. Who, who the government wanted to deport

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       a. How did he get to your basement? I have no idea. I was very young. Did you know there was someone down there? I mean, did you notice something was going to either, was his name the last name? His brother was the mayor of East Berlin. Okay. Um, but um, yeah, they were very conspiratorial. They never referred to themselves as communists, only as progressives. Even then because it wasn't a dirty. Well, oh, it was very dirty. He was a dirty word. It was very healthy period. But because this anya American left very subversive, ready to work with the, our enemies the up. So you know, a horrible totalitarian dictatorship where effectively quarantined. We lived in a kind of ghetto where you couldn't say what you, what you believed in that for a Democrat with a small d for a liberal minded person, that doesn't seem right, but it was actually healthy given the cold war at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:10:05       So, so, so what did it mean to have a stigma on people who hate this country? We've lost that completely. So, so we'll get to that part because that really sort of, that gets to the evolution part of where you're at. We were stigmatized and a well, what did they believe? Like what did that actually mean? If you said you were a communist, and we're talking the 19 forties now, nothing. My mother was a registered Democrat. I don't think anything different from certainly not the Democratic Party of today, although then, I mean, when Roosevelt was president, they were all happy Democrats. When Truman declared that America would defend free peoples fighting for their freedom against the Soviet Union, they all defected. And that formed the Progressive Party which was run by the Communist Party. Yeah. And then around 1956, if I'm not mistaken, all the information that comes out about Stalin and then that sort of.

Speaker 3:          00:11:03       That was my away. I was 17 at the time and that was my kind of awakening that everything that the William Buckley's. So we hated to write that. The right set, the right set of Stalin had killed 7 million people. He actually killed about 40 million. Um, and we said was this was all anti-soviet lies. The Soviet Union was a paradise of the future. Everybody equal everybody working, everybody happy, all lies. But we've, my community believed them. And then Khrushchev came along with this, gave it a secret speech that the Israeli Mossad smuggled out and it just, it blew up my community that there were divorces in our, that we do have a over people over the Khrushchev report. People felt betrayed. They had lived a lie and other people felt, you know, you continue, you go on and they defended it. Yeah. And that made marriage is untenable, right? You think p, it's tough now for marriages when people are going to.

Speaker 3:          00:12:12       I love trump. I hate trump, but, but that's why. That's earthshaking stuff. Your whole narrative. Yes. So I came into the, when I went to college, I mean my mission self self developed a was to rescue the left from Stalinism. Um, I still believed in this future, wherever, you know, common government ownership of the means of production and quality and everything. Um, and so I, I was a fervent new leftist. I was one of the, actually one of the creators of the new left. I was at Berkeley. We published a magazine called root and branch. But by the end of that decade it was clear. The left was a totalitarian forest. It couldn't fit in with supporting, you know, whatever was the men of malice, malice. Mao killed more people in style. Um, and uh, so you saw that change from what you thought, something decent. You saw that basically anything related to authoritarianism would be sort of pieced into my, my most.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       I had two serious deviations. I had a nuclear family and everybody else was living in communities or whatever. Um, but the more serious one was that I read books. So I, I mean, I remember when billy airs was elected vice president when the weather people took over, sds is a, a college senior. He boasted that he hadn't read a book in a year. I was horrified as a leftist by that statement. Um, but what was his argument was what? I'm not being programmed by these people, but then know to choose an irresponsible twit. I mean, it's, you know, came from wealth very privileged. I have, I have nothing good to say about billy airs, but by saying I haven't read a book in here, who is he? How is he trying to impress somebody? But I know doing well because the books are written by the ruling class or when a got.

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       What did mark say? The brulee ideas or the ideas of the ruling class? Completely false. How would you explain our universities today is full of crap. I'd be the first thing yet. Yeah. Well we'll get to our universities. Don't worry about that. But wait a minute. The first one you mentioned there was, you came from a nuclear family and that. Was that a problem? I had a nuclear fence. Yeah. Oh, you had your own nuclear. I also came from a new, quite the end of the decade. I had four children. Yeah. Yeah. So why was that a problem for them? Because they want. They didn't, I wasn't expelled from the left. I, uh, I was um. Well what happened to me was that I, I edited ramparts, which was the leading, it was the biggest magazine of the left and a Hollywood producer, producer. Vz Writer, um, was a big funder and sponsor of the Black Panther party.

Speaker 3:          00:15:21       And He introduced me to Huey Newton because he wanted me to take eldridge. Cleaver had been on our masthead, uh, and eldridge there was a war. It was basically a Black Panther party as a street gang. And uh, this was a contest for leadership. Um, so he, uh, he introduced me and I got to involve raising money for the panthers I raised per school. Um, I was very impressed. They had a lot of children and the Panther party was a, there were a genuinely good people and they were gangsters. Um, and the good people impressed me and I'm, one of them was running the school, a school and they were jammed into a brown shingle house in, in Oakland. I mean the, they had double decker beds from one wall to the other, but the kids. So I, um, I thought this Hollywood producer would give me the money but it didn't turn out that way, but I raised a, I think it was $125,000, which a lot of money in those days and bought a church at Baptist Church in East Oakland that had been overtaken by the, uh, inner city.

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       It was a white Baptist church. And, and I, I signed up the check, I created the Oakland community learning center, a five zero, one c three to how's the school? I'll never forget the, uh, the minister said to me as I handed him the check, I hope you're not going to turn this over to the black panthers and the nation of Islam. When did he know that you were working with them at all? At the time? That we had no idea. It was literally, I know I'm talking to you like most of the left today. I had no idea who they were, the panthers. Um, but anyway, I've told this story in a radical son, my autobiography. Anyway, in 1974 I, I recruited the bookkeeper, my bookkeeper at ramparts to do the books for the school because I believed our own propaganda that the government was racist and that they would shut down the panthers if they didn't keep the books, which was ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:17:45       I mean, look at Jesse Jackson, look at Dale Sharpton. Huge tax evader yeah. And he's walking the streets because he's progressive and Blackie's protected. Um, and in December 1974, uh, betty disappeared and by the time the police Fisher body out of San Francisco Bay, I knew the panthers had killed there and I had been interviewed by the police. They explained to me lots of things. It's very difficult to high to dispose of a body unless you have an organization and then it's not so hard you have safe houses and this and that. Um, and so when that happened, I was personally devastated. I mean, I was in the same place. My parents were being embarrassed by the Khrushchev report, something I swore that I would never happened to me. Um, and I, I'm curious, what were your parents around at the time? Yeah, my mother was very, they were worried for my safety as they should be.

Speaker 3:          00:18:45       I was threatened by Elaine Brown, who was the head of the panthers and is alive today, a toasted by the Atlanta journal Constitution. And uh, funded by actually conservatives have often not always speak on college campuses. Um, she was the head of the party. Why would conservatives phoned her now as she evolved? I'd forget that. What's the name of. It's a big orange county foundation. They gave her $10,000 to speak and uh, I can't remember. It was UC Santa Barbara. I with the students there and informed the now because, uh, uh, conservatives in this country are a well meaning a liberal minded people generally, especially the ones with money. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt. I mean, here's a black person claiming that America is an oppressive country. All sure he has money anyway. Uh, I was personally devastated. I was clinically, I would say clinically depressed for seven or eight years where I wake up in tears every morning. I felt responsible for having recruited betty. Uh, my name is Betty van patter. The woman who was murdered. She was a mother of three children. I'm the etiology is so precious that on the way to betty's funeral, her daughter who worked for me and I didn't know if she was 19 or 20 at the time, I tried to warn her. I mean, I was afraid for my children and I said, I think the panthers killed your mother. And her response was, no, they're good people.

Speaker 3:          00:20:33       So, so I set out then to warn when I had sort of assimilated all this, uh, I, my mission was to warn other people and that's how I know that Barack Obama is a communist.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       All right. So wait, let's, let's pause before we jump to modern day because everything that you just described there was why I thought your bio is so interesting because you grow up with communists, you know, now I didn't know about the. I didn't, I didn't know about the guy in the basement. But you, I mean, you, you are firmly on the left. Your whole first 40 some ideas with Maurice. I wrote a book called Empire in revolution, which the left used, right? So leftist, Communist, Marxist. I mean, so bourbon for example,

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       um, set of the, of my book that it was like a, I don't know what he said, a handbook, a Bible for the, for the left before I, he called me a renegade for leaving the left.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       Right, right. So that's. So you're, you're a hero. But the second you now change. Now, of course, if you deviate from the party line, this is what political people don't realize, political correctness is

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       turn that Mousey tongue, the greatest mass murder in human history and vented to shut people up. It's the party line. If you deviate from the party line, they throw you into the cold. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Alright. So now we're, let's flash forward. Unless there's something that shoot you or shoot you, right. So they, they silence you, then they shoot you, you know, uh, so unless I'm missing something, I think we can flash forward now to around 85, which is really when you, um, what happened was when this happened,

Speaker 3:          00:22:16       no, I was writing, I, I had, um, left ramparts with Peter Collier who was by buddy. Uh, and uh, it was Peter's idea that to write a, a dynastic biography. Uh, the goals were, the saga was on pbs at the time, so it was a generational saga. So I was in the midst of writing a book on the rockefellers, which became a best seller. And then we were asked to do a book on the Kennedys, which came out in 1985. And, uh, in 19 eight and, and, uh, uh, when it came out it was a number one New York Times bestseller and uh, the Washington Post, the editor of The Washington Post Sunday magazine called me to pick my brain about young Joe Kennedy was a congressman and he said, what have you guys been doing? Our whole, Oh, you won't believe this, but Peter and I just voted for Ronald Reagan and neither Peter and I had talked before casting that vote.

Speaker 3:          00:23:25       Wow. Oh, that's a good story. You want to write it? So our story was better run than red, but he renamed it lefties for Reagan. Right? So then that's when the knives came out and Peter said to me at the time, I just show you how deep the current rot the fake news is. Um, we were front page New York Times, both books about the rockefellers and Sunday Times. And The New York Times sets the standard for all the media they even reprint them. May View is. But um, and when our article came back on, we voted for Reagan. Peter said to me are literary careers are over. Wow. Alright. So you must be joking, so you really had no idea. I have no idea. Even though you knew some of the tactics, but it was exactly right. That was the end. I don't lie less 20 bucks. I'm a New York Times.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       They noticed one and called me a relic for using the word Communist. That was just a squib. Right. So even though you knew all the tactics that could be coming down on your way and the way you be treated, ever been a realist about that then. So you. So that's it. You just weren't a realist and your own. Even though you saw you had such a history of seeing what would happen and not the hare instant cognitivism black could never believe that people can be so ideological and so duped and I should know. Yeah, I think I've been suffering from a little of this right now and immediate. The rubber's meeting the road with me at the moment of of this kind of what, but what was it about? Was it something about Reagan or was it really about Mondelez? Reagan was. This happened earlier. My bumped in to the parking lot of the Berkeley Co op, which is a supermarket that was everybody liked because it was a cooperative. Um, we're not rolling stone actually publish a story that Peter and I did on the weather, the weather underground, telling the truth about it. Um, and uh, this woman I knew that me and the parking lot and she said, David, you know, people really hate you. Now.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       The truth about these crazy terrorists is what they were, who got people killed and they hate you now. Hey me for saying the truth about it. Yeah. But, but what was it about Reagan also that then they hated Reagan the way they hate trump. Yeah. It was the same kind of hatred. That ticket, they just hate it. It's, it's because he's, he's not one of us. That's, it's very visceral. Yeah. Is that what anything? Ironically, yeah. He's not one of them, you. No, he was an, he didn't know the trump phenomenon and problem is a little different, but it's not all that different. I mean, Reagan was an actor that they looked down on that, um, you know, a fun, wrote a pamphlet called, uh, an essay which is a pamphlet called the anti capitalist mentality. Why do academics, he capitalism, why are they so left?

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       And the answer is because they feel superior to businessmen. And here's trump. The businessman. A businessman are, yeah, they have no respect for what it takes to build a billion dollar empire of, for them it's all theft or something underhanded. It's after it's crony capitalism. We're. So Reagan was like that. He was an actor. How dare he be present. We're so much smarter than he is. We should be running the country. So intellectual stat, I think it was about intellectual. It's generally they don't, they, they feel that they're smarter than everybody else because they haven't actually created for the most part. So they have to sort of elevate what the pad. I think the power should go to them. And I learned very early when I was still leftist when Jack Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon Johnson became president. I was living in England and of course Europeans looked at on an Americans from the beginning of the republic, but um, uh, Lbj, he had the Lbj cufflinks and the Lbj children and the Lbj dogs and the MPG.

Speaker 3:          00:28:01       So they, they just thought he was. This is a, yeah, this is, uh, uh, you know, and Johnson was much smarter than Jack Kennedy and he went to East Texas State Teachers College, but he, he unfortunately, he put in place the great society, which is an Albatross on America's neck, has been for lo these this half century. But he was smart. He knew how to get it through Congress and Jack Kennedy couldn't get any of it through. Yeah. I now congress barely worked. So that's why when trump came along, I wasn't one of these never trumping inside the beltway snobs. Although some of my, my good friends from path, okay, so you have this final awakening. You write this thing. Then a year later, I think in [inaudible] 86 year old, why? It wasn't why I left the left. I wrote it and say, look, I, as I say, I, I, W, I was personally threatened by Elaine Brown.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       Um, and then in a, I have a tape of the phone conversation was he said, if you, if you should get run over David, really, I'm, I'm, I'm going to be your best friend because people will say I did it, something like that. I mean, it was a threat. Um, so I was afraid I fed to Kate Coleman, who wrote an article for a now defunct leftwing magazine, uh, what's called the party's over about the criminality of the panthers, which I had discovered by personal investigation. Um, uh, uh, yeah, I forgot. Well, getting to the village voice piece, the village voice. Yeah. So I finally in 1986, which is, it's a decade later, I wrote a piece why I am not no longer a leftist. And uh, and we've heard to this, I did not name the killers, but I did refer to the murder and the path that the panthers and murdered her.

Speaker 3:          00:30:14       And I'm a poem. Berman wrote this piece about the renegade Horowitz, the intellectual life, and the renegade Horowitz. That was a vicious attack and he had me at the end of his piece cheering on suicide. Sita, who was a psychopath. That was a contract in Nicaragua who might hadn't even heard of when he called me, he said in Horowitz's cheering wakes up the next morning cheering suicide. So basically you went off the reservation officially with this article and then you had said the knives were already out. We'll know it was with the Reagan article with the Reagan article. This is why this is a right and left. Right. So this was a way. He was a year later, right? I think it was 85 and 86, so a year later. So the knives were already out and then this was like sort of the final door on. That's right. And I saw 1986, 87.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       That's 30 years ago. Is that what it is? Something like that. In 30 years my work has never been taken the work, the ideas, my arguments with the left. Why am no law? I wrote a long essay on, on leaving the left, um, and why I left it a never responded to. I'm the nation, made one stab at it, but I'm not a very good one. On the other hand is like hundred thousand attacks on me on the Internet from leftists. So it's not like they don't think that I need to be refuted anything. It's just more effective to pretending it makes you feel any better. Right before we sat down, I was scrolling my twitter feed and some article was written about me were they referred to me as a right winger and then got a few other things incorrect about me and then my own audience actually started attacking them on twitter and then they, they didn't issue a retraction, but they changed the headline at least and change one other thing, which of course is not journalistically sound, but I guess maybe I'm picking up some of the.

Speaker 3:          00:32:12       Well at first it hurts, but eventually you get to be liable. Proof thing. They libel used so much that it just seems ridiculous more than anything else. It's just lazy, Lazy and ridiculous. So you know, I'm an easier target than you are because I vowed when I left the left that I'm gonna talk to the left. Address them in the same way that they addressed everybody else. No. Oh, I didn't know you could have nicely. Yeah. You and barry very hard to demonize. I'm sort of easy. So when you see, you had some nice things to say about me when you sat down and when you see someone like me that's understands the title of this book, that understands your journey and all that. Do you think I was just. Even though I'm obviously are we have 30 some odd years between us that I was just late to the game and picking up what was going on here?

Speaker 3:          00:33:01       Or do you think something also happened in the last couple of years with the left? Alright. First of all, starting with the mcgovern campaign. That's when it started. The communists left, infiltrated and took over the Democratic Party. Um, I mean Tom Hayden was no longer with us, was a cynical and I am American, lying radical. Uh, and he was given the medal of freedom by Bill Clinton. Um, uh, he was a state legislator in the state of California. You can still see his work whenever you see prop 65 that warns you about the bad effects of chemicals in your whatever. Oh yeah. It's everywhere here in la.

Speaker 3:          00:33:52       Um, but the Democratic Party took the left in the, the Ana, the Nih, American totalitarian, and I would say racist. Left. I will explain that later. But racist left was taken into the bosom of the Democratic Party in the Clinton administration. And with Obama, they got one of theirs in the White House. Okay. So let's. So let's pause there for a second. So when I hear you said about the Clinton administration, that's hard for me to picture because those eight years were basically, I don't think we saw a lot of what we're seeing right now. So what am I missing? If you miss them? You didn't know the personalities from one. Um, I've written a, let's put it this way. I think back to the Clinton administration very fondly still that things were basically, there were terrible that they were basic. Bill Clinton's was not an idiot log in the way that Hillary Clinton, this Bill Clinton's etiology was. Why was this ideology and was. But that you would argue that's probably a saving grace. Then corruption is far better than communism. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       If it burned for the corruption of the Clintons, Bernie Sanders would have been a nominee. Um, that's a great quote there. You just go out corruption as far better than communism as a good way because it is because you've got a meeting that you can deal with. It doesn't have the ideology that sweeps people along with Bill Clinton domestically was, uh, a fairly centrist, uh, you know, I don't have too much to quarrel with them. They are, uh, uh, I'm foreign policy was terrible. Absolutely terrible. The World Trade Center was blown up in 1993 a by Ramzi Yousef. He intended to kill 50,000 people or $200,000, top of one of the towers on the other. The bomb is fired. It wounded a thousand people and killed six. Bill Clinton never visited the site, dismissed it as an individual criminal act when it was inspired by the blind sheikh who's just been, um, assignment been London.

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       We should have been stopped in the nineties before the World Trade Center was. I mean, I can't go. I've written a lot about this. So, but in the case of that in case the first World Trade Center bombing. So what do you think was going on? They didn't Bill Clinton's head. So this happens. He never visited. Say what is the, what's the ideology there that would lead him to that? It's an interesting question. I wish we had a one of these Democrats on and you could ask them the question. Um, I'll, I'll try to get a former just to skip ahead in this book. I've written big agenda. I, I lay out what I think is going on that, that, uh, the Democratic Party is now a racist party. Uh, you used the phrase people of color is a racist phrase. Identity politics is racist and it's anti American. The fundamental American idea is that we're all creatures of a divinity or maybe nature's God, whatever Jefferson wrote there and equal in the eyes of our creator.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       Therefore we should be treated equally by our government and we have rights that are inalienable at government can't take away. So it's all about individual freedom. And most importantly, individual accountability. When I was a kid in public schools, we always, there was this phrase, regardless of race, color, or creed, who an American is somebody who doesn't look at your origins. We're a nation of immigrants that way. Don't look at your origins. Of course, if you come from a terrorist country, we should have a little vetting process. Um, identity politics is the opposite. What the left seeks. We are in a civil war situation now. Um, and the reason is the reason it's so irreconcilable is that the left believe is a racist that believes in a racial hierarchy. So if you're the right skin color, which is dark, you go to the head of the line for admissions to college and go to the head of the line for job.

Speaker 3:          00:38:27       You go to the headline for our promotion, you go to the head of the line for almost anything and everything's not diverse enough. So we'll take. Um, so what would you say to the people that would say, well, white people had a good for a long time and, and, and why? People do bad things and they did good things. And one of the good things that White America did was to liberate the slaves. People forget that we inherited slavery. This is how I've been myself, notorious in the left by coming out against reparations for slavery a 137 years after the fact. Um, America inherited a system of slavery. Slavery existed. I learned this from Orlando Patterson, who is a black left of center, a sociologist at Harvard who's written prize winning books on slavery and freedom. Slavery existed for 3000 years. Nobody ever said it was a moral, not Jesus, not Moses, not aristotle until a white Christian males in England led by Wilberforce, said it's a moral and an American slave owner.

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       Thomas Jefferson wrote it into the birth certificate of this country that all men are created equal and a given right to liberty by their creator. Within 20 years, the slave trade was ended. Um, the reason that America didn't initiate a civil war in 1776 to free the slaves. What are the biggest reasons was that England would have come and just, we take in the colonies and reinstituted a slavery anyway, and within a generation or a little more given in those days, people live shorter lives, uh, at the cost of a 350,000 union soldiers. We the braid that the slaves and liberated them throughout the hemisphere. So black people, Americans can be very proud of their heritage. Um, you know, it's, it's a human heritage, so it's got a lot of bad spots, but you look at any other country in the world, and uh, forgive me, left this for saying this one thing nice about America is the best.

Speaker 3:          00:40:42       What other country do Asians get in boats and risk their lives to get into? You think that coming here to be oppressed, right? I mean everybody, everybody wants to be here, and then the funny thing is this, at the same time, you go to watch some of these protests and the people that are screaming about how racist and evil and patriarchy and all this stuff, they're also the ones calling for open borders. They want everyone to share in the heart that is to destroy the country. Anybody with any sense knows so had it all. But let me just say, yeah, the left is, is it, it's own. Whatever ideas it has to marks. It's the Marxist paradigm of the oppressors and the oppressed and it's an economic. It begins as an economic and they've layered on race and gender. Um, so the fact is determines a country's prosperity is culture, not classes.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       It's culture. America has a great culture. We take in. I'm. One of the things we do is we take in brilliant people from all over the world and give them freedom to innovate. Other countries, copy our innovations. And Israel is the same way. It's why they hate it because they're bringing in people from all over the windows. But also it's the freedom people do not appreciate freedom in this country, obviously, since we are universities and now totalitarian institutions, I can't go to a university without bodyguards. Yeah. And that's been true for the last 15 years I've been physically attack. If I didn't have bodyguards and if the university has put in place security, I could never get through a speech and I'm not alone. It's any conservative, virtually any conservative. And now it's moderates and this is fascism and that's a. it's totally embedded in our university system.

Speaker 3:          00:42:39       Yeah. Do you make a distinction between sort of the leaders who really understand the stuff that you're talking about? So the people who, who are the leaders of this leftist movement versus the, the bulk of the people who I think are following along without bad intentions, like when I see all these kids who I, you know, I lock them on twitter and people got a demonstration to get laid. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and people are gullible and they don't think. And I can't put two and two together. The phrase I didn't want to skip this. People of color is a racist phrase. It's not English. Do we say, here's a box of crayons of color and French. That's the way French people or color or whatever they say. Yeah. So it's a completely ideological construct. So is that as its function? Well, let's look at the Mexico.

Speaker 3:          00:43:37       Two main ethnic groups. The descendants of the Spanish conquistadores who slaughtered the indigenous Indians and the descendants of the indigenous Indians. When they crossed the border, they both people of color, therefore they're oppressed. Both of them. The keys, the doors and the indigenous people, they are oppressed. They deserve special sensitivities and special privileges. Maharajahs in India are people of color be headers in Rocca are people of color who are people of color, white people, white people are evil, bad. And this is, this is, this is the racist ideology of our time. Is it also lacking in several other ways? I mean, for example, you could take American Indians, uh, people who've moved here from India or their grandparents moved here from India, or you could take Asian people at virtually any nationality

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       and they don't count in this leftist thing because they've said, well, the Indians happened. Yeah. The native Americans. I'm sorry, not. I thought that was ridiculous. Now I'm going to, we're not going to edit that out because I don't believe in that, but that was in the completely idiotic statement. I American Indians from India who moved to America. That's what native American, correct? Yeah. Correct. Chinese, the Japanese and American Indians in that native American. That's correct. Yeah. I just ruined my list. I don't like to say says my Nora. No, don't look over your shoulder. There's only, there's only arrows coming. That was Indian joke right there. I'm in the, the left.

Speaker 3:          00:45:18       It's pathetic. Intellectually. They don't have an argument. So they have to purge those groups because those groups. Yeah. That's why they have to shut you up because they can't deal with your arguments is really simple, straightforward, and it's so invaded our literary culture. The last two national book awards were given to racist tracks, one by Ta-nehisi coats I can never remember. The title of it was just a rank racist coats. Uh, what inspired him to write the book? It's about how evil America is, but how was the murder of his friend? Not The bird. I the killing of his friend by a policeman in Maryland. It turns out as he tells you that the policemen, the policemen accused the dead, his dead friend of trying to run him over with his car.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       The policeman is black. So what does code say? He was thinking white. Now that isn't the purest racism and this one now it's called stamped from the beginning. It's a semi illiterate book that, that it, that they have lowered their standards so dramatically as a still shocks me because these are intelligent people that people give the awards, but I should know better. Um, but it opens with the police shootings of criminals in the last year, which were totally distorted by black lives matter and other leftists into a cops gutting down unarmed blacks. These were predators. And who did they pray? Pray on a braid on black people. Freddie Gray. I mean, you know, you could go on a, again, even remember the names, the guy in Ferguson, um, they're criminals who prey on black people,

Speaker 3:          00:47:15       but this guy has them as innocent blacks who were gunned down by racist cops. So at the opening of his book, which is which he has called the definitive history of racism in America, he's exposed as a liar and he won the national book. So our institutions have been just generally corrupted. Yeah. So what is this racist ideology of the left? So for a lot of people hearing this, I think a certain amount of people hearing this, we're going to go, yeah, I get it. So you don't talk quite like this, which is why I think you're much harder to, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm wanting to see you with a so called liberal. I don't call them liberals. They're bigots. Yeah. Well, I've had many progressive, a progressive on this show and I treat them with the same respect that I treat anybody else I did.

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       My general rule is I don't find that braiding somebody or belittling them, but yeah, I made this bow ready 30 years ago that I was going to berate the left. I was going to say, Hey Lbj, how many kids did you kill today? I actually, when I was still sort of leaving the left, I thought about that statement a lot. St. Let's see if I were a prisoner of war and I was in a room with my captor, would I rather it was Lbj or holcim and it was a no brainer, so that's part of it is that you just constantly say the worst thing about your intellectual opponents because there's no end here that you just constantly say anything to you and that's why I love Milo because he just throws it right back in their face and that's what really needs to be done.

Speaker 3:          00:48:53       These people need to be embarrassed. Alloying probably beyond embarrassment. Yeah, I mean ABC news stuff. Annapolis is sitting there with Katrina Vanden who oval, whose entire life has been spent apologizing for defending and advancing communists causes. That was that. That's ABC. That's how far gone this country is. So are all the answers then for you on the right or do you have frustrations with the right? Because I think right before we started, we only talked for about 30 seconds. Liberal. I've, I tried to, um, no, I mean I, I get know what did I. Oh, I, I took on the leaders of the religious right over a mark raw rash cope was the governor of Montana and was the chairman of the RNC, met with the thing that's called the human rights association, which is a gay group. And he addressed them or whatever. I met with them and he was denounced by Paul.

Speaker 3:          00:50:02       Why Rick and very well known leaders of the religious right. And I wrote an article saying that I'm a political party is not a religious movement or shouldn't be and it's the job of the RNC chair to reach out and, and, and so forth. And I've never been an opponent of gay marriage and I, you know, I could go on on. Yeah. And you mentioned before that abortion, you're, although you're not a fan to say the least, but you are a pro choice, right? So, no, I wouldn't describe myself as pro choice. Okay. I, I, I, um, and it's been a long lifetime of rethinking this issue when I grew up, uh, abortions were illegal after the third month and we know a lot more now and medical techniques where we just know a lot more about fetuses and the, you know, if you think about it, their children from conception. I mean, I just, it's not an argument as a person already. Um, do you think from the moment of women, it's not about the woman's body alone,

Speaker 4:          00:51:19       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:51:21       you know, I, I think that fathers are involved as well, but certainly this child there, so you know, the argument against it as you want to bring a kid into the world that's going to have a absolutely miserable life because it's wrong parent at the wrong time. You know, and I, I think the energy should be spent on finding ways to take care of children that the parents are unable to take care of it. It's a very vexed problem and I don't, I've, I've confronted a right winger is actually was in the heritage foundation debate, you know who said it's murder? I said, well, if you think it's murder, then you should be demanding. The execution of every mother in America has had an abortion and if you don't, it's a much more complicated problem, so that's kind of where I am. What was his response to that and shine them up?

Speaker 3:          00:52:12       That has a real quite well. That's why the abortion went to me is is one where I think very good people on both sides of this are just struggling with it because it almost is coming down to the basic questions of life and it is, but you can't discuss basic questions in our political atmosphere and not with the left. The left wants to convert everything into a morality play where they are. Right. How much of this is culture? Did you see that change to that? It's just. I know what you're saying, that culture is the most important thing, but when did it go from, like I was thinking, even left, started taking over the universities in the seventies now and they've got the k 12 schools as well. Um, and you know, I conducted a was literally five or six year campaign to try to get a, an economic bill of rights, really a student bill of rights that students have a right to a professional education and a democracy that means that they have professors can express their opinions but they have to present the opposing sides of controversial issues in a fair minded way.

Speaker 3:          00:53:18       And I was attacked from one end of the country. Other is a Torquemada and a controller. It's very liberal. And

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       I did it all out of their own documents. There's a very famous academic freedom statement that was drawn. Well, what's the thought control part of trying to get more in there? Don't you know, he can't be logic. This is the aup. These are stalinists.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       I mean I debated them across the country. They, gosh, I mean they put me through the ringer, but you know, like I say, he'd get to a point where you're liable proof because they've liable you so much, and it does, it does, but they fought it tooth and nail. And for example, I had praised, uh, in all of my speeches, this is a 1915, the statement on academic freedom by the American Association of university professors and the Penn state still has or had as its academic freedom provision, the statement that the obligate the, it is not the place of a professor in a democratic society to indoctrinate his or her students. Therefore they must present divergent opinions in a fair minded manner. That's a paraphrase of and I praise that. And so the head of the Aup, Carrie Nelson, I made it a personal crusade to get that ripped out of the Penn state academic freedom.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       So the so called liberal person right now this to be removed. He's alive.

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       Okay. Yeah, carry. He actually, I mean he's defended me in some places, so he's like an, an whatever. It is. Not quite a bit a doctrinaire, but he did the faculty senate. They're ripped it out and took out explicitly the thing. It's not the place to indoctrinate the student.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       Yeah. Do you find when you, when you meet people, maybe some young people that are waking up to some of this stuff at once, they see one piece of it that the rest of it crumbles. Right? Exactly. Because I see this because I saw it happen with myself obviously, and I, and for me it's still an unfolding process I think. And that's why I'm happy to have these conversations, but I see it happening with other people. Now. I get emails every day. People would be like, one little thing happened and then months later I now believe everything that was Steve Miller says it was guns. That's what turned him from a liberal and conservative. Um, I have, uh, somebody who writes occasionally for front page website, uh, who

Speaker 3:          00:55:54       let me speak in Camden, New Jersey. And I pointed out, as I said I do in my book, big agenda. Um, every inner city of any size is 100 percent controlled by the Democratic Party and progressive it has been for 50 to 100 years. Clinton, Camden.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       So every little walkie Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Baltimore, right?

Speaker 3:          00:56:16       Um, everything that's wrong in the inner cities that policy can affect Democrats and progressives are responsible for, once you see that it's all over. And then there are people out there screaming that. And even president, we had this. Here's some leftist mentality when Peter Collier and I wrote the bestseller on the Kennedys, we found ourselves in a green room, have a good morning. America sitting. There were only three people. The other person was William F Buckley and was dead silence in the room. And uh, the reason that Peter and I were silent as we, as we, we had no idea who buckley was. We just knew we didn't want to be nice to a fascist. That's what the left and called him a fascist. We didn't want to be nice to a fascist. So Peter broke the ice by saying, my mother is a big fan of yours. And then we find out from Buckley who was a very gracious human being, um, that he was silent because his son had just written a very critical attack on a Kennedy book. That was another one that came out and he didn't know if it was.

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       Huh? Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       civility on the left. Yeah. It just, it's so, it's fascist. That's what it is. And if this, there's no way. I mean, the only response you can have this one, like Milo's it just go in their face. But anyways, I just shot you down. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       There is a, uh, an incredible video that I saw a couple of years ago have you at University of San Diego I think. And a young Muslim student gets out, very articulate with a head scarf. Yeah. And she, at first she opens by thanking you for coming and saying she's sarcastic. Diversity of thought and people can watch it and we'll link to it below so people can actually watch the video. There's a weighing of sarcasm in it or, or it was either sarcasm or she was trying to butter you up before she went to kill. Uh, can you explain the rest of what happened there? So that, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:58:20       Yeah. Then edit it. She said I'm falsely accused the Muslim Students Association of being a front for the Muslim Brotherhood, which it is and Hamas. So, and, and we had distributed a pamphlet showing this. Um, so I, instead of arguing whether about whether the Muslim Students Association students for Justice in Palestine, they're both amongst friends, Brotherhood Fronts A. instead of arguing with her, I just decided to cut to the chase. I said, will you condemn a Mohs as a terrorist organization? And she said, uh, you want to crucify me company? Oh, I don't know how I respond to coming in. And she said, well, if I don't condemn Hamas then I will be arrested by the Department of Homeland Security. This is how delusional these people are. So I changed the question. I had done this at other. So I knew what to expect. I said, let me put it to you this way. I'm a Jew and the head of his bullet says he wants us choose to gather in Israel. So he won't have to hunt us down globally for it or against it. She leaned into the microphone and said for it, and she was dependent afterwards by the Muslim Students Association. A whole left. Hey genocidal. They want to kill the Jews.

Speaker 2:          00:59:47       When she said that, I suspect you were not shocked as insanely shocking as that sounds.

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       No, because I had it at UC Santa Barbara. I asked the same question of the head of the Muslim Students Association when he said it was too complicated a question for a yes. No answer. Right? Genocides. Too complicated. He was smarter than she was. Hers was just like, hers was just showing you what they think and what they want. So. All right, so let's, let's shift

Speaker 2:          01:00:14       to Islam then.

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       I, I've been talking about it and I've tried to bring on. I brought on liberals to talk about it. I've had, you know, very measured people like Sam Harris, quote pupils. I've had ion Hirsi Ali on who talks about her own personal enemies on the left. People who are at my new eyes, who's a Muslim, you know, is still a leftist liberal. Yeah, he's a, he's a liberal, he's a liberal. Whether that I don't want to speak for him, I don't get into any extra trouble. Um, but I've had. My point is that I've had plenty of people thought of as liberals or on the left discuss it. They get hate from the left. Then I've had people more on the right talk about it, such as Lauren Southern and Ben Shapiro and some others that of course they're going to get a certain amount of hate for it. How do you gauge how much of a problem this actually is

Speaker 3:          01:01:05       at the moment? The problem being the problem being Islamic extremism

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       where God or whatever you call it, I think Islam is a problem and no rational person could not look at Islam and say it's not a problematic religion. It preaches hatred against all other religions. It's sanctions. There's just a series of quotes from the Korean sanctions where they're beheading infidels, which is what we are. I'm the Prophet Mohammed has has said that the day of judgment will only come when the Muslims fight the Jews and killed them when the Jews behind the rocks and the trees and the rocks and the trees cry out. Oh, Muslim descent. You hiding behind me. Come and kill it. Yeah. Talk. Not only. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:59       by organized Islam. Uh, but it's repeated use of our Kara doorway. I'm set as much. The Holocaust was a punishment and on Gypson TV and he is the [inaudible], the leading man. Not only put the bustle of brotherhood, but for whom Aberdeen, Hillary's righthand. That's her man. That the Holocaust was God's punishment of the Jews for their corruption. And it will come again. Uh, this time, Allah willing at the hands of the believers is a genocidal. Nancy is Garrett Dally, and he's the image of Hillary Clinton's right hand and deputy, but in charge of bustle of affairs for the State Department. Yeah, it's a big problem. Not a little one. Yeah. So Keith Ellison is the Muslim Brotherhood. A candidate is now the number two guy in the Democratic Party, only missed by 13 boats. How could the Democratic Party embraced this? And Tom Perez is no better, but at least that'll. Allison has an open record, uh, but you know, uh, uh, being in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood, being supported by them and being a Farah can, Jew hater and America Hainer and white hater. I'm on what happened to the Democratic Party.

Speaker 2:          01:03:20       Yeah, I mean in America and stuff is amazing because even in the last couple of days, I don't follow, fabricate, verified Milo's not on twitter anymore, but I was looking at fire cannons, twitter feed or something got retweeted into my feed. I mean, it's all God will destroy America. Haydel the Jews hate white people

Speaker 3:          01:03:36       for 11 years. The spokesman for the nation of Islam. And you know, people have to repudiate what they did that, this is, this is why I say Barack Obama is a communist. He was raised by communists. He, his whole political career until he became United States senator was in the Communists, left. Uh, I mean, I know these people. Um, if you are a part of a movement that you know is evil, the first thing you want to do is warn other people about it, especially when it's so deceptive. It talks about social justice and all this crap anyway. No, well, I mean he hasn't. So that's how you know what his allegiances are. And when you asked me about the, this was earlier in our conversation about why, why is the Democratic Party so soft on Islamic terrorists? There are people of color that has to play a big role. The first thing you do is all we have to understand if they're killing people, it must be because we did something

Speaker 2:          01:04:45       very sick. Yeah. What is that self flagellation that so many people in the West have guilt. I mean, steel is really guilty of success

Speaker 3:          01:04:55       has written a whole book called white guilt. Yeah. It'll bring down our, our great civilization if it's the, you know, and we haven't talked about Donald Trump.

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       Yeah. Objective my book. Yeah. Okay. So let's, I think is, I think if we have an antidote, he's, is it? So you really believe that that trump and that, you know, was gonna say a second

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       ago when you were talking about, you know, fighting the roots of Islamic extremism. I mean, Bannon, from what I understand, seems to be the architect of that. That is a good guy. Steve Bennett. Yeah. So you don't believe him to be an anti Semite though. First of all, the chief evidence, there's evidence given that Steve Bannon is an anti Semite one is a disgruntled wife in the middle of a divorce proceeding, a custody case who said who claim that he said that Jewish children are whiny, which melt way. Well, be the case of, you know, the whole ritual of Bar Mitzvahs you shower a 13 year old with tons of money and give them an audience of adults. Okay. So they might be allowed to deal with. They might be whining, right? Um, but that's certainly not true. Waiting, right? Regardless, even if even if it did, that's not, you'd have a big deal.

Speaker 3:          01:06:19       His wife that over the kids and when they go to school and maybe the school was very expensive. There's an expensive school. The archer school, the other evidence is an article that I wrote. I gave the title tooth bill, Kristol, Republican spoiler, renegade Jew, so people who haven't read your. I read the article, I did not find anything and he's no read a gay because he, he's going to return Houma Aberdeen and Ben Rhodes, who was the architect, uh, one of the architects of the Iran deal back to power. It's a death knell for Israel. I mean, what they've done, and not to mention the United I ran isn't powerful enough to destroy the United States, but it's leaders do chant, lead, chance of death to America. That's what they believe. Why if Franklin Roosevelt gave nuclear weapons to Hitler, what will we call them? Obama is an American trader and that's because he's a communist and always has been and always will be.

Speaker 3:          01:07:23       So I know enough people are going to watch it and go, wait a minute, but the deal says that they can't get new, but you would say, well, it expires one. It expires to the effect of the deal was to lift the sanctions, bring a ran back into the community of nations. He gave them $200, billion dollars, $200, billion. 100. I forget all the payments and there's no controls. But even if there were controls, why would you bring them out of isolation? Now? Ran is running over the Middle East. They overthrew the government in Yemen, which is why we now are losing American lives, their mind. Anyway. So if some of the. So that's why I sought that crystal and I didn't attack crystal during, during the campaign, you know, look, I, you know, I can see Donald trump. I can see why he upset some people. Yeah, I can see how in my view they're exaggerated, you know, the whatever, the fears that I, you know, I don't think it per second that he's anti Mexican or a bigoted in any way.

Speaker 3:          01:08:31       Um, and it, you know, and I'm, I'm one of those people that says, well, like he's been in public life for 30 years. He didn't become a racist and until he was running against a Democrat for crying out tears, uh, I, so I, but I, I could see a lot of people would get bent out of shape during the campaign, but once he's the nominee, then it's him or hillary. And if it's Hillary, it's whom I aberdeen. I mean it's, you know, the whole anti Israel crew. So you can sympathize then with bill. Crystal is intense. So Bill Kristol, who wanted conservatism, Ole, you know, what's thought of as relied real conservative. These are, these are people treating politics as a religion. Yeah, if you don't refer to the United States is a constitutional republic conservative if you don't use the phrase limited government, limited government. He never said that, that I know what he's doing now.

Speaker 3:          01:09:28       I mean, he's cutting the government and a big. So there'll be. I mean, it's just crazy. He won me over this way. I mean, I was nervous about him through the campaign because you don't know, uh, you know, this is his first venture into politics. I don't know. I'm not nervous about him anymore, although I think he'll disappoint me on some things, but he won me over in the first debate. Here's a guy, he's never been a political candidate before, is on a platform with a 12 of the top Republicans in the country is in front of. I don't remember if it's 30 million people or whatever it is and the front and he gets the first question because he has the highest percentage in the polls and it's not a question. It's an attack from a beggar and Kelly, you called women fat pigs, slobs and dogs, and he says, oh, that was just rosie o'donnell.

Speaker 3:          01:10:27       I said, this guy is a guy. They can intimidate because political correctness is a party line. As I said, it comes from now, let's say like a Communist Party line. It shuts you up. There is no other Republican under the sun who on national TV this time in front of 50 million people would elect Hillary Clinton in the eye and said, you're a liar and a crook even though she's both. If it were a male, they would say it. Why? Because because there's this gigantic double standard, it's politically incorrect to say anything critical about a woman. This is ridiculous. If that's the case, they shouldn't be in politics. Now I've left. We'll just take that phrase, but you can't be protected and at the same time pretend to be strong. You know, it's interesting how pernicious some of this stuff is because I'll even see sometimes if if a, if a man attacked me on twitter, not that twitter fights are that important, but I'll immediately defend myself and come back and I've had a few instances where women have and I've just ignored it because I don't want to attack a woman and I know that's my own.

Speaker 3:          01:11:34       Then that's just my own reflection of what we've all been schooled in that and then there's penalties. You have to think quickly about what the consequences are, so that desire to punch back or to not be held hostage by political correctness or I said, would you argue that that is far more important than any of his political? Totally. That's what I saw. Here's a guy who the Democrats can intimidate. Look, I use this phrase in my speeches, whenever I see a Republican square off against the Democrat, it looks to me like Godzilla vs Bambi because the Republican, the Democrat is going to call the Republicans are racist or sexist or homophobic and Islamophobic, and the Republican will call the Democrat a liberal who's going to win that argument. So this is a bulldozer or, but I love the way they call trump a blitzkrieg. The Democrat blitzkrieg.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       Uh, we have a tradition in this country. It's sacred to a democracy of a honeymoon for an incoming president. It says there's a peaceful transition of power. It says we're all part of one community since we're going to see what you do have that will free to criticize you. And the remedy is the next election. Trump didn't get seven seconds, he didn't get confirmation hearings. He got a witch hunt. The, and this is another example of how political correctness works. A Jeff sessions, I've known him for 20 years, and I've known a lot of senators, one of a handful of the most decent human decent human beings in the senate. A champion of civil rights, this was an attorney general and the deep South say state who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan, who desegregated the schools and there's Elizabeth Warren calling him a racist and then violating Senate rules to repeat calling him a racist, and when she's told to shut up, they say, oh, they're silencing another woman.

Speaker 3:          01:13:34       Yeah. I tell effect of political correctness. Is it just to be clear for people that they didn't follow that whole thing? She was reading other people's words, which isn't technically allowed in the sentence so that she was doing something that she wasn't allowed to do by their own rules exam. Everyone turned it into a letter from Coretta Scott King that she was repudiated. What happened was in Alabama there were, there were three blacks who, who's were defrauded of their voting rights because they were in opposition to three other blacks who were NACP corrupt officials. That's the whole case and and a sessions didn't know how to defend himself the first time he was up in the eighties. I mean, this is a thing. Republicans are not used to fighting back that you're used to getting out of the way. Why wouldn't you if people are calling you racist, sexist, homophobic,

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       so it's obvious to me that that stuff is not working as much anymore. So then my last question, given that that is amazing, right? So the words aren't, but what I now think is we're going to see more violence because they've been pinned into a corner where everyone that they're against is a Nazi and a racist and all those things. So I suspect we're going to see more violence. But my last question to you is with this evolution with, with now the first Republican, as you were saying with trump, that's not going to take it. What's the good path now? Like what if you could see something good coming out of these next couple of years? What is that path?

Speaker 3:          01:15:05       No, I am a Antonio Gramsci won't said that the revolutionary for the revolutionary must have pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will and I think he stole that from somebody or I can't. I can't remember who, but I think he did it. It's in wikipedia. Well, if it's in Wikipedia, but definitely stolen from somebody, I um, yeah, I, you know, my head was telling me there's nothing is good. Is gonna come and you know, and you can see, I mean, there's so many, so many problems of, you know, as I pointed out in, in, in my, in my book, big agenda, the left, the Democratic Party. Uh, it's a totalitarian party now. It lied to get obamacare and lied about. You can keep your doctor lied about, you can keep your plan. And it, and its mission was control. It's a credible assault on individual freedom.

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       The government tells you you have to have insurance. The government tells you you have to have, you have, what are they for packages. This is the kind of insurance you have to have. And the government gets all your health information. That is a totalitarian threat right there. But Republicans, they're lame. Why aren't they saying that? So replacing Obamacare is obviously, um, you know, as, as we're speaking and Republicans are all in disarray. Um, I dunno, I don't know what's going to happen of trump is fairly isolated. You have all these conservative idiots like crystal, um, and make mullen gunning for him. A Republicans marched to the tune of their own set of traumas all the time were individualist. I was amazed when the tea party came in and held a demonstration in Washington before that you couldn't get three Republicans to march together because they look at each other and say, what are we collecting this?

Speaker 3:          01:17:21       So does that. Then Eric said it was the last question, but we'll keep going for a bit. So there's that though. So when the tea party organized and the tea party was gaining momentum, everyone was saying there were these redneck back race, very decent people who cleaned up after themselves. That's just destructive. Nobody was hurt. There was no violence. Cops this, when people start referring to the left as fascists and not liberals, then I'll say, okay, we're winning now. Right now it isn't happening. They go on. They, like I say, I mean, it's corrupted our culture. It's corrupted our schools. Uh, I just very, very bad. But I think, you know, I, I, my faith isn't Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller. These are two fighters and trump and trump understands instinctively that when you get attacked, you attack back and throw them off. Well, I, I have this phrase that I, I picked up from Chris Lehane is a democratic, uh, was in the New York Times article about him, a democratic strategists, but he, he stole it from Mike Tyson, which is everybody has a game plan until you punch them in the mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:18:38       And the Democrats have a massive punch in the mouth for Republicans calling them racists and Republicans at the Comeback and Democrats. The Democratic Party is the party of racism. It's the party of racial categories. It's the party of identity politics. It's the party of the inner cities. It is a racist party. It is also, and I loved this, but what trump said in the was in the second debate, he turned to the cameras and said, you have to understand Hillary has tremendous hatred in her heart. And what he was referring to was the basket of deplorables, which he named. She identified all of her opponents or whatever. Half it was. The same thing, um, are racist, sexist, homophobes, Islamophobes. Xenophobes, you name it and he's raised them up. There isn't a conservative or a deviating liberal who hasn't been in an argument with a so called liberal who hasn't been called a racist or sexist or homophobic to in a way that was a gift. The Democratic Party is a party of hate. That's what they run on. Everything they're doing now is, is hate invent conspiracy theories with the Russians. I mean this from a party who's candidate turned over 20 percent of America's uranium reserves that are Russians. I mean, how do you deal with that? The only way and politics. You have a nine second soundbite. Just go for the juggler.

Speaker 2:          01:20:12       Well, I hope I don't want you. I, I like your style. I want to see if we can convert people at way. Yeah. Well I think interesting, isn't it? I think interestingly, people or can be converted on both sides because I think what's happening is I, I know for sure that I've helped a lot of progressives realized what true liberalism is and at the same time I think I've had and I know that I've gotten a lot of more conservative people to realize that not all liberals are bad. And I think that's where most of us actually are. That's good. I don't want to take anything away from you, but I, I found

Speaker 3:          01:20:45       when I came into the right, I conservatives are generally very decent people. And when I criticize the religious right leadership, I had different reactions from things like the Family Research Council. I had people in my face, blood vessels popping screaming at me. Um, and I had people who were very supportive, very Christian, uh, and that way. And I also had this experience in the 2008. I was at the moral majority, uh, Ralph Reed and invited me to come down to Atlanta. And the woman who, who was my connection there and a moral majority member, I asked her, I said, well, if John McCain gets the nomination, will you vote for him? And she said, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:21:36       So you know, people that what the, what the religious right needs to understand is that there's religion and there's politics and religion is about saving your immortal soul and if you mess with the devil you in danger it and politics, you make pacts with the devil all the time. It's about getting into office and trying to practically changed some things. And one thing that I wanted to talk yes to talk to you about that I just remembered it. The home studio so we can keep going. Yeah, you go ahead. Go ahead. Is this um, why is the, why is the left and now so called liberalism? Why are progressive totalitarians? And the answer is that they, it's, it's a crypto. Religious ideology. It's modeled on Christianity in the world is a fallen place so that he never used that. The world is an oppressive place. It's injustice rules. But there will be a redemption and we are the redeemer's. That's the danger we have to re and they use it all the time. We have to remake humanity so it fits our model of the redemption. That's why they're so, so if only Bernie was in, we have to outlaw. We have to stamp out racist, sexist, homophobic people who we disagree with. Milo, we can let him speak.

Speaker 2:          01:23:09       That is what is the only difference between that and an actual totalitarian state is if they had the power, they would execute my law. It'd be in a gulag or he'd be dead. Do you remember? There was a line a couple of years ago that oprah who and I basically like Oprah and respect are open and I'd be happy to run the show. Of course when she was talking about the older generation and some of their backwards ways, Vega and she said, well, we just, they just have to die. I remember thinking like, even if what you're saying that yes, there might be, you know, studies show that younger people are generally more liberal on the social issue, not more liberal. They'll, right. The older blacks are liberal. That's why Oprah doesn't like them that so well, that sort of fits everything else that you're saying, but. But my point being that when she said, it sounds so nice to me because one day if you just, if you take that logic to its end, guess what? One day the young people are gonna want all of you did when you're old because it just will. It'll just keep going. Can't try to make sense out of it. But it is, it's the reverse. It's the actually the reverse shareholder. Blacks

Speaker 3:          01:24:14       I know as racist, as younger blacks, racism is pervasive now. I mean this is a very politically incorrect to say, but I think it's pretty obvious racist, pervasive racism is pervasive in the black community and especially among younger people who've been to schools and told that their all their problems come from white racist. Very bad. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:24:41       the fifties were much better times in this country. So I think I only got a half answer then before you said my head doesn't have a lot of hope. Something to that effect about Roger. But what about you? Well, I'm, I'm an optimist by genes. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:24:56       Wow. I am. I just am. I, you know, I phrased it in a book I wrote. I, when my head is in conflict with my heart, I followed my heart, so I'm going to fight so I drop as long. There's going to be a positive outcome. But um, you know, there's that. What was his name? Skipio Africanness was a Roman general who burned carthage. And when he saw carthage going up in smoke, he wept because the classical view was that, oh, it's all cyclical empires rise and fall, societies rise and fall. And this idea of progress is one of the really bad ideas that the Jews gave to us. The idea, what is the promise land, although maybe Moses didn't beat it in a way that left this meeting, but that idea of a progress is the problem. Can't redeem the world, can't be fixed. Why can't the world be fixed? Because the root source of all social problems is us individuals. So you can maybe, you know, it's, it's very hard to take one individual who's gone off the day band and bring them back. Yeah. But you know, modest. It's, you know, and this is the oldest thing as the voltaire 10 year old garden. You can make the space around. You may be a little bit more humane. You can help an individual, but you can't change the world.

Speaker 2:          01:26:38       Well, on that note I sent, we could do a lot more, so we'll have to do this again. Okay. We'll see. Maybe we'll do this. How about we do this one year from now and we'll see if I've incorporated optimist. I'm an optimist. I can't. No, I'm old enough to know that, that, that will be a blessing. You're 78 years old. How do you look? So good.

Speaker 3:          01:27:00       Your makeup,

Speaker 2:          01:27:01       that's all the makeup. No, I saw you when you walk in and come on. What's the trick?

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       No, no. I have a great marriage. Wonderful Wife. Um, I tried to balance the political with you. Real, real life stuff. My animals. I have all these dogs I love. Um, yeah. I don't know. And it's also in the genes.

Speaker 2:          01:27:28       All right. One year from now we will do it again. And for more on David, you can check out his new book, big agenda of President Trump's plan to save America and visit Horowitz, freedom center.org.
