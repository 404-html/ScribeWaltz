Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I truly don't know if I could've come up with a more perfect guest for the first episode of the show. Sam Harris is a neuroscientist, author and founder of project reason and according to some people, he's also a genocidal maniac, bent on nuking, much of the Middle East. Sam, welcome to the show. Thank you. Pleasure to be here. Which, which half of that would you say describes you better? We'll talk about both halves, I imagine. Yeah. I'll take the first though. Well I'm, I'm really thrilled that you're here and that, you know, you came in for my first show. You said you were going to come in and October when your book comes out, but I twisted your arm sufficiently and, and here you are. Yeah. Well congratulations on the show too. Thanks. I appreciate it. Alright, so let's start. Um, I want to start basically were sort of, I really found out about you and where I think this whole discussion that we've, every, everyone's been having for the last eight months or so started and you were on real time with Bill Maher and you were on to talk about your book. Bill was talking about liberalism and Islam and Ben Affleck was on, and I know everyone's seen this clip already, but let's take a look when

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       you want to talk about the treatment of women and homosexuals and free thinkers and, and public intellectuals in the Muslim world. Uh, I would argue that the liberals have failed us and the crucial point

Speaker 3:          00:01:13       confusion, like, yeah, thank God you're here. The crucial point of confusion

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       and is that, that we have been sold this meme of Islamophobia where every criticism of the doctrine of Islam gets conflated with bigotry toward Muslims as people. Right? That is, it's

Speaker 3:          00:01:31       intellectually ridiculous. So even if it gets cold,

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       hold on. Who the person who understands the officially codified doctrine of Islam. You say, well, this is actually well educated on this topic. I'm asking you if I criticize the, you're saying that Islamophobia is not a real thing, that if you're critical of something, it's not a real thing when we do it. Right? Well, no, it really is. I'm not denying that that certain people are bigoted against Muslims as people and that's a problem big have you. But the gross, it's racist and it's not. It's, but it's so nice. So it's like saying nine years shifted, you know what we are saying, you guys are saying if you want to be liberals believe in liberal principles of freedom of speech. Like you know, we are endowed by our forefathers of the low, like all men are created. No Fan. We have to be able to criticize bad ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       So first off, I think it's gross. It's racist. Should be your twitter bio. Have you considered putting it there? People have been just throwing that at me on twitter ever since. Yeah, yeah. No, it's a bit of a meme. Yeah. So what I want to start with is, because I think there's obviously a ton of. We can talk about the fallout of this and we'll get to that, but I want to talk about actually the specifics of what happened there. Did you expect. Because usually when they bring on the guests that sits on bill's side of the table, usually it's for a one on one with bill and sort of a casual conversation. The panel doesn't really jump in. Did you expect that whole thing to explode the way that it did? No. No, not at all. I was selling a book on meditation at that moment I was talking and the first year, that's about 60 seconds into the exchange. Yeah. And so initially

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       it starts with, you know, how can an atheist be spiritual and there was a. we're talking along those lines and I said something slightly derogatory about the new age and Ben jumped into that space and, and you know, it was at my throat about Islam hadn't even come up so he clearly was poised to do that and yeah, it's considered a protected interview. Everyone on the panel knows they're not supposed to jump in. What do you think was going on with Ben? Well, apart from him possibly being on steroids for his, uh, his Batman role, um, I dunno, I just think he clearly had he, I think he had no idea who I was really, but someone had given him a paragraph bio of me and had, had more or less told him that, you know, I'm a, a bigot who's intolerant of Muslims and, you know, he really should, you know, take a whack at me on that topic.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       Yeah. And honestly, I was, I think I was a little slow to appreciate how hostile he was because I wasn't just looking at him. I was actually looking at Nick Kristoff, who I have actually collided with on this topic and who my remarks were more pitched to, I think more appropriately pitched because nick really deals with, with, uh, especially women's rights issues in the developing world to a unique degree. So I had a bit of a bone to pick with nick and um, and there were other. Michael Steele was on the panel and so my attention was split and so I wasn't just kind of out of the corner of my consciousness was I was understanding that there was a level of hostility here that I didn't really expect or know how to interpret and so talking about knowing how to interpret it, like it's a little different if, if Nick Kristoff or some author or a philosopher had immediately jumped out at you like that, I think perhaps it would have dealt with it in one way, but when a big.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       I mean this is an a list Hollywood star, this is Batman jumps at you that way. Did that throw you off in a way that you look, you were cool and collected there, but just having to deal with someone at that level, it's a different ballgame, you know? Yeah. Well it's hard to interrupt a, a, a movie star who doesn't want to be interrupted. So at a certain point, you know, if bill's not going to cut them off, I can't cut them off. So trying to get a word in edgewise is a challenge there. But I mean, the irony is the sentence, he was reacting to the sentence where I say everyone conflates criticism of Islam instead of ideas with bigotry against Muslims as people. Uh, he no sooner no sooner were those words uttered. Then he demonstrated my thesis with every subsequent statement and it was just impossible to, to get that mirror bent, you know, close enough toward his face so that he could recognize what, what he was doing. So he literally, for the remainder of the 12 minutes, I mean, he continually go and repeatedly proved your theory. Then I continued for an hour in the green room afterwards and it was, it was, it was by no means resolved. Yeah. And clearly hasn't resolved since. All right. So

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I don't want to focus too much on that specifically, but I just want to talk about when someone throws, you know, he throws this, it's gross, it's racist. Suddenly I noticed that the next day the onus was on you and Bill Maher. And a little more to bill I think to prove that you weren't racist. I have never been a big fan of bills for a long time. I've never heard anyone call him racist ever before, but suddenly the next day on all the websites, it was Ben Affleck Call Sam Harris and bill and my racist is Ben, is Bill Maher Racist? Is Sam Harris Racist? How does that feel in that moment of the discussion when someone throws that gauntlet down because you're, you're, you're used to debate and people with ideas, not just words.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       Well, it's very dispiriting because it's almost guaranteed to convince half the audience happy and this is something. This is the first thing I said to Ben afterwards in the green room, I said, you realize just calling us racist, convinced half the people listening and watching that were racist and leaders are using that word is enough for people. So people just assume where there's smoke, there's fire. They can't figure out what anyone is actually saying that their attention span is so truncated that using words like that, uh, again, just convinces fully half the audience. And the most depressing thing in the aftermath of this was to see the outpouring of the celebration of disproportionally and the Muslim community on social media from people who thought that he had just mopped the floor with us, that he had exposed our racism for all to see and he had argued brilliantly and he's just this white knight for the Muslim world. And it was so embarrassing because he, of course he did none of that. He was, he wasn't making any sense. He wasn't listening to what we were actually saying. And he was simply, um, uh, you know, calling us names, know very loaded names and, and it, it works for people who want to perceive the conversation along those lines.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       Was there was this meme or this idea of you as a racist, was that even out there? Because now I see it in a dialogue all the time. But, but I had never heard of it. And to be 100 percent honest with you, I had sort of ancillary knew your work. I'm not even sure if I was following you on twitter at the time. So I know a lot of people when they're done with this, they're going to have just as Sam Harris fanboy and blah blah, blah, blah, blah. But I really, I didn't. I was watching that and I thought, well, here's someone making some sense. And Now ben Affleck's just using the worst kind of language with him. But was that idea about you out there before?

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       Well, not. Well, yeah, I think Glenn Greenwald and a few other people had put it out there. So it was, I mean, it's, it's a trope of, um, political politically correct liberal apology around criticism of Islam. So this notion of Islamophobia, the idea that, that to single out Islam for any special attention as a set of doctrines or as a political in today's world is tantamount to synonymous with or covertly motivated by racist bigotry toward Arabs are Brown skinned people. Um, and you know, there are many people like Glenn Greenwald who quite irresponsibly, you know, make that point again and again. Um, and so, yeah, so, so ben's a started. That was not the first time criticism of Islam has been conflated with racism, but it's, it's, I mean it's such a crazy claim because it, I mean this has been pointed out again and again, and bill's done this, but Islam is not a race.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       It's a set of ideas. You can't convert away from a race. You can't convert to erase Rachel Dolezal. You can get this right. You. Yes you can. You can. A few at one person can do that. Everything I say about Islam applies to white, converts to the faith every bit as much as it does to, to Arabs or, or anyone born into it. Sure. In fact, even more so because that means you've had, if you're 30 years old and had not had this drummed into you on mother's knee and with a full adult, you know, clear viewing of, of your life and all the opportunities available to you, you decide to convert to the most doctrinaire and repressive form of Islam. Well then then I have the most to say about you. You know, someone like Adam. Good. Don, who's the. I think he's now dead, but I'm the guy from Orange County who joined al Qaeda, you know, this is, these are so and everything I say about Islam as a religion. That is true. I've said some disparaging things about it as a set of ideas and I've compared it unfavorably to Buddhism and Hinduism, which you know, their, their adherence are, are for the most part not white like me. So the idea that racism has the notions of race has anything to do with this is just completely crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       I took the top five things that I think people attack you on my opinion, misquote you on and I thought maybe we could take five minutes for each one, five or six minutes for each one and that way each time someone says, well, Sam Harris wants to nuke the Middle East, or Sam Harris wants to racially profile Muslims or whatever it is. You or I or anyone that's clear-minded can just send a link and say, here it is in five minutes. You don't have to read a book. You don't have to watch a three hour interview here. I think the number one thing that people say about you is that when you say Islam, you mean all Muslims. Right? Right. So take it away.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       Yeah. So the, the claim is that I generalize about Muslims and this is incredibly ironic because half the time on, in that film clip, uh, was spent where I was talking about statistics and poll results and percentages and a certain percentage is jihadist and then there's a wider circle of, of Islamists and then there's a wider, wider circle of conservatives. And so I never generalize about the Muslim world and in so far as we have good data on the numbers of people who subscribed various beliefs that I'm always looking at those data. And so I'm at everything I say about the problem of, of Islam and Islamism, um, takes as its area of concern. First and foremost, the people living in the Muslim world who are living under the shadow of, of, if not the boot of theocracy. So you know, women and gays and free thinkers and public intellectuals and atheists.

Speaker 2:          00:12:22       People who email me saying they're afraid their, their mother and father will kill them. If they knew they were an atheist, for instance, um, and there's nobody who I, who I celebrate more than Muslim apostates and muzzle and true reformist Muslims like my coauthor on this new book, Magenta was who have taken just heroic risks to say critical things about the faith in a context where it's much more dangerous to do so then the context and where were you and I live and I mean, so, you know, if I were a Muslim in Pakistan saying half of what I'm saying on this show, I would have a life expectancy of about five hours and that is a, that is a political and human rights reality that every liberal who's using this term Islamophobia is disregarding at, at, not at their peril, at the peril of all the people who are not being helped by, um, by Westerners who could help, you know, and non Muslims who could help and what non Muslims can do is help in whatever way possible to make criticism of theocracy in the Muslim world.

Speaker 2:          00:13:30       Safe to do so. Yeah. No, I don't generalize. And I think, um, of course there are millions and millions of Muslims who do not take the barbaric passages in the Quran and the Hadith seriously and who are not wanting to kill apostates and don't and don't want to throw gays from rooftops. And those are not the people I'm talking about. I mean, or if I'm ever talking about them in my criticism of religion, I'm talking about them in the same spirit that I talk about, you know, reformed Jews or, or non-doctrinaire Christians who are, who are not a real threat to anybody who but who, or but who may be bending public policy around in ways we don't like. The problem with many of those Muslims is they don't want their religion criticized at all and they don't want any link between its core tenants. Could tenants around Jihad and paradise and martyrdom.

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       A spelled out, uh, with, you know, in terms of it's, it's the way it's generating the kinds of violence and intolerance where we're seeing in the world today. So in so far, if you're going to defend your religion by saying Islam is a religion of peace and the Islamic state has nothing to do with Islam, you're being intellectually dishonest. And that kind of denial of obvious realities now is I think, you know, irresponsible and dangerous. Yeah. Just to close the door to notions of racism and bigotry against Muslims as people. And I think, I think the apostates, the intellectuals, the women, um, the gaze of the Muslim world are the most, the most important people in the world right now. If we, if we could give green cards to every real secularist in the Muslim world, I think they should just get to the front of the line.

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       I mean, these are, these are the people who need to be empowered. And so that's um, I mean, the irony is that they, if they could leave the Muslim world, the Muslim world needs them, right? So maybe we, the best thing to do would be to empower them in the Muslim world. But method, you know, life for these people is, um, in countries like Pakistan and Bankman, we have Bangladeshi blogger is being murdered in public by machete wielding maniacs and nothing happens, right? Um, it's, um, yeah, I mean, I, so my, everything I say about Islam is a confession of solidarity with these people. And so how you get racism out of that or bigotry against Muslims as people, you know, that's you. You're a better geometer than I. This is, this is a big one and I've seen this one really take a life of its own that you want to do a nuclear first strike on the Muslim world, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:16       Is that true, Sam? No, no. Alas, it's not true. Okay. Um, I guess it, it was made, made true apparently, or at least to the satisfaction of many people by Chris Hedges who went around in every stop on his book tour Know Radio, television, print telling people that this was in fact my position. Um, and many people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza Aslan, and you know, you're a old colleague, Janky, eager, have, have, have reiterated this claim. There are a couple of passages in the my first book, the end of faith where I talk about how a certainty about paradise and about martyrdom is the best way to get there, just destroys the logic of nuclear deterrence, of mutually assured destruction that we had kept us more or less poised on the brink of a mutual annihilation with the Soviet Union for so many years. Uh, and I just pointed out what I think is an obvious fact and still isn't obvious.

Speaker 2:          00:17:18       Facts should be an obvious fact and a very troubling one that if you have a regime that has the, the, that is the psychological equivalent of the 19 hijackers, but people who woke up in the morning wanting to fly a plane into a building that is a regime who you can't, they're not rational actors, you can't, or if they're rational, it's rational within a context of believing that they're going to paradise this way. Right? So what's the rational part of that? Yeah, but it's rare. If you believe that it's rational to blow up the world, you know, it's rational to hit the wall 400 miles an hour. So, um, this is not, so I pointed out the obvious fact that we have to avoid the circumstance at all costs and there's no one who should be more cognizant of this problem then so-called moderate Muslims or so or secular Muslims or non jihadist, uh, Muslims and um, we have to collectively find some path to a alternative future in which you don't have a true jihadist regime armed with a long range.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       Nuclear Weapons and all of those long range is, is crucial. And so you have Pakistan, Pakistan already has nuclear weapons. Do I think we should execute a nuclear first strike on packs? Pakistan? No, in Pakistan is not first of all age hottest regime and though, you know, they're one cool away from being taken over by one, but they're also, they don't have the warheads that can deliver these nukes to the capitals of Europe or to the US. Um, it's a very different circumstance. And um, so yes, no, there's nothing that I say in that book, the suggests that we should be nuking Iran, you know, and it's just, this is all I was talking about is how the kind of game theoretic logic of nuclear deterrence that we lived however precariously under, with the Soviet Union falls apart. Once you admit to yourself that it's possible that truly suicidal religious maniacs can get their hands on these weapons.

Speaker 2:          00:19:20       And so all I was calling for his, his, um, our awareness that is a, that really is a game changer and we have to avoid that at all cost. Right? And you know, you said this was just a few passages in your book. It was literally about a page, right? It's like a paragraph or two. Yeah. Right. So when people have blown this up into, into some something that somehow this is like this massive idea that you had actually a good friend of mine who I agree with that a lot of things and disagree on some other things. Uh, he, what he says to me in relation to this is that you are laying the philosophical groundwork for a nuclear first strike. People respond to this passage as though I invented nuclear weapons or that I think there are a good thing. I'm just talking about the reality of our world.

Speaker 2:          00:20:03       We have a, we have a nuclear policy, right? We have a first strike policy. We have a. So someone somewhere in a war room has, has beaten out every choice point in terms of what are the circumstances where we would use nuclear weapons first, what are the circumstances where we would do, where we would, um, uh, where we would imagine that they're going to be used against us first and then have to preempt that. And uh, this has all been thought out in a Cold War context. We haven't had to worry about anyone else doing this to us. And when you're talking about other regimes like China or North Korea, there are, um, there's a plausible assumption that they're not suicidal then that everyone isn't eager to die. Right? And now we are talking about a set of ideas, you know, jihadist eschatology to this, this idea that, that martyrdom is a real metaphysical principle and it's not only okay to die in the right circumstances is the best possible thing that can happen to you.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       Um, and that there really is, there's no such thing as innocent collateral damage because all the good people are going to go to paradise with you and they're just going to thank you for it, right? So there's nothing can go wrong and this world is just fit to be destroyed. That is the ideology that you see in a happily a, a small minority of Muslims at this moment. But it is not an accident that these people feel this way because it's, it's a very plausible, literal reading of the texts during real time. You said that Islam is the mother lode of that ideas. Now I've seen since I've seen you tweeted someone you tweeted a couple of weeks ago at somebody that Judaism is a motherload of bad ideas. Well, I should've said the motherlode. I mean, that was, that was the one moment in that exchange with, with athletic wear.

Speaker 2:          00:21:57       Um, it seems to me, I misspoke. I mean it was just insane. V as opposed to a what, because I obviously I've written, I've written more about Christianity then Islam, right? So I criticize religion in general. I think faith based religion is the mother lode of bad ideas. My faith, faith based thinking, this idea that somehow you're wanting something to be true is a good surrogate for evidence that it is true, right? And, and a way in which you can embrace self deception and deception of others as a legitimate principal. Um, that I think as a mother lode of bad ideas and religion has kind of a corner on that market at the moment. But, uh, Islam is an especially dangerous a variant of it within our current political rally or I should say Islamism as opposed to Islamic general. So when you, when you say that you're talking about because of the Geo politics, because of the maturation of the religion itself, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       We know that Judaism is far older, Christianity's older, they've gone through different reformations. So partly this just has to do with timing, right? Yeah. It's not old, but unfortunately it's not only time, but timing is enough to differentiate them because obviously Christianity 500 years ago was Christians were burning people alive, but the on street corners, by the way, you've written a ton about that. Oh yeah. This isn't just saying. You're saying to me right now. No, I've written more about that. I wrote a whole book just on Christianity. I have done that with Islam except this, um, this newest book that I wrote with the Majid Nawaz. So, you know, there are, there are historical differences between Islam and Christianity and other religions. And there, there are unfortunately theological differences that make Islam a harder doctrine to modify. But it's just as, as a sheer matter of history, Islam has not had a reformation, a, a, an enlightenment.

Speaker 2:          00:23:52       I mean, they had, hasn't had the, hasn't been modulating buy maternity in the same way. And um, you're talking about for the most part, people who have been intellectually isolated to a degree that, that should be unheard of, but it's still quite common in the 21st century and unhappily they are, they're isolated from the ideas and ways of thinking that the give a science and give us a commitment to human rights and give us a commitment to pluralism and democracy, but they're not isolated from the destructive enabling technology that we've produced. So you have people who are legitimate engineers, right. And legitimate, you know, computer scientists even who are jihadists. Right? Who wants, who will use the tools of maternity against any kind of set of modern values that, that we would be wise to defend.

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       Yeah. All right. So I think what you said is it is not the mother load, but it is a motherload within the context of timing, geopolitics and, and a whole bunch of others. Yeah. No, I certainly should've said a motherload about it. It's the next one. You want to racially profile Muslims, right? That was a painful. Yeah. Now, yeah, I've, uh, I read your piece on it. If that's the case, you actually want to, you're either Muslim where you want to actually go screw yourself. I am of the race that should be profiled. Yeah. So can you explain that a little bit more? So we've all had this experience of going through

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       clarity and seeing people who at a glance you can rule out as a non jihadist. I mean we, we, all I've argued for in, in, in the few things I've said about profiling is that we should be honest about where, what we're looking for. We're looking for gi suicidal jihadists. Now there are other, you know, there are other suicidal people who may bring down planes, but as, as a general matter, we're looking for people who are the functional equivalent of the 19 hijackers, right? So we're not looking for an 80 year old women from Okinawa. We're not looking for a little girls from Norway. If Jerry Seinfeld is going to the airport, if he gets the same search that, that someone who looks like Osama bin Ladin does, that's a crazy misuse of resources. Now there are little wrinkles here that we can correct for. It's possible to put a bomb and someone else's bags.

Speaker 2:          00:26:14       All banks should be searched. I mean the. Yes, you can think this through, but there are people who you absolutely know at a glance are not terrorists. Right. And any moment spent scrutinizing them in this security theater we've all witnessed at TSA is a moment not actually intelligently looking for a more plausible threat. So I met my. My view is we have $10 worth of attention. If you spend a dollar over here, you've got nine to spend elsewhere. Right. So it's just a zero sum game. And so my, my sense is, because again, we, we need well trained smart people at Tsa to do that. So that's a whole other. Yeah. So it's not, it's not like we're well poised to do this, but when you look at what the Israelis do, when you look at you, if you ever get on l and you look at how they run security, yes, they look at everybody, but there's, there's, there's absolutely no pretense of being fair in this process and there shouldn't be.

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       Right? It's just like a. and when I go through security, you know, 50 percent of the people to me look like, and I'm not, I'm not saying that I'm an expert here, but I'm, you know, I pay attention to this sort of stuff a lot. Um, I would be willing to bet my life that certain people are just in this blog post. I showed a picture of one. I'm a one old woman who you just know it's, there's absolutely no way she's joined. Okay. So you look at her and you say, okay, the scrutiny on her is a waste of time and it's a dangerous waste of time. And in the interest of appearing fair and we are actually ramping up our risk, um, and being appearing right because it's just appearing. It's not actually. Yeah. But you and I fit it, fit the profile, you know, young to middle aged men who could be, we could be jihadists right there.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       There are jihadists who ally. Like, as I said, you know, Adam Gadahn or um, uh, and in these other western recruits to al Qaeda or isis who functionally look like us. They're not, they don't look like Arabs, they're not, you know, they're not holding Pakistani passports. Um, so yeah, no, I'm not letting myself off the hook here. It's not like I, you know, I want me and the other white guys to just sail through. It's just, it's just there. There are still people who are obviously not jihadists and until these people start blowing themselves up on planes I am, I think we're, we'd be wise to just admit we know what we're looking for, we have, we have some sense of what we're looking for. And just to be crystal clear in that post, you literally said, I'm just reiterating what you just said, but that you should be picked out and you actually should be picked up.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       And as I describe it as anti profiling, it's not that I want certain people profiled. I just want us to admit that certain people require less scrutiny. And you know, Jerry Seinfeld is one, you know, when you see a famous celebrity, you know, go through security, treat it as though he just may have become a jihadist, you know, and you know, when, when no one was watching, it just, it's crazy making it is security theater. Yeah. And there, there, there are many people who though not famous, are every bit as unlikely to be members of al Qaeda as a prominent people who we know, you know, Betty White, betty, Betty White is, is, uh, I would not be happy about that. That would be a surprise. Yeah, I will have one if they weren't. Betty white gets a profile. All right. So the final one of these sort of five pillars of Sam Harris being the big one is your anneal con. Uh, so I think we should define neo-con first. You want to, you want to handle that or do you want me to. Well, I think it means many things to many people, but it's, it's the,

Speaker 4:          00:29:54       uh, it's the,

Speaker 2:          00:30:00       the attitude toward foreign policy that I think most was, was canonized by people like Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz in the run up to,

Speaker 4:          00:30:09       um, uh, the first, uh, uh, or our, our invasion of Iraq after nine slash 11.

Speaker 2:          00:30:18       This idea that we can go in in a very muscular way and just create nations along democratic lines and that our foreign policy should be very aggressive and, and, um, we'll fight them over there so we don't have to fight them here. And

Speaker 4:          00:30:33       um,

Speaker 2:          00:30:34       I think we've all, I mean I was, you know, I was never for the Iraq war. I was never a vocally against it either. I just was at every moment through that process, I was just painfully aware that I had no idea what to think about it. Apart from it looked very risky and it looked like a frank distraction from the war in Afghanistan, which did seem to me to be necessary and seemed like something we were probably gonna botch. One thing you can say against neoconservatism, which is that it is idealistic to a degree that now seems not at all sustainable. I mean we, W we, we should have learned a lesson at this point, which is we don't do this very well. We don't nation build very well. We have a political environment where we just can't stay committed to these things. Even if we were, we're doing it well, you know, we, we, we, we view everything through a four year, you know, Presidential Lens and an election cycle.

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       And so, and these are, these are multi-decade commitments if we're going to do this as well. So, um, but Iraq looks like a disaster and it looked like a disaster for most of the time apart from, you know, 15 minutes thereafter, the surge. Um, and I certainly don't consider myself an neo-con. I just, I, I just think we have to be honest about in ethical terms, what is really going on in the world when you, if you're going to say that we never should have gone into Iraq, which I think is a reasonable thing to say. And it was a reasonable thing to say then you just, you only decent to admit how depressing a claim this really is. Ms Dot. We're saying that, that Iraq is a place that requires a psychopathic thug to run it in a given the level of religious sectarianism, given the fact that when you remove a butcher like Saddam Hussein, everyone starts killing their neighbor, right? Which is, which is in fact what happened. And, and which is in fact they political and religious reality. We underestimated when we walked in there thinking that they were just going to put flowers in the barrels of our guns and welcome us as liberators.

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       Uh, so it's a, um, it's a very depressing thing to admit about the state of, of a place like Iraq. But I, and I think we should all mean I view Iraq as initially we went when Saddam was there as a, as a kind of hostage crisis when you have a totally illegitimate regime run by barbarians, uh, keeping tens of millions of people hostage. And, and so the people who criticize the war based on saying that it was a sovereign government. And we should never have gone in there. It's not just a failure to engage with the moral reality, which is this was a terrible place to live and if we could have done something to help these people, we should have. And there are many countries that fit that description. I mean North Korea is one of them. If there would be some way to, to depose that regime and liberate the North Koreans, we should do it now.

Speaker 2:          00:33:37       We know that it would just be a bloody mess if we tried and we're learning that more and more in, in these other societies. But um, and so, so neoconservatism, I don't know what its current state is now, but I can't imagine anyone is, you know, even Wolfowitz or parole is a, I can't imagine any of them are, are as saying what about the possibility of building a nation anywhere from scratch. Right. That's actually a great point. Like, are these guys still believing that idea? Do they think if we went back into a rack right now, would it, would it be any better? I somehow doubt it. No, no I. and it's. But the idea that that we created isis by going into a rack, that's also just delusional, I mean the, the, the set of ideas that get gives us isis, that is the set of ideas and the level of sectarianism that gave us the civil war that, that, you know, we, we could barely contain a that drove us out of Iraq and that set of ideas in one or another degree has been animating a subset of the Muslim world for a very long time.

Speaker 2:          00:34:41       Right. So this is where I think some of your critics would say, well, you're blaming things more on religion than the geopolitics because had we never gone to Iraq, Saddam would still be there and that isis would be controlled. But basically you're saying this, this thing sorta would have bubbled up one way or another. Is that so? But no, but if isis, those religious sectarian commitments were controlled by a dictator a that's. Yeah. That's. That seems to me an intrinsically unstable situation. At some point they're going to, they're going to bubble up. But I'm. Let's just admit how depressing that remedy is. And we're talking about someone who's got a torture chamber, is running full time and he's got sons who show up at people's weddings and rape the bride. And I mean, it's just, it's like this is just a playground for sociopath's, if that's what it takes to modulate the, the Sunni Shia Internet saying, uh, uh, animosity, you know, that's, it's a, um, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:49       That, that does not exonerate religion, right? And it does not exonerate at that level of commitment to a device of theology. Uh, and so it's, um, and they're, you know, I think it's a, uh, yeah, I, I think it is totally appropriate to be humble about how hard it is to help people in these circumstances. But if you look at a place like Rwanda, right where Clinton's one regret was that we didn't do more to help, uh, or to, to prevent that genocide. Um, and if you look at, at a total failure to intervene and the resulting massacre of nearly a million people, and you say, okay, that was, that was something we, we should not play that hand precisely that way again. Right? We should do something differently. We should have intervened. Well then what do you think we should do to the, you know, the, what's happening to these cds and in, under the Islamic state, you know, we got people being crucified by the side of the road.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       We've got thousands of sex slaves. We've got gay is being thrown from rooftops. We. So do we intervene or not? I think it's, um, it's not obvious, uh, that there's anything we can do in each one of these circumstances to help people. But the idea that you are a moral monster to even think that we should intervene is deeply suspect. Yeah. All right. So one of my intentions with this show is that I really want to talk about ideas and not people and I think that's what we've done so far for the half hour or so, but I do think sometimes you have to address certain people within the context of these conversations. So I have to talk about one of your favorite people to start. Reza Aslan, who in my view has repeatedly mischaracterize and misrepresented your abuse. He's done this in a very forum. I've seen him, you know, say to my former boss jaggery that you and bill, you know, that this is about all Muslims than the day later I'll see them on Huffington Post live saying that bill is his friend.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       I mean, just a myriad of things that don't sort of add up. It also, it sounds like maybe he half made up his bio. Again, I don't want to make this about people, but sometimes I do think this has to be addressed. So you want to just take that and put it somewhere because I also sense that you're sort of tired. We're talking about right. Didn't you say on twitter that you just weren't going to do it anymore and then. And then he feels like the mafia, like you get sucked back in, right? Yeah. Well, so yeah, I took, I declared a unilateral ceasefire at one point on my podcast saying that I would never mentioned these people again unless absolutely necessary. Um, but yeah, like I kind of painted myself into a corner there because they don't stop. So you know, people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza are the, have the larger platforms.

Speaker 2:          00:38:33       But there are many people who fit this description where they, they seem to imagine that it's fair and intellectually legitimate to misrepresent the views of their opponents as a way of sliming them because they know it's effective. It's like, if you can just get something to stick, that's good because the person you're arguing against is, um, so I'm unethical in his or her commitments that it's, this is the end justifies the means. Right? So, and, and I'm noticing more and more of this. This is obviously not a problem just with razor or Glenn, but this is a, a larger problem in our, um, conversation with one another and it's, it's, um, but it, it seems to be a pathology that's expressing itself on the left politically in a way that I'm not seeing it quite so much on the right. Right. I get attacked by people on the right, but they actually, for the most part, do me the courtesy of understanding what my views are.

Speaker 2:          00:39:35       And they attended a Bible thumper, like, uh, um, I don't know Rick Warren or anyone else like that. I have debated, you know, he, he, he will, he understands what my position is and then he, he disagrees with it based on his own commitments and then we can have an honest debate, um, and it, and it can be totally pleasant. It can be barbed onstage, but it can be totally pleasant in the green room because we, you know, we, we both know what, what game we're playing and uh, but with these guys, it's not at all pleasant in the green room. In fact, it's interesting. I mean, it's impossible to, to engage at this point. It's just so poisonous and mean. The crucial piece is, and this is something I honestly can say, I'm innocent of Amanda, if I've ever done this, I've never done it intentionally. And at the moment I've noticed I've done it, I've apologized for it. The crucial sin here intellectually and ethically is misrepresenting the other person's views as a, as a strategy for defaming them or, or marginalizing them.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       Right? And this has been done repeatedly. So in the example of Resident Glen let they've retweeted memes saying that you want to nuke the whole middle of all this stuff that we've been talking about. So what I'm particularly interested in here is that I see this on the left too. I'm on the left so I care more about the left and to me the right went over the deep end already, but I want to bring the left back into some sorta saying middle ground. So what do you think is actually going on here? I had a Dr Gadd sat on a couple of weeks ago and he said that basically this is just the age old thing where you go for the intellectuals first. So someone like Reza I think probably can't really. I know you have debated in but can't really defeat you, so to speak in a debate so that he has to go to this. Because as you said at the beginning of all of this, 40 percent of this stuff just sticks, right? You say racist when our 40 percent automatically believe you're racist. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       in, to, to bend over backwards to be charitable to these guys, I can say that, um, we're all guilty of kind of a bandwidth problem and an impatience with views that were not sympathetic with. And frankly we all are. It's possible for any one of us, no matter how scrupulous we attempt to be, to not take enough time to understand the position we're criticizing. Right? And so you, because you feel like if it's somebody like, I don't know, Glenn Beck or rush limbaugh or, or, um, Ann Coulter or somebody on the right with whom I'm basically unsympathetic. I basically, I feel like I have the gist of what their opinions are or likely to be. And then they say something, my, I have a shorter fuse with them. Maybe I have less of a reason to really look into what their position actually is. And that is, that's a time bandwidth problem, but it's understandable.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       But it creates huge pr problems in our conversation with, you know, left and right and on any given topic. Um, but the crucial problem is, uh, which I, I, I am now to a moral certainty. Sure. I've encountered in these guys is they know they're misrepresenting you and it's a strategy and I think it comes out of I'm just a feeling that it's a, it's a very cynical, a relationship to the truth. It's a very cynical relationship to, to the significance of ideas. Have you started this segment talking about the distinction between ideas and people. Now these are people who really don't think ideas matter very much. I mean certainly I don't think religious ideas matter very much and the differences between religious ideas and so you know, Razah is always talking about how, you know, religions are just, you know, so networks of symbols and metaphors and there's this, this kind of postmodernist nonsense that comes out of his mouth when he was talking about the truth claims of religion.

Speaker 2:          00:43:38       And the punchline is nobody ever really does anything based on religion. It's always some other reason, right? It's psychology is politics is economics. I'm right. I've heard him say that you actually believe in this stuff the most because that's why you quoted and he obviously knows that, but he says things. You know what he'll say, and every time I come up he'll say, you know, I get my view about religion from Fox News right now. Is there any chance he believes that there is no chance? I think if you've proven anything easy, you look in the bibliography of, of my first book, right? There's like a thousand references there, right? There's absolutely no chance he believes that there's absolutely no chance he thinks I've called for a nuclear first strike on the Muslim world, and yet he retweets a tweet that calls me a genocidal fascist. Maniac, right?

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       Yeah. Um, he's uh, and Glenn Greenwald was in this category and Jenkins as well, and, um, Chris hedges all of them. And um, the problem with this is that it works. It actually because, because then for the rest of my life, I'm going to be seeing people who are absolutely sure on every comment thread I'm ever going to see there. I will see people who are absolutely sure. I've called for a genocidal nuclear holocaust, right? Um, and uh, and many other things. And so it's a, um, it's very, it's very depressing, but it works. And there really is no way to respond adequately to it. And so I've, I've had on my blog for years now a, a, um, post entitled response to controversy where I deal with each one of these things as they come up. And then a year later I'll, I'll revisit it and fine tune it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       And, uh, I think it's the number, if you search response to controversy on Google, I think it's the number one result. I mean, so it's, it's, it's a, it's kind of depressing to associated with that phrase, but it's the um, but it still is not an addict. It's like a 10,000 word letter to the editor essentially. But it, it, it, it's not an adequate way of addressing this and it's not adequate because a lot of people just don't care what the truth is. They just liked the fact that your ready, you can destroy your opponents reputation by calling him a racist. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       So that's where I have to bring up the other person here that we've sort of danced around. Um, and that's the personal part to me. So jank obviously Janky. Greg is the founder of the young Turks, the CEO of the network. I worked for him for two years. I still play basketball with him every Sunday. Um, you sat with him for three hours, for three hours unaided on his channel. They put about five commercials in it. It has over a million views. I'm sure they made a lot of money on it. You calmly explained to him at the beginning that basically he was repeatedly slandering you. I don't know the, use the word slander, but that he was repeatedly misrepresenting your views and that you were there to clean up the mess and then you sat there for three hours, clearly laid out what you think about these things.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       I was still working there at the time and then after that he only doubled down on the. It's about, you not only doubled down, but I see this all the time now on twitter. People will take little video clips, ten second video clips of him saying one thing to you, and then what he said when you're not around, even after and things that he said to Reza, knowing that that's not what you said and all of this stuff. Um, so the personal part to me, I just have to say it because people have been asking me forever. So it obviously had a good amount to do with why I left. So I just want to put that out there, sort of a more for my audience. But in terms of the three hours sit down. I mean, that's a long time to sit with somebody. We're not, we're not going to go three hours. You did three hours with one glass of water. Did you ever, in your wildest imagination think that it was going to get worse after that? Because in my opinion, at least it did.

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       Yeah. No, I, I, it's, it's, um, I could see he was following me entirely so I could see that he was just, there was a kind of a fundamental disinclination to have his opinion about me changed by anything. I was going to say, right, so when you encounter that in someone, you see that it's not, it's not functioning by the usual rules of conversation. I mean, this is, this is the thing that's so poisonous. It's the. And again, uh, unfortunately I encountered this more on the left than, than elsewhere. There's a, every one on the left, at the moment seems to be a mind reader right there. What they're trying to detecting you evidence of a view which you claim you don't hold, but the moment they can, they can string together anything you've said that seems to align up with something they want to find in you.

Speaker 2:          00:48:18       They will hold you accountable to that misunderstanding. And no matter how much you try to take their foot out of your mouth, they, they did. The mirror effort itself is going to be counted against you if you're just someone who's in denial or you don't really understand how racist you are, or, um, and it's a, uh, uh, I mean, so for instance, so the classic example on twitter, I, I often see that, um, whenever I say something critical about Islam, I will get back, you know, why don't you ever criticize Christianity or Judaism, which obviously I do my book, but now I recently said something very disparaging about Orthodox Judaism and I saw on twitter people claiming that I was just covering for my racism with respect to the Islam. So that made sense. Um, and this is just a token way of, of just misdirection, right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:16       I don't really feel this about Orthodox Judaism. There is no way to dig out from this. I mean, really think how perverse that. And they're all mind readers, they're all psychics who, who are plumbing the depths of your con, detecting things in you that you don't even know about yourself. Do you wish your mind, was that da? Well, I mean it's, I, I, yeah, I wish it was amazing to me is, I mean this is such a confused moral position because they're claiming. I'm saying all these horrendous things, right? I say we should racially profile. I say we should nuclear the, the, the, the Muslim world. I'm no great. Now say they're going to select the edit that I say it right. I say we should torture people, right? These are my claims. And then when I say no, this is not actually what I, what I said.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       Um, they, I mean, I say I, I say incredibly controversial things if you actually honestly engaged with what I'm saying. These are very, I take controversial positions. I'm never hiding what I actually believe, right? It's just like I'm walking right up to the line. Like I'm going to say though, it's though it is politically impossible. I want to talk about the ethics of torture publicly. Now. I mean this is a thankless job if there ever was one. Right, and yet they're claiming to detect in me commitments that I'm disavowing and there's just no way you can disavow them once, once they, they, they, uh, insist there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:41       Right. So you want to have the battle of ideas, which is exactly what liberalism should be for and they don't seem to want to do that. So I just want to wrap this up with one final question. This, this portion of it. Um, so just putting it flat out there. I have tweeted at Jank publicly and respectfully several times since I've left the network to engage him on this and I sort of laid out some things and showed out, showed some evidence of, of this or that and he just ignored me. So I just think I just have to say that and you know, everyone can think what they want, but my final question on this is what do you think we should do about these people? Do you think that your engagement at this point, were you, when you've seen someone lie repeatedly misrepresent your views, all of those things when you've seen this happen repeatedly? Repeatedly. And then I started seeing it bleed into other things. Do you keep engaging or at some point do you just put your hands up and I'm guessing you struggle with this yourself because you were sort of ready to put your hands up and then you got sucked back then. But where, where do you stand on that now?

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       And I wish I had an algorithm for, for how to deal with this because there's no, uh, it's very haphazard on my side. It's just, you know, sometimes I'll, I'll just see a tweet that I just can't let go, you know, and then I'll go for weeks or months or in some cases, even years, not dealing with this directly. But I think in so far, if someone has a big platform you have to deal with, it's somewhat some of the time because he, because I see the consequences of their successfully misleading people. And so either the people who I will never mentioned it never deal with because they're kind of smaller fish in this, in this murky pond. But someone like Reza Aslan, you know, he's, he is a kind of a public figure now and he, he's a darling of a certain segment of the media and so what he says actually matters because it is, you know, he's promulgating genuine falsehoods about the, the connection between religious ideas and I'm a very dangerous behavior and he's does it it with a apparently clear conscience and I think he knows enough to know that he's actually line.

Speaker 2:          00:52:48       So he's a, he's a, I view him as a truly bad actor. Um, and yeah, I, but it's incredibly boring to keep poking fun at funded him or to keep pushing back against what I said

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       and then ultimately you're just getting them clicks and in some cases actual money too. So it sort of, I guess there is no answer yet, but

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       maybe I'll just do it, you know, I do it when I can't do otherwise, but then I move on to other things.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       Um, I want to get back into some of the religious stuff. Um, so I think partly what a lot of your detractors would say is that you have this focus on Islam that you don't, that you've already illustrated and you've written a book about Christianity that whole half first half of interfaith. You talking about the Crusades or all this kind of stuff. As you said just a moment ago, you said all kinds of things about the orthodox Jews. So I think we get a sense that it's not just that, but they're not all the same. I think that a lot of these, a lot of the progressives, a lot of these people on the left, they want, they believe in this idea that everything is equal. There's just this sort of base equality except the fact is by definition these things are different. If I was to right now draw the Jewish god of Yahweh or Moses or something and then draw Jesus in a weird sex act and then draw Mohammed and I'm talking stick figures. I'm not a good artist. Only one of those would cause a threat to my life. So those things are not equal. Right? I know they like that proposition. But it's, it's a faulty proposition, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       Oh No. Probably brought out in the, the most elegant way by that onion cartoon. I don't know if you saw that the title was no one was murdered over this cartoon and it's, you know, it's just, you know, uh, the Buddha stickiness, you know, blowing Jesus. I mean, it's so like everyone, but Muhammad is in there and um, but the point is made perfectly. It's just like, you, you can do that and yet you cannot draw a stick figure of Mohammed without having your life deranged thereafter by, you know, conversations with the FBI about how to keep your, your you and your family safe. Right? That's the reality of the world. We're living in the West right now. Forget about what's happened, what it's like to live in Pakistan or Bangladesh or any of these countries where you are literally going to be cut down by your neighbors on the mere rumor that you have mistreated a Koran or that you don't believe that it's the perfect word of the creator, of the universe. Um, so, uh, yeah, so this, I mean, the crucial piece is that beliefs matter, specific beliefs matter, the differences between beliefs matter, the doctrines, a religious doctrines are not all the same and therefore the behavioral and political and moral commitments born of those doctrines are not all the same.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       How has media really failed this year? The, the mainstream media? Because I did a video a couple of months ago, you know, there was this exhibition, I think it was somewhere in the middle of the country where they had the pope made out of condoms. Now I can see that being offensive to some Christians, right? You could turn on family guy on any given night or South Park and see Jesus doing all sorts of crazy things. I posted a clip of Jesus bathing naked in front of Stewie, a baby, a male baby, and they're playing porn music in the background. No, there's no threat of anything. So is this where sort of the media has sort of helped the narrative because they have no problem publishing the picture of the pope in condoms, but at the same time the New York Times didn't, for example, post the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and is this also where secular people, we've sort of maybe we've underestimated, not been kind

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       enough to the mainstream Christians because they get crap all the time as I'm illustrating right here. Nobody's being shot for things. Yeah. Well I think we just have to acknowledge publicly and loudly and incessantly that free speech has to win. So if anyone who in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre wondered, well, wait a minute, where are those cartoons at all racist, because that, that was going to make me feel differently about it. That opening that door is just a kind of moral blindness that we should have immediately a later itself against me. That was just. And people like Glenn Greenwald, that's, that's the door they open. It's like, oh, these were. These were not kosher cartoons. These were racist. Of course they weren't. In fact, if you understood anything about French politics, yeah, and these were, these were, these people were on the right side of all these liberal questions in France, if you, if you understood and by the culture focusing on Islam more than any more.

Speaker 2:          00:57:23       We're about Christianity, plenty of stuff. But even the cartoons that's on their face seemed racist and they were kind of a racial caricature. They, in fact, if you understood the context weren't racist, right? Um, but nevermind that the, the sense that it, it, it's the sense that there's a tension between freedom of religion and freedom of speech is a total moral and political illusion is that there's absolutely nothing you and I could say in this conversation that infringes upon somebody else's freedom of religion. We can disparage religion all we want. That doesn't affect someone else's political rights to practice it. They can raise their kids however they want.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       We simply need to admit that religion should be subjected to the same kind of criticism and scrutiny and satire, uh, as any other set of ideas. As you point out, we do this for something like mormonism so that you can have a play like the book of Mormon and no one gets killed. Sure. It's unthinkable to have an analogous play about Islam and we have just acquiesced to that difference we have. Just so you know, it's just, yeah, it's too dangerous. And the problem is not that it's too dangerous. The problem is that anyone like me would want to do it. Right. Anyone liked someone like Trey Parker, Matt Stone, the, those assholes, they shouldn't, shouldn't go after Islam. Right? That's where the moral sense that the sensibilities of liberals seem to be right now. Whereas we should be acknowledging how excruciating it is that there is this difference even in our own societies between Islam and something like mormonism.

Speaker 2:          00:58:56       Whereas at one point, um, in one of my blog posts, I pointed out that the Mormon response to the book of Mormon was, was adorable. They took out ads for mormonism in playbill, right? That's exactly as it should be. Right? And I, and I say just incredibly withering things about mormonism, but that no one is no more, man. It's going to kill me for it and that, and that is a difference that we know the people, people like Glenn Greenwald and Reza Aslan are maintaining the status quo actively, energetically, and we have the moderates and you talk about this and end of faith that actually the supposed moderates in this case, right? And they're in their liberal apologists and their secular liberal politics who are not even religious. Glenn Glenn is a gauge you, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go that well for him. It was already walking down the street to Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 2:          00:59:47       I think so. I think a Gad your previous guest, uh, once tweeted in response to something, Glenn Greenwald tweeted about me know, defending Islam. He said, um, I think this was good. It he'll correct me if I'm wrong, but he said, do me a favor, Glen, get a shirt made saying I'm gay and I don't believe in God. And, and travel around the Middle East and, and report back on your adventures. There's one place he could do that. And, uh, we'll get to that place in a second because we're going to go, we're going to go controversial if you don't think we've gotten there so far. I thought what we could do here for a second is because I know that people are gonna. Say you guys are focused on Islam, you're focusing on Islam. Can you just give me a bunch of bad shit about Christianity and Judaism?

Speaker 2:          01:00:31       I mean, just rip it apart. Just Gimme I know you can do it because I read the books, but just as telling me some really terrible stuff. Well, at the level of the text, at the level of what's just in the Old Testament, that is the worst book. It is worse than the Koran. It's, it's, it is the, the most barbaric and theocratic a recipe for human unhappiness talking about Old Testament Judaism and clear to some degree Christianity. But yes. Um, and uh, if you, if you as a Jew wanted to live out of leviticus and Deuteronomy, uh, you are, you know, just, you know, write of Mullah Omar in terms of your theocratic commitments right now. It just so happens there are reasons why even ultra orthodox Jews aren't committed to the letter of the law. They're, but they're not good reasons. They're just, they're just kind of accidental historical reasons.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       I was, this is actually a, a, um, a encounter I brief briefly relate in my new book with the Majid Nawaz. Um, while we're talking, I was talking to him about how I'm always worried when I see sort of carefully worded seemingly moderate claims from religious people because you sensed that there's, there they're doing some kind of theological correction in their brains where it's covering for other commitments that they're not, not being so forthcoming about it. And I wants discovered this with a Orthodox Jew at a wedding. He was a friend of the groom and, and, um, we were introduced and then the groom walked away and I said, so I just kind of launched into my spiel and I said, listen, just tell me what about all the barbers things and leviticus and Deuteronomy and how do you reconcile those things? And he said, well, you know, it was very interesting that all of that was just in the context of the time.

Speaker 2:          01:02:16       It doesn't apply now. There is no sand hedren, you know, there's no body of elders who, who would make all of that, uh, effective. And I said, and I could see, I could hear what he was doing there. And I said, okay, well, yeah, but when the Messiah comes back, as you think he will and you reconvene the Sanhedrin in the temple is rebuilt, then what you know, then are you stoning people to death for adultery in witchcraft and homosexuality? And, and he said, well, you know, that's fair. It's a very hard question. And He, and then he said, you know, you don't, I don't think you can appreciate how, what a sacrilege those behaviors would be in the presence of the Messiah and a properly concentrated, consecrated, Sanhedrin. Um, and I said, yeah, you're right. I can't, you know, so like, aware, what part of your body should I vomit on now?

Speaker 2:          01:03:06       I mean, it's like, it's like, it's like the. So the, that was the know, if you just push long enough you can find the theocrat in those people. Um, but as a matter of fact, there they have theological reasons why they don't have to be stoning people to death for homosexuality and adultery. Right now we're working on the sabbath, right. Though those rules are, are mandated in, in the Old Testament. But there are, yes, there are possible circumstances where a religion like Christianity or Judaism is more dangerous than Islam. It's just we don't happen to be as, as a global matter, we don't happen to be in those circumstances. But if you take something like stem cell, again, this just comes down to the specific consequences of specific beliefs. So Islam is totally off the hook with embryonic stem cell research. They don't, they don't think that the soul enters the Zygote at the moment of conception.

Speaker 2:          01:04:01       They think it enters that. I think it's day eight or day 1:20, depending on what you believe, which had either you believe. So, you know, when I go on and on about religious, the religious impediment to lifesaving medical research and on, in embryonic stem cell research, I'm never thinking about Islam right as it's just as long as it's compatible with Islam right now. Isis could be doing embryonic stem cell research if they wanted to. Um, so you just have to, you have to be honest about who is culpa, what, what ideas and what and what advocates if those ideas are culpable for specific problems. Yeah. So I'm pretty sure you're saying we just proved your an anti Semite yes. Oh, I, I got that. I got, I've been blamed a, there's a passage in the end of faith that if you read it on charitably seems to blame the Holocaust on the Jews.

Speaker 2:          01:04:47       Right. You know, uh, I brought that as I do. I'm a, no, but I, you know, it's an honest fact that you have, you have a 2000 year history of antisemitism, which to some degree Jews have collaborated in by being an incredibly insular culture, religious culture that dogmatically define themselves in opposition to the rest of the world. You know, the non Jewish culture, it's two sides of a coin, doesn't, it doesn't excuse the Holocaust, doesn't blame Jews for the Holocaust obviously, but um, well then I saw the conception of Jews as Jews, as a race is shared by Jews, right? It's not, it hasn't been foisted on them by the outside world and that's why it's a problem. Why? You know, why you have to get out of this game of, of defining ourselves tribally based on imaginary in a fictitious ideas. Um, and we have to realize that the way forward is recognizing our common humanity. It were a single species on a single planet trying to build a single viable global civilization. And there are a thousand different ways we can screw this up and not so many ways where we can, we can build paradise on earth, which should be our common project. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       Unfortunately, I think our definition of paradise and some of the people that we're talking about me, yes, well that may not be exactly the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       Well that's, that's the problem you have. I mean, hence the power, the, the crucial matter of criticizing bad ideas. The thing is, most people think there's a lot of bad people running around in the world. I, there aren't a lot of bad people. There are, there are a lot of bad ideas and bad ideas are worse than bad people because bad ideas are contagious. Bad ideas get good people to do horrible things. No,

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       you wrote what I think, or I think it was on your podcast actually, but I read the transcript, what I think is the most tepid defense of Israel that has ever been said ever. But because of it, people think you're a Zionist. You're secretly, as you said earlier, every, you know, you're manipulating things and blah, blah, blah. Even though you've talked about dragging settlers by their beards out of the West Bank and all of this stuff. I'm sorry, can we only have about 10 minutes? Um, so in about five minutes, can you just sort of sum up that what you were talking about? And I didn't even really view it as a defense in a weird way. Um, but it was, I didn't even, I didn't agree with all of it by any stretch. I defend Israel. It's the one tiny little democracy in that part of the road, which you sort of alluded to. Um, so can you just sort of sum that up and then, and then also why then even the most tepid defense means you're automatically on design. Design is Nazi, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:07:29       I mean, it was the worst titled Blog Post podcast ever because people read it as my, the title was, why don't I criticize Israel? Yeah. Question mark a and immediately I reminded my readers and listeners that I do criticize Israel, right? But it was read as, you know, this is, I am committed to not criticizing Israel because of x, Y, and z. So I do criticize Israel. Um, I say in that piece that I don't think it should exist as a Jewish state. And I think I've been, if I think the idea of estate organized around a religion is just intrinsically of noxious and divisive and unsustainable, uh, with the one caveat that the only thing that justifies the existence of Israel as a Jewish state is the fact that the rest of the world has rather reliably his willingness to murder the Jews outright. For being Jewish.

Speaker 2:          01:08:18       So I mean there's, there's no other people who are, um, coming out of this legacy of having been hunted and hounded for generations until antiquity, uh, by, uh, uh, the rest of the world. So it's understandable that many, many Jews think we need a Jewish state. Um, and I don't deny that. It's also, it's not a state that's, you know, there's, there's an ethnicity that is. Judaism is not, it's not just a religion, so it's not, it's not a Jewish state and quite the same way that the Saudi Arabia is a Islamic state. I'm not religious in any way, but yeah, I like bagels and I watch curb your enthusiasm so I get. So I'm you guys, I'm on precisely that sort of Jew. Um, and I like Israel. I been to Israel and it's, it's a, um, uh, I've loved my time there. Uh, but if all the Jews woke up tomorrow and said, you know, this isn't worth it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:13       Let's just assimilate. Let's just, let's just blend into the rest of the world. This is just, this godforsaken piece of land is let's give it to the Muslims. Um, in my view, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the Jews were the first religious congregation on earth to admit that religion as a variable, a, as a device, divisive variable was just defunct and we're just going to be human beings. That would be a, as a closing chapter to Judaism, I think that would be the, I'd be honored to be among those Jews. And the Poles are sort of showing that, right? I mean most Jews are secular or religious in any. No, I mean that's the, that's the other thing about Judaism now is that it's very hard to find Jews who believe anything superstitious in the service of their Judaism. I've debate conservative rabbis who don't even believe in God. Apparently they believe or the God they believe in is just like, you know, quantum mechanics or just pure energy or ms dot. It's not a god who can hear prayers, I believe in the force with. Yes, that's. I've met, I've met that rabbi. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       So it's a, a uh, but, so my bias toward Israel, whenever you're talking about the conflict between Israel and her neighbors, my biased towards Israel is really a bias against suicide bombing and the use of human shields and an explicitly genocidal aspiration which Hamas has in its charter and many, many of Israel's antagonists. Ha, have just in the way they talk about the fate of the Jews. I mean, it is prophesized that, you know, the, the end times will come when the very earth cries out against the Jews were the, were the trees and the rocks say there's a Jew behind me, come kill him. I mean, that is, that is the center of the fairway Islamic Prophecy, right? Um, and it's in the charter of Hamas, right? So how can, how can Israel expect to deal with these people? Right? So I think you illustrated in that piece that if the

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       weapons were reversed, if the Israelis had the weapons that Hamas has and Hamas or the weapons he's really had, well this thing would be over tomorrow because there would be a genocide tomorrow, which to me sort of sums up the white

Speaker 2:          01:11:26       yes conversation that's so silly. That is the, the, the, the moral disparity that all of Israel's critics have to admit to be intellectually honest here and just says Israel is showing what they would do if they could kill all their enemies tomorrow because they could kill all their enemies tomorrow. They could go into Gaza and kill everyone. Now they're not doing it. You might cynically think, well, they're just not doing that because the rest of the world would be so horrified and treat them like even more like a pariah state. Um, so they're not being restrained by any commitment to human rights or anything else notable. They're just as pure self serving a calculation, but still they're not committing genocide. And yet you have have people on the left claiming that what they did in Gaza was a genocide right

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       there. Their population goes up every year. I mean, I tweet that people all the time when they're. You're saying someone tweeted at you saying about, well, why don't you call it genocide? And he wrote, well,

Speaker 2:          01:12:22       yeah. So you know it's, it's they're, they're in a horrible and increasingly untenable situation, but they're dealing with people. Some set, some significant subset of whom support the targeting of innocence through suicidal terrorism in defense of religion. Not In, not in this is this has flown the perch of mere politics and mirror claims upon a know scarce resources. We're talking about religious attachments to holy site, if, if, if the dome of the Rock, if the, if the Alex, a mosque was destroyed as some crazy Christians and crazy Jews want to figure out how to accomplish. I mean there are, there are people who want to bomb that building, right to usher in the second coming of Christ. Or if that building were destroyed, you would see just an all out a attempt at genocide from the, from the Muslim world. Um, again, based entirely on the religious symbolism of, of just a pile of rocks. That's the situation we're in.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       I really, I put a lot of thought to it. How do I want to end this? And, uh, I read your other Book Waking Up, which is a guide to spirituality without religion. And as I've sat across from you for an hour and a half now, you seem to be extremely at peace. I said to you, you know, in your interview with Jake, there was a lot of ranting and raving on his side and papers flying everywhere and you sat there pretty much like you're sitting here right now and you commonly approach all these things I think in a very admirable way. Um, so I, I've read the book, but what are some of the tactics that you use to, to tap into that spirituality side to get all this? Because we've talked about a lot of noise and once we post these, I know what twitter is gonna look like. And I know what the comments are going to look like, how do you find some peace within all this, and then within everything else that is going on in your personal life and everything else, how do you sort of get to that space?

Speaker 2:          01:14:24       All right. Practice Meditation, which is just paying close attention to your experience in the present moment. So if you do pay close attention to your experience, you'll notice that you have this condition of consciousness which is subjectively speaking, whatever we'll learn about it at the level of the brain at a certain point, subjectively speaking, it's intrinsically mysterious. You don't know what this is or how this is arising subjectively. I mean you can't, you know, in fact you don't even know you have a brain subjectively. Um, so you have this space of light and shadow and color and energy and in that space, thoughts and emotions keep arising and changing and passing away. And the difference between being at peace and being starkly miserable, there's always a difference between a being kind of free of identification with thought and being totally captured by your thought. The next thought just comes up and you don't, you didn't notice it as a thought and it's just all of a sudden, it seems to become you, you know, so if I'm, if I have a thought that arises and you know, that fucking raise Isilon, right?

Speaker 2:          01:15:33       If that trims down consciousness too, you know, that's the entirety of my being in that moment, right? So the toxicity of our lives is really mediated by thought and the moment you recognize it really your mind as the level of experience and the level of your functioning in the world, your mind is all you have, you know, and, and it's every relationship you have, every experience you have is going to be as good or bad as your mind is in that context. Um, and we all have these experiences where we just kind of slammed into the present moment in a very satisfying way based on, you know, some heightened experience, whether you know your bungee jumping or uh, you know, we're having sex. So we've taken a drug or the some peak experience, that seat that overrides all of our kind of habitual mediocrity. Um, and, and gets us to recognize that life can be beautiful and profound, but you can actually take charge of that process and just train your mind to find that profundity in each moment. And meditation is just that technique and that the book waking up is my effort to describe that process and that possibility very much in the context of science and without any religious Mumbo jumbo.

Speaker 1:          01:16:50       I sense you'd rather spend more time talking about that than some of these other stuff too.

Speaker 2:          01:16:53       Yeah, I mean the irony is so that, that, that Ben Affleck collision completely hijack my book tour. I was on a book tour talking about meditation and spirituality and I'm restricted from that instant thereafter. They would, it was just, it was just all, you know, racism, Islam all the time. Um, but yeah, no, I do. I mean I just feel like I, I view, I really do most of my career, certainly most of my, everything I've said about religion as a massive opportunity cost. I mean, I shouldn't have to say any of these things. None of us should have to say or hear or contemplate any of these things. I mean, we just were talking about the, the, the, the legacy of these ancient books that people think we're not written by human beings, but we're dictated by the creator of the universe. And, and hence they want to throw gays off of rooftops and, and force women to live in bags or prevent gay marriage in our context or preventive embryonic stem cell research or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       And so we're, we're fighting these ancient battles which we should have outgrown centuries ago. And, um, I, I do, I see it as a personal opportunity costs because yeah, there are more interesting things to talk about, but I just see civilizationally we have, we have this one opportunity to make this life beautiful, you know, and we have a short life. You know, I have a friend who just died. I just, I just learned today, right? He was my age, you know, and um, uh, you know, his life was whatever he made of it, you know. And then he had been, he had a final hour and, and we were all in that same circumstance personally, and we're in that circumstance as a species. And when you look at how we, you know, I mean, there, there are real challenges that make that, that make it make that a hard project.

Speaker 2:          01:18:44       I mean, there's disease and there's no scientific things we don't understand that really would help us to understand and we have environmental problems and we can't, we don't understand economy as well enough to really figure out how to prevent bad. I'm recessions and depressions, but we have these other, this other area of our lives where we. So obviously creating needless human misery. Uh, and when you look at something like, you know, isis or, or, um, uh, the extreme forms of religion takes. It's just, it's just like we're just like lighting fire to the wealth of the world for no good reason. And, and um, yeah, so it's a no, I appreciate the opportunity to talk for a few minutes about something else, but it's just a fact that I do view us in the midst of a kind of political and moral emergency. And so I do find myself talking about bad ideas more than I talk about good ones.

Speaker 1:          01:19:42       Yeah. Well I, I feel the same way and I don't know how many opportunities people get in life to talk to somebody that they truly admire. And that's what I got here today. So I beyond that, the first, it's a pleasure. And uh, and I hope that at the end of this that may be something good happened and if not, uh, maybe we'll do it again or it was, it was fun. It was fun to do so. Yeah. Maybe next time we'll just do, do you have a room that you do the meditation and you have like don't, don't at the moment they can go there, but I could, I could find a flights out appropriate spot. All right, well, uh, of course you guys, you're probably following Sam already. It's at Sam Harris, a org on twitter. It, Sam Harris Dot Org. Uh, you got another place we want to send them a note on. My website is a good hub. Yeah, Sam Harris Dot Org. The website is the hub, uh, and his new book is coming out next month. So check that out. And Sam, I thank you once again and I thank you guys for watching our first episode and we're going to do it again next week. Thanks guys.
