Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Joining me today is an author, the editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research as well as a senior fellow at the Austrian economic center. Jeffrey Tucker. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. Good to be here. I almost wore the same bow tie my friend. Really, I should've brought one extra for you that would have been working on this. All right. There's a ton I want to talk to you. You're. You're sort of a one of these people that are right around all of the topics that I'm talking about from freedom and liberty and free speech and the battle between the left and the right and all that, but your new book and I want to get the title absolutely correct. Right wing collectivism. The other threat to liberty. I thought that would be the spot for us to kick this off because most of the people watching this show know that I've mostly focused on the left.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Sure, sure. Was My home or was it progressive? I've woken up to it. I shouldn't. Real liberalism is obviously, and that has nothing to do with the modern left, but sometimes people say, Dave, you don't critique the right enough. So let's dive in. What's interesting about talking about is that so often the left and the right are not as distinguishable as they seem to be for, for example, uh, the, this, this trade stuff. You know, Elizabeth Warren and Donald trump basically agreed. How do you account for that? And now we use all the celebration of the working classes. You know, you're going to get again, uh, the trump, Ian Wright a green with a Bernie Sanders on, on that, uh, the left is evermore trending nationalist and its immigration policies, for example, that didn't use to be the case. So how is the left? Well, well, like Bernie Sanders complained that free free immigration is, is a coke or coke industries plot basically to provide the capitalist class cheaper workers for example, now that you would have never found anybody on the left 20 years ago saying that, but, but now you know what's happening, you know, the, the, the, the, the hatred of the, of, of commerce.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       And, and the merchant class is so intense now that if a luxury resort in in Florida wants to hire some, some immigrants to work for them, then the left is saying, oh no, this is, this is terrible because his capitalist capitalism at work. So he was trying to see the strange blending. The left and the right have different cultural pitches, a different appeals, different constituencies, but they both have this agenda. That's. That boils down to the, to the use of power. Is this a little bit of just what people refer to as the horseshoe theory, that the more that the sides had become sort of extreme, that they're oddly, that I've heard this, this horseshoe. I tend to think that's a little bit superficial. I mean I look at it a little bit more historically and you see since since liberalism was born in the world in the 18th century, really high middle ages, but when the revolt against liberalism began the early 19th century, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       Too much change, too much wealth. The wrong people are getting rich and there's not enough control. What are we gonna do about our religion, our language, our rates? You know, the, the revolt began to grow from about the 18, 20 isn't and intensified and spread to the United States. Britain really began to take root and continental Europe. There took two forms. There was a left forearm and a right form, and in each country they took. They took on different generations, different names he knows so. So in Britain you had the Tories, then you had the Labor Labor Party. They both wanted to use the state for their own purposes. Then you always had the opposition party, which was the liberals, you know, and, and that's the way it's fleshed out itself. In country after country, the Liberal Party has always been. The people said, why don't we just let society be, let people live their lives.

Speaker 1:          00:03:51       Let them choose a religion of their own, have their own choice. If they don't hurt anybody, that's not a problem. Let's have free speech. This have a universal rights as have rights for this. Get rid of slavery. Let's have rights. The acknowledged the existence of women's rights or equality of freedom for everybody. Leave everybody alone. That's the liberal position. That's a pretty good position. It's A. It's a beautiful position and it's, and it's what I favorites, but I think it's what built civilization coming out of the religious wars of the high middle ages. We discovered this idea of freedom. We tried it, it worked, but there's. But there's always been a revolt brewing against it, a resentment, resentment against it or get resentment against the commercial class. Too much change, too much wealth, wrong. People getting wealthy. We're not controlling demographics well enough. There's not enough quality. Whatever the thing is, it takes different forms in different countries and in different times in different places, but ultimately the right and the left or ideologies of control and power and liberalism has always been the alternative to that. So. So we keep having to rediscover this again and again and every generation. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       well that's why now I'm so happy that there is, as you said to me right before we started the phrase, classical liberalism is coming back. You know what I mean? You hear it on tv every now and again. I like to think that maybe I had a little something to do with it, you know, and to me it is the only current antidote to the problems that we have, either the the more state power that the democratic socialist want as they've sort of ransacked their own party and purged all of the Liberals and it's also the antidote for all of the people. If you think trump is all of the horrible things that people say about them all the time, what's the antidote? The antidote isn't to get somebody else and then more power to power. The antidote obviously is to take power away from that. That's what liberalism,

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       my hope is that, that there are the good people left the center of the left, that we're looking at the emergence of the trump problem. We'll reconsider a the uses of power and the executive state and why did we build this gigantic machinery of the total state if it's so vulnerable to being captured by our enemies. Right? Right. That's the real question that we're at right now. If you believe this thing has been captured by the Russians or whatever it is, it's like, well, okay, you're kind of answering your own question. I hope that we can, we can rekindle a kind of a new resurgence, but I do have to credit you and Jordan Peterson for this. I mean, I've been working at it for about 10 years to try to bring back to the, not just the term liberal, but the concept of liberalism to, to public life and a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       It's been difficult because, because, because we do have the state that creates a kind of moral and intellectual and ideological hazard. Somebodies got to control it. And now that we, we built it over the last hundred years, this, this, this total state, massive taxes, regulations, interventions, uh, running people's lives. Everybody's trying to get hold of it and grab it and beat up their enemies. And it's a problem. It's a serious problem. So when people say to me, and we've discussed this on the show a bunch of times before, and I've addressed this in several forums, when people say to me, wait a minute, when you're, when you say you're a classical liberal in youtube about laissez faire economics and getting the government out of the way and all those things, really this is just a repackaged libertarianism or you're just afraid to say that you're a conservative because it's still not cool or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       How would you define the difference between, say, a classical liberal and a libertarian? Let's talk about that because, uh, because after World War Two, uh, these new, these new terms came along, uh, one was conservatism. It wasn't really used before the early 19 fifties, Russell Kirk's book called, uh, the mindset of a conservative, simply like the conservative mind, I think it was what it was called. And Libertarianism was again a first used it about 1957. Um, by the translator of the works of Basquiat. The problem was the term liberal had been captured by the new dealers as early as 1933. Once they acquiesced to the idea of the corporate of estate and we're blaming the great depression on capitalism, um, that became a problem for liberalism that kept the term liberalism, but they were no longer liberal because they were suddenly for big government, there were four big government and even worse the corporate state.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       And actually we can just be more blunt about it and say that back in the 1930, this, this, this ideology had a name. The name is fascist. Okay. So, so the caved, right. I mean in the New York Times in 1933, the New York Times magazine was celebrating the great prep professor, Mussolini and how he and FDR shared a vision for the planned economy. So that's the world we're living in back then. So we, we lost the term liberal after World War Two. There was an attempt to, to just speak a language, to describe who we are. And on one hand you had this new thing called conservatism and they, they, they kind of sampled some of this Tori Tori, like nostalgia for the past, a little bit of revanchist let's recapture what we've lost. Then you, on the other hand, you had the genuine liberals and they coined the term libertarianism, which had been sitting on the shelf since the late 19th century.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       Now most of the people who call themselves libertarians in the late 19th century, America and England were anarchists, socialists, but nobody had bothered with the term for decades and decades. So Dean Russell said, well, nobody's using that word. Why don't we use it? And that was closer to the truth of what they were in effect. Well, what was interesting about that is as dean rustled described it in his 1957 article, it was a synonym for what was once called liberal. He didn't think it was a tweak or an improvement or a distillation or refinement or a new dogmatic way of describing liberalism. He thought it was liberalism. So I need to read that because I mean, that's how I feel. I don't. If someone sends me, Dave, you're a libertarian. I don't mind that. If we need labels, I don't mind that late. I don't mind the idea.

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       You know, we can split the difference on how much government. Sure, she'd be the problem. I think libertarianism as a number, as a term, has a number of problems. One is it's a little clinical sounding and it has too many syllables and it makes you sound a little bit awkward and it sounds maybe a little too canonical. You know, like we, we have a list of things you have to believe, you know, like this, this, this, it's all rooted in this kind of reductionist. A more commonly these days is rooted in this kind of in a reductionist, nonaggression principle, which is a fine principles or rule of thumb, but it's not a good. It doesn't describe the whole of life. So the other problem is that libertarianism is, is a new term, so it doesn't have a deep history. So we can't look back and say, oh look.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       The Libertarians freed the slaves, the libertarians a acknowledged to the rights of women. The Libertarians gave us, the commercial society that built the middle class and brought dignity to the average person. If they had existed as a party, they would have done those. They would have done this. Well, it means the liberals, but it's deliberate. We changed our name so now we can like, feel a sense of pride in our past so it doesn't have a past. So that's a problem. So we're at. Libertarians tend to be detached from their own history for that reason. And I think it's a problem. It's a word problem. The second problem is that libertarianism doesn't have a universal of usage. Like whereas liberalism does, you can go to Spain, describe yourself and liberal Brazil. There's, there's liberals in Germany, there's liberals, there's a word for liberalism and every language and it more, less means the same thing except in the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:11:56       Right? So, uh, so, uh, if we acquiesced to this term libertarian and just wipe out our liberal history, we're cutting off cells off both from the world and from our own history. It's so funny because you've just said it in a far better way than I think I've ever really laid it out. But people will say to me, Dave, stop saying you're a liberal and I don't want to stop saying I get that. I'm fighting an uphill battle right now. Right. I'm, I'm a salmon swimming upstream. This is going to be tough, but I don't want to deny what is the truth just because, because it's tough. It's who you are and you want to, you want to have an ancestry, you know, you want to look back and, and see, uh, the, the champions are the medic cheese in the 15th century, Florence and say, I know those people.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       Those are my people. You know, the people who long for a world without slavery, you know, in the early 19th century, the people who wanted free trading fought hard for it. Those are our people. That's our history. I mean, we were, we were born as part of a long stream of emancipation that's been taking place for 500 years. That's our movement, our people, our history. Let's embrace it. I'm with your brother. Yeah. Alright. So are there any of those liberals, a part of the Democratic Party anymore? Do those people exist? What's strange? Things are happening on the left. Very strange thing.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       I'm not sure I should pause you for one sec. I my original question here because I wanted to do the deep dive on that. Right. So we're going to get. We will get. No, I promise you we're going to get to that topic. I mean, the deep dive of the far right gets us into a very dark place. All right, well maybe that. All right, so maybe the whole second half will be on that, but we just put that out there right now. That's what we'll do for this. I'm just now getting out of my depression having been a book. It was terrible. All right, so our whole second half is going to be what my first question was about. Let's just keep going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would for now. So, so strange things have happened to the left.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       Um, let's just mention that the phrase cultural appropriation for example. Now when, when did that, the approbation of this idea of cultural appropriation can put two, three years ago, three, four, five. I don't know, academia is weird. It may have been brewing for 10 years, but when I first heard about it, I thought that is the craziest bunch of nonsense I've ever heard. I mean, civilization is nothing but cultural appropriation. We've been doing this since, since the 19th century. You know, at the, at the height of the competency and Spain where Judaism and Islam and Christianity came together in this beautiful melting pot where we all learn from each other and the cultures began to blend and our religions began to change at our. Alright, I'll look on life began to because we learned from each other. If we stay isolated in our little tribes, we're never going to progress and and, and the idea that, and I don't know if it was inadvertent or what happened, but we can talk about this, but the, when, when suddenly you're told you cannot have affection for another culture and take what you find valuable and, and learn, learn for yourself and live a better life.

Speaker 1:          00:15:05       That is very strange. They seem to think it's cultural annihilation, not cultural appropriation, right? Like they seem to be. This is something that will lead to the destruction of that culture when in fact it actually spreads the ideas of culture, the foods, the thing, the, the, the ideas, not just creating culture as a scarce good like it's a property, but it's not the magic of culture, which is the same magic of ideas is resides in its infinite reproducibility and its malleability. This is something that the world of ideas can do that the physical world cannot do, and if we don't make that distinction, we're going to get very confused. Do you see what I mean? Emily? Cultures Spread and the, they're infinite and they can constantly change and that's the magic and beauty of, of culture and we can't get that out of this glass of water, this table, right?

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       They're, they're, they're bound by the constraints of scarcity. But the world of ideas is, it's magical. It's like a constant, constant, infinite sandstorm, you know, unpredictable. And I'm constantly changing and we can, we can take a culture for ourselves without taking it from somebody else. Right? It's just, it's, it's, it's reproductive reproduction. It's infinite reproduction. So loaves and the fishes isn't, isn't the beauty to that America has done this better than anyone perhaps in the history of the world. You just referenced some other points in time, but that we have taken in more cultures. And you said the phrase melting pot. I mean that. That's what we designed and set up here, the most beautiful melting pot ever. I lived in New York City for most of my life, most of my adult life at least, and would be on subway cars. And you are on that car with absolutely everyone with have white guys with dreadlocks and the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       And guess what? You may not like everybody and you may not like the way this guy smells and that person may be doing this, but we're all there living together. It's magic. You know, it's, it's, it really, it's commerce. It's because this country elevated the commercial ethos to be the highest thing that great and no bling factor of, of, of, of human life. And it's commerce that brings people together. And we experienced that every day. You know, you can, in a commercial setting, uh, people aren't fighting each other, they're getting along. I mean, I find I'm with you. I go to, I go to a restaurant and I get served by some guy from, from uh, Pakistan. It's a chance to meet somebody new. It's a chance to engage somebody and I have a personal relationship with somebody who's serving you and you're serving them. And you experienced this magic of exchange. A Benjamin consultant used to talk about this and the and the 18 thirties, how, how, how commerce brought to the world and new understanding of freedom and a new opportunity for us to find value in each other, in service of each other and see. And America just flourished in commerce. And that's why. That's why we have, you know, the diversity and the end. This melting pot they call it. And this rich cultural life.

Speaker 2:          00:18:19       You know, it's so funny because I'm so keenly aware of it right now. Not only because of the conversations I'm having and because people are screaming about this stuff all the time, but you know, I'm on this tour with Jordan Peterson and when I go to every airport that I go to, I, 90 percent of the time, unless someone's had a car for me, I take an uber and I just happened whatever rubric and there is there, there is every single type of person that looks every which way color every sexuality. And usually I talk a little bit to, to them it's, you know, and it's like, man, these are just people, you know, I'm maybe for the same way, you know, I live in Atlanta, which is just a gigantic really diverse society, you know, and everywhere you go you're bumping into people who are different from you and, and hang around and crypto circles in Atlanta. I want to talk to you and that you're talking about a melting pot. I mean we're all together and there are, we all consider each other are people, you know, just because we all love crypto and it has nothing to do with, with race. You can appreciate racial differences with,

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       but also see value in everybody and hope they can see value in you. You can come together. It doesn't mean that we have to be egalitarian or, or denied differences. It means that we find strength and our heterogeneity and, and that's, that makes for a beautiful and exciting life. One of the strangest things that's happening now with the rise of the outright in response to the failures and strange and so the left is this new celebration of homogeneity as if, oh, we need to live in a unitary racial state, you know, where we all speak the same language are all the same religion. So that strikes me as this theoretically very boring and I don't, I don't even recognize what that world would look like and feel like and it doesn't appeal to me in the slightest bit. Yeah. My nerdy. It was built out of the, out of the diversity that grows out of commerce and the commerce is the key because that's what helps us invest in each other. You know, Adam Smith said this about the division of Labor, right? It's like what causes wealth? The division of Labor, how big can that be? It should be as big as possible. The wider the division of Labor, the more people you include in the great project of of building commercial life and production, the wealthier we're all going to be together and I just, I love that vision. So when

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       we talk about capitalism, I, they show I'll every now and again I jumped in the comment section or I see what people say on twitter. If I have, you know, some of the Iran on or just some of the people

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       that are not for regulation at all and just let the economy go and see what happens. There's always a certain amount of people that say, okay, that all sounds well and good, but then the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer and Jeff Bezos shouldn't have, you know, $20,000,000,000,000 or whatever he has right now are the rest of it. What's the, what's the boiler plate answer to why you eventually end up with those kind of cliche. It's because they've been, they've been around for 150 years and they've never been true. I mean that they weren't true and Marxists time and everybody quickly recognize that going to by the late 19th century in America, we had, we had built the most prosperous economy in the world by far, by far, by far growing incomes, longer lives, healthier people, more opportunities for everybody. People are moving to the cities.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       Everybody's benefiting from capitalism. That's been going on for such a long time. Yet here we are in 2018 and we're still recycling these, these Victorian era cliche. It's about capitalism. I don't understand it. What do you think capitalism then screwed up if if only just a marketing piece of it or something where right now you sent and I believe that it will not win. It somehow doesn't seem cool to be for capitalism, at least with the. He does seem to be the the change. Maybe it's in the name and I. I don't even have a problem not using the word capitalism. I mean I will probably have the same view towards this. I will speak the language that you can understand and if I want to rebrand capitalism as liberalism, which it probably should be actually liberal liberalism, then I'm, I'm glad to talk about that. Same time. I kinda liked the term capitalism. I have no problem with capital because, because it, it really does underscore really important point that without private property and the in the and ownership of the means of production, you can't have a complex production structures and you can't hire more people. You can't, you can't build great things. You can have great cities. You can't improve people's lives. So what are the things that you think government should do?

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       Well, I think of lots of clans rules that we should have. Um, but I'm not a fan of governments in general. If there was some way that you could have, you know, an old fashioned the state, you know, that was really minded, his own business and um, kept kept civil war from happening, for example, you know, kept conflict, that kind of mass conflict. Um, then that would be a probably a good, a good thing. Um, state is not very good at that. So, um, I, I think, I mean I've got, I've got the mind of an addict because to essentially I trust, I trust the chaos of, of spontaneous human action much more than any kind of, of, of imposition. Yeah. But, but I'm at same time, I do like the writings of the old liberals, you know, they, they imagine that the state should do something to keep something like order in life to keep civil war from happening, to keep people from killing each other.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       A terrible things like that. But beyond that state should just, it should be a laissez faire. It should just allow commerce to flourish and allow, allow problems to work themselves out. I am. People don't have confidence in that anymore, but not because of any failure, but it's almost like the ideology of power has become a kind of a modern cancer that affects a flicks everyone. And I think we need to do something about it. Wait, can you explain that a little bit? Well, it's just a. Once you believe that you can control the path of history and you have an endpoint in mind, society should look like this. Then you want to use every kind of tool to hammer it in place. And this is what I called right and left wing who galleon agonism essentially. And it's, it's a grave temptation. And so we built this, like we said at the outset, and we built this gigantic machinery we call the state this total state and a control.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       So much wealth and so much power and so much rests with, with, uh, getting, you know, gaining access to it, that it just a kind of a constant moral hazard for everybody, like, give, give me that state and I'll make it do the right things. So for the people that are on either side of this, whether you're on the left and, and you want to help those that you deem have pressed more people with less when I believe their intentions to be good, even if their methodology I think generally is not good. Or your people on the right that want less of the state. But you know, you're just on either side of this thing. How much do you think the system itself can move without breaking? Because what I think I'm noticing now is that there's a certain amount of people that really just want to trash the whole thing and I do see this certainly more on the left right now because they're not empower that there's this growing thing and this is why they're so into Marxism and all this stuff now.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       It's like let's just trash the whole freaking thing and forget all the goodness that this is done. And they're doing it from their iphones and you know, their sense of irony is not great, but is there, is there, is there just a certain amount that, a system that's basically good can move before it snaps? And I, I would suspect that that's not much either way really. Uh, you mean the commercial structure? Right now our lives are capitalist structures. I mean the state, um, you know, what I see actually happening is the innovation has taken place so quickly. It's actually out running. They have the capacity of government to control it. And I think that's, that's really exciting if I was going to look at one point of hope in the world and set the market and the entrepreneurial innovative sectors of life from the APP economy to the Gig economy to now with blockchain technology and everything is moving so quickly that states can't, can't even keep up. Right. So I'm there with you on that because Gloria. So I'm very happy about that. I don't see that because it's. To me it's like how are people listening to all of these conversations, all of these podcasts that are out there

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       and communicating about them so quickly and it's like the government can't. I can't keep up with all of that. The change can't because people are lighting up all the time now in a much faster way. And I think we're changing in a much more rapid way and I think that's actually really cool. There's a danger to it because we could just spin out of control and do all sorts of awful things. But what you said, well, what did you say before about the general inertia of people or something that the general left to their own ways of figuring things out? I figured it out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       The reason why our politics seem reactionary on the left and the right. Everyone's trying to bring back something. There's a nostalgia on the left and then establish a on the right and they're trying to use the state to hold us back like in and whatever. It's a vision of the. Is it the sixties? Is it, is it the seventies? Is it preindustrial revolution, you know, is at some risks. So he and fantasy of perfect equality and the, the left might imagine, or, or, or the ride, uh, thinking about, you know, a world of high tariffs of the 18, eighties or nineties are. But everyone's looking back to something that they want to create and there's a real fear of the future and the left and the right. And as a future without control, it's a future where we're able to travel, where we want to download the apps. We want to invent what we want to work by ourselves, live where we want to live, be digital nomads, you know, travel around, do it. We want this,

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       this world. That's not what people should be. Fewer people. Everyone should be going, holy cow, this is the free is coolest thing ever. That's the world I want to live in. I want to live. That obviously is why you're so attracted to bitcoin and crypto in general because you're sort of the backbone. Well out of this. I mean if you think about it,

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       I mean we've waited our whole lives and actually generations of great intellectuals have lived and lived and died for so long, wanting something like a private currency that, that emerged privately, that operates without financial intermediaries, that the government is not controlling that it's global. That doesn't. It's not restrained by currency zones that anyone could have access to. You know, a true democratic technology like bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. That is just a dream come true. That is Gloria. That's why I write about it all the time and talk about it all the time. It is, it is the outright killer. It is the alt left killer. It's, it's the thing that's going to ultimately, I think, protect us from these wicked ideologies that are constantly trying to control their lives

Speaker 2:          00:29:17       because basically at some point one of these ideologies is gonna get too much control of the state forever.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       I mean, you know, one of the things that I think about this sometimes when you get depressed about the divisions in our public life and the way people are tearing, tearing each other apart and the way you opened up the newspaper and this, you can barely even read it anymore. You know, it was like, yeah, I know. I know, but it's like Donald Trump. You then just like, you know, I'll put trump, you know, and it's just, it's just this forever debate. And the one thing that I think maybe we should not be entirely unhappy about this. As you look back at history, when, when freedom emerges out of the high middle ages, it wasn't because any one great intellectual or anyone great state or anyone great power said, hey, let's let everybody be free. It was because there's so many competitors for power. They nobody could, could gain the monopoly was the church, it was the, the nation state, it was the localities and monarchical state, uh, the, the landed aristocracy, you know, the, the, the rise of the merchant class, you know, so there are all these independent power centers strewn throughout European society and nobody could get, get access to the finals, single singular control, no unitary power.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       And that fight that took place amongst so many disparate powers to actually lead to a kind of flourishing of freedom. So you know, in a sense the fight between the left and the right today is not the worst thing. If they just keep fighting and leave the rest of us alone. I don't know where we're going to be that lucky, but okay, so before we spend the whole second half on the question that I started this whole thing with the people who want freedom basically, and a light touch of government, are they always at a disadvantage because there's another set of people who will always use the apparatus against them where if they're being true to themselves, they won't use the power to stifle other people. There were all sorts of other things, so in an odd way our ideas are at a disadvantage, always have been.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       We've always been a kind of minority. So even again, over the last two or 300 years of political history have always been the third way. That's fine, man already. But we had, we had rare victories, but big ones, you know, like the end of slavery, you know, um, was just glorious. I mean the protection of the great banking empires of Europe from, from the populace rabble, you know, from the, from the preachers who wanted to destroy it. There were these great victories of the victory of free trade, you know, but, but we've won every once in a while and it always changed the world because once we have a little bit of freedom just a little bit, it just blows up and it becomes awesome and it's amazing and it. And it kills power because it's so powerful and so wonderful. But it's worth fighting for.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       And we've always fought mainly through ideas, not through armies, not through through guns and controlling states. It's always been the philosophical awesomeness of this position has been the celebration of the common man, uh, uh, the celebration of, of wealth, of the love of, of consumerism and commercial life for the coming together of people, the noble meant of people that the right of, of travel, the right of association, and to do what you want to have as many children as you want to educate your kids the way you want to, that these kinds of principles are compelling and they've always lead to victory for liberals despite the pressure from the other two sides. And I think it's, I think it's going to be our future. I do. Let's shift. Let's talk about the scary. Right? Are you ready? I tried to do this and we adapted.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       We did the happy stuff. Now we're going to plunge to look. You know, David, when I began to research this thing, I probably ended up reading about 200 books on this topic when the end and, and I'm a happy guy. I like happy things like technology. I'm an optimistic guy, but this really put me in a dark place, a digging through this history, uh, from, from Hagle, essentially up to Julius Caesar, Eveleigh and the, and the post were Nazi movement and realizing that there is an intellectual strain that stretched over all of these years. Let's go back 200 years. Yeah. So let's go back 200 years when you talk about right wing collectivism. Yeah. Because I think most of my audience now understands what left wing collectivism is because that's what we've got right now. Very in a very strong way. Talk to me about right wing collectivism.

Speaker 1:          00:33:42       Okay. Dave, I'm going to tell you a story. Um, I, I love Ludovico muses. I think it was a genius, right? And I thought I'd read all of his works, but in there is a transcript of a lecture he gave in 1956 at the San Francisco Public Library and he had about three sentences in there that just knocked me over it and I couldn't believe it because it explained so much. He says something like this and he's speaking casually, right? It says, hagle ruined German philosophy for a century. Uh, his original followers became a, W, believed that all of history would end in the Prussian state and the Prussian church having all power and the individualism, individualism, they became the right hit galleons that became the Nazis is the dissonance of this, uh, of the writer. Galleons became the left to galleons. They wanted a universal transformation of humanity and a historical drive to something other than the commercial society.

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       They became the Marxists and, uh, and the communists. And he said that that's it's left, right Galleon ism and that explains pretty much all the political history. And I closed that. I thought that explains more than practically any other book I've ever read. And so I began to, began to explore this. I understood the left together. I understood Marxism. I mean, those were, those were our professors, right? Um, and they're annoying. Uh, but what I did not understand was the right who galleon ism and what that, what that tradition looks like. It's the throne. And alter this, this historic view that the nation should constitute its own unit of profound integrity, uh, that, that is more important than the, than the individual. And that commercial society was too chaotic, that it, that, that it was leading us, giving us the wrong kind of progress, that it was flattening out the hierarchies that we need to have an orderly life, right?

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       This is, this is the right who galleon pitch that ultimately by mid 20th century becomes this very dangerous, dangerous movement in Europe, you know, um, became catastrophic, uh, but it gradually emerged from all the way from, from Hagle because, uh, this is at the end of the endless, seemingly endless Franco pressure awards. There's this battle of the battle of Jenna that, that Germany lost. And the explanation for that was that was a temporary setback. That history, it was going to determine that Germany would rise just despite, despite the choices and individual's history has got its wind. It's like a Meta narrative that, that, that was going to override everything. Hegel himself was a theologian by the way. Um, and, and so this, this view began to kind of spread throughout German academia and it was, it ended up being important to the United States through, through circuitous means, but what, but one of the great theorists of the, of the team forties, who am 18 fifties, who brought the suit to the United States was Frederick List, who was one of the first economist to repudiate the free trade tradition of, of, of the Smithian a Manchester Rights.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       And now we're celebrating the nation as a, as a unit, as a productive power, uh, and, and believed in tariff walls, uh, which was strange and I've read his book, uh, but, and that had a huge influence over American trade policy is actually the late 19th century. And, um, and it, it began to flow out from there. So Thomas, Carlyle, and, and in Britain now begins to celebrate the great man theory of history. And really we're nothing without Napoleon, without, without gigantic figures that we can worship at Meijer. And individuality should be subsumed within them. They act for us, God like, you know, and, and, and it was Thomas Carlyle who first coined the phrase, I'm a coined the phrase to describe economics as being the dismal science. And the reason he said that is that every economist, team new, imagined a world without slavery, and he said you to have a website slavery, that's a dreadful world without slaves, you don't have masters, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       And we need a world with masters and slaves so we can, we can have a vision of hierarchy and greatness without that, we don't have greatness. So we began to see this building of this intellectual apparatus that was not left to galleon. There wasn't Marxist, Anti Marxist in a strange way, but as an alternative form of collectivism, uh, it, it began with a kind of historicism and a celebration on nationalism with a German stayed, began to grow with this, this, this alternative theory of trade that we should, we should build up tariff walls. And Carlisle with his, with his great man theory of history. And then, and then, uh, Rueskin and Britain with his haste hate hatred of Commercial Society because they believed that somehow a commerce which ruined in quality and culture and was giving us mass production and by we all need to be really doing this is, is a, uh, living in guilds and making our own stuff, you know, because we're going to destroy English life and English country life.

Speaker 1:          00:39:10       And so, so a full scale reactionary trend on the right began to develop. And it was always a racial element to know. So that's what's interesting. I'm so glad you asked that because it comes about, first of all, through, through nationalism now and the end, the early 18, 20,018 thirties, this celebration of nationalist. Now you have to ask yourself, what is a nation? What do we mean when we say nation? And, and I'm taking this, a lot of this from a, from a, uh, an essay gave it given to 1882 by Aaron ran in a great French historian, uh, looking back at the rise of nationalism. So there's only five ways you can consider nationalism. You consider, uh, the geographic definition, so we're just living in this space. There's a dynastic element. We can all trace our lineage back to the great founders of our nation.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       There is a language theory of nationalism. We all speak the same language. There's a religious theory of nationalism all worship a god and a precisely the same way. I believe in transubstantiation. You believe in consubstantiation we can't be part of the same nation and that gates. Right? And then finally, and probably most insidiously, there was a racial, the racial view, and that came along and essentially the 18, sixties and seventies with a misapplication of Darwinian theory and scientific racism came along. And that's wet through academia, particularly in the United States, like nothing you've ever seen. It was absolutely astonishing how much racism with Orthodoxy and American academia in the 1890 [inaudible], some of the very first monograph published by the American Economic Economic Association, Black Gay man, I think his name is Andre Hoffman, was called race traits of the American Negro. And the first chapter dress goes all in. You know, it's, it's, it's the horror of the black people that don't have the right values, that can't, can't save money, they're just terrible. A shiftless and lazy and ghastly and uncivilized, double. And now chapter two, the Jews, you know, these people, I don't know what they've got this crazy out of control commercial ethic. They can't stop hoarding money.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       They really went for it. Yeah. And then the third chapter three is the slots and so on. And so the American Economic Association, you know, and then, uh, and there was essentially no, what do you think was happening in the world there? That it was taking a time, what was happening, David Laissez faire had transformed society so dramatically that the intellectuals felt that they had lost control and now you might think that when the world becomes massively prosperous and we suddenly have cities rising up and we've got steel that transversing large bodies of water and we're developing the telephone and indoor electricity and, and people are living longer lives and, and so much wealth is being created that everybody was data per say. Hooray. We found the answers, but the gatekeepers who had controlled everything for so long. So that's so interesting because of revolt. This is sort of what it feels like now to me, the gatekeepers, we've had so much success.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       There's so many, there's so many reasons right now to understand how great everything is. That book right there by Steven Pinker, enlightened misery is all about how great things are and how grateful we are. There is less violence now and all sorts of the. And so the revolt you always have to be on like the gatekeepers are having when the narrative intellectuals or what Deirdre mccloskey calls the clerisy, right? So it's the high end intellectuals, it's the power elite bureaucrats and the public, the permanent peace keepers of our civic culture. You know, it's, it's the political class. And uh, so this is sorta what for, for my audience that maybe not follow this. This is sort of what the New York Times is sort of like. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't have said it. So obviously. But like that's kind of what it is. Like that class, the ruling class, the ruling class, and they were in full scale revolted.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       They did not like what was happening to the world and the 18, eighties and nineties because of the loss of control. And so the, the scientific racism came along to add to the celebration of dictatorship and the and the and protectionism and the new nationalism to add a very insidious element which culminated in eugenics ideology. And that's when it gets very strange. And this is where, this is where the reading gets very difficult because now you're reading all the way into a, you know, the, the, the 19th tens with the works of Oswald Spangler, you know, the, the right who galleon German theorist that enraptured every American, you, they're all reading his book, Oh my God, the decline of the West. We better reconstitute ourselves as the tribe or we're going to be eaten alive by another four. And then there's a strain of that that's still going on right now.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       There is nothing new, you know, like, um, and you know, the, this, this very funny book called the passing of the great race by Madison grant that was on every coffee table in the late 19 teens and early 19th, 20th, you know, was, was forecasting doom for the white race, you know, when he was, he was a fascinating figure because, um, you know, of course I've read his book as, as it everybody did. Everybody a great gatsby makes a passing reference to it. It was that popular, it was that popular. And I tell you there's not a single outright racist alive today who hasn't, is not repeating those cliches that were written by Madison. Grant is all pseudoscience is all just nonsense and it's just ridiculous and embarrassing. But, but it keeps being resurrected. But here's what's interesting, he was a thoroughgoing a Darwinian because she recall that Darwin had two great books, origin these pieces.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       The other was called the descent of man. And the descent of man had the very unfortunate paragraph in there where he gret regrets, um, the invention of mass, a disease killing a, uh, a juror's essentially. It's like if we keep curing people and we keep feeding a inferior people and curing disease than then our genetic stocks going to go down and down, you know, so, so they are all kind of playing off this little passage, but Madison grant was, was not an unusual by American x to academic standards at all. They, they. This was orthodox in the 18, 10, 19 twenties. What made Madison Grant Interesting? You can look up his wikipedia entry right now. Uh, if you look it up, it'll, it'll celebrate him as the, as the father of the National Park Service.

Speaker 1:          00:45:44       Well, in the course of my research, I wondered to know what is the connection between Madison's grants, hardcore, eugenics based racism and its environmental design. What is the relationship there? Remember, it's not just two people. Usually people have, have it figured out in their own head. So I went through and read some of his works on, on the environment. It turns out that he had a master race theory of nature and he went to the California redwoods and he looked at these glorious mighty trees and he was horrified to see they're being cut down for, for, for, for making coffee tables and boats and things like that. And you thought it was this gigantic to nature. So he wanted the master race, uh, the California redwoods to, to be protected. And that's that. So that's why he started the national park service. And now the left heroism is as great as a great visionary environmentalist.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       But actually he was like a tree Nazi. I don't know how else you want to go. It's very creepy stuff. We don't have enough Nazi labels being thrown around. Now we're going to have tree nuts. I'm sure that already was nuts. Um, but you know, you can just march through the history and it gets worse and worse. And then to me, Dave, it'll, it'll culminates in the works of Carl Schmidt, uh, from the, from the late 19 thirties and his, and his amazing book called the concept of the political. And if you'll give me just one quick second to explain this, because because you as a liberal need to read this book because it's the most passionate, I would say, an even competent attack on liberalism Britain in the 20th century. Now, Carl Schmidt, what's a jurist? A brilliant man and a philosopher and a hardcore Nazi.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       Okay. He wasn't tried at Nuremberg. He escaped. I'm merely an intellectual. Okay? Sure. His book concept of the political. What's wrong with liberalism? I tell you, it's dull. Nothing happens, nothing dramatic. There's nothing. Just requires no courage whatsoever. Liberalism is a life in which we all benefit from each other's presence. We all just trade with each other. What kind of life is that? Where we all just are kind of the same and like each other and help backyard barbecues and baseball games and just get richer and live longer lives and send their kid to college. This is terrible. We need to live big, dramatic, mighty, bold, courageous, transformative lives, and live in times that, that, that, that, that, that are shocking, that are amazing, that make our lives worth living. That requires above all else politics. Liberalism imagines a world without politics, that's a terrifying world.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       What we need is a world of politics and and he continues to lay it out chapter by chapter, why we have to destroy liberalism and celebrate the concept of the political and for him that means having friends and having enemies, defeating your enemies and rallying around your friends. Now who are your friends and who your enemies and mode says at some level it doesn't matter. What matters is that they exist and and the state, the powerful men will choose them for us. They will decide who our friends and our enemies are. Now let's be clear what we mean by enemy. I don't stop me in somebody you don't like. I mean the willingness to kill. There has to be the presence of real bloodshed in your time. For you to have a sufficiently prescient sense of enemies so that you'll feel the intense desire to rally around your fin for your friends and experienced that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       That the, the, the awesomeness that only comes with belonging to a group. So, so he says, so he, at the end, the end feeling there is that you can't achieve what, what the real purpose of a humanist. That's right, that you can experience whatever, the highs of belongingness essentially and, and the life of drama that a big important life without being part of a kind of a, a group on the move, the slaughtering of center. And so we have to have the presence of bloodshed. So it really is the opposite of live and let live it is. It's so through, through, through bloodshed comes life and without, without bloodshed and death and violence and politics, then you're just gonna live at an irrelevant life and we can't have that. So he was in many ways of philosophical architect of the Holocaust. Again, not a leftist, not a Marxist, although he dabbled in it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       You find that. So from a lot of these right collectivists the writer galleons that they dabbled, guys like verner, sambar writings, wants a communist who later became a Nazi. Carl Schmitt dabbled in and leftism and then went full, right? Um, and it, it was in many ways the culmination to the right hand galleon ideology and the encroachment. So it's a book worth reading and contemplating. And I would say to anybody who rejects liberalism, you know, be honest about where you're going with this. This is the opposite of liberalism, the celebration of death and the quirks of Schmidt, very powerful thinker, highly regarded even today worth reading and worth reflecting on what kind of world do want to live in. Want to live in peace with others. Where do you want to slaughter your friends, slaughter your enemies and rally with your friends. So move me from that point 19 thirties into, of course, obviously into Nazi Germany and then we'll, we, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       And, and you know, my book really does end in 1958. Not necessarily, didn't have to, but I, I started to get really queasy about what happened after World War Two. A lot of the writer galleon movement went underground, you know, um, and, and became a kind of a quiet neo Nazi movement that never really had access to social media. They clearly weren't in academia, obviously. And but the ideology never entirely went away and, and it was just lying in, wait, wait, waiting for the failure of the left and for the resentment of the population against the left to rise up and receive a fevered enough pitch that it would, it would then come on full force. And that's really what's happening in Europe. Russia, United States, it's an alternative form of collectivism, has got a different flavor, a different orientation at different kinds of resentments, but it still drags in this gigantic history of writing Ghillean ideology.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       That celebration of that Dick Great man dictated the protectionism, the anti-immigration, the nativism, the nationalism that could take any one of five forms including the racism. Um, what do you make about how now? And it's obviously largely because of the Internet, it seems to be happening in so many places at once. We're seeing this unholy. It's an oddly unholy alliance between the collectivist left and then that drives, I mean, it's exactly what you're saying. Then you've got this other data that's just waiting there for these guys to go to bananas. And I was like, ah, we got all these answers. Meanwhile, you have the liberals and everyone, all the decent 80 percent of us that are trying to live in that part of it really comes down to this. There was a weird sociological, cultural contradiction at the heart of social democratic leftist ideology. On one hand they they wanted to build gigantic institutions that are redistributed Tori and we're supposed to treat each other like a big family and we're supposed to have this homogeneous nation state and the other hand they're celebrating diversity and encouraging mass immigration and heterogeneous populations and guests, but those don't really work together.

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       So you build gigantic institute, gigantic states that presumed sort of. We're all one family and then you throw in this, this, this diverse set of people, especially with the refugee crisis in Europe and immigration in the United States and people are looking around going down, these people are my family. I don't even like these and yet I'm paying for them and that is A. I mean that that blows up. I'm. That's a disaster. It's a powder keg and so is the left and there's this core contradiction that they have between on a welfare state. On one hand and their celebration, Hetero heterogeneous populations on the other welfare state and diversity, they don't, they don't work. And that basically puts us where Germany sort of is at right now, right where they said, okay, 3 million people come on in now all these people are going to have to pay for you.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       We're not going to integrate you properly. I mean this is not only to identitarian movements rising up in Germany and in Hungary and of course in Russia and of course the US, you know, so it all just kind of follows. It's, it's inevitable. The left created this. I mean if, if after World War Two, we had just embraced liberalism by we should have, we should have, we wouldn't be where we are today, but we have another chance and that's why you're here. And that's why I'm here. We have another chance now to re embrace liberal liberal theory and to end to reject the left. Right? And don't feel yourself just because of the enemy of your enemy is, is there. It doesn't mean to ask to be your friend. I mean, we really do need to think of ourselves as kind of a distance from a political culture that, that rally around freedom and human rights and universal human rights and, and the enablement of humanity, the champion of the common person, uh, the rights of everyone to live freely with each other, to, to gain value from each other and to live in peace and stop thinking of our, of our fellow human beings as possible enemies.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       We don't want to get drafted into this political world that Carl Schmitt. Imagine for us, as I was describing crossfit you, you see it happening, right? That Schmidt, Ian View to slice and dice the population. Who Do you like? Who Do you hate? You know, who, who are your people? It's, this is not a good life. Yeah. And we feel it chopping away at both sides, right? Yeah, we do. We feel it. And so we don't, I just don't feel like we have to be part of it as best we can. Uh, let's find things we love, you know, and go places we love me with people who love of all different backgrounds, all different kinds of cultures, learn about alternative religions or learn about new ways to do things. Travel right. And the age of liberalism. There were no such things as passports, you know. All right, so let's, let's spend the last portion here on, on just these last five years really here in America because I remember just even, it doesn't have to be the last five years, but let's say even three years ago, just it's sort of the emergence of trump as a candidate when people started saying the phrase, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       Yeah, and I did a bunch of videos on it where I was basically saying I see two strains to this thing and people are now using this video against me. And what I saw was there was the sort of fun me makers and the. I know all of the people who were having fun online doing often doing awful things and Nazi imagery just to, to, to upset people in power and whatever. But sometimes it's very fun things too. And funny things, but I saw it like just the real sort of shit posters they're known in the

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       gay people. The whole idea was we could get, we can start sending a frog to some like intellectual and they're going to think that's a racist thing. And then they would, they would say I'm being under attack from racist. They would actually give them exactly what they wanted. So I saw this, this sort of fun shit posting whatever part of it. Not to say it didn't have elements I didn't like, but there were, I saw that as the bulk of it. And then alongside of that was this, that you're talking about the identitarian part, the true racist part, the part that had been sort of underground for a long time and then because of social media now is finding that it could actually influence people and beat it up. Well, okay. So those. And now and you know, and I think the media really fueled both of those things because basically when Hillary said that deplorables comment, she, she just lumped the whole damn thing together.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       And I think if she had not said that, I think it's very possible she be president anyhow. And she helped the country almost made they'll write exists. So it was what my question really is. How would you just define the alt right flat out, if I asked you right now, because I think the definition has changed and has it. But if I asked you right now in the summer of 2018 to definition, so you know, the, the, the phrase. All right, comes about what, 10 years ago, I think it was coined by, by Paul God prayed, who himself as a follower of Carl Schmidt, um, I, I would rather look at this as a, as, as a writer, Galleon collectivist movement, you know, and in general, that stretches from the early 19th century all the way up to the present that's characterized by love of dictatorship. I love of power, protectionist trade policy, nativist immigration policy, and an, and a resentment against commercial life. Because it's because it's, it's, it's too heterogeneous. Intuit and noble enough humanity. I mean, that's, to me the alt right is one species. I guess you could say one flavoring, one instanciation

Speaker 1:          00:58:15       have a much larger problem that stretches way back, which isn't in liberal theory of, of life in illiberal theory of, of, um, of, uh, politics. So that's, I think the right way to think about it. My first time I heard trump speak was July 2015 and I don't even think we were using the term right at the time, but he opened his speech with, um, immigrants are a problem. I thought, hmm. Then there was protection of their foreign goods, protectionist when do protection, something like that. It was third big point was I can fix everything. This is all sounding strangely familiar to me, you know, that's, that's like the three pillars of a writer Galleon ideology essentially. And um, I realized we had a problem and I understand. I do where people had a high regard for him. He was going to save us from, from the problems that Obama had created.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       And God knows those problems and the left has gotten just bonkers, right? So we need, we need protection from that. But he introduced his own form of problems in the unleashed it's own form of, of dangerous and and potential punch. Essentially despotic arrangements of power and in some ways are more insidious because they appealed to bourgeoisie. The left has always been a little bit culturally estranged, you know, from, from the mainstream of American life. Whereas trump connects very closely with it. This is why fascist movements have been oftentimes much more successful than the left socialist once. Wait, I gotta I gotta get this because I would have thought the opposite. So if you, if you would have asked me before you said that, I would say the left is the one that is understood the culture part of this, at least in the American piece of they certainly academia and culture, what you could and couldn't joke about.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       Culture. The left is as high. You know, socialist ideology never came from below. It was never working. Man's philosophy, it was always a mental. I was always the intellectuals. It was a top down rule was always the ruling class that hatched associates, socialist ideology that never would have been communism, socialism, all those things without the intellectual class. But fascism, if you'll allow me to use that term, a kind of flip scenario to have a little bit. It's more, it's much more of a from below it. You can keep your religion, you can keep your nationhood, your identity, your race, your language, rally around your friends, your family, you know, all the things that you believe are true. You and, and, and, and, and, and within me as a person, as a leader, I will, I will embody all your values and, and collected by as us in a way that that means something important that connects with who you are.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       So in that sense, it's a very effective way of being illiberal. Alright? So all that said, what is our way out of this precarious position? I think I get where I get the theme of what you're doing here is we have to just keep fighting for what we've been thinking better. Well, so dave, I think we need to rethink who we are. I think we need to deepen and enrich our understanding of who we are and what we're here to do, and it goes back centuries. I mean it was the liberalism that dog is out of feudalism that ended the guilds that brought us free trade, that ended slavery, that really gave birth to the modern world and we need to learn to take credit for that and make that ethos our ethos. Go back and read the works of Adam Smith and the Great Scottish, Scottish enlightenment thinkers.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       You know, and, and understand our history so we understand ourselves better. I think this is important because we need to stop thinking of ourselves even though we are radicals. I think you are. I think I am. I almost believe that we should stop thinking of ourselves that way. We should think of ourselves as normal. If I'm a radical, then the phrase radical, it's definitely not as cool as it used to be. I mean, I, I think I'm open to these ideas and I guess being, being open right now and being really living up to the ideals that you said fourth year. He's, these days it kind of is, and maybe liberalism has always been a radical creed because it opposes power. It always had been opposed to power. That's where we have to do now, but we also have to celebrate regular life. You know, we have to.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       We have to celebrate the good life and the beautiful things and the things we love, the people we love and the choices that we can make in the technologies that you can use it. I fall in love with the new technology. Every single day I came over, I came over to see you with this new funny pillow that I bought for $10 on Amazon and it allows me to sleep sitting up and I'm been raptured. But yeah, I think this is the way to happiness and I think ultimately is the path to political victory for us to to be, to be more hopeful, to be more cheerful, to be more, to celebrate life and celebrate love and celebrate. Wow. In a way in which neither left or the right or doing right now. It gives us as an opening to be awesome, to emancipate the world. We can do this. I got nothing better to do for more ride.
