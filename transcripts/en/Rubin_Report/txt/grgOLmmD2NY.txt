Speaker 1:          00:02          My guest this week is Kelly Carlin, daughter of the legendary comedian George Carlin. Kelly is an author and a speaker who's work connects many of the dots her father's life was all about. I've known Kelly for about four years now after connecting with her on twitter because of how much I admired her dad, we become great friends. Kelly is welcomed me into her world and the comedy community She's part of here in la. I thought Kelly would be the perfect guest this week, not only because of her new book about growing up as a Carlin, but also because of all the issues her father's comedy was about that it becomes central themes of what we do here on this show. George Carlin was a relentless defender of free speech using words and language to push the limits of what society found acceptable at the time he railed against political correctness.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Like no other comment before or anybody since he dissected the absurdities of life that ultimately bring us together rather than rip us apart. I can't tell you how often I'm watching some campaign nonsense or some ridiculous politically correct crusade and think, man, I wish George Carlin was still alive to tackle this. Not only do I want you to see George Carlin in a new way by sitting down with Kelly, but I also want to use our chat as a living, breathing example of something else that's going on here. As I mentioned, Kelly and I met on twitter. All I was to her was another person tweeting at her in 140 characters who had some connection to her father, like millions of other people, but through social media we met, we became friends, and now we share so much of our lives and our passions together. To me, that's what's so cool about what's happening here with you guys.

Speaker 1:          01:30          The reaction to what we're doing has gotten to a whole new level. I've been getting emails from literally all over the world, from Denmark to Saudi Arabia to Mexico. We're connecting because of the same ideas that George believed in, which I believe in and which you believe in. By the way, that doesn't mean that we agree on everything actually, in almost every email I get that's heaping praise on me. You guys managed to tell me something that we disagree on. I love that. That's what this is all about and it's precisely what the far right and the regressive left fear. If the rest of us can wake up and realize that we can come together despite differences, then they can't control us. It's really as simple as that. The authoritarians that exist on both sides want control, and the best way to do that is to keep everyone hating on each other all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:14          For all the things that Milo Yiannopoulos and I disagreed on, this is one spot we had total agreement. The rise of the Cultural Libertarians is here and it contains people from all over the cultural map, from Chris Rock to Bill Maher, from marginalized to Sam Harris. If George Carlin was still around, I think he would fit right in there, but it would have also been shared to make fun of any group that would have accepted him as part of it. The point of all this is that every week actually, every day that I've been doing this show, I see this movement getting stronger. You guys are not only connecting with me but with each other, and now when I see the usual regressive spout off their nonsense, there's an army of people calling them out on it. That is literally as important as anything that I do. George Carlin's most famous routine was the seven dirty words. You can't say on TV. We live

Speaker 2:          03:00          in a time that's getting dangerously close to the several dirty ideas that you can't challenge publicly. Let's honor the trailblazers before us, like George Carlin, by relentlessly challenging and ruthlessly mocking those who would attempt to silence us. Alright, let's do a show. My guest this week is an author, a speaker, and a one woman show or something, right? Her new book, a Carlin home companion tells her journey growing up as the daughter of George and Brenda Carla, and she's also my friend and throws a hell of a party. Kelly, Carla, and welcome to the show. I'm so excited to be here. This is so fabulous. Doesn't it seem more mature than anything we've done? We've grown up right now. This is kind of scaring me. This is very grown up. Before we start, you just pointed to our window at this picture in case now I know we're, we're blowing the illusion television, but that is a picture.

Speaker 2:          03:55          It's not an actual window that is, uh, the upper west side that's 89th street facing north and just a little bit past where this picture ends is actually just in the last year a street that is now named after your father. This isn't where I was intending to start with, but let, let's start there. Your Dad now is a street, has officially a street a at 121st and Amsterdam. We wanted it to be between Broadway and Amsterdam, but there's. And that was the block he grew up on, but there's also a church there. The church, his mother attended the church that they had, the school that he attended as a child. He was kicked out of that church, right? Wasn't where he was kicked out of the school, let take down to the school. And then he was allowed to come back to graduate for eighth grade, but he had to write the play in order to get back in which they were great.

Speaker 2:          04:42          It was actually a very progressive school for a Catholic school. Um, but the irony is, is that once we wanted to name the street, the church, I'm a got all up in arms about it, a worried well, they claimed that they were worried about kids coming out of school and looking up and seeing the name and then googling it and finding out about the seven dirty words that was their concern. Also, not a huge fan of religion, never more worried about the religion is bullshit video that they would probably find on youtube video. There must be 50 of them. There is probably as a. we're working on that. We're trying to, you know, organize all of that. But, but yeah, but you can go to 121st and Amsterdam on the other side of the street. And uh, there is a George Carlin way, so just to be clear, they live so it's on the same street street, but they just pushed it one block, they just put it across the street on Amsterdam because I mean it's, it's, once again, it's just the thing that churches have these lines that they draw and they're ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          05:45          But the good news is, is that when all this went down was it got us so much press that it ended up being like a kind of a funny thing. They actually got us more attention for the street sign that I think they probably would have wanted, although every comic in the world wanted to be there that day. And you had a Zillion zillion amazing day. And Kevin Bartini the comic. He's the one who initiated it and did it all. But Yeah, we had Colin Quinn and Dave attell and I'm just, you know, it was, it was a great day. Well, I love the fact that what I'm putting right here, this, we did this because I used to live on the upper west side. So it's a nice. It's a nice way to feel at home. Yeah, so as I said in my intro, one of the things that I that I love about having you here, and we've been doing this kind of stuff forever, but one of the reasons that I think is particularly apropos now beyond just your book is that all of the things that your dad stood for, I think are really coming to fruition right now.

Speaker 2:          06:36          There's something again, right? It's a cyclical thing. Yeah. It's like this endless thing, but I feel like there's a moment now between religion and political correctness and free speech, these things that he railed on more than anybody and did better than anybody. They're all coming back right now. So before we get into that, let's let's do something a little bit. We'll give them a little hint from the book. Give me something about your dad on, on the private side, because this is someone who talked about culture, not necessarily talked about himself, so let's just do a little of that. He, he was one of those comics which really didn't come to me until he died, really? But that who really did focus on, I mean he focused on, he talked about three things, you focused on the little things that we all share. So that was the observational humor stuff in the refrigerator man and the airline announcements and things like that.

Speaker 2:          07:28          He focused on language, which is another thing that we all share as a culture and then he like would go after the big subjects, death, religion, children, things like that. Um, but he never, he mentioned me once in a routine in like 1971, one of the earlier albums where I was very excited. He was talking about, um, what's a euphemism for Shit, you know, we call it number two and P as number one and how once I figured that out, I made funny combinations up and things like that. And that was the only time I was ever taught about. And for comics, you know, 99 percent of the time, their material is their family and their personal life. So, um, my dad was very different than that and he didn't. And he wrote a memoir, but we didn't publish it until we published it. After he died, so, um, what do you think that was, was about because he's so got into the mind.

Speaker 2:          08:27          He so got into the very bit of us that we all share. And yet that part he did. Was that respect maybe to your mom or to your family or. I don't know. I think, I think his mind just didn't travel there. His mind was out here and that's just the way his focus was. And uh, so it was kind of weird because I would, growing up I would see other comedians about their families and it did hit me a few times, especially like teenagers. Like why Sydney ever talk about us on like the tonight show. I remember one time he went on the tonight show with Carson as the host and Carson asked about his family and he had these funny made up sons that he talked about dark dot Gagnon was one of them, which I mean it was a great bit, but I just feel, I already know I've already felt a little invisible.

Speaker 2:          09:21          Therefore I felt even a little more invisible at that time. And yet I think I'm happy about it because I wasn't, my life wasn't fodder for his comedy, whereas my poor dad, our life together has become fodder for my art series a, which was a bone of contention for us. Uh, and I, and I do talk about that in the book and, and not so much as artists, but that there were some things that we had never talked about as a family that I really was willing to talk about on stage. Like people like spalding gray and um, uh, you know, uh, Sandra Tsing Loh and these other solo artists did, uh, you know, they go out and comedians. I mean, I think a lot of comedians are way more comfortable going on stage talking about their life there than having to go home and having a serious conversation with their loved ones.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Yeah. Well, we'll get to the sad clown thing. It'll look to address that. You do address that in your one woman show that was sort of a lead up to the book that there there's a sort of beautiful moment where you and your dad are talking and he sort of, there was like a little bit of sense of betrayal or a sense that he was going to be exposed in a way that he had an done

Speaker 2:          10:33          and I think ultimately, I mean what happened was I wrote a solo show and I sent him the script and inside the script I talked about having some feelings, some negative feelings about when my mother was dying and he had to go on the road and it was a conversation my dad and I had never had and we didn't have any real healthy conversation closure around it. But, and I, and I, looking back on it now, I think sending him that script was my way of saying, hey, I have these feelings, but this was one of the themes I wanted to work on in the book was that here's this man who is the truth teller. Like you said at opening of the show. I mean, this is the man who conquered everything was fearless and we'll talk about all the big stuff that our culture does not want to talk about on stage. And yet when it came to our family, we were very much the textbook, dysfunctional alcoholic family that did a lot of walking on eggshells, didn't do a lot of intimate talking about the issues and we all pretended that we were fine. You know, we all worked for the American family truly. And that's. And that's like when people talk about my book and they're like, oh, you have such a unique life. I'm like, yeah, not. I mean I did, but kind of like the all American family. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:46          So I don't want to delve too deep because I want people. I want people to buy the books, of course. So that. So that's an important piece of this. But just one more thing on that. Um, did you have a sense when you were growing up, you know, your dad, look, there were, there were drug things that you talked about in the book and in the show arrests, you know, he was, he was arrested that night that Lenny Bruce was arrested. Right? And is that. Yeah, that was before I was born. But these types of things that were going on, he was on the front lines. So how much of that do you, were you conscious, especially in your early years that your dad really was this, this legend? I mean, when you, when there's the Mount Rushmore of comedy, it's, you know, half the people say it's your dad. Half the people say it's prior and then maybe there's one percent that gets split amongst lenny bruce and a couple of years,

Speaker 2:          12:30          the legend kind of route mount rushmore thing really happened more when I was in my twenties. And uh, I was at a, uh, uh, an English class at Ucla and my professor says, you know, we're going to study a compare and contrast essays today. And I have a perfect example of, of how you should go about this, and he pushes the play button on a boombox and my dad's baseball, football routine comes out and I'm sitting there in this class of like 25 people looking around going, um, is anyone else

Speaker 1:          13:01          having this weird experience? Are you going to play any shit from anyone else's dad? Maybe that's when you realize,

Speaker 2:          13:09          oh yeah, big dent in the culture has happened here. Um, so, you know, I think it was from that point on that I knew like legend, but even before that I knew that he was obviously famous and people worshiped him and, and all that kind of stuff and was around for, you know, an arrest or two of his also. So I knew he was definitely on the front lines of something.

Speaker 1:          13:32          So let's get into some of the, some of the themes that, as I said, I have become the central themes of, of what I'm trying to do here, because you're, you know, I say to you all the time, as I said in the Intro, I'm watching the news constantly and I like either text you sometimes or I'll call you and be like, God, I wish your dad was around because. Because I can't do it. That can certainly. And I don't know anyone else that can, that can skewer stuff in that way. So let's just hit a couple of them. So the religion one, so you already mentioned a little bit about his history with religion. Was, was he an atheist? Did he describe himself in any specific way? Right.

Speaker 2:          14:04          He did not use the term atheist. He felt atheism was as dogmatic as any other ism out there. Um, uh, you know, lately I've been introduced to what they call the humanist, uh, you know, kind of community, which is something I relate to a lot more. I think he would have felt better about that. It sounds like they're not going to have as many meetings and armbands and things like that, which you used to talk about groups because it's things less koolaid. I think he felt any, you know, any group of people you get group think, and then where does the individual thinking, you know, happen in that situation? So that always worried him. Uh, I think he's self, you know, named himself mostly as an agnostic. Um, obviously didn't believe in the man in the sky with the beard thing. It's not like he was thinking of that was a possibility, but he had a deep sense of oneness with the universe.

Speaker 2:          15:00          He loved astronomy. He loved that idea of looking up and um, you know, that feeling you get when you look at me like, Jesus, we're just a speck here. And yet there's something about that being a Spec that expands us at the same time. So there was something around that. Um, he was a man who dropped acid in the sixties and had some transcendent experiences about that. And talk to me about, um, being a high and having an experience where he realized that he really was at one with everything, including the old tennis shoe in the gutter and that he realized that if he was, that everything was him and he was everything. And from that moment on he said he felt safe because he knew that no matter what he encountered in life, he was only encountering a version of himself. So that's, that's pretty spiritual stuff.

Speaker 2:          15:58          That's. Yeah. I mean you can put it under, in that box spiritual. Um, and you could, you could talk about it from a brain science way and say, okay, maybe there's things in the brain that makes us feel that way or whatever it is. But it is an experience that changes your world view and changes how you encounter your life and other people, you know. And, and I think that did that for him. Do you think a lot of his. Sort of. Because when I think of it, I think of this sort of anti religion, the rants that he would go on at the church and religion. And how much of it was just not even about religion specifically, but just about authoritarianism or was that really what it was about? It wasn't about religion. Well, I can't say I won't speak for him and I don't really know at all what motivated him to do those bits.

Speaker 2:          16:42          I never was privy to that part of his process. How he would sit me down during the Hbo Taping and let me see it just the way everyone else saw it. I never knew his process, but sure. I mean, I think if you looked at all of his material and and sifted through it and analyzed it, I think authoritarian is. It would be a huge aspect to it all that anyone out. I mean he, my dad never made it through a single institution encounter. He got kicked out of everything. Elementary School, junior high, high school did not finish high school. Ninth Grade Dropout. Then joined the air force early, promoted and demoted. I got a little piece of paper of his that has all the listings of the promotions and the emotions that he had in the air force. So he got kicked out of that and then ultimately, you know, became this straight suit, clean cut comic and even that conservative form that he had to be in, in order to be a successful comedy because his dream is to be in the movies eventually that felt, you know, too restrictive and authoritarian for him and he rebelled against that to ultimately he was always looking.

Speaker 2:          17:52          I mean, he talked about the line. He always, you know, a comics job is to find the line and across it. And I think that's what that's about is anyone telling you you can't do something. All right, let's cross it and really see what we can do on the other side of that. So let's just back up for a second, because you mentioned that at one time your dad was this sort of. It wasn't conservative comic, but he was, he was buttoned down, get kind of. He was sort of like everyone else in this. He was that generic, whatever that were, but then had a moment that it all changed. Do you, do you know what it was personally at that moment or was it purely like lsd? It was. So, it was the drug. I mean, here's the deal on the inside. He was already the other person.

Speaker 2:          18:32          He had been smoking weed since he was 14. His politics were a little more conservative growing up. His mom was a Republican, as you know, whatever they call it, snow, anything anymore rela relative to fiscal because what every school. Conservatives central liberal, right. Exactly. Um, and when he met Jack Burns, his first thing was he was a comedy duo with Jack Burns. Jack Burns was left progressive and my dad was more moderate guy and Jack took him and pulled him and taught him about everything. And then of course Lenny Bruce, you know, blew his mind too. So on the inside, dad was a radical. He was hanging out with musicians in the village, you know, he was, he was one of them, but he had to put on this exterior in order to build this career because in his mind he really did. He had this Danny k plan and he wanted to be like Danny Kaye in the movies and he felt the way to do that was tv and these night clubs.

Speaker 2:          19:31          I mean really, there were no comedy clubs back then. You were doing the playboy club with a Copa Cabana and you were opening for, you know, God knows four seasons was. Yeah, I mean, yeah, he were lucky. It was a foreseeable bird. Humperdink. Yeah. I mean he opened for the supremes and Las Vegas and 69, you know, it's like the, you know, some really think how crazy that is. Like you can say it and we don't really absorb what that means. But your dad. Yeah. Even before his transformation opening. Yeah. Supremes. It seems so bizarre. Yeah. Yeah. And that was a, that was a great gig for him. He was making a lot of money in that Gig. I think you tell a story where he actually got fired from there. He got fired for that Gig. Yeah. Yeah. He was making more money than he ever had made.

Speaker 2:          20:10          And he said the word, uh, what was it? His ass in that one or shit, I think you said Shit that he got fired twice in Vegas after shit. Her Shit and Redd Foxx is down the street doing triple x stuff of course. So, you know, but, but this was the thing he realized he was entertaining the parents of the people that he was hanging out with and, and, and here's like another part of his outsider status to was he was 30 in 1967, so he was already too old for the hippies and all the kids that were going through that because they were all early twenties, but he wasn't relating to their parents either. So he was this interesting bridge between those two generations, but related obviously much more to the younger generation.

Speaker 1:          20:56          Let's talk a little bit about, about language because we've been doing a ton on political correctness. Your Dad was not only the most unpolitically correct person, but, but hated it with a passion. Yeah, right. He really hated it and used words in a way to show us how silly we are being about things all the time. And I think right now we're in this very bizarre place in our country where we're afraid of certain words were afraid of offending people. You talked about the line before and pushing the limits and like jumping over the line, what do you think he would make of what's going on in this country right now with, with words?

Speaker 2:          21:33          Well, I'm talking about that. I think he would make what he, what he's always made it. But I mean, in the early nineties this was going on in colleges too. I was at Ucla and actually did a, a forum on political correctness and invited my dad to come in and do that. And um, that was coming out of the Reagan era, you know, so there was a lot of that. But, but if you really think about it like political correctness, there's something about like polite society, like we're not allowed to talk about certain things, you know, I think it kind of grows out of that. But, you know, for him, uh, he was always bothered by the fact that it, it, it, it comes from a place of people wanting, you know, respect for tolerance, you know, of, of each other and our identities. So it's sort of well intentioned.

Speaker 2:          22:22          It's very well intentioned. And my dad grew up in Harlem, but he grew up in Harlem, a Irish, White Harlem, right next to black and Spanish Harlem. Yes, he would've called it Black Harlem. And um, and that doesn't make him race. It does not make him racist. And uh, and so he very much identified with the black experience, the outsider experience and growing up, uh, the n word was never ever said in our house. And my dad told me it is the one word. I mean, I was allowed to say any of the words. You can say all seven for TV, but say them in, in right the right places. He didn't want me getting in trouble at school and other people's houses, but the n word was one where that was Kelly never, ever, ever. So he got the whole idea of people wanting to define themselves and having their own identity.

Speaker 2:          23:16          That's a very important thing and it's, I think it's an important part of evolution of our species, but when you do it by not tolerating other speech and suppressing language and speech, I don't think he believed that that was not the route to go about this, that, you know, using intolerance to increase tolerance. It just some to something it just made, does it fit or something, you know, and you know what, here's the thing about speech and our country. I mean, if you're, if anyone's under the first amendment, it's always that old thing that, you know, that thing. It's always a balance between two forces, you know. And so here we are, we're, it's about freedom versus sensitivity. Both things are important, really important. Um, but uh, you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, right? I, I would argue that freedom is a little more important than sensitivity, right?

Speaker 2:          24:11          Well, for you it is for some other people it isn't, you know, but this is the great thing about a democracy is, and the way we work this stuff out is by having free speech and a marketplace of ideas. So therefore, if you're trying to control people's speech, then are you really having a marketplace of ideas and we're not talking about people bullying people and insult comics and comics who want to hurt feelings or you know, uh, the whole rape thing that went down. I mean, there is obviously we're not talking about hate speech, we're not talking about hate speech. Exactly. But the thing is my, you know, my dad did talk about is that um, standup comedy is a monologue. It's not a conversation, it's an art form that it's a monologue. It was his bully pulpit. He used to say, the Adi, I'm here for me and the audiences here for me, he wasn't here for them.

Speaker 2:          25:04          He's not there to do a seminar. And he's not. Even though he was professed sorial, he was not there to change the world in some way. He was there to get shit off of his chest and he did it in a certain way and so I would love to know his new take on all this college stuff and all this stuff going down, but I think it would be built on a lot of this stuff right now with this whole thing we have on college campuses with social justice warriors and safe rooms and trigger warnings. Things we've talked about. You wrote an interesting piece about this on your facebook page that was related to comedy and all of this and a little bit it was sort of about your dad, but we jumped off because of Jerry seinfeld making a comment. Yeah. And Todd and todd glass had written a, a, a reply to a piece in the La Times and he felt, you know, he was kind of on the other side of it, of respecting people's rights to define themselves more and you know, and I just, I just kind of.

Speaker 2:          25:55          I'd finally, after I think, you know, about a year and a half or two years of trying to think about all this had pulled all my thoughts together and, and, and, and some of it I've already shared here, but the whole trigger warning thing, I mean I really would have loved my dad to unpack the, just the phrase trigger just to help us unpack it a little bit and I can only imagine who he would have pissed off with that I'm sure it would have been the feminists and my dad was a considered himself a feminist. I mean, you know, that was the irony, right? So something like that, he would have pissed off the feminists, but he was very pro woman actually. Yeah. He did. Was To empower women who've never. He would really talk about something. Yeah. His humor for the most part I would say is very pro woman.

Speaker 2:          26:40          And um, but I mean, even when he talked about using the term rape, you know, and it can rape ever be funny. And then he tells this joke about, you know, uh, donald or daffy duck fucking elmer fudd or something. It's funny, it's a great image. You can't help but laugh. So that's gay duck rape. I'm sorry. That's pretty funny. Now I've got the vegans. Oh Man. And the game. Alright, please trigger warning on that. That joke right there please. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, I would. Yeah, I, I, yeah, I, I do like you, I miss him too. There are certain things that come up where I, where I do. I'm like, I wish dad was here and then I'm like, okay, so we're going to have to figure this out on my own or on her own like without dad how to walk through this, you know, and there's some comics out there who I think definitely helped with this.

Speaker 2:          27:30          Absolutely. The work is helping. I was going to ask you that a little closer to the end, but as long as I think Bill Maher is, I think Lewis Black is a, I think Louis Ck is doing brilliant work. I think Amy Schumer is doing great work. I'm Nora Dunn. Just went after her today and uh, because she's talking about using, naming her body parts, using nasty words to name her body parts and she thinks it's self shaming. So that's gonna be an interesting conversation between the feminists. What's going on with that? Um, and, you know, and I, and there's a ton of younger comics too that are doing great work. Um, and not that Amy Schumer isn't 1:30 or so young, but, uh, but yeah, I mean there's, there's, there's good work going on at there. Chris Rock, you know, always does great work. So, um, you know, they're out there pushing, pushing, pushing the edge, but the line, they should be.

Speaker 2:          28:24          So last thought on the, on the free speech and the political correctness stuff, uh, is, is this where we could really teach younger people. And I hate to say that as if. I mean, if there's an arrogance in that too. I mean, I think generations come up and they've got their own worldview. They've got their own life experience. They're trying to define themselves. Um, but yes, I think they weren't around for the fights. They weren't around for Lenny Bruce Getting arrested. They weren't around for my dad getting arrested. They don't understand the luxury. They have a around free speech and um, this regressive left. I guess that's what we're calling them now. I had, I saw one of your path, what I'm calling. I had to look it up. I'm like, what exactly does he mean by that? Now I got it. I understand it. And it's these people that would be attacking your dad with the kids and it's, there's an authoritarianism around it.

Speaker 2:          29:18          There's a need to control everything in order for the world to be comfortable. And Hey, you know what, I get it. That generation is facing a planet that's dying, uh, an economy that doesn't look very good. Politics that have stopped working, our democracy has stopped working. Um, I too would want to control things. And so maybe if you can control people's language and create a sense of safety, I mean, maybe that's what this is about on a psychological level. I don't know. Um, I, I get it, but yeah, I think it is our job to at least bring some history up and educate them about the fights we've had in this country to end to understand what the purpose of free speeches and it's not like enter government is no longer censoring. Yes. This is the, it's now corporate America and these interest groups, you know.

Speaker 2:          30:11          So did you ever think or or someone. So your father literally arrested by because of exercising his free speech. This is someone who last gigs because of using pretty mundane curse words. Do you think he could have ever imagined if you would agree with what you just said, that you would fear the lack of free speech? Not because the government is coming down, which is so funny. We're doing it to ourselves. Do you think he could have ever envisioned, envisioned? He had a lot to say about business and corporations. I mean he really hated all of them. They are the, they are the owners of this country and have been ever since the industrial age began. What was that bit and his last Hbo Special About The true owners? I don't think so. I think it was the second to last one. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I mean he would have a lot to say about that and he, I mean, it's not like, you know, 10 years ago corporations weren't trying to shave him at advertising dollars, shape everything on television.

Speaker 2:          31:06          I mean, now with the Internet, it's interesting because we have a lot more freedom, you know, and, and, uh, you know, and I look at like the bigger picture of, and you think of like the expansion of the freedom that the Internet has given us. So it's not strange that some other part of our culture wants to shut something down. You know, there's this, there is a balance like this all the time, you know, whether it's in our own individual psyches are the collective psyche. So it's fascinating. And ultimately, you know what I tell people when people say, Oh, your dad, I wish you know. And I'm like, yes, I get it. And then I'm going to try not to say to you, yeah, but it's true and I. But I remind people, I say, look, no matter what, we can remember this dad said, when you're born, you get a ticket to the freak show and when you're born in America, you get a front row seat.

Speaker 2:          31:54          So we're at the freak show and then he added later on another thing which I love, which is, and some of us get to sit on the side and take notes and talk about it, which is what we get to do. So, you know, which is a really privileged position to be in. Um, but now everyone gets that privileged position because it's the internet and there's comments sector going on, right? Twitter, they're pretty good to me. They're the people watching this. Me Too. We've cultivated something nice here. So the political situation we have going on this, this pathetic really pathetic group of candidates are pretty much on all fronts, in my opinion, with Bernie being the one exception. I agree. Um, what, what do you think he would make of this now? He did. He, he, he obviously was socially liberal, but he didn't identify as a Democrat, did he?

Speaker 2:          32:41          He didn't vote, but he didn't vote at all, but he was very progressive. He always chose people over property. So, uh, whatever candidate chose people over property, he would lean towards that. Uh, before he died, he was happy about Hillary back in 2008. That was, he was not around for the big Obama surge and I know he would have been thrilled to have seen a black president. I know he would have really been thrilled about that. And I got to be in Washington and November picking up his Mark Twain Prize. When Obama flew over, my husband and I were on the steps of the Lincoln memorial and Obama was flew over in the helicopter to go visit George Bush in the White House for the first time. And all I could think about is, I wish my dad was here right now. He would have brought a tear to his eye.

Speaker 2:          33:23          Absolutely. It was a very sentimental man in that way. But, um, but yeah, but, and he saw it all as bullshit as he said all the time. He really had a detachment to it. He didn't vote. He hadn't voted since mcgovern lost in [inaudible] 72. I think that's when his heart really broke. Um, and yeah, I struggle with that internally, that he wasn't voting yet. He was talking so much about this, but he also felt the system was so broken almost that it was he would it be on repairs. Logic was that you, if you vote, you don't have the right to complain if you

Speaker 3:          33:58          both.

Speaker 2:          34:00          Oh, that's talk about flipping something on a test because then you're part of the problem. Yes, completely. That was his thing and he would, he'd said that a few times. It was like, uh, but uh, that was his stance. So, and that's where he stood with that and you know, he really did. He was able to compartmentalize and detach, like I said, at home, rooting for Hillary, happy that, you know, that she was, you know, shaking things up, but on stage he didn't need, would never talk about, you know, one way or the other. I mean like Lewis Black, you know, his politics, you know who he's voting for. Bill Maher, he gives money, like he's tried to get money to burn money to Bernie on Friday. He's like, I want to give you money. I can only give you $5,400. You're not taking any super PAC money, you know, you have a pre, you give him another million dollars.

Speaker 2:          34:48          I mean, Bill Maher literally gave and Obama super a million dollars budget and it was sort of brilliant what he said because he was like, he's like, I know this sounds like I'm doing this for Obama, but I'm doing this for me because I don't want the other guy to become right. And that's what he was saying Friday night too. I was like, you know, if you don't like the fish, eat the chicken people. What do you think as a comic, there's a risk in that because then you've shown your cards too much in that what your dad did and in a way by, by holding a little closer. I think every comic has their own approach. It's, it's as you know that we're all snowflakes.

Speaker 3:          35:17          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          35:20          Yeah. Everyone's got their own approach to it in their own way. My Dad liked being, not part of it all. He liked not being, having no stake in it, uh, so that he could emotionally detached from it. I think that's how he personally protected himself from all of it to um, I personally don't think that's a healthy way to go through life. I love my dad dearly. I, you know, my dad was like, I gave about the species I gave up on the planet and I was in my late thirties, early forties at the time and I was like, well gee, I hope to have 30 to 40 more years on the planet. I'm still kind of involved in the species a little more and I get the, you know, evolution is slow, but I do believe in the evolution of consciousness, you know, so I try to do my little part.

Speaker 2:          36:05          My Dad, he was never an activist. He was never on the front lines, even in the Vietnam War and all that kind of stuff. Meaning had opinions about it, but he's not a man who got involved. He onstage did his act, you know, activism and there's probably something to be said for that, that we all in life, and I'm not just talking about comics, but everybody sort of picks very little role about how they're going to go out and some people are gonna have kids and try to teach them the right thing and people like your dad will have one child, but then, but then teach a generation. Although he claimed he never. Although it's not about changing minds, you know, uh, you know, when I used to say please, really bullshit dad, like, come on. Oh, he changed me. He was surreal. I mean, that's what he did.

Speaker 2:          36:47          He, he, you know, he had a big stick and he'd come out and whack us all with it and go, oh, we'd all go, oh shit. You're right. Oh, that's right. That's the beauty of it is that I agree ultimately the beauty of comedy more than anything else, that when I would watch those specials from literally from being 12 years old to being 35, that I would watch them and go, God, this is the truth, is the truth. And I don't know how any other comic where it, I mean even as his daughter, I would feel changed in some way by each of his shows. There was something in me, some idea I had about the world had been stretched in a new way. Not always a comfortably uncomfortable way, but something had been like, oh, a little mind expansion had gone on and I don't know if there are other comics who do that.

Speaker 2:          37:37          I mean, I'm entertained by a lot of them. Um, it does seem that something in comedy has changed where counterculture doesn't seem to be very cool anymore. Your Dad, part of the coolest was he was counterculture. And right now if you were counter culture, it really means you're sort of against your, against administration. So you're somehow you were against Obama I think maybe because of all this political correctness stuff, there's a sense that that's not cool. So it sort of like the death of. I don't know, I think there's still a lot of independence in that. Comics have to always are always the outsider no matter what. I mean, even if they vote and they give a million dollars, Bill Maher is still going to give Obama Shit for shit. I mean, he's still got his positions, you know, and Louis black to given Bernie Shit. Bill Maher the other day as he was saying I support.

Speaker 2:          38:25          Yeah. You know, and I think that really is the independent thinking and spirit of, of comedy. So I think that is, I really do think that's alive and well. I mean, I, you know, I spoke about Amy Schumer earlier when I first saw amy Schumer three or four years ago, she was on the Roseanne Roast and I thought, Oh really? Dick Jokes girl, like, you know, we fought so hard, you know, and you're telling Dick Jokes. I didn't get it. I didn't get. She was playing a persona that she's kind of pushing up against all of this stuff and she's doing it in her own way too. She's counterculture in some way because she is taking her. She's really, she's, she's a, she's a huge feminist and yet she's taking some of it to task at the same time. And, and I like that. She makes us a little uncomfortable around that

Speaker 1:          39:06          stuff. Well, we could talk about your dad and all this stuff forever, but I want to shift a little bit to sort of how we know each other past couple of years and, and some of the things that we talk about all the time and you know, you. So you have these parties every couple of weeks at your house where you bring basically what I would describe as sort of the wackiest mix of comedians and actors and writers and philosophers and who, what other professions are there behind the camera. People, musicians, this wild crew of people. And it's always changing and coming and going, uh, and you call the poly mine. And so I first want you to explain what it means to you. But the reason I love it so much in it because it's so become part of how I've treated this show, that I want my audience to be part of what we're talking about. I want it to be a conversation. So now explain what, what the poly mind is and most of the people that you've had at your parties. By the way, I've had on previous incarnations my show. I bet you, I mean, you really like opened up like a zillion friends to me in the comedy community, all that

Speaker 2:          40:08          part of the. I mean, I love community. I think being an only child I was a little. I was, I was a loner, a bit lonely. So community's always been important to me and especially in the last 20 years I've really felt that. And um, and, and part of what happened and how this came to be was when my dad died, I became part of the comedy community, which I was not a part of before and met Paul prevents and Paul Provenza knows everybody and he is part of that. Like he and him and my world kind of merged in this thing called the what I call the poly mine commune emerged. And for me, the poly mind is, comes from my, my roots of studying, uh, Carl Jung's psychology, uh, the collective unconscious that we have all these archetypes inside of us. We have all these voices in our head and they all have a right to have a voice, you know, from the most staunch conservative voice in our head to the most liberal voice, uh, to, to the most immature, to the most mature. We all, everything gets a voice and gets a seat at the table at some point because every voice ultimately is important.

Speaker 1:          41:15          Wait, so let me get this clear. We're not supposed to shout down the voices we don't like and we're not supposed to call them bigots and racists and homophobic and sexist. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          41:22          Yeah. And I think the way, the reason we do that in public is because we have such intolerance for the voices inside of our heads. Also, I think what his enter his outer. I mean, that's part of what I do. So part of. I just love that word. And so I just came up with this word poly mind because I really feel like we all are individually a polyman, but community in itself is a polyamide that we each have our own perspectives and their own way of seeing it in and we can agree on 10 things. And then there's four things that we totally disagree on it. And that's okay. We love each other. Imagine a read on everything. It will be terrible. It would be boring and there there's no learning and expanding and there's no, you know, there's, there's no juice in life at all then, you know.

Speaker 2:          42:05          So yeah. So this, so I just, you know, playfully call it the poly mine commune, you know, because ultimately I'm a Hippie, you know, the blues and the weed helps of course it does test and, but really it's become um, what I love, what happens in these things is that, like you said, this cross pollination happens. And my favorite thing which happens when I, you know, I haven't had a lot of big parties lately. I used to have a lot of big parties, but in the big parties, maybe 60 people will be at my house and it always happens that two people will encounter each other in my kitchen who have not seen each other in 15 years who grew up together. I was something crazy like that. And there's this re, uh, you know, this reunited reunited and it feels and um, and then there's like suddenly they're collaborating on a thing like three months later I hear they're collaborating on a thing. There's a lot of collaboration going on and that I don't know, that just brings me such joy to know that I can create a space for that stuff to happen. It is really good.

Speaker 1:          43:11          Yeah. And I mean I can give you a living, breathing example of that as you know, because Rosanne and I became good friends and we've been working together and doing things. One of the more interesting ones that happened at your place was, I guess it was probably about a year ago, I met Taylor Negron, who for those that don't know him was, he was a brilliant comic actor. And then stand up really in the eighties into the nineties, storytime brilliant, brilliant guy who I loved without knowing him. And then I met him one night at the fire pit at your place and we were talking and you know, I could tell like he thought I was funny that I got it kind of thing and you know, we were talking, talking and then I told him about my show and he said he would do my show. And then literally two months later I found out he was dead like didn't you? And I assume he knew he was sick. I don't know a lot about the story, but those types of things are what's going on there. And that's what was so magical about it.

Speaker 2:          44:01          Yeah. It's, it's, and people feel comfortable to be themselves there. I mean, that's why Roseanne will come to my house and I know it's not like I have, as you know, there's not like all these a list celebrities sitting around my fire pit. It's not like that actually. But, um, every once in a while Roseanne will come by and she feels comfortable there because no one's like gawking at her or whatever. And um, but it was like, I mean, the first time she came to my house, it was, it was one of those moments because even though I grew up being my dad's daughter and everything, these people, icons to me, and I'll never forget the first day she was there, her and Rick Overton and Paul Provenza, we're sitting around the fire pit and I'm walking by with some friends and I'm like going, Oh God, what's going on in my backyard?

Speaker 2:          44:43          And meanwhile you're the daughter of George Carlin. So I have no concept of that. That's just who I am. So, yeah, but, but, you know, and yet this incredible thing starts to happen. And like I said, believe people will start collaborating and it's, it's just, it's beautiful. And I don't even really bring this up so that for the purposes of name dropping, something like that, as much as that, there's something really interesting when you can connect people that care about the same things. And that's really what we're trying to do here and that's what I, and I think that's the hope of our species, is that we can have a safe space for conversation. Um, and you know, one of the things about the internet, which is fabulous because we met on twitter and all of that is great, but there doesn't feel like there's a lot of safe space, you know, you have to really filter through a lot of anger and rage and lonely people who are trying to make a dent in the world and not do it in a nice way.

Speaker 2:          45:38          I'm not conducive to conversation or listening. There's a lot. There's very little listening going on on the Internet. There's a lot of talking going on. So yes, uh, in, in our lives, we are trying to create space where we can hear each other, you know. Uh, well I'm glad you mentioned the online thing and twitter because one of the things we talk about all the time is I don't even have this device. The device I was going to go into my pocket. But fortunately I actually gave it to my producer before we started. I don't have it on me. This is a rare moment that I don't have my phone on. Are you reading? Are you okay? I'm totally okay. And we're here, right? We're present. We're here. We're having a conference. Not like it's not right. Yeah. And so the reason I think we talked about all the time is because we hate it.

Speaker 2:          46:21          We and we love it. I know, and yet it brought us together and then at the same time I want to make a living using it because we find an audience and we can connect with an audience with it. I mean, I found my voice on twitter. I mean, I learned to write a joke because of twitter and, and the limit of twitter that go onto me of words that, which I think they're planning on changing. And I'm like, no, I love twitter, but I told you I'm not going to keep saying your dad for that. Um, but, but this device and this thing that we're in this horror, um, what are you, what do you. To me it's a net win at the end of the day, it's the net week, but it is connected. So many people. It's literally helped revolutions in Egypt. Um, and then on the other hand, I see people's attention spans are being shredded.

Speaker 2:          47:07          There's no more stories about that. Neurons in people's brains are firing differently. Yeah. You know, every two seconds. And if you're on a street corner meeting a friend where you might have to stand there and look up at the sky, God forbid you're, you know, you're liking instagram and you're like, I don't even like this person, like all of this stuff. I think for me, what's really. I mean we've talked about this before, but even on a new level, just in the last month or so, I really am starting to get sick of the intrusiveness of it. How dare it. And I say it like it's some sort of autonomous thing and I haven't invited it in. It's not autonomous yet, but it does kind of feel that way because it's the part of my brain. Like I don't feel like I have control over that part of my brain. So it is feel like, and I really feel like if you want to be the fear is that if you put it away, you're not going to be part of the culture that you feel like you're actually missing. So you do feel like you're missing something and you know, you probably are. But as you know, when you and I do our little retreats that are electronic retreats and we turn off for a week or 10 days or sometimes a weekend,

Speaker 1:          48:14          you don't really miss that much, you know, that's the thing. So it goes on. So right before we launched the show in September, I got married the week before in Sonoma and I've told you this, but I did 10 days off. I did not look at my phone for 10 days. I didn't look at email, I didn't look at twitter, I didn't post. I posted one thing on youtube for 30 seconds just to say I'll be back, don't. I wasn't like, you've been worried about me. I don't think anyone is entail fitting care. I thought they cared, they didn't. But I actually, I genuinely felt my brain resetting. I felt I've described to you before as like, you know, when you used to turn on an old desktop computer and there'll be some worrying and some being being. And I felt bad. I actually felt that in my head and then when I got back I was like, wow, everyone's just up to the same old. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          49:00          same old conversations, same old annoyances, same old bitching and moaning.

Speaker 1:          49:05          And yet we're both agreeing it's net good. So is that the. That's the conundrum

Speaker 2:          49:09          I think in and so it really is like everything else, it's neutral so it's can be used for good or evil and like everything else, you have to be conscious about it. You have to really decide what are you using this for in your life and in and in your career and how much of it, you know, what, there may be an overall net good, but how much of it is a net negative in your life and your personal life and in your process and your creative process? You know, I've been finding lately that I'm doing much better away from it all because I'm going deep down to try to figure out what my next book is. I can't do that when I'm online and I'm doing, I'm looking out into the world. I have to go inside of myself to figure that stuff out and do some research and some things, but I have to be very conscious about what I'm doing.

Speaker 2:          50:05          Um, and, and that's my process and I'm figuring that out and I think the longer we have this technology, I mean you have to think about it in 2008 was the first smartphone. The first iphone came out. That's only been seven years. So as a species, it's nothing as a culture that's nothing. So we are starting to feel the pain of it and, and, and the problems with it and I, you know, and I think we're going to start making some real new decisions about it too. I'm guessing that, I mean it's, I feel like I'm already doing that in my own personal life.

Speaker 1:          50:46          Yeah. And not only doing it in your personal and your professional, so you do a podcast also where you talk a lot about sort of waking up and and the spiritual journey that we're on and I think all of that is directly related to this stuff because when we're, when we're in it, people are fighting, people are approved, giving you an endless approval. But to me it's like the approval stuff, which is really nice. It's nice, but like that it's like, oh well I, I think I'm putting saying good out there. So it's nice to be acknowledged. I don't really dwell on it. But then you get some negative stuff and it can, it can spin you out out. Tell it days. And that's what I mean about this. All this all being live, this whole thing is actually alive

Speaker 2:          51:27          and yet there's something exciting about, you know, that if we were really to become a collective, a conscious collective mind on some level where we could really solve the really big problems that we need to solve. We need many voices to do that. I mean, that's what democracy is about, this marketplace of ideas and so it invites that, you know, there's this other level of connection that, you know, um, there's a Pakistani hip hop artists a deal. Omar, who I met also on twitter fan of my dad because he saw youtube videos. This kid is 20 something in Pakistan, hip hop artist. He was just at my house a few nights ago. Um, that's amazing that he and I connected in the world on twitter to begin with once again and now we're friends in real life. That's, there is hope for a species when we can do stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          52:24          You know, I, we sat around the fire pit the other night and we really asked them, what's it like there, what's really going on, what's the thinking, what is the Pakistani government really doing? You know, all this stuff. I got to have that conversation with someone because of this stuff. So, but, but, you know, all of the trolling and all of the distraction and all of the Click Bait, I'm, once again, it's like anything else, you either going to let the distraction distract you because that's what they all want. I mean, you know, they were the fuck that is. But um, ultimately keep us fighting with each other and then we can't look at the real problems and try to solve them. That's okay.

Speaker 1:          53:05          Literally how, I don't know if you saw in the green room at the beginning of that's how I started.

Speaker 2:          53:09          Yeah. And, and so therefore we're not really having the real conversations we should be having, but dammit we are because you're here, you're doing this. There's a lot of real good conversation going on in the world now. But, but we have to be the grownups and say, Ya know, more clickbait. Sorry, I'm not, I'm not doing it, you know, and the, and the ones who are distracted by it, well there's always going to be mob mentality. It's part of the species. It's how we're wired.

Speaker 1:          53:37          Yeah. And that's what's so nice about doing something that I think people are responding to the way they are because there's so much crap. So it's not like there's five things and they're finding something that they relate to. There's a good jillion things and they're finding some something that's, that gives them a little sense of presence or a little center.

Speaker 2:          53:53          Yes, people are hungry for it. And I think after this, you know, this Internet explosion, we all had fun being distracted for the last we all 10 years or whatever. It's all fun to be distracted. But now it's also like, oh, it's the hottest year again. Oh, it's crazy weather. Oh, this shit's really going down. Oh, there's no one gonna fucking be sweeping out of the sky and rescuing us. Oh, maybe we do need to get our shit together. Maybe we do need to just. I mean, it doesn't have to be these serious heavy as conversations all the time, but where are the grownups? I want to go hang out with the grownups and yes, smoke some pot and have a nice drink and laugh and be silly too. But um, yeah, I want to be hanging out with the people that are kind of trying to think straight about that.

Speaker 1:          54:35          Well, that's what we're trying to build here. I almost feel that that should be the ending of the show. But I'm going to give you one more. I'm going to give you one bonus question which is what's next? What's next? What's this worth? What is the next after all this, because I know how much, how much of you you had to pour into this book. I saw the copies before I saw the manuscript when it was a, just a printed from your printer and all that and how much you had to put yourself into this and go into talking about things that are scary to talk about and in and expose your, not only your dad but your mom in a way my whole life and your whole life in a way that people didn't know and you know, especially because someone like your dad where he's held up to this thing and that you were showing him in a different light and all that stuff. Where do you go?

Speaker 2:          55:13          Yeah, I mean I think there's been kind of two mes the last 10 years, the one that's had this book in me and know that it was unfinished business and that I had to, that in some ways it was going to give me permission to have a bigger conversation in the world. And, and on a personal level it was unfinished business just around my psychological healing. Um, I mean I am a person who had studied psychology and I do focus more on the inner life and the cultural life on, on some levels, although I'm pretty 50 slash 50 these days. So really I think my next thing is really pointing my, my mind slightly more outwards. You know, that it'll always be interested in our personal process and how do we get from a to B and B to c and C to d. But I think they're really connected.

Speaker 2:          56:01          I think how we do this on the inside the micro is connected to the macro and, and how we treat ourselves is ultimately how we treat each other and how we treat the planet. And so I'm interested in connecting all of those dots. I don't know exactly what it looks like right now, thinking I'm going to start up my podcast again. I'm looking to something a little more elevated level around the podcast, maybe with video or something and finding a new format. Um, I've suddenly become the humanist girl I go to. I did a keynote speech at the humanist association, American Humanist Association conference last summer. I was speaking at the reason rally. I'm speaking at the reason rally and I've been hired to do another one in May in Vancouver. And I'm suddenly like, I'm the spiritual humanist girl. Uh, you know, it's, it's very interesting. But there's something about soul and meaning and the inner life that I think is important and it's important part of the conversation and doesn't have to be thrown out just because we don't believe the whole church bullshit and religion of bullshit. Um, there's still way to find meaning in wonder. I think wonder is a really important aspect. If we could get reconnected to the wonder of being alive, um, we'd all

Speaker 1:          57:20          appreciate people a little bit more. Stop yelling at each other, yelling at each other. Right. You know, I mean obviously it's not going to happen, but I, but I really believe so and I think we would really treat our planet a little better. So I'm, I'm kind of want to be in the wonder business, whatever that means. Right. I did not know that the answer was going in that direction, but it's been, you know, look, we've been on this adventure for awhile and I look forward to seeing what's, uh, what's next. You can follow Kelly and give her all your approval and disapproval and all of that good stuff on twitter. It's at Kelly underscore Carla. She's got the unders. I do. I'm sorry. I was, I was a Dork at the beginning of all this. I didn't know what was going on. Got The underscore. Or you can check out her book, a Carlin Home Companion, which you can get pretty much anywhere books are sold and thanks for watching. And uh, now we can go get a drink and do the other stuff.
