Speaker 1:          00:00:05       The question I get asked more than anything else lately is how can you possibly say that revenge of the Sith was a good movie, but after that, and I do have my reasons, the next most asked question is, who do you trust in the media? I'm finding this question harder and harder to answer these days, which is yet another indication of how screwed up our political and social system is right now. At the same time, it's hard to know just how screwy our world is or whether it's just the loudest and craziest voices that consistently get amplified on social media. Maybe the American revolution actually was a bit nuttier than the history books would tell us, but we'll never know because George Washington didn't have the chance to live tweeted without trust. We really don't have the basic underpinnings for a free and pluralistic society. We have to trust our elected officials, will do the jobs they're sworn in to do and carry out the promises they said they would deliver upon.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       We have to trust that our media will keep the political elite in check and not just suck up to the powers that be and we have to trust that our institutions are strong enough to withstand corrupt politicians and totalitarian ideologies that would strip us from the very freedoms our system was built upon. Of course, trust without doing the necessary work to make sure it's based in logic and reason is really just faith. Having faith that our politicians will do the right thing or that our media will hold the politicians to account or that our system will just function as it should is basically a recipe for disaster. Slowly but surely, our freedoms will be chipped away at because faith isn't what guarantees our freedoms in the first place. It's the constitution that does so. Trust is built over time by repeated evidence that you can actually believe that when someone says something, it's what they mean.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       You don't believe it's simply because they say it. You believe it because of a track record of a person consistently following through on their word. This is the opposite of faith, which is built on the idea of believing in something without evidence. We usually talk about these existential issues in the context of God and religion, but I think it would serve us all well to ask some important questions about these issues right here and right now. So now let me kick the question back to you. Who Do you trust in the media? I'm guessing it's a pretty short list though. If you've got some good names, I'd love to hear them in the comment section right down below and let's go a step further with that. Who Do you trust in politics? If you're the biggest trump supporter out there, do you truly trust everything that he says or do you accept his untruths because you believe in his wider agenda.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       Accepting the certain amount of untruth may be the only legitimate way to view politics and politicians, but when you add a distrust of the media to a of politicians and then toss in a heavy dose of social media craziness, we ended up with this confused conversation in which we can't even agree on basic facts. This spot where nothing is really true and what we feel overrides what's provable is fertile ground for those on the extremes to take root. So who do I trust? Well, there's a wide range of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro, to Larry Elder, to Eric Weinstein. Trusting these people doesn't mean that they're infallible or that I agree with everything that they say, but it does mean that I see they have a commitment to the truth and they've consistently done their best to put it out there. They don't have all the answers and I certainly don't either, but I think we're doing our best to find some truth in the sea of craziness. For those of us who genuinely want to figure out how to combat the forces who want to burn down the system or give into authoritarian tyranny. Our work is cut out for us. As for me, I trust that it'll work out because I see more and more of you speaking out every day. You might just say that a little faith in yourself goes a long way.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       Joining me this week is a former candidate for president of the United States from the Libertarian Party and a man who, according to his twitter bio is pro liberty pro life and Pro Constitution Austin Petersen. Welcome to the Rubin report. Hey, thanks for having me. We've been trying to do this for quite some time. Our twitter. It's going to go bonkers. My people love your pupil. I don't know if you're like me yet, but I guess the kind of remains to be seen. I think they were there. I don't know if you've noticed, but there seems to be a classical liberal, libertarian little bonding thing happening in America right now. People said that if I get you to say you're a smaller libertarian than that they're going to donate five bucks. My Super Pac. So it's. Oh, is that right? So are you a libertarian? We can where you can turn some of this on me at some point, but not right now yet.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Not yet. Not just yet. So, uh, so it's funny. I shooting three shows today and I just walked outside with my dog just to get some fresh air. I just found you wandering in the street, you didn't even take a car here. You're, you're truly a man of the people. Yeah. Well, you know, from Missouri, I grew up on a farm. Pretty common, you know, and uh, I think that um, you know, California is beautiful and uh, you know, we're trying to like be environmentalist riding bicycles. So I just want to walk and found your studio. Yeah. All right, so here we are. There's a lot I want to get to with you, but let's just start with the basics. People know, I like definitions. You ran as a libertarian, what is a libertarian to you will essentially libertarian. It allows you to choose your own values as long as you don't try and use the government to force those values on somebody else.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       That's why we get a lot of infighting in the Libertarian party because we have so many people from so many different backgrounds with different values. But the one value we all share is that we believe that government should be limited so that individuals can choose what they want to do and, and choose their values. And, and explore the wide range of options, you know, sometimes those options are dangerous, you know, some people choose to smoke, but they should have the right to do that as long as they don't try and impose a cost on others. Right. And, and so as soon as you start talking about what sort of cost people are imposing on others, that's when government starts to come into the equation, you know, at the most hardcore end of libertarianism, which some say a is the true libertarianism is it's anarchy. And our coo capitalism, I think I fall right before that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       I train right there and I, I call myself a min, darkest. Essentially the government should be relegated very basic rules. They should protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You know, that may include things like fire courts, police, military, otherwise the, everything else should be solved by the market. Yeah. So I had a Brian Caplan from George Mason University who's in an narco capital verlander co, capital Arco for some reason. Yeah. Brilliant guy and I thoroughly. We did about an hour and a half. I enjoyed every minute of it. There were moments where I thought, all right, this is a bit much know some private court stuff and some of the passivism stuff and open borders, but is that the inherent problem with the Libertarian Party? Not The philosophy, but the party that this thing is really wide and when you say I'm a libertarian, people see some of these guys or some of the, you know, at the convention, that guy running around without a shirt and some of them were crazy pieces.

Speaker 2:          00:07:20       That was the worst thing that happened to get to that in a second, but that it's bad because it's based on the individual. It's hard to get a whole bunch of individually focused people to agree on something because essentially you're talking about taking collective action, right? Yeah. This is kind of anathema to the libertarian cause, but I mean the Libertarian party is made up of sincere individuals. These people really want limited government. A lot of these people are victims of the state of people that have been harmed, whether they've been persecuted in their communities for doing things like homeschooling or maybe they want to drink raw milk, right? Maybe they want to have the ability to sell that, right? Amish farmers and things like that. So it's, it's kind of easy to poke fun at the people like the naked guy, but, but, but the thing is, is that the news often doesn't go in and cover the tales of the single mothers who are being harmed because their, their tax rates are so high that it's hard for them to feed their kids.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       Right? That doesn't make as compelling a new story as the guy who, you know, dances around. So, so there, the problem is, is that we're missing the forest for the trees in some sense. And there are a lot of sincere dedicated activists and Libertarian party who really just want to. They're not just fighting for their own freedom and many of them, many of them are sincere patriots who are fighting for the freedom of their fellow countrymen and they just see the two parties as being one in the same in some sense that they really. That their solutions are just more government. So that's what, that's, that's the kind of the untold story of the heroes of the Libertarian party, which we don't see very often. Right. Okay. So I want to spend most of our time talking about looking forward, but we do have to look back a little bit here. Right? I mean, to me 2016 was a massive disaster for you guys because

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I, I've said this a billion times. First off I voted for Gary. Okay. I've had Gary Johnson on the show. The candidacy ultimately was just terrible and I think if there was ever a year where the libertarians or any third, maybe the Greens, whoever, although obviously I agree more with you guys. Uh, but if there was ever a year where there was going to be a mark made, not, not the presidency, but a mark to be made. This was it. There was so much discussed with trump and Clinton. What happened?

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       I'll tell you this topic, I mean, this turns me into Salt Bay, like, but um, don't you usually walk around with a musket, couldn't make the, uh, the far the flintlock right? Yeah. The stuff, boy, you're going to get my hackles up. Alright. So it's very difficult to be in this situation. We're in the position of having tried to stop that right now having kind of seen it. There's nothing more frustrating and I think a lot of libertarian see this in so many other ways on society as a whole where we see things kind of rushing toward a cliff and you're screaming stop. And people, if you're going to tell people the truth, you better make them laugh or else they'll kill you. A and a that's happening in society. But with the Libertarian party, there were so many times when the account at the incompetence was being displayed pre-primary and people either weren't paying attention or they were applauding it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       Uh, I mean there's videos of some of the gaps and stumbles and one on before the convention. And I don't think there's any excuse. I mean the people who take responsibility for what it was need to take responsibility because they had every opportunity to try and stop it and they sort of cheered it on. But you know, the Libertarian party has a lot of the same problems that the major two party has with cults of personality and things like that and with none of the upsides of actually winning elections. So that's the problems of, of fighting a in a third party. But

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       is there a bigger issue here, which is that for the specific stumbles that Gary made once he got the nomination, and again I liked him as a person, I think he's a decent guy and I hope you'll come back here and I'd be happy to discuss all this stuff with him. Um, but he's, that the bigger issue, the only time anyone ever talked about the libertarians was when he either made a gaff or when the naked guy ran round beyond that, there was virtually no coverage. So it was almost as if you had to do outlandish things. So I watched the libertarian debates and I thought they needed to say more crazy things if anyone was going to pay attention as even though I don't believe that generally related to to

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       politics, it's not about what you say, it's about how you say it very frequently. Right. And so sometimes it was just Gary's delivery that came off as awkward. It wasn't necessarily what he was saying, but the way that he was saying it, which I think puts people off. Uh, and the thing about Donald trump that I think was so attractive was that he was giving the last year was a crazy bastard year. Right? And, and libertarians, that's crazy bastards. That could have been our year. Yeah. Uh, and you know, with the rise of the alt right, which is really what propelled in many ways helped propel donald to the presidency. A lot of those people, you know, were sincere conservatives who were looking for a, a third option, a, they wanted somebody who could take down Hillary. And I think that the real strategy problem was simply that it looked as if gary and bill were sort of cozying up to Hillary, which is what nobody in the United States wanted because they rejected her.

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       So it wasn't so much what Gary was saying, it was, it was relied a little bit more on tactics. I mean, yeah, the delivery was not that good, but. And the gas were horrible, but it, it really just comes down to not being able to read the political winds of the, of the time. And that's really where we suffered. Yeah. Without getting too thick in the weeds on just the machinations behind the scene of the party, because I don't think people really understand like what happens by the party. So we know the Democrats have this massive machine. We know it's deeply corrupt and that was a lot of that has been exposed. The Republicans also have a pretty powerful machine. I don't think it's quite as corrupt, but who knows what is, what is the underpinnings of the libertarian machine, like what's going on behind the scenes?

Speaker 2:          00:12:51       Who's in charge? What? Nobody. Anarchy, right. I mean, they have the Libertarian National Committee, their job is to run candidates for office. Um, the. I think the good thing about the Libertarian party is that anybody can participate, right? They sound like a Democrat, so they have super delegates and things like that. I mean anybody can become a delegate if you joined the Libertarian Party and go to your state convention. So the way that the Libertarian party works is it's powered by the people there, there isn't, you know, some shadowy Koch money, you know, the Koch brothers left years ago. So it's really just powered by the activist and the people who want to try and see these ideas be put into public policy. Now there are some people who actually, they, they caucus with the party, but they don't want the party to actually win elections for, for multitudes of reasons.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       One being perhaps that they think that there'll be a system wide collapsed and libertarians will get blamed for it if some, if there was a libertarian president and another one is that they think that the parties should be educational. So you've got all these different factions in the party, uh, and, and some of them are sincere and committed activists who really want to bring about change, but the, but when it comes to the machinations, it's what you see for the most part is what you get. I mean, there are some backroom dealings and things that go on and so a lot of pressure and hassling that goes onto the convention. People Endorse Bill Weld will give you the world. It's like that story in the Bible where like they take juices and Satan is like, if you will bow before me and I know bill well, but, um, but you know, there's, there's, that kind of stuff happens.

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       But for the most part it's what you see is what you get. Was there a moment a after Gary got the nomination that you would have considered being his vp or did they announce once he got the nomination, did they say they were a team immediately? Of course. So he was running to be the VP. And um, the thing was this, you know, my mistakes that I made at the convention was that I actually took the principal, moves over the pragmatic moves and I'll just explain this very briefly. So there was a brief period of time when some people said, Okay Austin, if you want just go run for the VP slot. But because I was trying to think for what the good of the party and for the good of the ticket, I thought to myself, okay, well Gary hates me and I wouldn't want to be hamstrung by a VP that I can't stand.

Speaker 2:          00:14:59       And he obviously wanted bill, you know, the delegates thought that he was better. So I was trying to, I, I gave into the will of the majority and I thought, no, I'm not going to do this because I think it's going to cripple the ticket. Well then later, I stupidly, I didn't realize that Gary had threatened that if he didn't get bill weld, he would quit. So if I had been the VP then I would have been a candidate if gary had quit. So maybe I should have just stuck it. Dual. I suspect he wouldn't have chose you though. No, but they choose. That's how the Libertarian party is different from the major two parties. The delegates choose the vice presidential candidate. So if I really wanted to be a bug chunk, I could've, I could've taken my gun out of the trash and mounted a campaign to try and be the VP pick with the hopes that Gary would quit.

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       But that's just being again, a jerk. I already have been labeled a jerk so I'm trying to get away from them. So my last question to you at the end of this is going to be about 20, 20, but, but as a lead into that then, so you learned that lesson there. So do you think you would do things differently next time before you even tell me if 20, 20 is an option? Yes, I would definitely do things differently. And uh, you know, there are certain things that you learned from the process, you know, hindsight is 20 slash 20. Uh, but, uh, I think that tactically I made some mistakes but print from a principal perspective, I did everything right, raised money, the grassroots way online, you know, just doing live streams and going around the country. I think we raised $120,000, so, so in, in a lot of ways, my campaign pioneered many of the campaigns in the future for people who have no power, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       People who are grassroots who can come out of nowhere and I think I showed that people who are sincere committed activists can, can do that. So there are some things that I would do differently, but most of it's just sort of parliamentary procedure things. How much for you as an outsider running on an outsider, a ticket, uh, was about raising money because that to me is the root of all the problems right now. Well, you know what, the funny thing was was that I found about raising money is that when things are good and you're happy and you're doing well, you know, people will send you money. But there's nothing that raises money like controversy. And one thing that happened to me, and it's so ironic because I was just their keynote speaker this year, now, the Colorado Libertarian Party disinvited me from their debate and I was in Illinois at the time and I'm there with my, my staff.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       And they said, okay, well you're not invited because I disagree with some of the radical anarchists on one of their base philosophical principles. So they're like, oh, you're not libertarian, you're not invited. What principle is, it's called the, the nap, the nap, the nonaggression principle. Uh, which many libertarians believe that is the centerpiece of libertarian philosophy, which I in no uncertain terms completely reject simply because in my mind, I believe it leads one to a form, a strict form of pacifism, which, which doesn't account for self defense, which they, they dispute, uh, but aggression being a sort of a, a term that can be broadly used in many ways. Like what do you different define as aggression? It leads one to consider. Maybe we will need a court system to Suss it out, which would imply a government which would end the argument for anarchy, right? They have gotten, they disagree and they're going to be very mad at me for saying that, but so you're taking in that specific and what you would argue is just a more realistic approach or a more functional approach.

Speaker 2:          00:18:11       Not really. It's not a matter of realism. Essentially. It's a matter of, of real true principle simply because many people have argued, and boy, this is going to make people mad, but, uh, in the end, the concept of we're putting this on youtube and youtube comments or anything but lovely liberal friends are gonna like it kind of a heretic in libertarian circles for this, but simply many libertarians have argued and many have told me directly to my face that the evil of government is, is so horrible that it's better that we have a society where it may be immoral to allow a child to starve to death, but it's not illegal simply because it's all about the initiation of force. Right? And I like to play the, the, um, the puzzle game. You know, if you walk past a homeless person on the street, they're starving to death and you don't feed them.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       Have you committed a crime? No. Have you initiated force? No. If you have a child and it's your child and by neglect you allow that child to starve to death. Have you committed a crime? Yes. Have you initiated force know so that that's really where it comes down to it. The rights of children is, is sort of where we start talking about whether or not some third party may have a right to come in, but that controversy was enough to make the libertarian part of Colorado say no, and it made my activist so angry that they started pouring money my coffers saying Austin drive to Colorado right now and we drove all night. Thirteen hours straight to the convention, took second place. You know, beat up on Gary a little bit and raise money so that. That's fascinating because this infighting of all the parties I find incredible.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Like just the inability for anyone to build a bridge these days, which is so much of what I'm. I'm not a political insider, but what I'm trying to do around here is build some bridges and show people you can disagree on abortion and we'll talk about that in a little bit and a bunch of different things and still find some basic principles to believe in. But let's just talk about the general role of government because that's really what this all comes down to. So you touched on it just a little bit up top. Give me the basic things that you believe government should exist for the specifics, not just, not just the ideas of liberty and that sort of thing. So the libertarianism isn't really about government, it's about self government. So that's the concept that, that, uh, you and if you have a, just, if you have a moral just society, then people should be self-governed.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       Uh, and uh, so it, it's different from the sort of FDR definition of freedom because FDR and the Social Democrats believe that freedom means freedom from want. So you're not free if you're hungry, that's their, their definition. So the question really comes down to is, is that we as Libertarians have a different concept of freedom from most people because our concept of freedom is the most politically incorrect because it requires personal responsibility and when you start telling talking to people about personal responsibility, that's when I get angry because as the, and even libertarians aren't perfect when it comes down to this, but when, when it comes to the actual role of government, it should be the absolute minimum that is required in order to sustain life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That's the declaration of independence. That's not the law, but the constitution being the law, it has very specific enumerated powers as sometimes conservatives I think make a mistake where they'll say, well, we believe in states rights, and the Libertarian says, no, actually that's a misnomer.

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       Only people have rights. You know, states have powers and the idea is that those powers should be strictly limited and enumerated. So we delegate some of our, some of our power to government, but we don't delegate and have our rights to government. Our rights are intrinsic or rights are natural. They are self evident as to our humanity, and so libertarians simply believe that the individual should be self govern and governed to is to the greatest extent possible until that self governance is a problem, right? If you do not police yourself, you will be policed. So in or so as long as I'm, you know, whatever action that you're taking isn't, it created some negative externality on the community in that question, you know, when it comes to the environment, right? What are the, you may be polluting or something like that. These were problems with libertarians face, we believe in a strict definition of property rights.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       So essentially what government should do is it should, you know, adjudicate disputes between property rights holders and it should prosecute criminal cases of force and fraud really is what it should do. And that's really the limited role of government. So you would take like sanitation away from the government, you would take the US Postal Service. All of those kinds of things were easy where we're keeping courts where we're keeping a cops and then nuclear weapons in my opinion. But yeah, but, but that's cops, courts nukes. Yeah, cops, courts have nukes. Well, I think we just came up with your slogan for a couple different way. If I ever write a police. Yeah. How is any of this different or do you consider yourself an objectivist? Actually, I mean, I flirt with them now. Can really get you in trouble because I know you mentioned Iran.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       People go nuts. I like a lot of it and I've had many people, uh, your own Brooke who is books right over there. I think that she, she rejects altruism. I get a joy out of doing something. I know she, the argument is that, well, if you get a joy out of doing it for other good people, then it's selfish, but it's not entirely selfish. I mean, I, I think that, um, you know, that there is a, there is a desire for us to sacrifice ourselves in order to do it for the greater good. Some people think that the government should require that sacrifice on. It's like mandatory service. But as a libertarian, I believe in voluntary service, a voluntary military. And if I were to, if I had served in the military, I would be doing it out of a sense of patriotism, which would be, in some sense, a sense of selflessness.

Speaker 2:          00:23:50       I think many people have been drafted, right? But a lot of people who fought in world war against the Nazis were doing it because they were fighting for their family and they were fighting out of a greater sense of oneself. I mean, sometimes libertarians, I think objectives are sort of immune to that, but, but not all libertarians are. Some Libertarians do what they do out of the, out of the sense of what's good for the community. Um, I, uh, maybe, maybe this is what I would say was selfish, but I actually do want to see humanity flourish and thrive. I just simply don't believe that government is the best way for us to do that. Yeah. So I don't see actually a major distinction there from, from what you would believe, as opposed to an objectivist because doing for yourself what is selfishly good. I always view that as, that's not necessarily gonna hurt your neighbor because if you're smart and you're doing what's good for you, you're not going to be dumping in your neighbor's lawn because you want your neighbor to be happy too.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       So like sometimes don't you just do good thing for people even though it doesn't benefit you. I mean, yeah, it may make you feel good, but every once in a while I catch myself just doing things for people like opening a door, handing a quarter to a homeless person, right? Somebody my phone to use or something like that. Just not big. And like sometimes I don't derive any pleasure from it. I just do it automatically. So then that, then we're on the philosophical piece of it. Is that somehow actually for you, which it almost to me it's almost irrelevant in a sort of real world. Right? That's probably my biggest issue with objectivist is just simply the, the again, that it's distasteful to me because I really disliked called some personality, right? And uh, and I just, I'm, I'm a contrarian and a skeptic and I just really like to pick things apart, find the flaws in it, you know, this is what gets you in trouble and it gets you branded a heretic, but you know, when you find flaws and you want to pull the thread, eventually sweater comes apart just because I like to see what things are made of.

Speaker 2:          00:25:33       Right. And I don't like to accept things just because this Marie Rothbart, senator Iran set it right. Or Ron Paul said it, you know, now it just angered the. Everybody else appreciate. I normally don't have a list of people to anger, but I feel like I should have had a little Glen Beck whiteboard here and I could just knock it all. We haven't, we haven't hit feminists, sjws patients. Patients will get there. Okay. So we've taken back a lot of this stuff with government. We've taken back all of those things. Do you think that's actually possible? Like is that the government too big at this point and our people to dumb down to understand why big government is in important. So for example, when I hear a lot of progressive saying, you know that it just the government should redistribute and all of these government programs and they get upset when we cut money to the arts.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       I don't think that's going to stop art and I think it actually might help art that, but we've just become so numb to how things work that if you were to try to reverse some of this stuff, you might do some really irreparable damage in ways that maybe we can't even see. Well, at the risk of sounding like a founding father, I'm going to call Tj and say, and we should've been doing this. The natural tendency is for government to grow in liberty to shrink. So do I think we can go back? I think we can. The only problem is, is that we have to adopt, not the, not the principles, but the tactics of some of our opponents were the Fabian Socialists who want to try and grow government bit by bit is we're going to have to try and fight a war game of inches.

Speaker 2:          00:27:00       Right? And we're going to have to take ground bit by bit, so I do think that we can go back. But the problem is, is that with, with my movement, the Liberty Movement is that we're not content with small games, right? We want to see big games. We want to start seeing major victories because we see our opponents getting major victories all the time and I think we've got to be a little bit more patient. We've got to fight, you know, on the short game before we can worry about the long game in some ways. Why doesn't the party do anything down ticket? Why is it that you only hear about libertarians come national election time and as far as I know there is. Are there any, there must be some randomly avowed libertarians in there. It's just that we, we sort of. There's not a lot of incentives because when you run as a like a senator or a president as a libertarian a, you're, you're going to get the same amount of hell that you're going to get if you run for lower office.

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       But at least there's the benefit of getting a little bit of notoriety, right? A little bit of fame, perhaps a little bit of opportunity to advance your ideas. I mean, when you're running for the, for the dog catcher as a libertarian, you're going to get the same amount of hell, but it's your neighbor next door that is going to give it to you. So I think that the incentives are probably, you know, messed up there. And also we just, um, I think there's just a lot of people don't know what it means to be a libertarian. A lot of people who will, you know, Bill Maher says he's a libertarian, right? And uh, what's the guy, the, uh, John Bolton Ambassador, John Bolton came on my show once and was like, I'm a libertarian, really invade Russia because actually he, I think of it more as a neocon a well to, to some neo constant, this is going to make more people angry.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       But here's some neo-cons they actually consider themselves anarchists in a sense, no borders, right? And that if we see somebody, uh, if we, if we see somebody like a genocide going on overseas and things like that, Wellesley, if we believe in a borderless world and these are all humans members of the human race, why should we not intervene overseas? I mean a lot of Democrats agree with that, right? That we should be stepping into Darfur in Sudan and Yemen and, and we should be, you know, having humanitarian interventions around the world. And so the neoconservatives in some ways think of themselves as libertarian humanitarians and in some way because by bringing democracy to the Middle East, they are spreading freedom around the world. And that's their thought. The only problem is, is that you buy in using government for this, you know, they, they're, they're ends, may be positive, but the means that they, that they use end up, you know, with the destruction of regimes and with humanitarian crisis.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       So what do, what would your position beyond that that I know that obviously you wouldn't be for nation building, but in the case of a, of a true genocide or a case of what's happening in Syria now? I think the general libertarian ideas thought of as isolationists, where do you fall in some sense the, the, some of the returns are isolationists actually many of the, that's more of a Paleo conservative thing that people who want to build a wall on the southern border, right? And they want to stop trade overseas. Those are, those people are much more isolationist. But, um, uh, there, there are ways to solve these problems and if you're going to use government to solve foreign policy problems, you should use the constitution. That's really what it is. And, and the problem is, is that we ignore the constitution. The constitution actually gives.

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       And Libertarians don't talk this up enough. The constitution does give the congress some authorization to act in a manner that would make liberals very angry, which is that it would allow the congress to lay a letter of mark and reprisal. The last time they did that was the war of 1812. So international laws and norms have changed. So, um, if it's a, if it's a terrorist activity, essentially it would be something similar to how you, uh, how we dealt with a Sama bin Ladin because we have such a deep and profound sense of patriotism. United States. We think only the government can kill terrorists, were not willing to get go all 1776 on that bus and higher a higher merck, which is really what we're talking about here. So in a case like that, like I've been lied in type case, you would actually be for that you hire, you're basically subcontracting contracting our army out and it's probably, you would argue, I assume be would be a cheaper and more effective way to Ron Paul after nine slash 11 actually introduced legislation to, uh, to go into kill bin Laden using letters of mark and reprisal because at least we're following constitutional due processes.

Speaker 2:          00:31:16       A lot of libertarians, uh, that, um, that don't agree with the authorization for the use of military force have to admit that that was quote unquote a congressional authorization. And, and the real problem that we were dealing with in terms of law of the laws of war or that if we declare war on isis in some sense, if we lose, we're legitimising them as a state actor and in some ways we don't want to do that. So in order for us to behave in a manner that, uh, that is in conduct with constitutional principles, reviving Article One, section eight, and the letters of mark is a way for us to follow constitutional processes. But the problem is, is that liberals aren't going to like this because if we're talking about privatizing the military and the Conservatives aren't going to like it because it's not the whole bad ass team.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       America, hail team six, kill them. But we have the, we've got thousands of former veterans who are out of work who would love to do the United States a favor. And if you gave them a contract, one of the beautiful things about it is only libertarians are going to like this, is that any bounty that they capture over there can be brought back and sold to the United States. So all of those guns that fell into the hands of Isis can come back and be sold, not in California where I'm from. You could have a beautiful new military grade weapon. So when I hear you talk about this now, but I can go there intellectually with you for sure. And I like the idea is that this, and especially if you route things in the constitution. Uh, I love that. When I hear you say this though, there's a piece of me going, this sounds like Rambo or you know, it just sounds like some eighties movies were still owner in where they got a bunch of mercenary.

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       I'm pretty sure this was a movie. Was this partly the rock? They get a bunch of disgruntled former military men. They come together and they find the guy. I think Predator was sort of about this too. There's an alien that you're going to hunt. Right? Right. But the idea of that, that just sounds crazy to people. I'm not saying to you it's crazy, but just so how do you even get there? Well, new ideas or they always sound crazy, right? Like legalizing marijuana 30, 40 years ago, you're crazy, you're stupid, you're a stoner, blah, blah, blah, and now we see that things start to change. Right? And you know, crazy people. Like the problem with this is, is that is that there's this really great quote where somebody used the other day on twitter, they said that I'm a smart people sound like crazy people to stupid people.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       So. So the problem may not be that just because I'm an opinion is in the minority. That's wrong, right? Most of the time whenever people are like, oh, you're crazy, nobody agrees with you. Well you know, maybe most people are kind of stupid, so maybe you're the crazy ones and the media is not helping that. At some point you've got to be willing to put your foot in the ground and take a stand and say, I don't care if nobody agrees with me. I'm going to take a stand on principle and listen to the founding fathers did not put this into the constitution for no reason. You know why they did this? It's because the war of 1776 was primarily one on the seas by private mariners. There was no continental navy. There was something like maybe six or seven ships. There were over a thousand, uh, who, people who turned their merchant mariner ships into dogs of war.

Speaker 2:          00:34:22       I mean, this is the days of fighting sale, but I mean it without those merchant mariners turned a private tiers, we would not have won our war of independence. They captured hundreds of British ships. So I mean, when, when the going gets tough, sometimes you have to turn to the private market to solve these things. But again, the reason why it's distasteful to the establishment is for two different reasons that conservatives love it. They're like, oh, this is a great idea, but we'll never get the liberals on board. And we'd much rather trust it to our, our Navy, Navy seal team guys. And the liberals are like, oh my God, you're privatizing war. I mean, you know, it's horrible. It's the free market and it's war. So it's very hard to win that battle. But I mean, whatever I do, I try and couch it in actual precedent law, the law, the constitution, that way I think you remained consistent and uh, you know, again, new ideas are always sound crazy until they finally become accepted.

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       Yeah. So speaking of precedent and the constitution, what do you think of the general state of the Constitution right now? I think it's a pretty beautiful, almost perfect document to be governed by, but it doesn't seem to be what we're really governed by anymore. It's being trampled in every direction right now. You can make cases that trump's trampling it in certain ways with executive actions. And by the way, Obama did plenty of them and George W dot Bush did plenty of them. So that's a non partisan attack. We also don't, you know, we do military actions where we don't get congressional authorization. What was Libya where they call it a Connecticut military action or they just make up terms and you go, oh, that's not a war. I'm pretty sure if Libya had been blowing us a bar, we'd call it a war. Um, so the general state of how we are, are, or are not governed by the constitution in many ways.

Speaker 2:          00:35:57       I think we're living in a post constitutional republic, you know, has some of the trappings of a constitutional republic. And you know, the, the good thing is, is that the bill of rights still exists. It's still enforced. I mean, Congress uses the fifth amendment all the time. They've got people in there, in the hearings that are always having to plead the fifth. That's a big one, right? And then they of course, the, the, uh, the supreme court relies on the second amendment when it upholds decisions in like Heller or, or McDonald versus Chicago. So, so you've got the second amendment. I don't think anybody would know, maybe some people would like to get rid of it, but I thought, yeah, there's, there's plenty of. But, but most people, I think cooler heads will prevail on that issue. You've got the first amendment, which is in retreat in a lot of ways.

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       College campuses, probably primarily the spots where they're in retreat. Um, and uh, you know, it's also a retreat in some ways in the mainstream media. This is why, you know, the Rubin report is probably so popular and successful, not just because you're so tremendously talented, but because, but because people are seeking out alternate means of information, um, you know, we don't live in, in North Korea, so I can't say that the constitution has been a total failure, but I do think that in some ways the constitution was far from perfect. I'm the founders tried to get rid of slavery, uh, at the signing of the declaration of independence. It didn't happen. It took another 100 years and a bloody civil war. So, so there were some institutional problems with the, the uh, constitution. And we've had a, we had to pass the 13th and the 14th amendment.

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       Yeah. And again, it took a war for that. Um, but, uh, I think that, you know, if you look at postwar amendments, you of course you've got things like, um, uh, you've got the 16th and the 17th amendments, which have been the most anti libertarian parts of the constitution. Now we have a law by bureaucracy, right? So, so in many times the things like the FDA or the EPA, they'll, they'll write law and enforce it and that was, that was definitely alien to the concept of constitutional law is written by the founders. So with, with, if you're going to have a bureaucracy then I think the bureaucracy should be limited to operating within constitutional law, but if they're to going to, you know, create laws and those laws should have to be passed by Congress and they, those laws or regulations in many ways. So that's really where the problem comes is with all the executive branch agencies that have been created that are, that I think are probably the biggest problem that we have for the record. I didn't mean that, that, that in and of itself it's perfect, but in terms of the way that we can be governed as we humans are the ones that write this evidence, it's pretty close. The best we've got because we've got a CNA and we are flawed things that create these things. So as perfect as maybe we can create, but of course just a, as a, as an independent thing. The thing though is that,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       uh, for some reason the founders didn't build a wall along the southern border so that, that can be improved upon because at the time they would have been no need for a casino down there. All right. So you mentioned the EPA. So the, the two ones that I hear all the tie or the fruit of drug administration, these are the two that you hear when people say Libertarians are nuts. Even Bill Maher, who I know he half now identify as libertarian, but he's for a lot of big government stuff at the same time. Uh, you know, I saw a couple weeks ago he said something about that trump got rid of this thing with the EPA and now they're going to start jumping in rivers again, is immediately what he said. And to me it's like we now live in 2017 where everyone has a phone and if the company a block away from his dumping in the river or the smokes coming out of their chimney or that everyone would report on everyone, that's another problem that society has altogether. Um, but that we would police ourselves in a way and as John Stossel who I love would always say, you know, the more regulations we keep putting in companies, just figuring out other ways to do it, we just keep putting money in lawyers pockets and we're not actually accomplishing anything. We're just shifting around bullshit basically all over the place. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       so I can jump in on. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. So, so two things. There's EPA and then there's the FDA. So very briefly with the EPA, the EPA was created by Nixon. It was created to essentially offer scientific information in court cases where our property rights were in dispute. So the original idea behind the EPA is a good one because, you know, Congress is a, is not made up entirely of scientists, right? It's mostly lawyers and lawyers aren't environmental scientists. And so you're going to need the testimony of environmental scientists are going to need someone to actually go out and do the research, find the samples and prove perhaps that some company is putting too much mercury or some sort of toxin into the, into the environment. You're going to need science for that specifically. Not Be political though, right? Not Be political. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       And not to be the enforcement arm. Right? Because right now there are a bunch of ventilated bureaucrats with assault rifles. Right. You've got the EPA, I think the US Department of Agriculture has sub machine guns right there. That. Right. So they're checking the cows, you know, there's a. When it comes to the FDA, I actually think the FDA is an easier case to make for the case of abolishment because even though people think, oh my gosh, well it's the things that we eat all the time. I'm like, yeah, actually. And if you haven't noticed, people are much more conscious about what they eat. And uh, you know, whenever I look at yelp reviews, perfect example, every time you go and eat somewhere, I go and eat somewhere. If I've never been there before, I checked the opera and if they're like, it's dirty, it's got cockroaches, you know, terrible service, I don't go there.

Speaker 2:          00:41:07       And, and that, that's a market mechanism, that's a regulation, right? It's a free market regulation that people use in order to determine whether or not they should eat somewhere. I mean, it doesn't take very long to figure out that, you know, some, some food sources bad, but the problem is, is that when anybody makes a mistake, which they do, even the government can't even stop some of Salmonella from getting out. It happens whenever somebody's child dies, you know, they say, well, one death is too many. Let's create an enormous, a government institution for the children and we'll save all the kitties. And if you don't do this, then you hate children and you want all the children to die. And that's why we have these institutions. Because as a politician, it's so much easier to say, well, I'm for the children. I'm for checking children's food and we don't want them putting poison and baby's milk.

Speaker 2:          00:41:54       Right? Because yeah, because people really have an incentive to poison right these milk, right? Because actually if you are a good producer of food and you create clean, healthy food, you make more money, you make more money, whole foods, they are making much more than the lower end retail chains. So I just walk in there and hand them all my cash because I'm like, I know I'm not walking out of here with any money. It in some sense it's elitist and because. Because what they'll do is the people who argue for it will say, Oh, well I'm not worried about me. Right? It's not me. I can. I'm wealthy enough to check my food. Like I have no problem with it. Like if I had a private agency that was, you know, checking the food and had a stamp on it, like I would be fine, but it's all the underclass, right?

Speaker 2:          00:42:32       Is the plebes that we need someone to take care of them. Right. And it becomes a very elitist thing that we need to have the government because we, we need to have the really, really smart people like about 100 or two to two to 300 of them sitting in, sitting in a room making these decisions for the Plebes, you know. And that's, and that's what it comes down to is very paternalistic. I never thought of it in, in the whole foods concept. But there is something really there because you know, if you go to whole foods, at least the one over here, they've got, you know, five levels of how they treat the animal. And one of the lowest is like free range, which is still pretty damn good. The highest. It's like they took them out to dinner before and they drug them and yeah, that sounded weird.

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       But that, that's all done by whole foods. It's by their policy. Right. But, but, but what, but if they don't do it at Walmart, you see the good and then the paternalistic cake like, but they don't do that at Walmart. Well you don't shop at Walmart. Well, well, but, but other people do. And I care about them. No, you don't. You don't care about them. You're not charitable because you go and you take a gun and you put it to somebody's head and you say you will make sure this fluid is clean. But is there any evidence of a place where that was scale? Like before the FDA existed, were there a lot of stores that were, you know, I don't think people are intentionally poisoning tomatoes, little grocer, but is there any evidence that, that it actually accomplished anything? Yeah. Uh, I mean, the thing is, is that it's all about the incentives.

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       Right? So, so the question is, do you think that people are incentivized to actually do good by their community? Because the way that capitalism works as the better you serve your community, the more they, the more money you make. Yeah. Right. But um, but yeah, there, there, and there are always examples of, you know, just like there have been financial panics before the Federal Reserve, but somehow instead of having great, you know, instead of having great depression, it's like we did post fed, we have these little short term blips, little panics that happened in a year. It cleans itself out and it's gone. But now what we do is government steps in and any prolonged crisis, right? And exacerbates crisis because then you have to have tax payer money spent on the cleanup, right. Whereas before, if there was like a food poisoning case, right, a local judge would have a judgment and they would, they would, you know, exact, you know, tribute and they would bring it back to, you know, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       The, uh, the victims were, you know, and there would be just compensation for that. But again, it comes down to the question of, of whether or not you think that some, you know, bureaucracy in Washington DC consensually plan all of the food and all of the drugs everybody takes in the United States. I think it's Hubris to assume that a, that people are smart, right? And Yeah, you can get the best people in the world, you know, and put them in a little room and hopefully you're going to get some good ideas. But uh, but more often than not, it's again, it's, it's Hubris because they think that they can possibly play all of our allies. They can't. The definition of socialism is, is central planning central control over our lives, right? Ninety percent income tax rate. You have no choice. The state plans, everything. And that's really the road to serfdom essentially, right?

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       It's a freedom is dangerous. Freedom is dangerous as hell, but I'll take her to stop poisoning our tomatoes. And by the way, you know, with all this inspector stuff, of course, first off you can pay off and an inspector very easily. There's so many little ways around it. It reminds me a little bit when like when I was a kid and I went to sleep away camp and the date and the camp would be like a disaster for three weeks and we were like swimming in sewage the day before visiting day when the parents are coming. They cleaned up the whole freaking place. Yeah. And it looks good. Parents come, they're happy, and then they leave. Next thing you know, next day we have license, right? But the difference between a private inspector and a state inspector is that if the at both both have a tendency to be corrupt, but you can't fire the state inspector.

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       It was going to take an election or it's going to take, you know, some connections in DC. Right? But if you've got a private inspector, then they are much, uh, they are much more tied to their communities and uh, and again, you can fire them, you can prosecute them and the government will, I will guarantee you he's going to step in and clamped down on that. But if it's the government and you're trying to sue the state, it's very difficult. You briefly mentioned taxes, let's do it. Taxes is taxation theft. It's more like extortion, right? But it doesn't make for as fun a slogan. It doesn't feel that I have a great hat that I, that I sell. It says make taxation theft again instead of make America great again. And that goes really well, but I didn't want to wear it in California because I thought they would think it was a trump hat and I might get beat up even if you just wear a red hat.

Speaker 2:          00:46:53       I know. Did you see this? I had a guy that hated abby a couple of weeks ago that he wore. He was wearing a nintendo switch hat, the nude Nintendo and it's a red hat. And he said people were telling him to go fuck himself. Come on. Yeah. Well and yeah, somebody got beat up and I'm in DC because it said a make bitcoin great again, or something like that. The left has gone a little bit nuts, I think, as you've started to detail on some of your videos, but um, when it comes to taxes, a tax or the price we pay to live in a civilized society. Just kidding. Just kidding. No, like that. You went to the camera, triggered all the libertarians are watching. Um, uh, taxes should be as low as possible, right? The idea is that you should keep the fruit of your labor. That's the philosophical argument, but the, but the, the technical argument is, is the government wastes so much money.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       They wasted money because they don't have an incentive. Right? I have an incentive to save money, but if we go out to dinner tonight, Dave, and you're like Austin and I'm taking the finest restaurant in Los Angeles, I'll be alright, great. I'm getting steak and lobster shrimp. I'm going to get all the fixings. Right? And so there's no incentive for government officials to save. So there's no, there's no incentive for them to be careful stewards of the public's money in our trust and they build these budgets that they have to exceed. Otherwise their budgets get slashed because people, they didn't use the mic. I'll take it in and out, but that's really all in and out a secret menu though. But yeah, when it comes to taxes, I, I'm not a fan of the income tax just because it assumes that the money isn't yours. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       It basically assumes that, no, this is our money and we're going to let you have some of it as soon as we've taken out our share. Right. Withholding. And uh, again, from a philosophical perspective, I think it's, I think it's just anathema to the concept of freedom. We didn't have it before 19, 13. Somehow the roads got built, the roads did get built, guys. We had systems tariffs, right? But at least with a tariff system, and I'm not a fan, I'm not a fan of tariffs either, but with a tariff system, I mean you're in a sense you're paying for what you use, right? It's kind of like Gary Johnson's, you know, national sales tax proposal. Right now you're just paying for what you use, what you consume. Which I think in some ways as a, from a moral perspective, I think it's better than an income tax, which just says, well, what you have is ours and we'll let you keep a little bit, little part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       I prefer a flat tax system. I know that's controversial because poor people pay a larger percentage of their goods and services, uh, of, of their, of their money into essential goods and services. So, so there is a problem with that because people say that's regressive and that, and that is true. And I acknowledged that. But again, if you really believe in true equality, which we hear a lot from progresses, if, if we all, if we want people to be equal in some sense, then shouldn't they be taxed at an equal rate? Well, the then they disagree and they say no. If you make more, you should have to pay more. And I think that that creates big word here, disequilibrium in the sense because because the people who are the most productive are, are being harnessed the most, right? And the people who are the least productive in some sense are paying less, right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:52       So if we're all, and that's not to say that it should, could, should, would, what's moral here, but in some sense you're, you're taking the people who are creating all of the wealth of society. And this is the Randy and concept of, you know, here is that you're taking all those people and you're disincentivizing the cream of society. And so I think that that's not the right way to go about it. You should. Everybody should be taxed at the same rate for, to be taxed at all. Um, and most of the taxes that we have, I, you know, I think are just excessive. But, uh, you know, again, it's not just the income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, you know, you've got fines and fees everywhere you go. Trust me, I'm a business owner now and I just did my taxes this week. I know about a whole new slew of taxes I didn't know about for the privilege of sitting in your home during this interview.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       You have the government 15 percent. Yeah, it's unbelievable. So, so alright. So you mentioned a flat tax and when people asked me about taxes and I think, you know, I've said for awhile as a, as a liberal, I haven't moved, I've, I've watched the left go off the deep end so it makes it seem like I'm more right even though I don't, I don't think I've moved, but I think I've shifted a little bit on taxes which is I would basically be for some sort of flat tax. I'm just gonna pick a number for a second and we can go backward and that let's say 15 percent flat tax and if you made less than 50 grand you don't pay any taxes because you need the help the most and if you make over 10 million or something like I would pick at something pretty high. You pay another two percent and then maybe over $100 million to pay another present.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       But something like that. Does something like that make some sense to you? Yeah, I mean for any reform, the tax system that we have, I can be reasonable. Right? Like I may not like taxes at all right there. I just shout it from a, from a just a simple like, you know, reaction, I just despise taxes, but um, I think that it's time for us to have some sort of reasonable tax reform. So. So yeah, I think that these kinds of, this is the kind of solution that I was looking for. The real problem is, isn't with taxes, it's worth spending because the spending is just future taxes and we've gotten ourselves to what, $20,000,000,000,000 in debt. I mean when I was a kid, every the Conservatives and, and what are the, the Democrats were attacking the conservatives in the Republican party because Ronald Reagan drove up our national debt to $144,000,000,000.

Speaker 2:          00:52:01       What is it now? It's 20 trillion, $144 million versus $20,000,000,000,000. So we've gone into the twilight zone in some sense in terms of our spending. And we take into trillion a year. We spent 4 trillion a year. That to me is a, is a recipe for disaster. So it seems fairly obvious to me, and I'm not an economist, but we're never going to pay this money back. That seems obvious to me. And that then unfortunately creates a situation where it's why we need a military. You know what I mean? That one day trying to, you know what I mean? Like, I, I don't, that's just, that just seems real world to me. One day it's possible. China is going to go, whoa, you guys are racked up quite a bill over here. Uh, what are we going to do about that? And then unfortunately we know we're not gonna pay it back because we don't have the money.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       And that's how you ended up in another war. So in a bizarre way, a debt brings war. I think. I mean, the United States is defaulted before and it didn't go to war. I mean we had, um, the, the Bretton Woods, a crisis of course, that we had where we finally closed the gold window or no longer could you trade dollars for gold internationally. And then we did it nationally. And in many ways, this is a default because in some sense you're destroying the savings of people who had money back to buy gold. And so these are, these are defaults in a sense and, and it, it didn't cause war, but in mean our, our creditors overseas who wanted to be able to exchange their dollars for gold, you know, they didn't attack us. So I don't know that it necessarily needs it. It would necessarily lead to war, but if we had a default in some sense.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       But uh, you know, here's the thing, I mean, it's only $20,000,000,000,000, right? It's not 100, $100,000,000,000,000 in the United States economy that we put out $2,000,000,000,000 a year or two to $2,000,000,000,000 a year. It wouldn't take that long for us to pay it off if we would cut spending. So. So it's not that it's not feasible to cut taxes because I think everybody wants to cut taxes and everybody, if you ask them, would say, can I pay a lower tax for the sandwich? You know? Yeah. Well, everyone says they'd like to cut them for themselves, but there's plenty of people that would say I'd like them to be higher for sure. Sure. But if we could get some sort of broad based tax form, let's say we do stocking to solve the problem because again, any spending is just a future tax increase, but if we could cut spending and then there are some proposals that have been put out and I put one out in my presidential campaign, we called it the penny plan where rather than try and kill elbow, you know, or, or some special interests, right?

Speaker 2:          00:54:28       You just make everybody take a haircut from the top. And it was called the penny plan because you'd cut one penny out of every federal dollar across the board. Right? And then you would put in a, a, you know, a cap, a spending cap, so like 15 percent of GDP, right? So that you wouldn't, you wouldn't spend yourself into oblivion in the future. Uh, but I think that if you just give everybody a little haircut across the top and then you continue to do that every year, those savings start to add up and I think that that's a reasonable way to do it rather than inflame some, the passions of the people who love pbs or the National Park Service and things like that. If everybody has to take the same haircut, just like if we're all taxed the same. Right? I mean that's really a quality in a sense.

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       Uh, but it's, again, it's not necessarily politically feasible, but new ideas got to get them out. Yeah. So That's interesting. And that's actually consistent with what you said earlier about sort of incremental things or how you would change things without burning down the system. So in this case, you're not taken big bird out to the shed and shooting him, but I would get a lot more facebook fans by said that would be a lot more popular because you know it right now, as you know, we could get in the media, but I'll just tell you, it's so polarized right now that, you know, if you're not with us, you're against us. If you're not a feminist, you're a bigot. If you're not a conservative, then you're a stupid lip toward and, and it's, it's difficult to be. I mean, I don't, I'm not a moderate, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       I'm a radical competitive admissions but amongst, but in the political world of today, I mean, you know, I think I bore people because I come up with such simple solutions and say, okay, this is a path towards, uh, towards what we really want. And Progressives can get on board some of these things, right? Gay Marriage, you know, liberal Liberals, Democrats can get onboard those people who even like Hillary or Bernie can get on this. And people who, like Gary or whatever, they're. There are all sorts of solutions that I think has a broad base of support amongst the American people. The people who control our politics right now, uh, on, on left, right are so toxic that he poisoned the well, and that's why obamacare wasn't overturned. Not because the house freedom radicals were in there, but because the people who were in the establishment, we're, we're slapping it together and they, I mean, in some sense they were the radicals because they were doubling down on obamacare in many ways and then they start to demonize the opposition within their own party and the Democrats are just loving it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       But, but, but the Democrats have their own problems too. Right? All right. So let's throw away some easy ones. So, medical marijuana and legalizing marijuana altogether. No problem. Sure. About the problem with legalizing it is that you got to pay taxes. So, I mean, I guess, you know, decriminalizing is where the anarchist, but uh, but yeah, I'll take legalization over. Nothing. Alright, we'll throw that one away. Gay Marriage, not a problem, right? Two people want to do what they want. No problem. Can I, can I talk about that for a second? Let me just say that I just trying to give you some easy ones to just love it. But I am so happy whenever anybody finds love, you know, and, and it's just not set enough by people. It's like, what the hell business is it if somebody else else's happy that the government should get involved in a contract between two consenting adults?

Speaker 2:          00:57:24       Yeah. I just, like, I, I never understood like I've seen on some level where some people, you know, they find discussed with it. I never, I just never felt that way. Right. And um, I have just way too many gay friends and family members that, uh, that I've grown up around that I love like crazy and I want them to be happy. And so yeah, when it comes to gay marriage, it's not a gay marriage question. It. So does the state have have a prevailing interest and telling people that they can't sign a contract and that's how I feel about it. Yeah. And that's why I've used that one as it's such a consistent example of where liberals and Libertarians can get together, so you may be a liberal who just feels that this is the right thing to do and the liberal thing to do and you may be a libertarian even though you said Nice things about, about gay people and whatever, but you may just be a libertarian.

Speaker 2:          00:58:07       He says, I just don't want the government like this now. Conservatives and Alabama or pushing a bill to get the state out of marriage, now they're doing it because they are absolutely tired of the government stepping in and saying, well, we're forcing you to recognize gay marriages. Right? And so we may actually get a consensus on this because the conservatives are so tired of losing these culture wars and. Well, the Democrats love winning. But, uh, but I think that if we, if we could get a consensus for it, unfortunately now because of the, the overfelt case, which I still support, but because of the overfill case, it's now a federal issue, right? It's like abortion. We just can't go back to a state based solution on this, but if we can get people to accept an idea first that then we can start talking about putting it action.

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       Yeah. And I suspect as with abortion it's going to just stay the way it is and I don't think, but that remains to be seen. Uh. Alright. So I gave you two basically is the only thing that we'll do to tougher ones that we've sort of touched on here. A second amendment. So obviously I know you are a strong supporter of the second amendment. Are there any regulations that we should have on gun? Well, maybe nukes, right? So maybe you shouldn't be able to have a nuclear weapon, right? No, no, we don't want to. Kim Jong Moon. Okay. That might be the, the tipping point. Everything. But nukes for the most part. The problem is that most people think that if you, if you make it legal to own tanks, then like everybody's gonna own tanks. Well it's not true because it's so expensive to own a tank.

Speaker 2:          00:59:26       I it, you can't even drive it down the 10 feet without the gasoline, the insane gasoline bill that it would take. And I was probably probably be illegal to drive that on the road too, so. Right, so you don't have to worry that people are going to suddenly come out with tanks and this is going to make some people uncomfortable, but you really need to understand that the revolution was fought by in many ways by militia men. They, they fought with military grade weapons of their time. And so I worry about disarming the citizenry one day. I mean, liberals are now arming up by ultimate irony now the liberals all are talking about limits on executive power because trump is in power and create, you know, all of their screams of misogynists and racists. And so now they're like, well, maybe we need to do about it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       Something about it. One day they're talking about states rights because the sanctuary cities, I mean, everything's upside down now. Right, right. And, uh, and so there is some irony there in that, but hey, if they agree with me, great. I saw some liberals were out like, uh, doing a, a gun march the other day, but then when we look closer they were carrying airsoft. You guys might want to get some actual, some actual guns, but yet strong from support of the Second Amendment says arms for a reason. Right. So it's a bit of, you know, up to use the ideas is that, you know, the arms, the definition of that would change. Uh, so I do think that citizens should be able to have that fully automatic rifles. Like I want to live in a world where gay married couples can defend their marijuana fields, fully automatic machine guns.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       That's a beautiful world. Think about it. You're giving me a lot. They're happily married lesbians who grow marijuana and one day somebody comes in and wants to steal their stash. I mean, they can do, they should be able to grab their ones and you know, kick some ass. Yeah, that sounds like that should be on Netflix, that show, you know, I'm all right, but somebody's gonna hear that and go, all right, I've been with this guy is making some sense, but I don't want my neighbor walking around with a bazooka. The tank is obviously okay. You can't afford a tank, but maybe a save 20 grand. I don't know what you'd call it. Right. But you know what I mean? So how do you stop the crazy person from just saving all their money and buying a weapon that they could blow up at school or.

Speaker 2:          01:01:26       Well, you could tell you could get on the Internet and, and uh, you could build a bazooka for a lot less than it costs to buy one because that's probably not the answer they wanted to do. Probably not. But that's the problem is, is that people who want to do evil things are going to do it, right. It's, it's a, it's very easy to make a gun, you know, you can take a pipe, put a, put a shotgun shell in it, hit it with a hammer, that's a gun. And, uh, so, you know, I, I don't want to say that, oh well we don't ban it ban something simply because, oh, it's, you know, it's possible to do it right. We banned murderer for, for good reasons. Uh, but a gun is a tool, right? It's just a tool and it's just, it's only as evil as the person who wields it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:04       Like A, an object in itself doesn't carry any morality. Like, like, uh, sometimes libertarians would get upset with me because I talk about drones for example. And I say, well, a drone is again, just a tool. It's just, it's just like any other tool and it, what matters is that constitutional due process is applied when the government uses a tool like this, right? We like drones much better than we like carpet bombs, right? Because it's been more pinpointed. Right? But the ultimate question is, is who wields the gun? Who Will, who has power to do it? The finding is about liberals that kind of kills me are the ones who are the anti gun liberals, is that they, they say things like, you know, oh my God, these cops are so evil and racist and, and they hate, they hate blacks but an only they should own guns.

Speaker 2:          01:02:49       Right? Well there, I mean that goes to the heart of the argument, which is always how corrupt and evil the system is. What's the answer? Make the system bigger. I think this system bigger, right? Hire more cops. Right. And I, I, you know, I don't usually get off on seeing people get harmed, but when you. It was some irony in occupy Wall Street and some of these definitions of people calling for more government and then they get government right in the face or the pepper spray, right? You wanted more government and there it is, right? That that is the ultimate result of the, of the call for more state intervention. So. So there is some irony there when you see, when you see a leftist get bashed over the head by, by the police truncheon that that's essentially what they're calling for when they say we need more regulations, we need higher taxes.

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       That's the state because as Mao Zedong said, you know, all political power flows from the barrel of a gun. And so you have to be careful about the use of power because it's, it's fire, it's forced, it's not reason. Yeah. Abortion, let's go. Oh boy. So I had a flip on this. Not before way before I ever thought about running for office. And um, because, uh, you know, I'm a, I'm a secularist, right? I, I, uh, believe in empirical study and data and science and things like that. So I didn't have some sort of, um, some divine intervention that said, Austin, you know, you need to believe this. Right? So, but when I started to listen to some of the secular prolifers arguments on this, I was convinced people like Christopher Hitchens, and even bill Maher as has said at some point to express some sympathy towards the, the unborn child.

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       Uh, and so the question in my mind is, is, is it a life? Is it a human life? I think the answer to that question is yes. And then it gets down to the question of, well, when does life begin? Well, can I be intellectually honest and say, I don't know because I'm not a scientist and that I don't know everything, but if I'm to make a mistake, uh, I would probably think it would be. The moral question is, should you err on the side of life? So I think that yes, we should err on the side of life. Um, and uh, this is, this is not a scientific or empirical question, but my, um, my little sister is adopted and she was slated to be boarded by her mother and we convinced her not, not to abort and then we adopted her. And so I think to myself, wow, you know, like I'm so glad that she's alive.

Speaker 2:          01:05:06       And I say then I think about all the people who want children for adoptions. Because while we were going through the adoption process, that was 11 years old, but I was learning about the adoption process and studying it and I realized how many parents just really want children. So I think that it, abortion for convenience is a problem morally. I think it's a problem because I think that if you really, if you really want to live in a moral society, we should encourage people to adopt. It's not to say, Oh, you know, you conservative or liberal prolife libertarians only care about a baby once it's born. Right? But that's not true because my family adopted, right? I know many parents who are dying to adopt children. Um, you know, I'd like to have kids one day and if I can't have kids I'm going to adopt.

Speaker 2:          01:05:51       So I think that, you know, again, with knowing that this isn't a perfect world and that, you know, we're never going to be able to just completely ban it. Like, Venezuela tries to do that. If that, I think that we can probably agree that abortion isn't a good thing. Some people think it's a good thing, but it's fetishized in a bizarre way, but, but I think most people don't think it's a good thing. Otherwise, why is the stigma or the shame attached to it? But I think that if that's true, I think science is going to come up with new ways for us to, to save the kids of the life of children. Um, you know, earlier and earlier perhaps that are going to be some options there. I know a lot of Catholic charities that would spend millions of dollars to see technology like that come to the light of day.

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       So I think that that looking to the future that abortion is probably going to become less of a problem, especially because birth control is becoming so much more available. And when it comes to the law, the first things that I would like to do when it comes to policy, try and find the most non coercive way to reduce the amount of abortions. The number one simplest way that makes some people very upset still is to just legalize birth control over the counter. And that's, that comes part and parcel with ending the war on drugs. Um, and so there some institutional challenges there, but I think that abortion is wrong. I think that it is a human life. I think that as a, as a society that we should protect the. If government is to exist, then its role should be to protect those who cannot protect themselves and I think that that should include the unborn. Uh, but of course we have federal challenges to that and we have court challenges with that. We have stated challenges with that. But I, I try and make the moral argument because unless we can win the moral argument will never win the legislative argument. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       Well I liked the way you framed the argument there because it's also nice to occasionally hear someone say, I don't know everything and you're not a scientist. And that there's an actual moral quandary here. What did you make of a couple of weeks ago when Tomi Lahren came out and said, you know, that she, using her conservative principles is actually approach. I don't know that she said she herself was pro choice, but she said that she didn't want the government basically legislating what a woman could do with her body. I do see that as an intellectually consistent a position. It may not be the conservative position. It may not be the position that that Glenn Beck who I like and who's been chair believes and he did what he did. God shows no longer on the blaze. That's a whole separate issue,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       but do you think that there is legitimacy to the argument? No. No. The. The, the first thing that popped into my head was, oh, she's had an abortion because three weeks before that she said, I know there's a video from being a complete hypocrite here. So something happened. That was my first thought. Then I was like, well, you can't prove that, and then I thought to myself, okay, so what is this really all about? Well, if the argument is, is that the government has no prevailing interest in getting involved in, in a woman's body, well then can the government save the child if something's wrong with the mother, if she's in a coma, can the, can the government take the child out? Let's say the, let's say that the, the situation happens where the mother is life is actually in danger and the mother, but the mother can't give consent.

Speaker 2:          01:08:54       I mean, can the nurse then save the life of the Child? But what if the mother at the time doesn't want the child to be born? What if she woke up and decided, oh no, I wouldn't actually want to have an abortion. Right? What would the nurse probably not try and save the life of the child by default because she thinks of it as a baby. When beyonce posted pictures of her being pregnant, they, the liberals were saying that, oh, those are babies. Those are children. Those are humans, right? But that, but they're not babies. They're not humans. Uh, but when it comes to the timing there and thing, I think she probably just says whatever she can say to get traffic and clicks and God knows I've been so tempted to fall into her, her example because you could make a lot more money that way.

Speaker 2:          01:09:32       But, um, I think that when it comes to the question of whether it's consistent or not for, for a government to intervene, I mean even Gary Johnson who parades himself around as a pro choicer signed a partial birth abortion ban. So a most abortions do occur within the first trimester. But, but the real thing, again, when I said we're full circle here, the most politically incorrect thing that you can say is that you should be personally responsible is that we have things called condoms and birth control. And you are supposed to take care. Because the problem with the liberal argument of freedom is, is that I am free to not only, you know, destroy other people's lives and harm and create harm and have the government solve. But I'm also free to self destruct and to make you pay for it. And a prime example of that is, is the, uh, like for example, when the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare, I was there the day that happened, the liberals were unironically smoking cigarettes after it was over, not because they were necessarily addicted to nicotine.

Speaker 2:          01:10:29       It was a side to the rest of us that I can do whatever I want and now you have to pay for it. And uh, you know, there are people who think that taxpayer funded abortions should exist and that we, we should pay for those decisions. But when it comes down to it, if it is killing a child, but it's killing a human child, well, shouldn't you be personally responsible? Shouldn't you have been careful beforehand? And then you know, you've got the questions of rape and all these other things that come into it, which is always like a t, you know, we'd like to take tiny, tiny exceptions to rules and then blow them out and conflict to the rules. But again, I don't know everything and the government cannot possibly legislate from Washington DC, all of these problems. Which is why I think it should be a state issue because I think from an administrative question, uh, the state should be allowed to laboratories of democracy in some way, right when it comes to the war on drugs, when it comes to abortion, right?

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       Like if you're in Texas, if the war on drugs was ended federally, Texas might execute you for looking at a joint. I'm here in California. It may be like they may have, you know, you can execute you for not smoking or not smoking. Right. So, so that's the thing is that there are some problems with federalism, but I think when it comes to issues, especially with life and death, that those things are better handled the close to the, the smaller, the tighter knit, the community so that it's, it's so that the, the negative externalities aren't projected on the rest of this because I certainly don't think I should be funding abortions. Right. I think that, that, that if I think it's a crime, then I certainly should not be taxed to do that. It's just such a place where there's so much richness for conversation where we can find people that are perfectly moral and just view things a little bit differently because I do get the Tommy argument there of keeping the government out of it and I, I personally am pro choice but um, but I find great pleasure in it at all and I have all sorts of issues with, you know, later term abortions and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:12:15       Um, but this, this is one of those ones that it's just. Yeah, but we make a mistake if we looked at Tommy for intellectual stimulation, that is an a and I hope she'll be here so that I can ask her about that. Um, all right, last question. And I already told you what it was. So a 20, 20. We're doing this. No. Um, I, I don't like running for office. Um, I, I really despise it. And um, as libertarian I really liked my personal life. Now I have looked at, people have said Austin go run for lower office. And so I have looked at potentially running in Missouri for Senate seat. I've still got about a two or three months before I have to decide some of something like that, but maybe, you know, I ran for president because of the timing and because I thought that there just weren't that many good people who represented my beliefs.

Speaker 2:          01:13:04       And so I did. I didn't run last year just because I wanted to be the king of the United States. I ran because I thought that that Donald and Hillary were so distasteful and Gary was not the strongest candidate that maybe I would look good by default and you know, could get our ideas out there. And so, and so, um, I think I, in some ways, you know, I didn't win the presidency, but in many ways I won the argument in a lot of ways. Look at retrospectively because a lot more people are now interested in libertarian ideas, which is one of my goals. Um, but when it comes to running for president in 20, 20, I'm going to respectfully decline at this time and say that maybe it would be better for me to try and do something at this point. That would not be an altruist perhaps, but, but try and do something, give something back to the citizens of my state who have got a horrible senator, Claire mccaskill, Democrat, who's now for complete partisan politics.

Speaker 2:          01:13:53       She should kind of shooting yourself in the foot saying she's going to Filibuster Neil gorsuch and uh, and she's doing this because she's terrified of the progressives in our own party. Uh, the Bernie Bros and all that, or they're threatened threatening to primary or so now she's being pushed so hard to the left. She's going, you know, doing what Hillary did, the mistakes and Hillary made going hard left as you can, hoping that those socialists and Social Democrats are going to push her into it. But if I think that there is an opening there to maybe run for Senate in Missouri Than, than I might pursue that. But, but God, I don't know. I see what's happening to trump on a daily basis. And I, you know, I don't really have that much of a lust for power. So yeah, at this point, and we see the inherent problem with all of this.

Speaker 2:          01:14:33       Good principled people simply don't want to be part of this game anymore. So you're left with it. Well, you know, it destroys you, right? So it's, you know, every little personal thing that you've ever said, right? Every job, every off color joke that you've ever made, say suddenly used to demonize you. I mean, I thought it was a good person until last night. I didn't realize that as a sexist, misogynist, and all of these things. And uh, but then when you look at it, it's like the truth is who is fit to rule? Nobody's really fit to rule over all of us and the, and the power. It has so much power. I mean, I just, um, at this point I'm going to save me. I don't really have an interest in. All right, well, you put it on the record. So now if you do end up running for whatever reason, you're going to be considered a flip flop.

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       But they always do that to everybody. Like Donald Trump said, no, I'm not going to run for president. And he runs for president, right? It always does. But you know, on the, on the minuscule chance that you know, that I feel like I can see I'm called to public service, which is what it should be. Then maybe there's an opportunity, but at this point, you know, I've got a lot of other things that I really need to focus on my own personal life, you know, like maybe have kids someday, you know. Alright. Well as I told you before we started, people email me every day asking if I'm going to do it. I don't want to run for president, but if I do, would you at least help me before the debates because you know your shit. Yeah. What is Aleppo Limbo is. That's like half of it. Would you make them bake the cake? No, I would not make them bake the cakes. He thought that we haven't gotten to this. We said okay, let's go real quick. Alright. We'll let you know. We're gonna do this for our bonus segment after we'll do the cake thing because people know my feelings about the case. Alright, I will.
