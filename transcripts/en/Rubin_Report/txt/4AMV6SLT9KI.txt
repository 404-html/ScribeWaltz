Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Suddenly it seems the entire country is talking about the. All right, so I guess it's our turn as well. For those of you who are tuned to the Wacky wild underside of the Internet, you know that the alt right has existed for a couple of years now, but it's only in the last few days that the mainstream has started talking about it. Last week, Hillary Clinton attack me all right, and a big speech which lead to coverage in every newspaper and online outlet across the globe. Hillary blamed Breitbart.com for mainstreaming racism, which she said was proven by trump's embrace of the alt right. CNN and Fox News both aired clips from the Rubin report in which Milo Yiannopoulos talked about the alt right, explaining it as a counter culture movement, uniting disaffected conservatives with mischievous Internet meme makers, the usual pundant. Suddenly we're all experts on the alright even though they didn't know what it was while it was growing right before their eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       This whole time, our outrage culture always need some new outrage to be outraged about, and once Hillary mentioned the alt right by name, it meant the movement had officially arrived. The Albright seems to take many different forms depending on who you talk to, mainstream media and pretty much the entire left brand, the alt right as a white supremacists movement, rallying around Donald Trump. Their members hate blacks. They hate Jews, they hate Hispanics, and they want some sort of racially pure country to stop white genocide. Mainstream Republicans see the alt right as a group of loud mouth defensive racist who are tearing the conservative movement apart by throwing away traditional conservative ideals like small government and replacing them with a win at all costs. Candidate other say the outright is a grassroots movement born out of natural pushback to are increasingly political correct society. I think if you mix some of those explanations together, you get what the all or I really is, but you have to add one more thing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       The Internet, the alt right, whatever version of it you claimed to be was created right here on the Internet and as something created by the Internet, it is as amorphous as the Internet itself. What the alt right really is though is a band of a meme, posters, Anamae avatars and twitter eggs vying for attention from people in power. They posted Nazi means racist pictures and offensive tweets with the express intent of getting powerful people to react, respond, and thus amplify their message. They are keyboard warriors and professional trolls, trying to get attention from the sold out and corrupt media and political elite that we have. The real alright isn't about one political ideology as much as it is a loosely linked group of people using tools of the Internet to upset the establishment. Ironically, in some ways this wrangling and mocking of the establishment is exactly what the Bernie Revolution was supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       But while Hillary put Bernie's revolution on ice, she is now elevated the alright to mainstream status by giving a big speech about it. The alright wants attention more than anything and they trolled her into giving them exactly what they want. Let me back up here for a sec because I don't want to gloss over that whole white supremacist. Hate the blacks hate the Jews. Kick out the Hispanics thing. This portion of the alt right absolutely does exist. I see it on twitter every single day. You can pause this video right now and find thousands of images including Nazi imagery, racist characatures of minorities, and plenty more. Do a quick search on twitter, a scan on reddit or a look at four Chan and you'll see some pretty nasty stuff. I don't like it, but you guys know my policy on free speech and free expression, so I choose to ignore these images and ideas rather than amplify them.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       The real question though is do these truly hateful racist means in tweets represent a real movement of hate or they designed just to get attention? I think it's some combination of both, some true racist mixed with a bunch of people who just want to mess with those. Empower. How many of each of them are there? We have no idea. What we do know though is that these people will very little real world power. Dwight's premises exist. Yeah. The Black Jew and Hispanic haters exist. Yeah, they do too. Some people want to keep immigrants out because of racism. Yes, but the people who make up the right aren't the ones with the power. Instead, they are the ones trying to upset the people in power, and as for Donald Trump, he has blacks and Jews and Hispanics on his campaign staff. This doesn't mean there aren't racists supporters of trump.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       Of course there are just as they're a racist supporters of Hillary and everyone else to ever run for president ever trumps blunt language which has attacked almost every group out there often blurring the line between being politically incorrect and truly hateful is just an extension of the tactics that the alt right keyboard warriors are doing on their own. Personally, I think that the regressive left is more of a threat to our democracy than the all right. The regressive left with its tactics of stifling debate and silencing critics has gained mainstream traction in our media and in our universities. These regressive, not progressive ideas have become all too common on the left and they've actually given birth to the natural response, the alt right. I know this firsthand not only from the emails that you guys send me, but also from all the students at Ucla who came up to me after my event with Milo Yiannopoulos a couple months ago to tell me that they're supporting trump just because they can't take the culture of fear around speech anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:06:00       The alt right with its trump frogs and photoshop. Pictures of sick Hillary is little more than a bunch of guys in their basements using outreach culture against itself. Most of us are not part of the regressive left or the alright. This is precisely why we must talk about ideas honestly and not let the extremes on either side control the debate. As I've said many times before, trump's wall might not be sensible or sound policy, but a wall in and of itself is not racist. If we refused to have a conversation about immigration without yelling racist at everyone who disagrees with us, then we'll leave the conversation to anyone who comes up with an easy answer. Trump's wall is the easy answer to a complex immigration problem and it's one of the reasons that the alt right loves him. The alt right is the organic result of a politically correct society that refuses to engage in ideas in an honest way.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       That doesn't mean the alt right is right. It just means that they're here and to demonize them without understanding them doesn't stop them. It actually strengthens them. My guest this week is Scott. Adam Scott is the creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip, Dilbert, as well as a proponent of Donald Trump's tactics. I don't know if he considers himself part of the alt right, but I would consider him part of it as someone who's using Internet culture to spread his ideas during this insane election cycle. We're going to dive into his feelings about Donald trump and much more. We'll be all right. Twitter Nazis make memes of us in Nazi costumes. After the interview, you'll only know if we retweet them ourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       My guest this week is an author and creator of the legendary dilbert comic strip, Scott Adams. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. I'm very excited to talk to you, but before we get into anything, you've also received the Rubin Award, which is for outstanding cartoonists. They spell it the other way though. Coincidentally. Yes. Although it's not as prestigious as you might think because they changed the rules some years ago that you couldn't win it more than once a and there aren't that many cartoonists in the world, so if you stay alive long enough, you got a good shot at a Rubin Award, then you're pretty much good to win one, but you want it back. That's silver 15 years ago or something. Right. You want it. Which is amazing because I'm so young. So there you go. All right, well, I'm very excited to talk to you and we're gonna. We're gonna. Definitely do the politics stuff and the trump stuff and all that, but first for the people that probably know dilbert but don't know much about you personally, uh, you have a sort of interesting backstory. What kind of led you to becoming a cartoon and it's everything you used to be a regular working man, is that fair to say? Yeah, it was. I worked in two big companies now working in a big bank in a cubicle and then I went to the phone and worked in another

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       cubicle and I, um, I actually, my, both of my career has ended the same way. I keep forgetting I can say anything I want on here. You can say absolutely anything for years. There are things that I've sort of censor it or played down in my backstory, but let's break you out of self censorship right now. I'll put it right down there. Yeah. Um, my banking career ended when my boss called me in her office and told me in direct language as directly as I'm going to tell you that she couldn't promote me anytime in the future because I'm a white male. Wow. And she said it wasn't discrimination per se in the normal sense, it was that the, I guess the local newspaper had discovered that there was no diversity in senior management and in order to reverse that, since the pipeline wasn't as good as it should've been in either, they pretty much just had to stop promoting people who look like me.

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       Wow. So I said, well, how long is that going to last? And she said something like, well, it took 200 years to get here. So it might take awhile to reverse this. I made up that part, but that was implied. Um, so I put my resume together and I left, went to Pacific Bell, started working there. I got, got on the fast track. I was identified as an up and comer who was ready for management. And one day my boss called me into his office and he sat down and I had to tell you this, but the word has come down. I can't promote white males. Wow. And it's, it was the same reason it was the newspaper had discovered that they too had a problem with diversity as senior management. So that was the point that as I like to say, when you hear the story, you say to yourself, wow, that must have been a really bad day for you, but turns out that the moment you realized that your efforts and your outcomes are not related, it really frees up your schedule.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       So suddenly I taed for hobbies. I wasn't coming in so early, I wasn't working so late. I started looking for other things to do. Yeah, the things that I could control my own fate a little bit. So one of the things I tried to do, and it's one of the many things I've tried to do both before and after Gilbert, was to get a comic strip published, didn't know how to do that. Um, and you know, how do you do that? Like what's the, what's the process for getting a comic strip started? This was pre internet. You couldn't find out anything free Internet. Hard to believe that time existed. It was the time. But this is a true story. It's a, this is sort of the amazing luck part that everybody has in their story. At some point, you know, any successful person, if you look at their story, it's like I worked hard, I worked harder, I worked hard.

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       This really fricking lucky thing. And then something good happened. Yeah. So in my context where lots of things that didn't work out for me, but I got real lucky this time and I was, I came home, I was thinking to myself, how do I become a cartoonist? And I was flipping through the channels on TV and it was a TV show on how to become a cartoonist. Well, but I'd missed like 28 minutes of the half hour, right? And I just figured out what that's what that must have been about. And I wrote down the name of the host from the closing credits and I wrote him a regular snail mail letter and I said, how do you become a cartoonist? And he answered two page letter, said, buy this book, use these materials. And he said, whatever happens, don't get discouraged because the real tough industry and you know, you'll get rejected a lot, you know, don't give up.

Speaker 3:          00:12:24       So I, I said, oh, this was great. I bought the book, I got the materials and put together some comics that were just single panel comics, send them off to the major magazines they ever rejected. You know, I just thought, well, I tried, right. It's the best you can do is try. So I put all my materials in the closet and I forgot about it. A year goes by and one day I walk out into the post office or to the mailbox and there's a letter there from this same cartoonist who had sent me the original advice, his name is Jack Cassidy and if he's watching this hijack, um, and he, he said that he was cleaning his office and he came across my letter that was in the bottom of a pile and he said that he was just writing to make sure that I hadn't given up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       Wow. And that was the only reason he wrote and I had given up. And so I thought, well, maybe he knows something. I don't know, maybe you see something that, that even the, the, uh, the magazines didn't see in my work. So I decided to raise my sights to become, to try to become a syndicated cartoonist and newspapers all over the world as opposed to just trying to get at, you know, a comic in a magazine because I figured if I got rejected at that, it would feel like progress because that'd be good. Rejected at a higher level that would feel good. Um, I sent out my samples and united media, one of the big sin that gets called and offered me a contract.

Speaker 2:          00:13:49       Yeah. I mean that's really just a great story of not just perseverance but also that someone else that you didn't even know really dragged you back in when you were out and also that your, your work before that, you hit that dead end of, you know, you're not going any further here. It happened to me because of your skin. It's interesting the way you described it, you don't sound like you were, you sound like you sort of understood what they were doing even though each node as against he wasn't working for you.

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       Yeah. I have two minds of that. Right? There's my social mind which says yes, there was no diversity in two major companies that that's not a longterm sustainable situation in this kind of a country, so it had to be fixed and if you let it get fixed in its natural course of events, it would take too long. It just would be untenable. And it is also true that when someone who looks like me, a white male in 1979 gets fired from a job without doing bad job or in this case to sort of encouraged to quit again. I had lots of opportunities so it wasn't the worst thing in the world for me and it worked out well obviously. Yeah. So yeah, I have two minds about it. I think it was good for society, bad for me at that moment, but it worked out good for me in the long run.

Speaker 3:          00:15:08       Yeah. What do you think in 2016, if the same thing happened to sort of a middle management white guy and they were told that now, uh, do you think the reaction from the average person would be the same? Do you think a normal corporate atmosphere? Do you think they would say it in such sorta. I think everything ages certain times. Right? So the tool you need know you have to adjust it for the time. If it's, you know, if it's years ago and you've got to slavery, you need a civil war, right? You got to go for the biggest bluntness weapon you can, if it's the, you know, the seventies and you still don't have good representation in top jobs. You need something less blunt than a civil war, but far more blunt than doing nothing and just hoping for things to change. Yeah. So I was in favor of a sort of a punch in the nose, sort of, uh, you know, to try to get things kick started.

Speaker 3:          00:16:00       But now I think things have improved, right? Nothing's fixed. You know, we haven't ended racism. We haven't ended sexism. Right. But there are pockets in which it really isn't a problem. Yeah. There are pockets where it's probably a huge problem, but you can choose your pocket now. So if you were somewhere where there's a huge problem, we do mostly have mobility. You can quit that job. You can find a place where you do have an advantage, you know? Um, I saw a picture today this running around twitter of the Huffington Post editorial board. It's 100 percent of white women. Oh yeah. I've seen that before. So if you're working for a company, you're a writer, you're a white woman, you got discriminated against, there is someplace you can go, right. We're probably something like the opposite is going to happen. Right? So I'm not saying that's good or bad, I'm just saying that in the world of 2016 you can leave where you are, you have, you know, mobility of sorts.

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       Nobody has perfect mobility, but you can't move. Right? So you can control your own fate and the way that you couldn't in 1979. Right. And it's funny because if we're talking about the same Huffington post picture, it's a long table. All the women and the woman who took the picture is saying, oh, look at our diversity here. She means diversity in that there's a lot of women or something to that effect. Yeah. And she's actually showing you that's just, it's different than just all white men, but does that really diversity per se. There was amazing bit of blindness that someone could tweet that publicly and be proud of it. Now I think we're all happy that women that have, you know, all the opportunities. I have literally never met anybody who thought differently about that topic. So you believe women are equal before the commenters start going out and I know he hates women or something.

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       I believe in equal opportunity. I think every individual is different, but of course you have to have equal access. Equal opportunity. Yeah. Alright. So let's jump forward. So now you, you get the cartoon out there and it starts taking off how much of it was rattling around all the ideas of Dilbert, which is very much takes place obviously in the time of your life that you were working in the corporate atmosphere. How much of those ideas were rattling around in you while you were doing it? I mean, was that just your creative outlet to not go crazy in a corporate job? Well, it turns out that Dilbert was sort of the sum of all my frustrations from my corporate world and it gave me an outlet for them. I hadn't been thinking in terms of, you know, Gosh, I got to make a comic about that until I actually started working on, um, but it was, it was a handy outlet by personality.

Speaker 3:          00:18:30       Um, I'm excited by problems. I'm excited by chaos. If it can, I swear you can swear away. I told you no rules. I wasn't getting a if things go to shit. Yeah. Suddenly I feel good because there's always opportunity. Right, right. Things are broken. At the very least, there's a job for somebody who fixes broken stuff, right? So every time something that's broken, I think, ah, there's a, there's an opportunity here. So I just love that situation. That's probably a good segue to the trump stuff, but I want to do some other stuff before, before we quite get there. So I was doing a little research and I knew you were into hypnotism. Well, I haven't had to test. You are a trained certified hypnotist. Yeah. How did that come to be? A well, the back story and that is that my mother gave birth to my younger sister while my mother was, um, hypnosis a while while she was hypnotized.

Speaker 3:          00:19:20       My family doctor was a hypnotist. Uh, and we hope he is a medical doctor, but I know he was at least after this. Right? Well, you all came out, right? Yeah. We all okay about. And My mother, my mother reports that she felt no pain did not have any drugs during childbirth and was awake the whole time. And now this is an unusual situation. So even even though, well hypnotized person, 20 percent at tops could feel that kind of extreme phenomena, but the other 80 percent can be deeply influenced. And so when I heard that story, I was pretty young when I heard it. I thought, what is the superpower and how can I get that? It was part of my process of trying to accumulate skills that would layer well on whatever, whatever I was naturally good at. And I thought, well, knowing how the human mind works now he had an influence at knowing how to hypnotize people has got to work everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:20:18       Right? Where would that not be a good idea? Right? Uh, so do you practice it some. I mean, do people come to you if someone say, I have a smoking problem or uh, you know, I eat too much or something and you say, well, I want to be hit and Desi and how do you use it? Actually. So I've sentenced, broadened what I, what I call it hypnosis to include anything in the field of persuasion, influence it could be advertising a, you know, in the, in the dating realm, you know, Game Theory or whatever it's called. Um, so there, there are a million forms of it, but it's all, it's all about how to influence people in there in the irrational sense.

Speaker 2:          00:20:55       Right? So you could be using some of the basics of hypnotism right now, but you're not putting. So people think of hypnotism, I like, I'm waiting for you to pull out the Stop Watch and put me to sleep. But you're saying there's, there's sort of skills and lessons you learned in that, that you can apply that you probably put into Dilbert and that you certainly are using on twitter and things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:21:15       So when I was learning hypnosis, of course I was doing the, you know, putting people in so-called hypnosis trances and uh, doing things like having them remember their past lives, which by the way is not real.

Speaker 2:          00:21:27       The past life things that really. Cause I know a couple of people reading that journey of souls know that during the sit bone, but it's all about the past life regression and that whole thing. Again,

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       I can tell you, I, as practice, I would run a little ad in the local rag to say, come in for $20. I will hypnotize you, wouldn't show you your past lives and person after person came in and sure enough under hypnosis they could remember past lives. But at the time I thought I was actually open minded about it. I was like, well maybe. I mean, how do you rule it out? But I'd have to do a few. You realize that none of them have lives that you haven't seen on television. Like nobody said. Yeah, I was, uh, I was an Ethiopian, you know, something that you wouldn't know what, how their life was. Everybody was an Egyptian princess or a viking or a cowboy. I think the most exotic Wa was a French surf, you know, and I'm thinking nobody's. Oh, and here's the other thing. I had person after person come in and not one of them was Chinese in a prior life and do some math, math. Right, right. Man. And there's a lot of China, a lot of Chinese people. Somebody was Chinese and her prayer life. And if, if there were such things as prior life.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       Right. So what do you think that tells you about the human psyche or the human condition that people, you'd put them under Gnosis, which you believe is a good practice and that ultimately there. So you would say that that's. Then their site subconscious. That's just exercising itself. It's just, yeah, it's combining with their ego to like just make up stories.

Speaker 3:          00:23:08       It's not just their subconscious is the fact that the hypnotist has implanted the suggestion that they can retrieve their past memory, and so that's enough that they imagine that they are having actual memories. Yeah. The main thing you learn to practice hypnosis to be a hypnotist is you have to understand that people are irrational all the time about everything, and if you don't understand that, you can't even do it because none of it would make sense for a rational person. People aren't. You know, if you think people are affected by data and facts and good arguments, you can't even do hypnosis. The whole thing just falls apart. You wait. You don't think everyone though is like that, right? You think 100 percent of the world are rational pretty much all the time. The Times when you're not or trivial, so you know if you're balancing your checkbook or or, or trying to decide which object is heavier and how much you need to lift it as probably a rational decision, but those are trivial in terms of our lives.

Speaker 3:          00:24:07       It's not going to affect the house you live, you decide to live in the job, you take the person you marry. It's not gonna Affect, you know, uh, the way you, even the way you dress most of the time. It certainly won't affect your political choices. Right? Right. So you would say those choices are done in an irrational manner for most people buying a house. I mean people spend a lot of time figuring out what house to buy or what career to go and do you think those are done it through irrational. We make our decisions about people and things and the first few seconds and then everything after that is a rationalization. I'll give you a perfect examples from my life. A few prior relationships ago, we were looking for a house, looked at a bunch of them. We both did like him. We drove up to the house.

Speaker 3:          00:24:50       We ended up buying sat in the car without even going inside the house. Looked at each other and laughed because that was our house [inaudible]. That was it. Yeah. And I don't know why, I just had a look at a feel, but without even seeing the inside of the house without knowing, you know, what we would pay or anything like that we had decided in. Sure enough we bought that house. Yeah. Likewise. It didn't work out. That was great. Yeah. And another relationship, we're looking for a car, you know, with my ex wife, looked at car after car. We pulled into one dealer, stood there and looked at the car and I just laughed because I didn't know anything about the guard, didn't know the specs to know the mileage. It didn't know anything. I just knew that was going to be our car. Sure enough.

Speaker 3:          00:25:31       Yeah. So for the people that go to a good Julian houses and inspect every inch or that go to 27 car dealerships and all that, that's a, it's sort of, you would describe that. That's just sort of a different way of doing things. You're sort of going to find a feeling that's going to appear. Right. That's not saying that everybody's doing that, but I'm aware of. But you're aware of it. Certainly there are some, some things that would eliminate a car from your potential. If you're looking for a truck, you're not going to buy a prius. Right? So there's a little bit of common sense in there, but when you get down to those final choices, that's, that's all. Just how it feels. Yeah. Interesting. All right. Should we go to politics? Sure. This is where they want us. This is where all the trump frogs that are very excited that I'm talking to you. This is what they want. Did they fast forward to this? However they already put on twitter the time. Say Skip. The first x amount is, the good stuff is at blah, blah, blah. He had a job. Okay, let's get to trump. All right, so let's, let's talk about trump a little bit. So my sense of your support of trump have, please correct me if I'm wrong, is not that you love him or his policies don't always support. I don't want to go too far with that word out there.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       And you've said some interesting things about your support of Hillary. So, uh, yeah, so correct me if I'm wrong, that it's not that you're necessarily supporting trump, but you like the techniques or you at least understand the techniques that he's using to get his message across and I think they're very much in line with some of the techniques that you just described to me. Is that a fair estimation? And I'll backtrack the word support if

Speaker 3:          00:27:07       put it in my, uh, my words. Yeah. And put the context straight here. Um, I don't think that anybody who was about seven years old should get hired for a job that requires great mental agility, flexibility, high energy, and even staying alive, which is very important to do the job of a president if they keep saying he's high energy, be alive. Right? So, so it's hard for me to get on board either of those choices because really 320 million people in the United States and the best we could get his two 70 year old racist or biggest, you know, depending on which side you're looking at it. Yeah, we'll, we'll get into that, both Megan and secondly, my political views that don't really align closely with either one of them, but that said, what I noticed last year, it was trump ahead a, an influencing or influencers I'm toolset. Um, he had the skills of the hypnotist and the skills of persuasion that I immediately said being fairly early on last year and said that's not normal while he's doing his technique that people don't understand, he's just a better persuader. And so I'm a big fan of his persuasion talents and I think people need to understand that in context and maybe not think of him as the crazy clown. It was lots of times there's intention there and there's a lot of strategy and you know, he's playing the long game and a lot of ways. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       So can you describe that part of it that uh, you know, a lot of people will say, well, he's just nuts or he says anything and it's just all crazy and all that. But what you're saying really is that there is a method to this madness. He's not just walking up there every day and saying crazy things with no plan that there's an actual plan and it's pulling some of the, the, the tools that

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       you're talking about. Planning might be overstating it because who knows you, you know, in this kind of context how far in advanced they really can plan or how much makes sense. But definitely he is saying, how can I control the most energy? Alright, so persuasion is about making somebody focus on your thing until they think it's important because the human brain is so dumb that it thinks whatever it pays attention to the most is the best or the worst or the most important. But anyway, in their minds it's priority rises right now, as long as he doesn't make too many things, people think he's the worst. The attention alone is a positive, right?

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       It's basically the heart of it, right? This,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       that it's an attention game that he's using and that's why it was so easy to dispatch the secret toolbox. Yeah. But if he had to mention one thing to sort of, you know, shining object and it would be manipulating attention, but he also manipulates attention away from things he doesn't want. So, um, I, my best example is during the first debate a year ago when trump was asked about his comments about women in the past, now this was a trap that nobody can get out of, right? You can't say there's nothing you can say because now the media has made people's attention on these bad things. So just focusing on it makes them seem higher priority. What does trump say? He goes, only rosie o'donnell and suddenly all the energy sucked out of the question and went to this visual, a person who is disliked, at least by the base, you know, the Republicans could be counted on to have an extreme reaction.

Speaker 3:          00:30:33       So it's a face whenever you can put a face to something, a personality and a visual. All the energy just sucks into the room. And that was the moment I got out of my chair. So I wait a minute, this is not normal. And then I watched to see if he could repeat it and he kept doing it and doing it. And then by the time he was doing the, the low energy thing, I think I was the first person probably in the country who said, okay, that's not a random insult. That's the end of Bush is dead. And there isn't as, that is what I call linguistic kill shots are not just insults. That's what people thought. The first part. These are engineered, right? So look at low energy, how engineered this is, right? He takes something that hasn't been used before in the political realm.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       You know, it's not the usual thing you say in politics. So therefore you can imbue it with his own meaning, right? It's his own thing. Then he picks something that matches the physicality of the person. That's another big trick or something. When you look at them and you say, yeah, that feels right. Right. Now here's the thing. Before he said that, before he reframed a Bush as being low energy, I think most people had the same impression I did. I looked at that guy and I said, you know, he looks like a calm, seasoned executive. He, it looks like he would be unruffled and even a nuclear war. That's exactly the kind of executive I was running my country. And then Bush says low energy and every time you look at it and after that you go, well, it does look a little low energy and you don't even know why that's bad.

Speaker 3:          00:32:04       And the edit fields, so we're in a bad. So now he's created. Here's the second, the, the other, the other part that's important. He creates a trap for confirmation bias so that everything that Bush does, using his normal personality makes you think, oh yeah, it just. So his label reinforces over time. Same with Lion Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz unfortunately has a little bit of a distrust, full face, kind of slimy. Some people just have that face, right? Yeah. And because he's a politician and he's going to say things that aren't true, like, all right, but he got the tag. Your confirmation bias will go to everything he says. He's lying, he's lying. So is that really the genius of this that he said Lion Ted Cruz, and he calls her crooked hillary when there's every evidence to believe that someone could call him those things and be just as truthful, if not more truthful than he's being right because he's taken every position we can talk about some of the immigration stuff, but he's already scaling that back so well while it's important to pick the one that people are already sort of prime to believe or there's something about his physicality that would make them easily believe that trump.

Speaker 3:          00:33:11       There's a lot of things you can say about him, but what a Clinton has finally jumped on that was sort of late in the process because she was fighting Bernie and that was a different fight. But at this point she is going with the, the racist, irrational, racist thing. Yeah. And that too is an engineered killshot I believe I'm reasonably certain that she has professionals working for one in particular that I've nicknamed Godzilla Godzilla is my pet name for Robert Cialdini who wrote the book influence, um, who would be considered that the monster of persuasion, if you are going to hire one person to persuade the world. This is the guy that's the guy. And apparently he did consult on, um, Obama's campaign. It would be, it would be surprising if he had not been asked at least, but I don't have confirmation of that. Um, but I do know that Clinton went from having no persuasion game at all, talking about facts and their experience and her policies and realizing that that wasn't going to work.

Speaker 3:          00:34:14       And then she went full trump the summer and said, forget about all my facts and policies. I mean, she's not forgetting them, but she's not emphasizing. You want to be real scared of this Guy Kevin here. And here's the best part. Trump was using fear as a persuasion technique is fears the best thing you can do, right? You scare people. They have to, they have to fix that first. You fixed your fear first, then you work at the other stuff. So he said, look at these, these terrorists coming in. Look at the criminal who's crossing the border. Look at the, you know, the economy falling apart. Now whether or not any that's true generates fear. Fear is real good for persuasion. That what did, what did Clinton half facts affects her, her experience, that's nothing. And then she ratcheted it up and said, no, the real fear is trump, right?

Speaker 3:          00:35:02       Because trump is saying maybe you've got a fear from terrorists, but if you think about it, what are the odds that a terrorist is going to kill you? Right? Low. So that fear is good fear it worked, but it's not like a comprehensive fear that gets everybody in. Clinton said, if trump gets in the office is going to have his finger on the nuclear codes and you're all dead and suddenly she got all kinds of purchase and you know, in and her poll numbers started rising. She basically has a commercial outright now saying exactly that. So. Right. So do you think there was a calculated, what does that say then I guess about the Clinton campaign that pretty much

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       this all went down last week. Like this all seems to have come to a head last week with the big speech calling him a racist, linking him to all right. And breitbart and we'll get into all that. Um, do you think there was really a sit down where they said, man, the technique he's using is really working and we have to now shift you out of policy and all that stuff? Or, or was it just, it's sort of low hanging fruit to call someone a racist. They're doing it to each other now. It's just, Oh, you're a racist. It's become meaningless. I think for the most part the word has become sort of meaningless. But do you think there was a real calculated sit down, like the technique he's using is working. We better start playing ball this way.

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       They're both doing what I call the AB testing is a word from the technology world where you're testing one technique and then you measure how well it does and then you test another and if that works better, you go with this one. If this one works better, you try yet another one to see if that's even better until you get the best one. There is no doubt that they found out there are other attacks weren't working. Um, I think there was a wiki leaks saying that they, they thought attacking him on his business acumen. Was it working because people sort of had it in their mind that, that he was good at that stuff, whether that's true or not.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       Right. So I'll show you some bankruptcies, but they go, but wait a minute. He's still his buildings everywhere. So whether it's true or not.

Speaker 3:          00:36:53       Yeah. The trouble with the bankruptcy stories, who's name is on 500 entities and, you know, yeah, four of them didn't go well. So that's actually more like a home run than a failure, you know, in, in an entrepreneurial sense. Um, so yeah, I think that they tested until they found that the racist thing is the one that stuck and because of the way he talks is unfiltered a method and the policies that he's put out, they attract confirmation bias. Um, for those watching who don't know what confirmation bias is, it's a well known mental phenomena where if you think something's true, you imagine every bit of evidence to support that. Whether it is not, you'll see, you'll see it that way. Once you've decided by the way, that's, that's what the hypnotist learns. The hypnotist learns that once you've decided, which is the irrational decision, that, that there is no such thing as data and, and rational or logic just doesn't exist.

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       That you basically will then just go through life finding just the things that validate what you have presupposed way back.

Speaker 3:          00:37:56       And let me prove that beyond any doubt, if ration, rational thinking and logic existed, there would only be one religion. We would all just figured it out. There would be mostly people all on one side and these and these political events, not to every time it's about 50 slash 50. Right. What are the odds of that, right? Like, or, or, uh, I asked the question once, where do, where do all the smart people come out on this? Like if you pulled only smart people, well educated, really well informed, smart people, would they all have the same opinion now if there was anything to logic and data and thinking is thinking we're a real thing. Like we, you know, we were really, you know, taking the right data and making the right decisions. People would mostly be on the same side and these political questions, you know, even if it's 75, 25, it would be overwhelmingly, you know, on one side, but they're not.

Speaker 3:          00:38:52       So as someone that cares about thinking and critical thought and being smart and all of that stuff, this has to be a little depressing for you. Right? I mean, as you already said, the 70 year old part and all that. And we've only selected just these two, but just the general discourse has to be kind of depressing, right? Absolutely not because remember, since, um, since my twenties when I learned hypnosis, I've abandoned the idea that anyone is rational, including me. So once you abandoned that, the world becomes far less frustrating, not more so. Let's look at the world that the rest of you are living in. And I feel sorry for your bachelors living, living in this world because if you're looking at the people who are on the other side of a political debate and you're saying, why can't they see the logic, the rational arguments that are so clear to me?

Speaker 3:          00:39:39       And the answer is always the same. You're an idiot. But guess what they're thinking they are too. And you know, they're having exactly the same thought where their set of confirmation bias and they're so sure that they're right. Sure. So basically you're saying you, Scott Adams don't have any of the answers, right? But you're just saying this is, this is the game. So we have to deal with it in that reality. While I have all the answers, if you're talking about the political stuff you've got all the way and we haven't gotten to that yet. Yeah. Well let's get to. Let's go. You wait, before we get to all the answers. That will be a better thing to probably end with all the answers to everything. Maybe we'll wrap up the show. I could end the show if we get all the answers. Yeah, we'll, we'll see.

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       Uh, but I'm curious. So the racist word, we've talked about it a lot on this show that one of my issues has been how the left has used the words of bigotry and racism and homophobia and all of these things. They've used them so much to smear their opponents that these words have no longer have any meaning. Really? Totally disagree. Really? Yeah. Racist never loses its power even now because my feeling was absolutely need both were firing at each other and it didn't feel like it took anymore. Oh No, it's taken. It's taken big time. Yeah. If if you talk to the average Clinton supporter about what they think of trump, and this is something I've not seen in any other election, you'll see the person who dislikes trump physically shake. Yeah. I've seen people talk about them and their handshake, like there's a lot of people. I mean this is not just a few. Observation is common that people will spit and yell and shake and that's because the racist claim sticks. It's not because they think his policies aren't as good. They prefer this approach has nothing to do that they think is actually a racist. They've literally been convinced, and so that's that subset of Clinton supporters. My suspicion though is that the average person

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       out there, here's the word racist, sees the way these things have been overused and the way we label everybody and goes it actually in a way, especially if you take the trump supporters, every time you call them a racist, it actually, they like it because they feel like you've lost the argument, so that's the word you're throwing out there.

Speaker 3:          00:41:51       There's confirmation bias in in inaction.

Speaker 2:          00:41:56       Oh, I guess that's the best example of someone calls you something bad and you go.

Speaker 3:          00:41:59       So the, the trump supporters believe is that they're not racist or you know, it's not a problem. And so they, they imagined the world in which those insults or ineffective, but they are totally effective. It's, it's the strongest sauce you could possibly put on this spaghetti. Terrible analogy that was there. Uh, yeah. So that's the reason Clinton's using it and I'm sure they've tested everything else and found out, wow, this is super, but let me get back to the confirmation bias. So look at the charge and look at all of the things that trump is accused of and we'll just pick anyone and of the bunch. Let's take the judge curial a thing where he said that the judge couldn't be bias because in, um, in trump's words he was Mexican. Now you hear that. And even to my ears, that's like, the judge would be biased.

Speaker 3:          00:42:49       That couldn't be biased. Right, right, right. Okay. Um, so even to my ears that's like, oh, that's like a little red flag there. So you back it up. If you talk to someone who was born in this country and their parents came from Mexico, what do they call themselves while they're Americans? Obviously they call themselves Americans, but in casual conversation they'd say, I'm Mexican. Same Way. If you're a Italian blood, but you, you're two generations away from Italy, people still say, yeah, I'm Italian. It's an understood. You're also American. It was. We just have. So he used me. He used the language the way people use language, right? So, so far he's not a racist. He just used the language, lay people do. But he went further. He said that because of that, you would be biased. Now you know who's biased. Every fucking person, every person in the world is bias.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       There's no such thing as the unbiased person. There's a reason that, that jury's pick, um, that, uh, lawyers kick people off of Jerry's because of their experience that is biased. There's a reason that a judge can recuse himself or herself because they know they're biased. So to imagine that someone who has, let's say a Mexican heritage and presumably their relatives are Mexican, maybe he has, maybe he's visited Mexico, I don't know if that's true, but at the very least he's got a family influence. What is more influential on your decision making than your family and how you have to live with them for the rest of your life? Imagine this judge ruling inexplicably favorably for trump and then attending this next family reunion right now. Remove Mexican. It doesn't matter who it is. If this guy is, if this guy does something that's unpopular with his family, that's the problem.

Speaker 3:          00:44:30       That's the perfect for a human. Forget that is a judge. Forget deals, heritage and human. In that situation, it was almost guaranteed to be biased. Now the question is, is a professional judge, can he see past that? That's his job, right? Of course, right? But it's still smart for trump to put that out there because he's persuading a legal case and both, both sides are trying to persuade as hard as they can. So trump is putting it out there and says, hey, you know, and he's also persuading the public in advance. If I get a bad judgment, I'm going to say people in this situation can be biased. If I get a good judgment, I'm happy I go away. So as he's not doing it as subtly as you just laid out saying, well, this guy might be biased in a calm way. You calmly laid it out.

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       He, he goes to the easier but that. But you're saying that's the whole, that's why he gets attached point. Yeah. He gets attention. So it's the attention on it that makes it powerful. So if you were to pick this apart as the legal strategy and pick the actual words, there actually isn't any racism. There is a comment about somebody who has a race in this case, uh, has a, a cultural heritage is a better word, but everybody is influenced by all their, all of their influences. Family influences their job. They worked at their pack, their background, all of that. Right. I suppose the inherent problem with it in that case is that had the, had this judge been white of Irish descent or Italian descent or some other European descent, you acknowledged she would have certain biases, but trump would've never figured out a way to bring up his ethnic background.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       I'm going to. Let me give you an example right back to your. Let's say trump is doing some business in Scotland, which he is. Let's say the people in Scotland got really mad at him and formed a partition and the people in Scotland just hated him. Yeah, I think they're doing this over that golf course. All right, so let's say there was a, a, you know, a second generation Scottish judge. I think even trump has some Scottish blood. Yeah, I think so. So in that case, if a Scottish judge who had Scottish, uh, parents was involved and he knew that the Scottish parents living in Scotland were really, really mad at trump. Yeah. Would it be fair to say that the Scottish judge who was really an American citizen with Scottish background, um, could be biased? I think so. I mean, wouldn't you know reasonable?

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       Yeah. So basically you're just. All you're doing really is just peeling back the. You're showing the wizard behind the curtain here, so more than anything else, right? You're not. You're not defending the specifics of what he's doing. Oh No. This in this case, what I'm doing is giving the listeners an example of what confirmation bias looks like. When you heard the judge curial comment out of context. It does sound like a racist statement. Once you put it in its proper context, that goes away and that's how confirmation bias looks. It looks just like that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       Do you blame? Why don't. Since you have a lot of blame in general, but do you prescribe the symptom of trump to just everything that has transpired over the last 20 years just are terrible media that doesn't challenge politicians are discourse that's crumbled to the point of just yelling racism at everybody are politicians who lie. I don't think trump is any bigger, bigger of a liar. Then Hillary is. I think she's probably a bigger liar. Everything being equal, but he lies in more of a, in a more of a regular person way. And that makes people freak out. She lies in more of a policy, like it just all led up to him in a way it seems kind of obvious.

Speaker 3:          00:48:14       Well, you know, we don't live in a single variable world, so you needed everything to be the way it is. Plus trump and again, the results you have, you can't, he can't remove one of the important variables. And there were lots of them. But I think the key variable, and this is what I've been saying, is trump's skill, his skill at persuasion, that is the story. I don't think you could take a non trump, put them in this same world in 2016 and say the world is crazy in the media, is this, um, I don't think you could drop Kanye West into there yet, although I've said he does have some really high persuasion skills, but he doesn't have some of the other stuff. Um, so yeah, I think trump's specific phenomenon.

Speaker 2:          00:48:55       Yeah. So. Alright. So I don't sense full trump's support. Correct? Or is that what you're not,

Speaker 3:          00:49:02       you have support, you know, I would never, I never support the use of support

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       in terms of. And yet at the same time, I think a lot of people think you're like one of the biggest trump supporters out there and it's really just because you're talking about his technique.

Speaker 3:          00:49:16       Uh, I'm an admirer of his technique. Yeah. I, unlike many people, I'm very amused by his humor and his personality. And by the way, before we were filming, you mentioned you have a New York background as do I from upstate New York. And I haven't talked to too many New York people about this. I'm going to run this by you.

Speaker 2:          00:49:35       I went to Suny Binghamton badly. That was another piece of my news. Hartwick. Is that right?

Speaker 3:          00:49:40       Oh my God, we're practically neighbors. There you go. The wrong times. Um, what was I talking about? Upstate New York? Upstate New York. So when trump talks in these ways that offend the world, I as a New Yorker say, that's not offensive talk. Let's just talk. Yeah, that's just how I talked. One of the, um, one of the things I had to learn to change when I moved to California is that when I talked like New York people talk upstate or city, it's, there's a bluntness that is offensive and I had to really work on that. Also, there's an arrogance or a perceived arrogance of New Yorkers because we talk honestly about things we're good at. We also talk honestly about the things we're bad at, but that Kinda gets lost California. Right? And I was like, Oh, you have a big ego. No, I said, I'm good at these things. I'm just like, you just like everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       We're all good at something. We're bad at something. How was that? How was that terrible? But the things that New Yorkers do is they say, man, I want to punch that guy. He knows he needs a, he needs two bullets in the back of the head, you know, I'll give him two in the chest. One on one of the head is just normal New York talk. Yeah. But you see that and a context. And by the way, I think this is purely a trump mistake, meaning that there's, I don't think there's somebody telling them, wait, this stuff doesn't sound the same. And as soon as you leave the street, as soon as you leave, your state really doesn't sound the same.

Speaker 2:          00:51:06       Yeah. It's funny because I was just telling you I was. I visited New York for the last 10 days. I got back yesterday and even though I lived there my whole life, one of the things that I really noticed about being in New York City for for 10 days was the incredible, you know, racial mix and every, every type of person on earth is in that city, on subways together. We're not killing each other. We're pretty much just ignoring each other because everyone's going to live their lives. And I thought there's something actually beautiful about that. It doesn't matter ultimately if keep these people privately hate each other for racist reasons or anything, but they're all out there living their lives. That's not to say there isn't any crime or any bad racism or something like that. But I thought that was actually inspiring about New York that we're told we live in this society that's so frayed and everything, and yet our best city has everybody

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       and we're doing that. I love that example. And to that point, um, I'm going to steal something that I heard Dr Laura say one, so I'm kind of, you know, maybe modifying the words a little bit, but I'll credit her for the thought and the thought is that you are what you do. You're not what you think because if we were judged by our thoughts, we would all be executed for, you know, you should be killed for just the things you were thinking, right? Um, that's coming. Yeah. You are what you do. And more importantly, you are what you do recently. Because if I'm judged by my past, I got some problems. If you're judged by your past, you've probably got some problems too. We were all in their twenties. Ones, right? It's all, it's all bad stuff in the past. Yeah. The goal of life is to improve. So if we're not, if we're not improving, we've got a problem, right? I think both Clinton and trump have probably improved and I think that judging them, either one of them by something that happened in say 10 or more years ago is um, is probably a bad bet because we're all bad people 10 years ago compared to how we are now because ideally we're all getting better, smarter,

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       right? Better informed. Well the hope is by the law, but people do obviously, but the other way too to

Speaker 3:          00:53:08       so when people are judging, for example of trump for his, let's say his, his recent focus on African Americans and say that's in his mind. He's not thinking that. I say, you're on the wrong page. What, what, what counts is what he's doing and what he was doing before it wasn't as good because he wasn't mentioning, you know, other groups in society and now he is. So he's gone from less good too good if doing the right thing doesn't count anymore, what the fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       So that, that's really fascinating. So when they, when they take something like the immigration thing where he said we're going to kick them all out day one, then he tempered it this past week and then it sounds like he untempered it by saying, you know, first our in office, it's going to start or something. Those are all crazy comments, like we're not getting rid of everybody. Then the temporary actually I thought it sounded somewhat sane and then I'm going to do it in the first hour. Sounds completely insane at that point. Is there. That's not crazy at all. No, no. I get it. He's using the tools you're talking about but is there. So I understand that, but is there anything that he could say, do you think that would turn off his people because he immigration was their number one thing and he pretty much. I mean even Ann Coulter was acknowledging it. Like he backed off that because he was trying, I think to become better, to become a more legitimate candidate.

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       Yeah. So he had to throw them under the bus. Well, people who believed it, I would. I would put it in these terms. In hypnosis, there's something called pacing and leading. Pacing is when you match your subject in any way you match their breathing, the way they talked, the way their their posture, because if you do that long enough, people get comfortable with you and then you can do what's called leading, so then you then you can do something different and then people will start doing the thing that you're doing, so you start by copying them until they learn to copy you. Subconsciously. They're not doing it intentionally. It's a. it's a major. It's one of the biggest components of hypnosis is that idea. What trump is doing is pacing and leading the entire Republican Party. What you think he's doing is that he's gone in and his ideas are a little different and somehow with his, you know, he's punched his way through the top.

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       That is not what he's doing. He hollowed out the gop and he's wearing it as a skin. When he's done, the Republican Party will never be the same. He has changed it and he has improved it. He got in front of, he got onstage at the Republican convention and did a full throated what I thought was completely sincere endorsement of doing more to help the Lbgtq community. Peter Teal spoke. He meant it and what happened with all the Republicans as soon as. As soon as he did that, you don't hear anybody complaining about that, right? Yeah, and not that they would have complained necessarily, but the Republican party changed. Trump changed them and they can't go back. He, he pays them until he led them and on immigration. He pays them. He said what they needed to hear until they said, trump, trump, trump. He's our guy. I feel good with you.

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       Now he's in a position to lead the repo, the democratic side. There were already there. You know, they wanted something kinder and gentler going by the wayside. Why don't want this to be dealt with in the most humane way. That also makes sense from the country, but he's, it's a little bit like, but slightly different than Nixon goes to China. You know, Nixon was a hard ass about China. So when he went there, people believed him that he wasn't just selling out, he was still Nixon. People believe that trump is still trump, and if he sold them that he had their interests in mind, which he totally did. All right. For his Republican base, he said, I hear you about this immigration. I'm going to make it my top priority. He paced them, they trusted him, they got into side. Now trump and nobody else can soften that position. No one else is in that position because of the way he did it. But it looks to the public like it's a flip flop. It's the opposite. It's, it's, it's, I'm sure it was intentional from the beginning.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       Right. So, so you would say that, you know, I saw a lot of people that after Peter Teal spoke and trump had that nice moment actually where he said the thing about lgbt Americans and he got a, what I think was a pretty spontaneous applause break from the crowd based Republicans. Right, right. Um, you know, I saw that a lot of people after that we're saying we'll still look what's in the party platform. And there's still stuff that's not great on marriage equality and other things, but you would argue that's basically irrelevant at this point because he's the, he's the head, he's the leader and he's made the acknowledgement so.

Speaker 3:          00:57:47       Well, they're not done. I mean there's, you know, everything's a work in progress, right? But, uh, I think trump's support of the lgbt Q, I lose a bunch of ladders. Community was both sincere and a higher priority than the wedding cakes. And guess what? I think the wedding cakes will be okay. And the weddings, uh, yeah, I think the Republican Party will, will catch up in that sense.

Speaker 2:          00:58:09       So is that the irony? The ultimate irony of trump more than anything else is that while these people get shaky when you're talking to them and angry and stammering and sweaty and all that stuff, that he actually became the Republican nominee by basically being pro gay marriage. He's not going to try to flip gay marriage. He's for gay people to live equally basically. And at the same time he's been running an antiwar. He certainly doesn't want a nation build that's pretty obvious. He wants people that were giving things to, to pay us all of that stuff. So he actually sort of killed the Neo con part of it and killed the Christian conservatives, like he slayed them both on the way. So he, he should've become the left's favorite Republican in a bizarre way.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       Um, and maybe still. Well, I mean, I'm still predicting that he'll win in a landslide. Uh, I know the polls don't look like that right now, but they're tightening as we're talking.

Speaker 2:          00:59:02       How much of that do you think is just that there's a certain fear of saying you're for trump

Speaker 3:          00:59:06       so people don't fall properly? Probably a lot of it. Um, I know a lot of people who say they're a, that they won't say out loud that they support trump. Uh, because since I said that I support Hillary Clinton for my personal safety.

Speaker 2:          00:59:19       Yeah. I want to get to that because I live in California

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       where that's kind of important. Um, uh, I've heard from people who say the same thing. They say, oh my God, I can't say it at work. I can't say it to my family who can't say it to my friends. How many there are is the great mystery, but I don't think they're being picked up and pulling necessarily. Yeah. What do you make of the alt right that everybody's talking about right now? Do you? I don't think you consider yourself part of it. You're sort of a do not. You're a. you're a parcel to it or something like that. Right? Like because they're, they're getting two or something like that. Like they are getting, I think. I think some of the techniques that they are doing of upsetting people in power with memes, you know you have so nobody in the basement, they send out a Nazi meme to somebody important.

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       That person retweets it. Thus you're showing that you're upsetting them and you're changing the game from your basement. Like some of that seems like the stuff that you're talking about. Well first of all, I disavowed the alternative as I see what I've done here. I said, you spy, you endorsed trump thing. I'm putting you in a disavowed trump. I disavow everybody's going to Hillary Clinton because that's best for my personal safety. I don't even know what they all were. The, the, the uh, all right. Even is it, isn't it like a grab bag of miscellaneous things that other people don't like. It was pretty much what I described at the beginning of this is polite. People don't like it. It's him. So I'm not sure how one can, can love that movement, but it's certainly is having an impact. Yeah. But it's using the techniques you're talking about, right?

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       Like they're doing a lot of the leads stuff. They're upsetting people. Empower everybody's using the techniques we're using better than, than others. Um, and yes, I would say that I've observed them intentionally trying to use the power of the tools of persuasion, but both sides are doing that now. Yeah. I'm curious because you've become so big on twitter and you have your base on twitter that, that absolutely loves you. Do you ever find that they're leading you? Do you ever find that you were about to tweet something and go, ah, this could, this could upset them or they'll get confused or, or as someone that's, that's a writer and that's able to get a thought out in a six panel cartoon that twitter has some drawbacks when you're trying to really formulate a thought. All communication has drawbacks. And I definitely, um, I'm definitely informed by who is reading my tweets to keep them in a zone that makes sense for the followers.

Speaker 3:          01:01:49       But beyond that, I'm a big proponent of free speech, so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna mute myself. Totally. Uh, I have what I lovingly recall. Fuck you money. So I don't have a boss. You don't need to. I don't need to make other people happy. If I have something that needs to be said, I can do that. Yeah, you don't have to tell me the number. But when did you realize you had fuck you money? Um, 10 years ago probably. All right, so let's do a little bit on hillary because we kind of danced around her a bit. Uh, it's

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       sort of all, it's all encompassing. This, the top trump, you're sort of talking hillary already. We're just stuck in this thing. Um, what do you make of her? Do you think? It seems just uninspiring to me and I consider her as much of a liar as I consider trump and we're just screwed. How's that? How's that for a lead?

Speaker 3:          01:02:39       I'll tell you at this point in the race if you're going to vote for the one who's not the liar, good luck. Good luck. I think there was a, there was a point early on in the race where you could say trump is lying way more than Clinton, but I think that difference has been erased and the reason is that lying worked really, really well. And so Clinton is sort of, as I said earlier, dispense with the facts that. And she's more about a user are racist and misogynist. And I don't think, as I've said, I think that's confirmation bias. It's not fact, but the race has almost entirely, if you think about it, it's. I've never seen this before. The race has gone from talking about policies and things in the world to almost entirely talking about this gray lump of matter in each of their heads like that, you know, is, is, is Hillary's sick or lying or whatever is trump, you know, a crazy, racist, misogynist or whatever, but it's all about the gray thing in their skull. Like, what about the world?

Speaker 2:          01:03:41       Right? So was that the obvious outcome here? In a weird way, if you, if you go back six months and you really saw what was going to happen here, and you look at Hillary and Bernie, actually they were gonna take him down no matter what. And if you saw what trump was building, which as you said, you saw it a little earlier than most people. In a way, this was the obvious. We were going to get to this, right? No matter what,

Speaker 3:          01:04:02       probably the gravity was sucking us to this place. Yes. The, the only unknown was whether Hillary would go as dark as she went. By the way that were dark probably came from Godzilla. Um, that's, that's an engineered word. That's the word that you don't hear in politics, which is designed to attract confirmation bias. Hey, everything trump is doing is dark now

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       for people that missed the beginning of that clip. That's what. What's the guy's name again?

Speaker 3:          01:04:27       Uh, so that would be Robert Cialdini. I'm just hypothesizing. I don't have confirmation that he's working on the Clinton campaign advising her in the persuasion arts.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       Yeah. Um, okay. So let's put trump and Clinton aside for a second and I want to finish up with free speech because that's sort of in the thrust of everything that I do here. And I know it's something that's obviously very important to you. Um, what do you make of the state of free speech in America in 2016 as a, as a creator, as someone that puts thoughts out there and you do poke funded a lot of our societal nonsensical ways that we self censor.

Speaker 3:          01:05:02       Yeah, it's, it's interesting in many ways the world is going in the same direction in the sense that there's more of everything. I mean, I think in the old days, more of something less of something else, but now there are more places that you speak with complete freedom, you know, online and then there are fewer places that you could do the same thing in corporate America or in other places. So in some ways there's more freedom than ever, but in a whole lot of places in, in troubling ways, there's less than ever. I'm a little on the fence about how much of that is bad and how much of it is good because I do think that words matter. And I think that, uh, there are places where civil conversation is more important than say in your mind, right? For freedom of speech is overrated in some contexts, but you certainly have to have it to have an effective government and an effective country.

Speaker 3:          01:06:02       Right. So to that end, do you say Asana, bringing it back to trump, but unfortunately here, but I have to, for the purposes of that, do you think that once in office, if he became president, do you think he'd be able to have those conversations in that sort of space where he's not doing these all these tricks but doing, I suspect your, these? Yeah. Well, I think if you imagine a president trump, um, I could see two things happening once that everybody moderates, once they get the job. I remember back in my corporate days, um, you know, one of my coworkers would get promoted to an important level of responsibility and their personality would just change overnight. It started getting serious and they would stop joking around. Certainly trump would be doing some of that, right? So there would be some moderation just because the job, I imagine just imagine yourself, you know, you're, no matter what you're thinking before you walk into the Oval Office, right?

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       You walk into the Oval Office, you're in the White House, all right? There's no way that doesn't change. It's real now. It's real. That's the biggest influence you could have, and in fact, a Chilean even writes about this, the influence of your physical environment in his new book, which I'll, I'll plug for them. Presuasion predestination will be the biggest book about persuasion. The world's ever seen. It will be massive. I got an early copy, so I saw, um, yes, so trouble moderate just because of the physical, you know, power of the office, but also he's also created in everybody's mind and expectation that he does things that other people don't. So if you're, let's say you know that the heads of China or Russia and trump says, you know, a crazy thing that people don't normally say, they're not going to say, oh my God, here it comes to the nukes.

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       They're good. They're going to say that's what he does. That's. Yeah. So we have to stop thinking that China's a bunch of idiots. They're going to misconstrue what's happening over here. It could not be more clear. The trump says things. Other people that would say. So if he does more of it, people are gonna say, well, there's more of it. Right? So basically they would just have to learn how to readjust already have, I mean I think that process is done, you know, you just have to see enough of him to say, okay, he's talking like I'm going to say a new and we get that. Yeah. Once you get the that that's his style, you're okay with it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:22       Yeah. I think it's interesting what you said about how so in some ways it feels like we have less free speech and in some ways it feels like we have more because people will now use the internet to do this. There's some, I'm a little caught between feeling that the Internet side of it is good and bad because so many people are doing it at that. I feel like I'm buried. They're exercising their right to free speech, but then it also comes with you say all kinds of things that you would never say in person. I have no problem with what they say. As I say all the time that the show, I don't like the Nazi memes and showing all these rays actual racist things about black people or whatever. I wouldn't stop them from doing it, um, but I guess, but still you would say that's a net good because at least there's the outlet.

Speaker 3:          01:09:08       Yeah. Um, I would say that anonymity is essential in a free society. You got to be able to say some things anonymously, but I'd also say that the cure for all the bad stuff is sunlight and the more of the anonymous people say horrible things, the more of the sunlight starts to, you know, eroded. So I think you have to let it out before you can kill it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:35       So to that point, would you, if someone was tweeting you all day and sending you awful Nazi memes or any of this made my entire day. I said my policy is I just ignore them. Occasionally I mute them and on a very rare occasion if they just won't stop, then I'll block them. Um, but I never amplify them because I feel like, well, if I don't really pretend that they're here then unless they, you know what I mean? Like they're not outside with pitchforks, they're just doing it from the comfort of their own computer. Do you basically think that that's a good policy and in this way because otherwise I feel like we're just making their ideas bigger if every time, if I get outraged that they sent me something upsetting and then I outrage somebody else by retweeting it and then it becomes this never ending thing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       I feel like I'm judging everyone individually because every once in a while they'll say something that links to some data. Yeah, and now look at that and say that's data that. I mean I don't. Maybe I don't like where their implication or where it heads or or any of that, but data is data so those I tend to let stay, but if somebody just comes on and yelled some racial stuff that I usually just block them right away. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:42       All right. Final thought. You've already predicted. It's a. you're predicting a trump landslide. Do you want to give you some percentages but you want to put yourself out there

Speaker 3:          01:10:50       that I said some from last year, 98 percent trump landslide and hasn't changed. What has changed is that he's had terrible weeks and if that week was the only thing that happened until the end, of course he would lose, but that never stays the same. That weeks are going to be up and down. I think there are some big shocks to come. I think that all the trump shocks are baked in. There's almost nothing you could hear about unless it was totally out of left field that would make any difference. Right? But there's a whole bunch of stuff you could hear about Clinton. Um, especially since she has government experience, right? That, that makes them more vulnerable to a shock because if he did it in the context of the government, it seems worse. Um, so that alone I think almost guarantees a trump victory really. So basically that wiki leaks could just drop something because we know they're holding something.

Speaker 3:          01:11:36       It doesn't even have to be wiki leaks could be anything. It could be anything A. Well, I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you and I'm glad we were able to talk about some of this stuff without sort of the craziness attached to it because it doesn't it feel like it's just crazy all the time. Right? Crazy in the most entertaining ways. I have never had more fun year of my life. I got to say I wake up every happy because the news is going to entertain me and, and, and people are. People are. People are engaged. Engagement, the engagement. Look, look what people learned about their government this year about how the primaries work, you know, that they are rigged a little bit. I mean just the level of human engagement is off the chart and I would go so far as to say that a president trump would probably encourage more direct public participation because it just feels like he needs it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       Clinton, which was because he just loves it. He loves that. Well, I think Clinton would do her thing and her lobbyists would writer write legislation. It'd be like always, but if you saw president trump, you'd think almost anything was possible. So you'd say, I got an idea and people are already sending me all these ideas for building the border wall with a, with a light rail train on the top and businesses and casinos and, you know, making it, uh, you know, economic zone, good guy. We're here, we're hearing all this big thinking on one side and I, I feel like something's being unleashed in a good way. Like a creative thing and we hope it's not the, you know, some kind of a race war.

Speaker 2:          01:13:09       Yeah. Is Out World War three. All right, well for more Scott and, uh, the dilbert cartoon and his thoughts and blog and all that, you can check out blog.dilbert.com. Thanks for watching. And we will do it again next week.
