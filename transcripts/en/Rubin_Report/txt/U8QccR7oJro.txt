Speaker 1:          00:00:02       During

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       the direct message last week, I mentioned how people from all over the world watching and listening to the Rubin report are connecting through the power of ideas. Immediately after we posted the video online, the comments section lit up with people chiming in from around the globe. For those of you keeping score, here are the countries I heard from in no particular order, Macedonia, Hungary, Poland, Lebanon, Denmark, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Finland, United States, Canada, Italy, Arac, Slovakia, Israel greased. I won Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Argentina, Ireland, Belgium, Georgia, Netherlands, Bangladesh, South Africa, India and New Zealand, Norway, Brazil, Australia, Portugal, Spain, and even North Korea by my count. That's 35 countries and that's just from the people who happened to comment on the video or tweet to me wherever you are, you are a living, breathing example of why ideas about secular values and free speech matter. For my interviews to you guys, furthering the conversations on social media were igniting ideas and people all over the world who share the same ideals as the civil rights activist.

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       Medgar Evers said, you can kill a man, but you can't kill an idea, so whether you're listening to this in the comforts of your vacation home on the Italian coast, while on a bus in India or in an apartment complex in war torn Iraq, you're a piece of the puzzle of reclaiming liberalism and having honest conversations even with those whom we disagree, ideas of brought us together, but I think we're just at the precipice of what this conversation about free speech and liberalism could become. So now I want you guys to be part of the show more than ever before. I think we can do something bigger than just emailing, tweeting, and facebooking. I want to talk directly to you. Consider this my official request to have you. Yeah, you on the Rubin report. We're going to take a group of five viewers from five different countries and I will interview you via skype for 10 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       Posting them all as one complete episode. I want to know who you are, what you do, why you think the conversations we've been having here are important, and how you came to think the way you do together. I think we can amplify our message of conversation, human rights and secular values in an exponential way. I don't care if you're a religious atheist, Republican, Democrat, black, white, gay or straight. What I care about is, yeah, you got it. Your ideas with this in mind, joining me this week are my friend and former guests, Feisal Syeda, Al Mutar and first time guest, Melissa Chen. Feisal was born in Iraq and now lives in New York where he works with movements.org and organization dedicated to helping people escape closed societies. Melissa is from Singapore, got her phd at Mit and is the manager of the global secular humanist movement. These are two people who are using their voices to help those who need it most, and now it's time to make your voice heard. To go to Ora dot TV slash Rubin report or click the link in the description right down below and let us know why you want to be on the Rubin report. Oh, in complementing the host probably won't hurt your chances.

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       My guest this week, our feisal site on Matar and Melissa Chen, they worked together at the global secular humanist movement, a platform committed to the use of critical reason, factual evidence and scientific methods of inquiry rather than faith and mysticism in seeking solutions to human problems and answers to important human questions. That was a serious intro. You guys write a nice boiler plate there. I got to tell you. Well, I tried my best. You gave me all. Those are all the buzzwords that we talk about all the time, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And, and uh, the word committed is the most important one. Committed, committed to that. These principles, because it's very hard to be consistent these days. It is hard to because especially as you know, the, some of the folks, we conserve our allies, but they, they have their mind on Christianity and, and other stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       They changed their mind. So the word committed here is I think is the most important one. Right. So you're itching to get right into it. Get into. I want to get into a fight, but get into flow all the way from New York with. Yeah. Alright. So we're gonna talk about our friend of course. Of course. A Pfizer. You've been on the show before. I have, yeah. Thank you for inviting me again. Yeah, my pleasure. So you guys work together and uh, I want to do a little bit just on your histories first. So since we've had feisal here, let's start with you Melissa. So you are originally from Singapore. I moved here,

Speaker 3:          00:04:32       but I moved here in 2004 for college. Um, worked and then went to Grad school and continue working. I love it. And I, you know, I got sold the American dream and the American ideals, I think, you know, in part it's the same thing that drew both of us here, you know, we, we, we couldn't have more different backgrounds. Phase all grew up under a dictatorship in Baghdad and he has only known war and strife his whole life, but I've had an interesting parallel childhood it Singapore where it's a benevolent dictatorship, so, you know, he grew up under those circumstances, but it was safe and, and, and very prosperous, you know, city and life there is stable.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       Yeah. So I think that people, at least in America, I'm trying to expand some, some worldly knowledge on people, but I feel like people don't really know anything about Singapore. So when you say a benevolent dictatorship, what, what does that even mean?

Speaker 3:          00:05:30       Well, it's been a single party state since 1965. One government has one party has ruled the country since, since that time ever since it's gained independence. Um, and, and they are, you know, economic freedoms are, are, are extremely well developed in Singapore, I think Heritage Foundation listed as two out of 180 on the economic freedom index. Right. But if you look at political freedom, you know, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, it's virtually nonexistent. So basically there's freedom to sort of pursue the work that you want, but not necessarily say the things that you want. It is a neo liberal contradiction in that regard because it's extremely fiscally austere, low taxes, free trade deregulation. It's all the buzzwords that, you know, the right wing economists, you know, love right by it. On the other hand, um, you know, I, I think it's sort of throwing a wrench into Milton Friedman's capitalism and freedom. His theory about, he said that economic freedom is a necessary precondition to political freedom and civil freedoms and that's not really happening. So that's really interesting. So Singapore sorta got half of it, right, because the economic part, but not the social part in the political part right now. Of course you come

Speaker 4:          00:06:55       from both of them are in my country. We got everything. So she's got one for two and you got a little bit has to do with some of the things that we did here in America. So for the people that don't know your story, give me like a two minute recap of growing up in Iraq and catches up on. Well, I mean, I was born in Iraq and I was born in Babylon and raised in Baghdad. Uh, my first year was under Saddam Hussein, the dictatorship, and then afterwards the US invasion of Iraq happened and uh, continuing with civil war, I mean, my spark for activism was kind of a mixed of because after the intervention we had the first rocket elections and I saw the rise of secretary and politics and I, since I was a young boy back then I was advocating for secular values and uh, just to prevent the rise of terrorist groups like what we have right now because I was afraid that if I want to grow up, takes over the other and that's good.

Speaker 4:          00:07:54       Not obviously go. And um, I left. So within, like the Sol was rising, I lost members of my lost. My brother lost my cousin. I was also a lot, so friends and the had to leave Iraq in 2009. Um, and actually a year afterwards I started like the pages total global secular humanist movement that eventually became one of the largest in the world. I left Iraq, I went into country close to Singapore and Malaysia and I applied for asylum, uh, through the NHCR United Nations Committee for Refugees and I got accepted to come to America. Yeah. So that 13. So that's why I wanted to have you both on together because I think it's really interesting people that come from different places and as you say on the show all the time, the idea is we talk about here transcend borders,

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       they transcend ethnicity and nationality and all of those things. So when you were there and when you were growing up, there was, did you have a political awakening while you were there? Did you realize that you couldn't say some of the things that you wanted to say in kind of stuff? Absolutely. So, um, Singapore, it late, you know, when you first entered, when somebody learns that I am from this country, they will say one or two things. The first one is I heard chewing gum is banned. I. Whoa, I heard you can't bring bubble gum into true. Yes, it is true. Every chewing gum it used to be that they've relaxed it a little so, so you can't purchase it now. Um, you can't purchase chewing gum there. It and it's for very, um, kind of silly reasons. Possibly back in the 19 eighties, you know, Singapore was, was developing economically, right. But, but you can develop really fast economically, but the people's mindsets and civility and tragedy of the common sort of mindset hasn't had not developed. So they went litter, you know, you stick your chewing gum on the doors of the trains and then it gets stuck. And so the government was like, we're not going to spend tax dollars cleaning this up so you can't handle the chewing gum. We're going to take it away.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       Wow. So that talk about it and authority. Autocratic. Yes. Really at a very micro level, like how authoritarian the government.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       Yeah. And that's, that's a good example. The second one is, you know, if one of the, the, the sort of the best gifts you can get in Singapore for like tourists to bring home that, that people usually get is a t shirt that says Singapore is a fine city and on it they're all the different fines that you can get, like you can not eat on the, on the public, the public train systems and it's just a country with very strong rule of law and all sorts of, all sorts of rules that you can't do this and you can't do that and everything under the guise of maintaining social harmony.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       No, I assume it's some level that probably works right at some level. The social, Huh?

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       We have not had, you know, radicalization of our Sunni Muslim population. Not, not as much as any other country actually I would say. And it's been largely, you know, you've had, you have Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, living very harmoniously together. We've not had any incidents. So there is something to be said about, about the methods of top down, institutionalization of social harmony. The problem is that manifests itself in sedition laws, blasphemy laws, and as recently as last year, it was used to throw a 17 year old blogger into jail for wounding the the feelings of religious people. All he did was a say some stuff about Jesus Christ and twink, at least 20 grown up adults in Singapore felt offended enough to file a police report and they threw a 17 year old and to Dale.

Speaker 2:          00:11:28       Right? So we've talked a little bit about what they've done to bloggers in Bangladesh and Singapore and you've connected me with the Bangladeshi blogger who I'm going to have on soon. These are the people that we need to be caring about more, right? Because these are the people that you guys could have been had you not left. Yeah, I mean they. I mean everyone knows like whatever one of these, one of these folks get killed or like what happened in Bangladesh

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       or do I be a good job? We know that these guys are the solution. We know that they stand for the same values. What we stand for, and we know the data, the best counter they created. The best counter narrative to extremist I the, like the Sam Harris of Saudi Arabia. Yes. He's an intellectual who has advocated for great values that in a country that is as extreme as Saudi Arabia, they wouldn't have changed the world in Saudi Arabia. That is one of the main exporter of Wahhabi ideology that killed the bungalow bloggers that, that created the Taliban, which a country that has nuclear weapons. Um, so yeah, I mean we have to, they are our best resource that we should always continue to help them as much as we can and whenever we can.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       Yeah. So when you were there and you saw this sort of authoritarianism, when did you realize, all right, if I'm gonna Express what's in me, I may have to leave.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       I started realized that in high school, um, in, in, in Singapore, many, many of the best schools, like at the top, you know, in academia, um, they were religious schools, you know, it's just like a sort of a stage of the colonial era. When the British came, it was a British colony and, and you had all the missionaries from France, from, from, from Europe. They came to set up schools to educate the locals. And so this became associated with a economics like high academic standards. So I ended up going to, you know, a methodist schools which were associated with a very high academic standards. Right. Did you grow up methodist? Yes. And I did. And I did. So, so the religious, the religious schools, where are quite a force to reckon with in Singapore and in producing graduates. And I guess I realized that, I mean this is a country that is very self enforcing in terms of political correctness.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       If you can't, you know, there's all sorts of rules and you, the reason people don't, don't do something or don't litter is because there's, there's a fine waiting to happen. So, so the motivation to, to do something or to not do something is completely extrinsic. So we're all self policing each other. And I, I sort of, you know, bought into the, the, uh, sort of ideal of the United States, the first amendment, the freedom of expression, freedom of speech because I was always that rebellious, you know, skeptic in my circle, in my religious circle and, and school, which is pretty much overlapped at that point. Um, and that's when I realized I need to get out. You really need to get out if I, if I need it to, if I want it to broaden my mind and fulfill that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       Yeah. I'm curious when you hear the phrase self policing in a place like Singapore and their self policing because of fines and sort of this authoritarian thing. So one of the things I've been saying on the short time is that we now self policing

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       ourselves in America. So it's not coming. You know, we always used to fear the idea that the government is what's going to come in and take away our Frisco. But now it's we're doing it to ourselves and what's happening in academia, which I want to talk to you guys a little bit, but when you hear that, does that make you crazy knowings from where you came? Exactly. Nineteen 84, but four people, right? It's backwards. It's something like 1984. Yeah. I mean, to be honest, I, when I, before I came to United States, I had like a very good image of what, like when I came to America, the people, especially the people who believe in St Louis with as I am the secular liberals of the, of the West with just give and I will say at first because the movement has changed. Write something on the left has changed over the last couple of years.

Speaker 4:          00:15:38       So when you moved here, I'm guessing maybe it was a little more welcoming. I mean it was, I mean it was welcoming, but I thought it would be more welcoming. I didn't know that there was this huge splits. The fact that if I can, if anybody can be advocating for same sex marriage in a, in a western country, it's totally okay. But the moment you talk about it in a Muslim country, it becomes, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I didn't know about these dynamics that when you talk about the same values that the American liberals that have cared for when you move it to a universal or another country, you would immediately be called a racist. And so when I got into that, I started getting attacked left or right, or like, oh, what I'm saying is that I support same sex marriage. And they like, oh well that is a form of colonialism.

Speaker 4:          00:16:25       And I'm like, no fucking getting made because you're saying the same thing for like the United States. And I just said that I believe that gays are humans. Even in Iraq, like I, I think they are humans. They breathe and they have the same DNA for human beings are really out there stuff. So, so like I don't really think of myself as a radical person. Like I think that I'm advocating as. But the moment you just shifted to a different culture, quote unquote, because what I found very difficult here is that because we are minorities coming from, um, the majority dominate here, so I'm a minority all the time. But when it comes to color of my skin, I'm the majority. So here in America, there is this concept of the authentic voice when it comes to minorities, is that there are these stereotypes, whether it's from the right on the left, like if you are from this specific race, these, the issues that you should care about the most in this specific order.

Speaker 4:          00:17:20       If you are a Mexican, you should care about immigration and, and so on. And if you, if you are Arab, they expect this image about, okay, he's an, he's a young man, so he must hate the west. He must be very angry against the United States about what Bush did to Iraq. And they must hate capitalism and he must all this stuff. So if you don't fit into that narrative, you're immediately going to be attacked as some sort of like uncle Tom or which is itself racist without them noticing it. Right? That's what I keep saying. They're actually using real racism because they're not judging you by what's in your mind. They're judging you by what they think of King is like rolling as a grave right now because it's like the. So, so that's actually one of the most difficult things I found over here is that how come you don't subscribe to my order date?

Speaker 4:          00:18:10       My notions of who you should be. Like I'm like I'm individually as you are and, and, and now like we can see it in the US elections in which I've seen many people on both sides I would say especially I would say on the far left who are like, how can you as a, as a black, not support Bernie or something like that. While black people have, they have, they have agency and they may rush rationally think of supporting one person over the other. Like you can disagree with them, but that's completely fine. But to say like, why is he as a black person, you don't say that about a white person, they'll say like maybe support trump, but like coming again from white people on the left see a critical race theory from like White Guilt University of California and they are suddenly now experts of race relations and what the dynamics of the Middle East are. Right? And they project themselves as being the intellectuals. So that's really interesting. And because we talked so much about the Middle East and we talk about extremism and Islam and whatever, I see a very specific reason why you get something like that. I'm curious, having left Singapore, having, you know, believing in secular values and atheism and all that, do you find some of that, that soft bigotry of low expectations

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       that we talk about? No, I don't. In fact I'm probably a beneficiary of have high expectations, right? I mean, so anyway, that joke that Chris Rock made at the Oscars with the little kids. Yeah, with the little accountants and, and you know, for some reason the, the, the Asian community was really up in arms about that stereotype. Even though it's a positive three positive stereotypes. So w, what did you feel when you heard that? That's good. Okay. So I did get into some online fights about this because again, his face all says because of your race, you know, like seemingly Asian person, you should be finding this thing offensive. You shouldn't laugh at it. You should, you know, a sale and rally against an end sort of, um, deny as stereotypes. Forgetting that this is in the context of humor. Um, and, and the same thing with what Sarah, Sacha Baron Cohen said about the little minions, like, that really blew, like even Jeremy Lin, the basketballs got into that and I think it's just, you know, I, I was asking people rhetorically like what, what happens to comedy if, if you just take all stereotypes out of it, you have to be angry at South Park.

Speaker 3:          00:20:37       You have to be angry at snl. Everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:20:40       I mean, this whole season, did you guys watch South Park this season? I mean, this whole season, I think it might've been the best season ever. Literally

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       the entire season was dedicated. Watch it. Well, there you go. So the whole season was dedicated to fighting these exact ideas. Right,

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       exactly. And, and the thing about taking a fence is, you know, I always ask people like, who creates the offense, the offense, the person who offended by the person who feels the offense, who is the one that actually created it because it doesn't happen in a vacuum.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       Right? So there's a particularly interesting notion with what you're saying because the stereotypes. So when Chris rock brought out the three, or was it three? Yeah, three. One of them was actually had a Jewish name, so. Right. So the Jewish people weren't angry, so just for people that didn't see it. So they brought out three Asian kids. One of them had a Jewish name and they were supposed to all be like accountant from price waterhouse. So they're all supposed to be really bright accounts, blah blah. But so the stereotype that they're using is a positive stereotype. The implication is, oh, these are educated kids that are going to go on and be good at math and they excel academically. Right. So when, when people were upset with you or when you said I'm okay with the humor in that the people that were upset, what were, what were they saying? Like did they feel that that's causing some sort of backlash? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       so the, they don't like the perpetuating of the model minority and they think that that sets up a standard where now every agent has to live up to that. I think they're reading too much into it. You know, it's, it's, it's just a reflection of, of stereotypes that have a grain of truth in the case of have a leg who made that joke about. He said, well, you know, this, this Oscar's is all about diversity, but what about them? Little yellow guys, you know, who, who have the little dogs? And then he paused. Everybody laughed, right? So everybody assumed that he was talking about Asians and then he said, oh, you know the minions. So the job was actually on you because you are the ones who did the stereotype thing. And, and I don't think people, they just reacted to that. They will like, oh, leg saying, you know that Asians have small, small dogs, and I was just like, well actually this is the anatomy of humor and if you don't know Ali g as a character and, and, and how he's playing off his humor, he's actually saying you're the one who

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       stereotyping. So just to be clear, he did something really clever there because he took you one way or made you laugh and then immediately takes you the other place. So you're right, it's on you,

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       on you. You're the one who stereotyped left and you thought that he meant Asian people. So

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       I think all of this is directly linked to the authoritarianism stuff, right? So you came from an authoritarian government. You were not allowed to say, you know, I'm a, I'm a free thinker in a secularist. You've, you've laid out why you can't, you know, lived under an authoritarian rule and now we see this happening here and I'm firmly, I firmly believe that we are in like some really murky waters in America right now and in the West in general. So what do we do to fight this? Well, I mean there a, I think I do my step because now it is, is coming to our lines here and it's happening over there

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and um, when it comes to what's happening over there, I mean, I think the best solution for is to support the values that I think to be on the right side of history on this battle between authoritarianism and I would include a theocratic fascism in the end, the umbrella and uh, and the values of John Stuart Mill and Jefferson and, uh, the values of, of the free man. And you think,

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       do you guys think that those are values are the left anywhere? When you think of John Stuart Mill or classic liberalism? It seems to me that that's not even a value. That really.

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       Yeah, I mean the last has shifted and the right has shifted. Like now we live in a moment. You can look at the elections, then you can see for yourself like we live in a very polarized. I mean there's, there's no discussion about everything. Like you can start by whether it's Islam or abortion or gun control or a glass of water. And one of the things like, well the things that I like because like it's like a, it's a dogma and like you can actually know someone, someone position from abortion about abortion and gun control, but ask them questions, right? Or don't like what do you think about abortion? And then you can actually know that a position on gun control, because it's like now is like this polarization of like dogmatism of the 10 commandments of the left, the 10 commandments of the riots. And so I think that both sides have kind of lost principles. I've even the quote unquote the right. I mean they are supposedly about the free market, but they want to police people's, a vagina and a job. They are not as, they're not as a free, uh, they as they claim to be. I mean they want to police marriage and marriage equality. They want to police a woman's reproductive rights and the stuff and the left one. Supposedly they'll. The guys are free speech one to how the police.

Speaker 2:          00:25:33       The sad part here, if we're jumping onto the political side of this, that the one guy who wanted smaller government, the one guy who wanted rand Paul who wanted, who's as close to a libertarian that we're going to get into the mainstream parties and I had Gary Johnson on here a couple weeks ago who's running under the libertarian ticket. Unfortunately. Good luck. Good luck for that. Unfortunately, we still don't have a legitimate, truly legitimate third party yet, but I think that after the craziness of this year, I actually think it's possible for 20 slash 20, but is that the real fault? So we focus on the left, but there was a moment that they're right. Could have said, all right, maybe this is the guy that we should listen to because he's got some of our principals and then they kicked him out after one bad caucus.

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       I think it was actually Islamic extremism. What was going on in the Middle East that really did rand Paul's campaign in the rise of Isis and, and you know, the, the havoc that was racking the refugees. It's sort of, it's sort of implicated that the United States couldn't be isolationists and the libertarian position is to just, you know, hold back. So I think that's what kind of killed. I'm rand Paul's Rand Paul said.

Speaker 2:          00:26:39       Yeah. It was interesting because when I had Gary Johnson on, I didn't know what his policy was on because

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       of the libertarian really you can, you don't have to be so like just like this and so ron everything. So when I asked him about some Middle East stuff and some foreign policy stuff, he actually did feel that there is still a role for the United States. Didn't really lay out exactly what it was really interesting. I mean with the Libertarian Party as well, as I mentioned, there's this concept of isolationism which are very strong in the. But I thing is like if you're not interested in the Middle East and Middle East is interested in us, but what happens in the Middle East doesn't. It's not Las Vegas. Like what happens in Iraq doesn't stay in, even though we have the same mother between Vegas and Iraq, but one thing that does, that's, that doesn't stay over there. And uh, and that's one thing is Islamic extremism and I mean because one of the good things about Islam and I always admitted like it is the least price that's religion and it is very universal and it always talks about universal values.

Speaker 4:          00:27:41       I mean one of the famous quotes of Prophet Mohammad in which he said, but there's no difference between Arab and non Arab except by I'm like, I think how much faithful he is. So, so that, so the, well that's universal. Except he was saying you have to convert. Yes. Religion transcend borders is that you can be a, like the values of Islam can't transcend borders. Not like a tribal religion. Let's say like Judaism is with, with Islam. So what effects what's happening in the Middle East can effect like many people who are recruiters for Isis are in the Middle East, but the recruiting on the Internet for people living in the West. But I'm failing to see how you see this as a positive thing because it isn't that showing why it's spreading. No, I mean a. it's a double edged sword is that it's a good thing that is not racist, but it's a bad thing that is universal, right?

Speaker 4:          00:28:30       To do that as a little more bad. But back to the isolation. The isolation is believed that if we can just secure the borders, if you can ban everybody from entering or whatever. Even the Libertarians are clinical educator because they believe in open borders as the same time reducing the welfare state. So in that way we can accept more immigrants. So yeah. How are we going to deal with that? Like with Islamic extremism rising gap with the refugees coming in with people from the West getting recruited to join terrorist groups that may actually make attacks here in the west, like Paris attacks and Charlie Hebdo and even like now some like my friend just recently came from Germany. She's a woman from Afghanistan and she said like in, in some hotels telling data are telling women not to go out at night out of fear of being harassed by the newcomers and which then ultimately just strengthens the far right.

Speaker 4:          00:29:23       Exactly. Tweeted this morning, I saw, I saw an article in Germany that at one of the public pools were allowed lot. The migrants are going to. That there were, there were a lot of men that were attacking women and children, so now they're. Their resolution is that they're going to segregate by sex, so you know, weird way now the government came in and the most sort of the thing that religion would want the most. Now we're going to separate men and women and guess what? When people aren't having sex as Bill Maher would say that sort of fertile ground for extremists or extremism. I think the horseshoe theory is like one of the best way to play and sex is like not. Not also. They also theater is like how much they feed into each other is that the more people say that there is no problem with Islam, the more people on the far right will be getting more powerful because whenever, because there's a correlation between the rise of terrorist attacks and the rise of far right groups, another sunrise grows, but the need for them to get mobilized and like people like trump or people like the edl and defense league or a material upon the fronds that when the Paris attacks happened, that moment is like, let's get mobilized.

Speaker 4:          00:30:26       Let's, let's, uh, we're losing our way of life and, and stuff. So I mean this is one of the biggest issues, and we were talking about it a few days ago, is that with the rise of the far right, when they start quote unquote killing Muslims, I'd want attack Muslims and all of that. They're not all that. They're attacking people who look Muslim as well there. I mean, I, I don't have no one's Hashtag on my face saying I'm a Muslim, but even I'm not going to advocate for attacking Muslims either. I mean, my parents are Muslims, but I grew up with Muslims, I love many of them, but I don't want. So what's happening is that when people do not acknowledge the problem there is these guys are going to be and they're going to be attacking six and they're going to be attacking anybody who looks Brown.

Speaker 4:          00:31:03       Right? So that's the problem is that there absolutely are true racist, right? There absolutely are true bigots. And by the way, that's why I had Tommy Robinson on my show. I don't agree with everything he says and I don't fully understand everything about what's going on in, in the UK and Europe, but I'm trying to learn and I know he had tried to, at least from what I understand, separated himself from some of the more racist elements of the EDL and some of those organizations. So I thought it was worthy of a conversation. But I think this is a good segue to something you said earlier. So a certain in Singapore, a certain amount of authoritarianism. It sounds like it made people coexist and is that sort of on the surface? So is that sort of a, it's a very, like you got to thread that needle really carefully, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:42       Um, you know, it, it, it ultimately, it's, it's a political philosophy question. And also what is the purpose of government, right? Is it, is it to maintain the most stable society? Is it to raise the standard of living of most people? And do the ends ultimately justify the means because to get there, you know, their, for example, like we in 2007 we've had, have you make racist comments on your blog, you can be jailed. Um, so you're not free to, to, to make these comments and how, how else does that manifest? Right? So in the United States, anybody can say any racist thing they want, um, you'll never be thrown into jail for that anyway.

Speaker 4:          00:32:24       You might be booted off twitter, but also, I mean the word racist, I mean, it could be perceived as racist, can get you in jail. There's a subtly, what we probably all know what racism is. It could be something that they say like, oh, because people could be something that,

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       no, absolutely it's a good racism for me, but the sedition and blasphemy laws essentially protect also the criticism of religion, religious institutions from often very necessary criticism, right? It's like I can't even go there. You can't critique and, and it, it creates that climate where where people just don't question because they're afraid and they don't talk about. They just, they're a decent safe spaces right now. Let's not go talking about. I'm talking about religion. We can't, we can discuss racism very well in Singapore. It's a very sensitive. Let's not talk about it. So people tread on eggshells and, and I mean it's funny because I feel like I sort of escaped that. That scenario, like the right sort of top down, government instituted curtailing of the freedom of speech come to theu , s and slowly on campuses. What starts happening is now the left asking for the same thing the students are asking for safe spaces. What you said about the segregation in Germany, right? Essentially that's what religion is doing is creating a safe space between men and women. Yeah. So like what phase also at the horseshoe theory does come together, you know, let the left and the right extreme left the effectively are kind of achieving the same result.

Speaker 4:          00:33:54       But also like worth mentioning about like Singapore even like I can't believe I'm actually from Asia. I'm actually on the same continent and Asia and I'll try to keep that in mind. I'm judging you for now is that within a eastern cultures there is a lot of sense of collectivism and the and the concepts of tribalism that makes it easier for leaders to tell them like the philosophy of Buddhism and Confucianism that there's others respect to the leader and like, so like I said, it's generally like a culture of self in China is like a. so, so what's happening is that is open to people like when they talk about change in the Middle East and things of that sort and Jolene, eastern culture, you will see that you don't need to create a critical mass because you don't need to check most of individuals because it's a collective culture.

Speaker 4:          00:34:41       If you change the leader and the leader telling people to look at Iraq for example, within, if you look at the history of rock the last 50 years, you'll see 50 years ago women were free and some places are in Europe, you know, and the moment that the leadership change, they killed some civil society activists and stuff. The moment everybody start worshiping and then, and, and, and so on. So did you see, uh, I'm trying to interrupt, but did you see this meme about a, there was about 30 women from different countries, you saw this, 30 women are 50 women, may be from different countries at mostly Arab countries or at least Muslim majority countries showing what their, what their actual dress, the indigenous dress that is supposed to be in. It's all vibrant and they are free in their clothes and it says it's not supposed to be this.

Speaker 4:          00:35:27       And then they show with one of the things that like what ideology of [inaudible] and our hub is in what's called used to call himself. I'm not the web, it's called himself a Muslim reformer that he wanted to make all the Muslim world homogeneous and that's part of some of his success because they're appealing to this concept that Oh, we all have different than humans and a different cultures and stuff, but yet all my bringing all of you under one caliphate all under one ideology and all of them I need to order the same address and all. Many. And it's appealing to some people and not appealing to those who are cultured, but that's another reason it has been to some extent successful because it appeals to the people who want to have the collective mindset to want to be like part of one umbrella and one leadership.

Speaker 4:          00:36:12       And that's what an Arabic is called Omar, Omar, the Islamic Omar, the Arabic Omar come from, is that this concept of one leadership in one community and, and all of that. So the three of us sitting here, three secular people, atheist, right. So you grew up methodist. I didn't even know that until we sat down just now. You grew up Muslim, right? That's to some extent to where my parents are liberal, but yeah. But I grew up in a Muslim culture. Certainly in a Muslim culture. I grew up Jewish. I still consider myself Jewish, but I'm not a believer in, in a, in a magical. You don't believe in a talking donkey. I don't believe in the talking donkey or the fire. They talked to her, all that stuff and the way, you know, um, but it's ideas that brought us all here. And that's why I wanted to have youtube on together because I think that that's really interesting. It shows that these concepts are irrelevant, you know, these concepts, transcend borders and all of that stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:37:04       I really like what really interested me about sort of joining forces with Faisal, especially right now with the shift that, that he's doing with a human rights. He's focusing not just on the atheist movement or the secular movement. Well, what can we do about it? So he's now working in human rights and, and the reason I'm so supportive of that and want to be involved in that is because for me, you know, I grew up in a country where I think one of the, the, the founding father of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who, who recently passed away, one of the most dangerous legacies, he's probably one of the greatest statesmen modern statesman, you know, um, ever. And he's built a country that went from third world to first world in just three decades. It's a feat that, I mean, it's, it's amazing what he's done for the country, but I'm, on the other hand, he sort of legitimize this term which kind of bothers me is he says that it's called Asian values that because Asia, because of his history and culture, um, the western ideas of, of, you know, liberal democracy cannot apply and it doesn't fit well within the culture and he uses confucianism as a bulwark against that, like what he was saying about collectivism and, and so it sort of pits, you know, the West Western ideas and it says, oh, it's invalid here.

Speaker 3:          00:38:27       It can work here. And to me that is cultural relativism. You know, it, it violates human rights. Like it's not, it's not consistent with this saying he saying sort of be free but not that free because that's sort of what will undermine what we've built. Well they are re, they legitimize their able to legitimize repressive policies under the guise of Asian values. It's almost like exceptionalism. Like you know, we prioritize social harmony and prosperity over individual freedom and this is our culture. So, so our policies fit that. And I think for me that was what was very dangerous about that idea and you start seeing it being replicated in Russia, like Putin's doing that. Um, I see Jinping and China and they're taking the leaf out of his book now and creating almost like parallel alternative to western democracy. And part of that, again, it

Speaker 4:          00:39:23       goes to the way we see Europe having so many problems right now and we don't see those problems in Russia. Right? I mean certainly the immigration stuff, we don't see that in Russia. And because of that then it makes probably the average European, it makes poodle look kind of good even if they don't like. But also it's worth mentioning that Russia is not a country worth immigrating to. So they want somebody who's a refugee himself. He wanted to go somewhere warm, totally warm. But I want to have a country that is probably different than where I come from. It does. But authoritarianism is that I'm in Europe. I mean obviously it's much better economically and much better socially that makes less people. But, but yeah, I mean when you have an open border policy that's, I think Germany would probably have it and the net not a very strong vetting system you're going to have because as I said, there was the rise of far right and Islamic terrorist attacks and if we are not going to support the reformers and the liberals are trying to change the things in the societies because I mean I, I wrote an article about the Syrian refugee crisis and one of the main issues is that there is no solution to Syrian refugees going to keep coming.

Speaker 4:          00:40:34       Yeah. So if you're not going to find the solution over there, then it's, this issue is going to continue all the time. So not always serious and as obviously it's Libya has also having a problem at the opiate and all the other countries in the region and obviously Iraq since a long time. But the, we're not going to find solutions over there. So other than just like a focus on domestic issues. That's where like libertarianism fails because it's always deals with the refugees are coming in. But how can we reduce the amount of refugees that are coming in for that region that's by not subtly motor intervention, but at least being on the right side of history and being with the people who support the values that reduce the amount of revenue. Right. I suspect that most libertarians would say somebody like Rand Paul would say, well, I wasn't for the Iraq war, so I didn't add to the chaos.

Speaker 4:          00:41:21       Right. It's irrelevant now because here we are now. But that is not enough. I mean, this concept of like, well, but I'm not a racist is not enough to two different things. Yeah. And, and, and I mean people talk about the numbers and stuff. I met Saddam Hussein killed hundreds of thousands of people. If they did not intervene, there will also be hundreds of thousands of people killed. So, so just because saying, oh, I'm against the war, doesn't somebody make him a good person? You know what I mean? I mean, I'm talking about practical solutions for. I mean, the war happened and we have to deal with it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:52       Yeah. So that's a great segway to sort of what you guys do because you know, what you do with movements and what you guys are doing together. We have to empower these voices. Um, so just a few weeks ago I had someone on the show from Iraq or I, well, I guess we can give her first name, at least for now. So we had moved on the show and she's a secularist and atheist. All the things that we all stand up for her, she's a minority within a minority. Um, I, we can't get into the major details of what's going on with her right now. But suffice to say that you're helping facilitate some of this stuff, but these people are completely ignored. Exactly. And they're ignored by the people that should care about them the most.

Speaker 4:          00:42:33       Exactly. And, and, and the fact that this has no, I mean it's been what, 15 years since nine slash 11 happened and it's been the same mentor over and over again that there's no policy change of who exactly the people we should start with. And we have a country like Saudi Arabia as our ally and we have Qatar that I recently discovered funds the Muslim Brotherhood, which is using slave labor by the way, to build a cub stadium to actually like I want to raise this point, which I think is very important. I the Muslim Brotherhood is actually much more dangerous than the ideology of Islam is because they are able to work on the grassroots level and also they have double faces. And what's happening is that they want to say hopefully traded the US government because at that may say made me sound like a fucking lunatic. But they have a lot of people say it though, but there have been places in in think tanks and all the shows everywhere that told, told the Western world that they, that these other guys, the secretaries and stuff are traitors and they're not the good guys and we should help us.

Speaker 4:          00:43:35       So that kind of have a block for, for a large. For Charles like Al Jazeera and they have kind of block this concept of secular Arab. It was like they wanted to push this image of the authentic Arab of the person who, so this is, we are Islamists and we'll have to settle with it while in fact, my policy and I want to change is that we should change what we need to settle what we are asking us to subtle when I should not settle with Islamic jihadist. We have to support those who agree with our values. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:44:05       Does all of that ring as true to you as it does to me in terms of that we're skipping a step here. We're, we're skipping caring about the right people because of all, for all the wrong reasons, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:18       Yeah, absolutely. Um, I, I think it's, it's sort of extremely symptomatic of, um, sort of criticism now that that's happening in, in the left. And, uh, I, I, you know, the, the, the problem with that also is, is that it's created like a vacuum where, where you have like people like trump who was coming in and inciting inciting so much hate against these people and blanketing, blanketing all Muslims and, and that's just feeding, that's just feeding the ends up eating the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:44:53       Right. And you come from the academic world. I mean, as I mentioned at the top of the show, you got your phd at Mit. Oh, you're on your way to your phd at Mit in genetics, right? So you, you know, your stuff, you're in the academic world. Do you see this? I think one of the people, one of the things people struggle with, is this coming more from the students or the academics or is it, is it both? It's

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       more coming from the students for sure. Uh, I would say that I'm on campus at Mit. We haven't had that much incidents, but over over the, you know, the t stuff at Harvard, um, we had had way more, way more incidents like recently the last, the law school had to change. I think they're wanting to change their, their, their crest because it features three bushels of wheat. Um, and, and they're also like house masters now I'm at the dorms. They, they've lost their titles, they're called Dean faculty assistance or something. So, you know, the question becomes what happens to your master's degree or like master of the universe, like, you know, just words like that, you know, I, I posted something recently about like in chemistry, they, you know, the, one of the greatest achievements in the last couple of months was that they actually created a new synthetic element that stable.

Speaker 3:          00:46:07       So we add it. We completed the seventh row of the periodic table. And, and in the article they called it a manmade elements, right? And they had to change. So they had to change the word manmade because people took a lot of offense at the word. They said, Oh, you know, this is, uh, it's, it's, it's excluding women. It implies, you know, implies that it's the Patriarchy who's involved in this. But, you know, in Latin, the word madness, his hand and man mean it doesn't really come from man. Oh. So the entomology entomology is, you know, I mean people take offense firsts and, and that's the first reaction. So I was telling face all of this many times. The problem with what's happening, you know, in, in the regressive left movement is, is, uh, this desire to see the worst in everybody. For example, Matt Taylor, the Rosetta Scientists, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       Who landed up the comment, uh, the probe on a comment, um, he wore a shirt, you know, inappropriate for an interview. But the first instinct is to assume, can you tell people what the shirt was? Just this shirt had, um, it was like a tessellation of like pin up girls with guns or something. It was a cartoon. It was, it was actually a gift from a female artist friend. It was just a silly, silly shirt. It wasn't very graphic at all. It was, it's, you know, I mean, I wouldn't wear it. But, um, uh, and, and he wore that, you know, announcing the, um, the triumphant achievement of his team and, and immediately just the, the outcry online forced him into tears when he had to apologize. And, and I don't know how you make the leap from guy wearing shirt to just infer. I mean like if I feel like a big part of this is wanting to see this rate, this racist, sexist, whatever it is, intent, the moment you catch something that may be, you know, can be interpreted that way. They interpret it in the most extreme way. And then the reaction starts there. And then the whole outrage, I'm industrial complex begins online. Um, and then, and then after that, it's a cycle, right? Like there's that little thing, you find it and then blow up and then the people will criticize the blow, the people who are bitching about the bitching and then, you know, it's just a cycle.

Speaker 4:          00:48:36       Yeah. So what do you guys make of that mind reading portion of this? Because psychoanalysis, phds are being thrown around everywhere. Well, because when I, the first episode of the show is you guys know what I had Sam Harris and he said something about the mind reading. They want to just find something in you, which is exactly what you just said. And once they can find the green of something, now they can extrapolate it into every which way that they want to judge you, which you sold the reverse, I think of how rational people actually operate and how evidence based people and people of science

Speaker 3:          00:49:07       that can also just compassion that that is supposedly part of liberalism, right? It should be one of the things that we aspire to is to actually see the best in people. I don't know, but that's just me.

Speaker 4:          00:49:17       Yeah. I mean I don't think it's just one of the things that make me sad because like this outrage requires energy, right? So I wish that some of. I mean I'm not trying to trivialize that experience or whatever they may think of me, but I wish some of that outrage and all these hashtags would be used to advocate for people like Lupe. Now for people like Ryan, for people who are like, I wish that energy of so much out of. I mean if they get offended by a Halloween costume, I wish they got offended by a woman getting acid thrown in their faces by the Taliban in Pakistan. I was offended by bloggers getting beheaded and in Bangladesh like I wish that some of that energy and not like tell them not to talk about this stuff, but I wish some of that energy at least like maybe just 10 percent.

Speaker 4:          00:50:04       I'm not really asking for much like I like 10 percent is pretty good. This is lower than the taxes of trump and 10 percent if they just use some of that outreach, some of that energy and it creates a movement at least of solidarity. I don't want them to donate a million dollar or billion dollar. Just a moment of solidarity. They show that we people in a free societies side with the values you side with and that. I mean for me when I was living there, that's meant a lot to me and when people told me that I want to replicate that to help the folks over there who did that sense of solidarity. And again it doesn't. It show rick and tee shirt doesn't achieve a certain level of narcissism to. Because it seems to me that when they do this they're just saying why can't blame everything on myself?

Speaker 4:          00:50:50       And now that's a problem they want, you know what I mean? If they can't link America, there's something, it's not even a problem. So that also seems to be a bit of the. And that is, I mean look at like many of the definition of racism is power plus privilege, right? Is it getting it right? Prevalent? They, they because they look. So for example, racism, they redefined racism. So racism is no longer about people hating of people of other races, but rather it is who are the people on the privileged side. So. So it has to be. So at the top of the pyramid we talked about last time, there is a cisgender white male. He's worse than Isis. And so then there's probably isis because they're brown. Mel's probably the, the social media guys are mostly white but, but uh, but the other side is like a pyramid and the top of the pyramid is white smell and they think he is the biggest problem.

Speaker 4:          00:51:45       So ironically what they're saying actually is that you as an Arab, as Arab landscape man, you could not be racist against me or against me. But I know that someone of that, an Asian person is probably lined up, it's very sort of right next to white privilege so that you, even if you were endorsing white genocide, wouldn't be viewed as racist because you were being oppressed and that has been actually like there was this case, I think it was in Goldsmith University in which one of the students was talking about a genocide, this stock white genocide. And then she said, this is my way to surprise my grievances. Yeah. Because there's no other way to get more creative then. And then she said this is, this is not actually racist. What I was talking about because I am a from, except the fact that she lives in London, she's under privileged and she's trying to suppress our grievances against the people from the upper class.

Speaker 4:          00:52:46       This last night in the debate, didn't Bernie say something about how white people don't know what it's like to be poor? I mean, something of that effect. I mean, I did not watch the debate because I was out. But uh, I saw this coach has been circled. Yeah. And because they, they, they will say, well mean some of the concept, I mean I, I'm, I agree with some of the, with it's called intersectionality. I mean it may accept the fact that many people who say it are crazy nut jobs because it has a good concept is that the people who are, for example, block have less likely to get jobs because of their names. So, so it is difficult if you are a block to raise to middle class then if you're otherwise tries to America. So there is some truth to this. But what is happening is that it is mixed up with so much baggage of bullshit that doesn't make sense anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:53:37       Just like when the, when the far right talk about we should be fearful of all of these things. Things except the fact that some of infiltration of the Muslim Brotherhood, all these things like because there are so insane about so many other things that like whenever there's a shooting, Obama's trying to take our guns, you don't take them anywhere. So whatever they say. So what's happening with intersectionality and the people on the far left. Some of what they say is through third is that there are people who are, because of the rights of men, there are studies done even based upon the name, like if people who have like different names, if they sound for it and whatever, they are less likely to get employment. So yes, there is a sense of when somebody is tired to bullshit us, so then they extrapolated into gaze for Hammas and then.

Speaker 4:          00:54:16       Yeah. Yeah. Which is valuing. Yeah. So, so that is what that is where like the, like a huge bag of bullshit is that when all of these like intersectionality and critical race theory, critical old, literally start defending people that would have, you can because under the name they are a minority and all of this eventually gets like, it's like the destructive when it's all this stuff mixed together. So as three people here sitting here, that all came at different points in our lives. So I'm a, I'm a third generation American. Uh, you guys are first generation but different skin colors and that, all of that stuff, we're putting it out there. We're not fooling anybody. Uh, you sort of touched on this earlier, but American exceptionalism, do you believe in American exceptionalism? Because I get all right. I do, I do too. But

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       tell me why I like this quote by Bill Clinton and he said whatever is wrong in America can, can be fixed by what's rights in America and as a stance now before the elections, I can say that with a straight face. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I've always been a free speech absolutist. Um, and I think it's, it's something that's just, if human dignities to be upheld, we should be free to express ourselves. That's just always a basic human right. Um, and there is no other country other than the United States that upholds that resolutely. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:55:39       so doesn't that directly correlate to everything you do as a secularist and know what it was like to not be able to express all those freedoms? And the reason I prefaced it by saying that we're all different races and all that is that we all have the same opportunity here. Right? Exactly. Exactly. But, but people don't lift, don't like, if you say American, do you believe in American exceptionalism? That's a good question. Actually. I haven't thought about it that I'm putting you on the spot here. Now we're going to get the left to hate you even more. Yeah. Well, I, I think honestly that good job interview, but I think I do. I mean it's really depends on what you mean by it. People from all over the world. I mean, I live in New York City and uh, I can see people from tons of living together for the most part peacefully and trying living under one system, one umbrella.

Speaker 4:          00:56:30       Yes. I mean, I think it's a wonderful idea. I think America itself is a wonderful idea is that despite the fact that obviously the history of it was not as beautiful as it as I wish it to be. But I mean Jefferson, who was one of my heroes called America, the kind of experiments is that let's put these values and see how they work together. I think for the most part to a great experiments that this concept of the new world of, of the, of the American constitution is that one of the first documents I was translated when I was in Iraq and trying to suppress the flyers around was the bill of rights of the United States. For me it's like my Bible is like one of the most important because during the time that it came from obviously, I mean now we take it for granted.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       People say like freedom of speech. It's a human life. But before this concept of, of separation of powers and separation of church and state. So for me like the most important things about the American constitution, these are used to be radical ideas back at the time and established this nation of from people all over the world. And here we are. I don't think this. This kind of happened in medical news around the plant and the three of us from different parts of the wall to have a different culture or background can come together and have a discussion about ideas. And that's, that's the power of ideas. And I love that you brought up Thomas Jefferson in this because about a year ago I was at cello, which was his home. He Got Regina. Yeah, that's great. And it's a great place and they tell his story and it's really interesting because progress takes time so that they taught, he looked.

Speaker 4:          00:57:54       This is a man who owned slaves. Not only did he owned slaves, he had relations with at least one, I think several of the women. So he was in effect having sex with his slaves. So obviously something's not. I mean that's not right on many in terms of slavery and women's rights and a zillion reasons, but at the same time he was doing so much good for the country and so many of the ideas he had lead to goodness. So it shows that not everything is through that kernel of evil. You want to find the goodness in people.

Speaker 3:          00:58:22       Yes, but and, and, but there is a trend nowadays to apply modern moral framework to look at the past and you're starting to see that with Oxford Rhodes must fall campaign and things like that. We're looking back into the past and now faulting, you know, leader, certainly in the history, um, for, for views they had. So

Speaker 4:          00:58:42       how dangerous do you think that is as someone who's sort of in the academic world? I mean, I, I find that to be incredibly dangerous. We're going to look back on everybody one day as, as culture changes. We're going to look back on everybody and go APP that. Well see he was a homophobe right? Yeah. Although I think he actually said something that I should be able to get married or something to that effect. We will be able to do that to everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:59:04       Yeah, it, it, it's, you know, starting on campus. Right? So what Joel Wilson School, and I'm at a university there, they're debating removing his name. Um, the question is again, it ultimately comes down to why do you feel like that helps, you know, is it, is it something that's a personal, it doesn't feel like a personal attack. And, and if we, if we weigh out every single person with that kind of moral calculus, you're not gonna you're really not going to find any. Um, uh, any ideal person, uh, in the past, right, right.

Speaker 4:          00:59:40       There's literally nobody, and that's why I keep saying the left just eats itself. I've seen this over and over. Unless your APP. Look, we can see the way sometimes even with Bernie, they've turned on Bernie a little bit with some of the race issues with black lives matter and it's like here's a guy who was arrested in the, in the sixties, you're standing up against segregation and things like that. So it's like you have to have a better set of principles than something that'll just come around and get you on day. Yeah. They also talk about history. I mean they're also nice to look at the context and the timing. I mean if, if Jefferson wanted slavery to be part of the United States, he will have written into the constitution. So obviously, I mean the guy was sophisticated enough that it takes time to understand what diverse in.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       But yeah, when it comes to mind reading, this seems like a pretty good over there. Yeah. It also shows, I guess that we have personal short falls that you can somehow maybe in the public be better than you are personally. Right. So he's writing all of these things about equality for man clearly led the groundwork for you, the slaves, right? Yeah. And yet at the same time, at the personal level he didn't. So yeah, certainly component. You're talking about an hour, like bringing the conversation to global. Is that like for example, like as I work in the human rights field, I mean I would be honest like for starch in Saudi Arabia, I'm not going to advocate for same sex marriage, but our advocate, the concept that gays are human beings equal equal rights and then you can build a foundation that over time, of course, I mean I, I saw Mike based upon many of Jefferson's readings and, and back to the eight, the life eating itself is like, there was this congressman, he's also was a civil rights icon.

Speaker 4:          01:01:17       Lewis. His last name is Louis. I forgot who endorsed Hillary Clinton. John Lewis. John Lewis. Yes. So I'm in. I, I'm not, I cannot avoid this election shot. I can bash any candidate I want, so what happened when he endorsed Hillary? But if somebody I agree with or don't, that's irrelevant. The amount of attacks that he got from the far left was pretty impressive about how they are anti racist. They were calling him pretty racist terms, uncle Tom and word and overall all of that because he endorsed a candidate they didn't like this is itself the LF eating itself because they supposedly and direct service, but there is still on their side of the ticket. Yeah. There was a quote from Fdr that I really like. It was. He asked him why do you support the fascist in Nicaragua? He, they said he's a son of a bitch but is our self.

Speaker 4:          01:02:06       So, so if, if, if, uh, Mr Lewis and drove the car day like that, he is okay. That is what that black person should vote for. But if not, then he is thing to talk about. Uh, they, they claim to be. I mean there is a new term called the entire racists racists, which is interesting. Yeah. And I have double negative but, and also have to work this through at home. And also there's the Islamophobia phobia of the fear of being perceived as Islamophobic is, is now selected. They are afraid of being perceived as level four, a big advocate for as low phobia. I, there's no doubt that that was all right. We have to wrap up here. So I'm going to give you the last word. What can we do? What is the number one thing we can do to help these ideas spread?

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       So what Phase I was saying about the outreach he wishes to divert the, the, the, the outrage manufactured by all these small little incursions into global issues. Um, I think that's actually something that he's working on on movements and it's a very worthwhile cause because with that we can engage people who do live in western democracies to be more active and to be more aware of the perspective of what's going on with the persecution that's going on in closed societies. So that's for me very. I'm a very key thing.

Speaker 4:          01:03:23       Yeah. And while we have our power of freedom, we may as well use it. Right. Alright. Well I have a feeling we're going to continue this in the green room because we barely. I didn't even pick this thing up. All right. Uh, well for more of the work that Faisal and Melissa do, check out the global secular humanist movement on facebook. Go to movements.org. And thank you guys for watching. I will do it again next week.
