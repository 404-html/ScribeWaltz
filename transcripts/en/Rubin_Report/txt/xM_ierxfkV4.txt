Speaker 1:          00:00:05       One of the things we consistently talk about here at the Rubin report is why it's important to judge people as individuals and not as a collective. You as an individual are much more than your immutable characteristics be at your skin color, your religion or your sexuality to judge you on those characteristics is actually what the essence of prejudice really is. Prejudice of course means to prejudge, so if you look at a black person or a Muslim person or a gay person and think that you know what they think, or more importantly how they should think based on those characteristics, then you are actually the one who's being prejudiced. Sadly, many of the people who accuse others of bigotry and racism these days are often the people who practice this brand of prejudice the most without even realizing that they're doing so. Just look at some of the things that my friends Larry elder, my [inaudible] and Ion Hirsi Ali or called by the so called tolerance side.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       When you look at a group of people and you think you know what they should think or what's best for them based on those outward characteristics and now what's going on in their own minds. You not only lock people into your preconceived notions of what they are, but stifle the voices of the minorities within these minorities. This is why the voices of black conservatives and gay Muslims, for example, are so relevant and interesting today. If you really listen to these minorities within the minorities, you will judge these people on their thoughts, their logic, and their reason instead of simply how they look or who they love. In a way, the very existence of BS freethinkers within these minority communities, flips identity politics on its head, showing the flaws of this postmodern intersectional way of thinking. Just see how quickly those who preach identity politics turn on black or Latino people who have conservative political beliefs or how easily they dismiss gays are women who dare talk about how poorly they're treated in Islamic societies.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       Identity. Politics only works if you believe that the most important quality about each of us are the attributes which we are born with thus cannot change rather than the ideas which we come to learn. I view this twisted ideology as a true existential danger for the tolerant and Liberal, albeit flawed country that America is Martin Luther King, Jr's desire for his children to be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin is being undermined by the very people who purport to be the tolerant ones. We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty today and joining me is the CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, Johnny c Dot Taylor. The organization represents nearly 300,000 students who attend the 47 historical black colleges in America today. I heard Johnny speak at an event in Dallas a couple months ago and was blown away by his passion, his commitment to educating young people and his desire to move past identity politics. We're going to talk about politics, race, and much. Has

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       the role of the Black College changed as we've become a more fair injustice society. That's just one of the many questions I'll ask johnny and I'll only judge him by the content of his answers, not the color of his skin.

Speaker 1:          00:03:17       We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty today and joining me is the president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, but the only national organization representing the nearly 300,000 students attending America's 47 historically black colleges. Johnny c Dot Taylor. Welcome to the Rubin report. So glad to be here. I gotta tell you man, I and I just did tell you, but now I'll repeat it. Since the cameras are on you. We've been doing this thing with learn liberty for a little over a year or so and they've sent us some great authors and professors and thinkers. I've never requested anyone. User are the first person I requested because I saw you speak a couple of months back at a conference for academics. Had to do a lot about free speech and liberty and all sorts of things and you gave the keynote address on the final night and I thought, this guy is possibly the most passionate speaker I've ever seen in my life. Thank you. Where does that passion come from? Well, let's start there. Before we even talking about what you do, just the passion that you had. I was just like that. I got to get that guy on the show.

Speaker 2:          00:04:17       See, it's interesting. I spent my career in the entertainment space, the media space, paramount pictures, spelling, entertainment, blockbuster entertainment. So all of my life was doing that kind of stuff, making money, right? But I always had this yearning for the community and how higher education could play into him. Sort of fixing what was going on in my community. And I say the community, I mean all of Americans, but particularly African Americans. And there were so many conversations that didn't occur, weren't allowed to occur. And so I took this new role at the Thurgood Marshall College Fund representing Black Colleges. I didn't attend a black college. Um, I often say I'm a beneficiary of it because so many of my teachers and doctors and lawyers did, but I didn't, my parents didn't attend a black college, but I thought this was such an opportunity to come in and really begin to influence how young people are, our future leaders, how they think about the world and then to challenge them. My legal education by definition sort of taught me to challenge the status quo, to be able to argue both sides or in some instances three sides of any argument. And so that's where it came from. I really, I, I don't sleep at night sometimes thinking about where America is headed and that's where the passion comes from. I'm genuinely concerned about where we're going.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       Yeah, I feel that too. And we kind of hit that a little bit before and now we've got to do it all over right now. Um, tell me a little bit more about your resume before we get to what you've been doing these last couple of years because yeah, you just mentioned some of that stuff. I mean, you've got a pretty prime. Your linkedin has got to be pretty fat, less on what, like eight pages that God is good. But tell a little bit about that because I

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       think it does form Sorta, you know, how you end up sitting across from me here. So I began my career. Well, let me back up. I did the undergraduate work at the University of Miami. I'm a born and raised in Florida, so I'm the. You got to give him a shout out to my school. Um, in any event. I finished school, went to law school in Iowa at Drake University. I came back to south Florida to practice at a big law firm. Janet Reno was one of my, was the first female partner. So I'm dating myself and takes your way back. And then began my practice, sat on a plane one day, melt, met A. I did not know at the time of billionaire Wayne Highs, Zynga who had this small little business called blockbuster that he was building. I went in as the third lawyer on staff and literally we went through this huge acquisition spree and you know, you remember blockbuster was on every corner.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       It's the biggest so did that. Viacom bought us, so I've spent my time as a lawyer, as an hr executive and then ultimately once by combat us and worked for sumner at Viacom, Sumner Redstone, and then uh, my last corporate gig was running a business, a subsidiary for Barry Diller in New York. So I literally have had all of the back office functions and then ran frontline operator running a business for Barry, came to TMC in 2010 as the CEO. So you've been doing this for now about seven years and you're actually about to shift into something else which will, which will get to a little later, but tell me a little bit about what the scholarship climb to actually does. What is the purpose? Because I know a certain amount of people, because I know a lot of your thoughts on, on the diversity memo and all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:07:27       It almost sounds counter to what the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund might do. Right? So the, the college fund was actually created by the way we were created as the Scholarship Fund Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund about a decade ago. We changed the name to broaden the remit to the college funds, so it's Thurgood Marshall College Fund and we really only do four things scholarships. We provide scholarships for the absolutely most talented students, so this is not sort of a social services feel good for kids who didn't get a shot k through 12. These are the brightest kids who frankly just have money problems they need, so scholarships that are needing and sort of need and merit based. Then capacity building. We've talked with our schools a lot about. There was a time when HPC use captive market. If you were black and you want to go to college, you attended a black college. Well, everything changed.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       Be careful what you pray for it. We asked for diversity, we got it. We asked her integration, we got it, and so now black students have options and so black colleges, historically black colleges have got to step up. So the second thing is to build their capacity to be attractive. The third thing that we do as governmental affairs, I mean a lot of abic advocacy and policy work to make sure that we're not making emotional decisions. We want to do what is good for our communities and what's good for this country. Those are really the three things that we focus on as, as a fund and that's the work that we do and the thing that most of the folks frankly don't realize is historically black colleges are not ebc. They're not exclusively black colleges. In fact, for currently four of our member schools are majority white, really majority white.

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       So they are still historically black colleges because the hbcus historically black, not necessarily currently blank. So West Virginia State and Bluefield State College, both in West Virginia, Lincoln University in Missouri, Kentucky State, uh, these are schools that while technically are not technically are actually hpc use are, have more white students than black students. And those are some of the things that people don't understand. This is not about race per se. How much battling is there over what it means to be historically black versus currently diverse? Because I would imagine you've got, you know, ideas and academics and administrators who were probably pretty entrenched in keeping things, just looking at it by numbers, not necessarily diversity of thought that's and all that. So you must be dealing with that constant. Oh, you have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       That's ugly. And it's interesting because I'm surprised, and I know we'll talk about some of this, but I'm surprised at the number you'd like to think millennials, you know, we think millennials and we group them in and they're open and they're diverse in there. Well, I was surprised we've had some students really not faculty, not alumni, but students, 18 or 19 year olds take great issue with the fact that the institutions are more diverse than they were. They wanted to come to an all black institution and we get there and realize that we have international students and white students and Hispanic students. They really push back. So that's been a real surprise to me. How do you break through that? Well, you continue. First of all, you explained to them that Hbcu is not ABC. Then you start with that and you also then explain, I find myself oftentimes when I'm talking to them saying, let me just put yourself in this situation. So just recently one of our campuses, one of a group of students were really upset because in fact it was all over the national news about students came on the campus of Howard University wearing the make America great again.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       And I said, no, I just wanted the student leaders. I pulled to the sadness. I don't want you to just for a second to ask me, how do you think this would play out group of black students right after Obama elected go visit Liberty University's campus. They have on the wonderful Obama tee shirts where they're proud of this new president and they were literally run off of campus. They were threatened, they were harassed. How do you think that will go over? And so what I find myself doing is she just literally put yourself in that situation and tell me why this is that different. Um, and then you get that pause, that moment. By the way, that's what motivates me to do my work because that's the way you influence the sort of the narrative and how these young people think. You have to just stop and say, I get how you feel right now emotionally about this, but for just a second, let's flip the script and tell me how this works.

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       And you're smart, you're bright. Tell me how this works out. That's really part of what motivates me to do the work. Yeah. And that's what we need more of, right? I mean because everybody seems hysterics hysterical over, over emotional. So that's like. It's like I can understand that if I, if I was black and I wanted to go to a historically black college and I got there and I thought it was going to be 80 percent black and I got there and I was like, wait a minute, I'm, I'm actually still a minority here. The emotional part, I can understand it being like, this doesn't feel right to me, but then when you hear that and you go, well, things actually are changing. Integration is this, this is all good. This is, this is the purpose, the purpose of freedom prayed for it. I often say, be careful what you pray for.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       This is exactly what we said we wanted, is the opportunity to choose kind of what I can tell you. That's when my great grandparents, yeah. In fact, Thurgood Marshall himself for folks don't realize this. Thurgood Marshall didn't choose to go to Howard University. Law School, Thurgood Marshall. Fact of the matter is applied to the University of Maryland, was denied admission to that law school. Went to Howard because it was the college for black students and law schools for black students, and so you just have to think about it. He then subsequently brought lawsuits to actually stop that very thing. Again, this was an anti Hbcu. The message was, I want to be able to choose irrespective of my skin color where I go to school, so all of us should have predicted that we would be right where we are today. What I find is the young folks just don't understand the history and then the older people refuse to tell.

Speaker 2:          00:13:17       The honest is, so what's going on there? Because I don't believe there is so much nonsense. The media is so complicit in this. Yes. Um, I, I don't, you know, and, and identity politics has become so rooted in everything that I don't blame the young people who are misguided. Yeah. I want to get through to them and, and all that. It's the other people that you're talking about, the older people on the academics that are afraid to speak. What happened there? Did you see it change? I, I did. I saw it, you know, and, and where I, when I was in school, you were encouraged to be a little bit of a provocateur. Always respectfully. You never. There was no, no one wanted you to go out and hurt someone's feelings. But we were encouraged in law school for example, to look at things from all different sorts of perspectives.

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       I was given a case once where you'd have to represent the plaintiff and then turn around and go against, you know, defend him. So we've just lost that in education now. And then I got to tell you more and more, I'm talking to students who say, you know, I feel a certain way, but I know that if I either uttered those my thoughts even in a question format in the classroom, I'd be attacked by from my professor. It would impact my participation in class green that Po, that portion of my grade. Also. And more importantly, what do you say to kids say when they say that perhaps you're at the wrong school? I said, you got to vote with your feet. Colleges not about, it's supposed to be a time to explore and to grow. If you already knew what you needed to know to sort of live in life and be successful, then you don't need to spend five or six years and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       If you are the same person that you walked in the door at the end of your freshman year, um, then you were cheated. And I tell them, you should challenge the institution to give you a better education. And sometimes that the way you get better is to have to confront ideas that you don't necessarily embrace. You don't understand them. One situation that that sort of comes up, and I think it helps my students a lot. Understand where I come from us. It's, you know, listen, I was an employment lawyer early in my career and at that time there was a big question, for example, around whether or not gay, lesbian sexual orientation was covered under title seven. Okay. Big Question. Gender and sex was clear if you were being discriminated against on the basis of something else. That on sort of sexual orientation that wasn't covered.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       I actually brought those cases and made those arguments. I defended them, that they, she was not the intent of the congress and this was ridiculous, etc. That gender is something that's innate. You're born That way and low gay and lesbian, maybe not so much. Fast forward. Where are we? That's 1992. I think it's important that context. That's right. Put it in context. Now, fast forward, you began to evolve and grow. You start sitting down and getting to know people who are different than you are or that your family is or that you, you, you just, you began to evolve and it challenges your own notions of what is right and what is wrong and maybe you conclude there is no right or wrong here. This is just life that we're evolving as a human species, kind of even. I've had to do that and there are so many instances of that in my own life, and so when you begin to have conversations in the context of the classroom with students, you see the growth.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       That's the beautY. That shouldn't be the beauty of it. Instead, what I'm seeing more and more, david is there actually retarding the growth students. You're not encouraged to think. You come in thinking a certain way. Your professors want you to think a certain way. Your institution wants you to think a certain way, but here's the problem. The real problem is then you go to work and you have to confront the reality of you know you're not protected in this bubble. You've got to live and work next to people who don't look like you, and frankly that's a challenge. That's something that people talk about a lot. when I talk about black colleges, the only. I don't question the relevancy of hbcs. I think that's a dumb argument. It's a dumb question. There is a fair question that is posed. If you have gone to a black elementary school, middle school, grew up in a black community and then you went to a black college.

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       The first meaningful interaction that you had with people who are not black is in the workplace. You're going to be at a disadvantage just practically speaking and so you it. It has some downside, tons of upside. By the way, being a majority and a minority community. black colleges give you a very special and nurturing environment to grow in, but there's a cost to that. Yeah. Is that just the natural evolution of the way humans are, that if you have a legit grievance, you may need a different place. Or for thurgood marshall who did not get accepted to the Maryland law school, so he needed a place to go to completely legit in that time and place, but that eventually we, if a quality works, because the arc does bend towards justice, that eventually you slowly need these things less. It doesn't mean that there's no use For them, but you.

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       But a lot of people are sort of addicted to that original pain or instance or whatever you want to call it. You nailed it. I mean that. None of us. It's, it's, it's addictive. I mean, that's the problem. And Weaning yourself off of that is difficult and that's not limited to black people or any group of people. It's just that you get used to it. And this notion that we were to create. Remember even the concept of affirmative action was supposed to be remedial. It was not supposed to go on forever. Right? BuT what happens is if you get used to it and it's a benefit that a new words to you and people who look like you, um, it's really tough to one day say, okay, that's done. I have a seven year old daughter and I, you know, there's a point at which she's going to come off of daddy's credit card and she was going to fight me if it's 18, if it's 28 of his 38, the day that I decide you now have to leave the nest and figure this out yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       If it's 38, if I move in with your dog. Right. But you're right, you're onto something that, that's, um, it's even think about just in real life. that's the thing that I'm intrigued by is I could not wait until I turned 18. I could leave my nest and my mama and my daddy's house and go and start creating my own. And I'm seeing some of them for economic reasons, but just everyone's sort of staying at home and they want. It's a very different world that we live in right now and I'm intrigued by it. Yeah. How much of this also is about the family in general? That's one of the things when I've had a couple, particularly in this case, when I've had black conservatives on, you know, like larry elder, talking about the black family you just mentioned, you mentioned your mom and your dad, so I, I suspect they're still married.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       No. Okay, so that's interesting. But they were for obviously most of your childhood. Mr. How much of that structure is related to all of this? Why then you can't necessarily deal with outside influences or or any of that stuff. So I struggle with that. I struggle with that because because of the realities of slavery, the black community was always largely maternally run. Dad and mom were separated. Family, the family unit in the traditional sense didn't exist so and we were successful in spite of that. So I, I'm noT so sure that I now what I all day. I think the value of having mom and dad in the home and and frankly at some point grandparents and home to build that in that I think it's incredibly important, but I'm not prepared to say that's why everything is wrong. As I pointed out, my parents ultimately got, were divorced and all to have two sisters. We both went to college. All three of us rather were successful, have great lives. Nobody's been to jail. No one has eight kids that you know, so I don't know that I'm Prepared to say that. It's totally about

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       sort of the family unit. I think family, the one thing that I'm happy to see now, his family is being more broadly defined. We and our community oftentimes talk about it takes a village and the family could be the little old lady cross the street. If you don't know your grandmother, she might essentially become your grandma in local parentes the concept in latin that there a whole bunch of folks who act as parents to make it all happen. So I think we have to be a little too careful and I hear the strict conservatives. Well, it's all of this is because the family model has degraded as well. Historically, I'm not so sure we as a people in particular ever had that. That's not real. Yeah. I was mentioning to you before it also that I just went to george washington's estate and you can go to the slave quarters and they do a daily memorial and all that, and they talk about the men living here.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       They're living here. They sometimes only got it interacts for for minutes in a day and all sorts of stuff. Yeah, so you know, sometimes when we have to help people revisit history sometimes they're like, oh, it was great. Back in the day. Not exactly. SpeakiNg of history, I wasn't planning on going here, but as long as we're talking about this list, what do you make of all the monuments stuff happening right now? Because I just read one this week that at at christ church and I think it's in alexandria. They're taking down george the minute I think it's just a plaque actually, and I guess there was also a plaque to robert e dot lee that upset some people, so they said, all right, we're going to take down george washington's as well, George Washington, than there is no doubt he did own slaves. He freed as many as he legally could.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       When he died, not all of them more because some of them were technically, I think owned by martha or for her or her family or something like that, but as I said, they do a great memorial to them. These people, we're all complex. People who were writing law is to free people while they own people. I mean it's a whole freaking thing, but me personally, you want my answer firstly because I'm glad to, but tell me what do you think? I don't think you can take these things down. I think you can put a, a, a counter monument next to them or a plaque that explains more. Maybe you could convince me that they can all be moved to a museum where then you are going to learn about the history, but I'm very leery that there's just no ending here that we're going to take down the robert e dot lee stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       We're going to take down, You know, other confederate stuff, but he will creep to George Washington. It will creep to Thomas Jefferson. I was just at the memorial, but words that that man wrote about what freedom is. That's the stuff we should all care about and I just feared that there is no ending here. I don't know if that's enough of a justification not to take anything down, but that's really where my position is coming from. That it won't end. Well, not surprisingly, I violently agree with you. I, I, uh, I would have accepted either. Oh no, I know that would've given him, but frankly, you know, there are a couple of aha moments for me. First of all, we don't like to acknowledge this, but black people owned slaves in America too. That's real. I'm the litmus test is if you own slave somehow we should erase from history or puts you into a museum, a little box so that only

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       people who visit museums will learn about. That's why I don't really like that I throw it up there because I, in a q and a that I did at claremont mckenna, a kid asked me and I said that. He said, well, what if we put them in mind as I said? All right. We can play with that one a little bit, but to your point, if you take this to its, I think illogical in [inaudible] we didn't go through and parse every person's history and we find the one thing they did that we didn't like, which by the way at that time, at that point in the world may have been totally the norm. I'm not arguing it was good or bad. I'm just saying it was the way people lived and it was the what was the more ready, the way, whatever of the time I.

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       I struggle with this. I think you put everything into context. When I ride through and I see a confederate statue, I was laughing. I was in old town alexandria the other day. I have passed this particular this. Which one is it? I was just as robert e dot lee is the one that's sitting right in. It's just passed. I don't know the street of past king street. I think it is. There's a statute at this guy on a horse. I've passed out a number of times and thought, well, that's interesting. Um, I've also, I live in Washington dc on capitol hill and there are all sorts of these statutes that frankly charles barkley, who I don't quote very often to my impression would it dell, but he said something which was really provocative. he said, frankly, most african american people aren't thinking about that damn monument.

Speaker 2:          00:25:12       I mean, it's just, we have real issues facing our community. And the idea that we have now gotten preoccupied with these monuments is bizarre to me and frankly and more disturbing to me is that is divisive. Anytime you start peeling apart people's history, all of this is sort of the history of the country, the good and the bad. And I think that's the beauty of telling a story. And when I talk to students about it, because I've had this conversation with some of our students and I said, you know, all of us, we go back into history even to find out that your grandparents weren't perfect people. You know, the grandfather who beat on your grandmother who cheated on your grandmother. The grandmother who, well, let's say back in the day, decided not to have a kid. just had a kid out of wedlock and decide to give them to an ant and never acknowledged and was.

Speaker 2:          00:26:00       There's so many things we've ball our bodies and the notion that somehow you've literally made this person's life less important because of a decision that happened. I mean, all of us are growing on this journey called life and I just think we've gotten too serious about it and it's also frankly divided the country. A country that is way too divided right now. I mean, I've never seen. I think of martin luther king, a lincoln thurgood marshall. They have to be like sitting back somewhere looking at this hand, oh my god, I can't believe. Once we pulled the rules down, change the laws, became a more open and free society. None of us could have thought that this is where we'd end up. Yeah, and you know, the easy answer is to blame it on trump, but the fact of the matter is this started way before.

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       This has nothing I know so now, now, but I'm pretty sure some, even the. Even the nfl protests were going on under obama horse. When you talk about the historical stuff, obama, his first president, first four years was against gay marriage. now 20 years ago we got to take obama's statue or take his library down or don't even start me on that. I've got countless examples. You know, I was talking to folks at a. That was a big discussion about public schools and you know, we need to send all of our kids to public schools, synthesize timeout, timeout, timeout. The obama girls were to to go to school sidwell. I know it's not very fast for them, but then you can't turn around and say, oh, public school's a wonderful. They're great for everyone when they know the reality is they are good enough for your children.

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       Those are some of the moments when we have to stop and just pause and say, you know this. It's gotten crazy. That's the point. I mean, I'm so frustrated with it right now because we're picking apart people's lives and the reality is none of us would want someone to do the same thing on an individual level with me. you want to pick my life apart. You can come out and say, I'm a horrible person. Ignore the fact that I have a beautiful seven year old daughter that my parents were wonderful, that I'm a good son a good, but you want to focus on the one or two decisions that perhaps I would have. I'm frankly, I would have done them differently if I were 48. I was 18. So yeah, it's, it's, um, we're just in an interesting spot and I know that's what you're talking about, but it disturbs me.

Speaker 2:          00:28:19       It disturbs me in some very significant ways that I'm raising a child in this world, in this country in particular. This is not the country I envisioned it would be. Yeah. Do you think there's any chance that it actually is the country, but it's just the level of noise has gotten so out of control. So when we think about, you know, I talk a lot about social media and how twitter is affecting everybody and the way we will cater news to ourselves and all that stuff. BuT then I took all of august offline. I shut down. I was working on my book. I disappeared for awhile and when I spent more time just, I mean I talked to people for a living, but outside of this room, just talking to random people, I think most people do buy everything that you just said there and I don't think that people are necessarily as hysterical as maybe we feel they are.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       Do you think that's possible or is that. I'm just trying to give a real silver lining to this. I think you're trying to feel better because as much as we can, we can't just put the media over in a little box. Particularly. It used to be traditional media, but now social media and so when you add all of that, it really does influence the narrative and it influences what people think it means to live in America and and I do think we're in a very different place now and you're right, every person in the world doesn't know what's going on. Manafort gets charged today. The vast majority of americans don't know or care. It's people who watch the news and who read and who think about this, who, and you know, where it matters. The vast majority of americans are like, I'm trying to keep the lights on, I want to put my kid in school and I want a decent life and retire with some decent savings in a bank that's more practical.

Speaker 2:          00:29:52       So I think you're right. But the influencers, people like me and you, um, maybe not like the two of us is the more liberal media has just put it out there so far. Progressively they're really crafting the narrative and the message and it's, it's, it's something that we have to pause. Do you find yourself with a political home? Because obviously I'm in a lockstep with so much of the things that you're so many of the things that you're talking about. When I heard you give that speech, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean 20 times I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Um, do you, I mean, do you consider yourself, are you in a party or totally independent? So or as when I was in North Carolina, it was called unaffiliated. That was the phrase you wanted an independent because there were independent.

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       So that was the, a third party. So it's unaffiliate. I was a democrat for years and actually quite as it's kept up was a big part of hillary clinton's 2008 campaign, a raised tons of money. Had her in my home. Fundraisers had erskine bowles and his wife. I mean I was like really, really into that world. I did not see that in the research. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm literally hosted in my home in North Carolina and did a lot and then fast forward, I've become this last election, frankly less enamored. So I was not involved in that campaign. I also wasn't a involved in donald trump's campaign. I just have decided that I'm going to have to figure out where I fit. And right now it's just, I'd like to say I'm an american, I'm a patriot. I'm trying to figure out on balance which individual is looking out for the best interest of America.

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       And that's a very, it's a lonely place sometimes. It's because you know, we're in this bike, but you know you are a democrat or a republican and some call themselves independents, but the reality is they lean left or right. I'm sort of in the middle. They were things that I think I would take positions that I take that are more conservatively aligned and the near times when it's more or less conservatively or more liberally aligned, but I don't think you can just fall into a box. I really don't. I think that's the problem. Frankly. There are some issues that I really take a strong position on it. I mean we were just, oh, this is just the other day, and we'll talk about something. I was at the advancing justice seminar. It's advanced justice summit, which is hosted by the Charles Koch foundation, big discussion around reducing the number of incarcerated americans and so someone throughout by 20 slash 20, we want to reduce the number of people incarcerated by 50 percent.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       And I paused and I said, well, that's dumb a suppose 30 percent of those people really should be incarcerated. Suppose they're not. They should. They absolutely cannot be put back on the streets. You're telling me you're thinking through just someone yells out of your thinking and I'm thinking it through and tell you why, because it bothered me because here's the deal. I grew up in one of those fragile communities. I grew up and I shared this with the group. I said, I grew up in the area and my grandmother, I'll never forget this. I'll never forget riding up high school. People would run up to our windows. She, you know, 60 plus year old grandmother and me and an rotc uniform going to highschool drug dealers run up to our windows. Prostitutes are standing on the corner in morning. This is 7:30, 8:00 in the morning next to a school.

Speaker 2:          00:33:09       Okay, but this was the community. My grandmother one day, I'll never forget it, she said they wouldn't allow this in white town. They would never put up with this and white down. She was so bothered, so she became committed. She called demanded police. She demanded that you remove these people from our community and so fast forward you just want to release them all back to our community, and I said this to one of the attendees said, here's the problem. That sounds great and it's great for you because they're not coming back to your community. That's that's why this isn't your problem. If you release 50 percent of these people, where do you think they're coming? They're not coming into suburbia. They're going to show back up in the communities and continue terrorizing and negatively impacting the community. So on that plant, I tell that story to say, you know, listen, I am passionate about and I am bob.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       I appreciate well intended people thinking that just releasing half the people who are currently incarcerated into our communities as a good thing, but they don't think about the impact of that. When my kid can't go out and play in the streets for being shot, my kid can't. My daughter has to walk past these scantily clad women who were selling themselves and she begins to think that's normal. That's not the world, and you may call that a nonviolent opened her, but it's not nonviolent. It's actually more violent because it's working into the psyche. These young people, uh, there's so much there because you could also look at that and go, well, a certain amount of those people that are in there for drug offenses not selling right. And, and if they had had better representation where more money, they would have never been in jail in the first place and either parents or so you can't just blame the government.

Speaker 2:          00:34:43       So that's the thing faster. We want to get to 20 and blame the system for not giving them good lawyers and the system for incarcerating them too long and all of that. And you forget that a lot of that stuff started a lot earlier in their lives. Now you now you took her back to the conservative point. That's right. It's not that scared because by the way, my only point is it doesn't have to be mom or dad. It has to be someone. It could be a school teacher that helped infuse morals and the sense of right and wrong into that kit, but we've got to go back. We can't just wake up and say, okay, now you've got a 19 year old who has a long criminal history. No regard for anyone or anything and say we just think he or she should not be incarcerated.

Speaker 2:          00:35:22       Okay. Then pray, tell what are you going to do about that? Do you ever get an answer to that? If you let these people out, I get that. I'm totally with you. Okay. Came from a bad place. Didn't have the proper support potentially in jail for doing drugs, not even selling them, so the idea is, okay, you want to get this person out of jail. Even if even if it's just an economic thing, you don't want to have the system spending money on it. Right, but now you put them out there, you still have some responsibility. I think that the system or whatever you wanna call it, has some responsibility to make sure that now you just don't toss this back into the mix of what got them there in the first place and how do you fix that? That is the big question. I mean the easy answer is released it and then what I would say.

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       And then what, and the thing that bothers me is that many of the people who advocate for this release release, release don't have to answer the question what? Because they have, they live in neighborhoods with gate gated neighborhoods with a lot of police protection, etc. So they're not impacted by, they just want to, once you get them out and we see this listen and unfortunately with individuals who suffer with mental, a mental illness, so you, you want them out and then what, what, what are you going to do now? And that's someone else's problem. And the system as you call it, the non system hasn't answered that question.

Speaker 2:          00:36:47       All right. Let's shift a little bit to some specific issues because I think we've done a nice little broad job to start here. Uh, you mentioned to me briefly something about daca that I thought was really interesting, how the black community, you sort of split on this. Yeah, yeah. You know, daca is on iTs surface. It's an easy, it should have been easy, but what I've come talking about, the complexity of it and the nuances. So increasingly our students on hbcu campuses, uh, raising, they have real beef with this as the way they described it. So one of the students put it in it, it made me pause because I was like, that's an easy one. You're noT going to send 12 million people home. These kids were brought here by their parents. Didn't have a choice. If I tell my daughter we're going somewhere, she's gone.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       Right? So I get it. Yeah. And then one of the young women put it best. She said, you know, think about the chicago. She said, the irony of this is that they're very, the America is all rallying around providing not only a, the ability for these students to enroll in school, but oftentimes full scholarships for these students. The daca students, while she said, and here I am, the legal descendant of slaves, we were forced to come here and I have to figure out how to pay for my education, and so there's this tension, there's real tension and they have to whisper it. So I asked her, I said, well, why don't you just talk about that in class? And she said, oh, I will be killed. that you can't talk about that in class. She said, but there's an underground sort of conversation about that doesn't seem fair. If America has enough money to provide additional scholarship assistance to students, then shouldn't you take care of people like us who were brought here are parents who were brought here and we truly are. And so I was like, wow, that's really. It was a really. I hadn't thought about it. It made me pause.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       there is also a recent article, I think it's the chicago times where a guy wrote an editorial about rahm emanuel wants to spend one or $2,000,000, so I'm providing ids for undocumented immigrants and the black alderman had a melt down. I mean literally it's quoted all over the papers saying thIs is absurd and enough's enough. We have americans here, americans in chicago who need x, y and z and instead you want to go spend a bit. So there's a tension. Americans that are really inflection point that's just not black and white or conservative and liberal. There's tension now amongst people of color. Yeah. And it seems to me that obviously that conversation is good and it's nice to hear that a student said something to you that made you reevaluate because that shows you practice what you preach obviously. Um, is there, is there, who's the leaDer right now?

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       If I, I, you know, I know you probably get this one all the time and I don't even like the question in a certain way, but, but who should black America, whatever that is. It's so, it's so stupid talking about that stuff. But like who should be in your opinion, should the community be turning to, to make some sense of this? Because there's the usual cast of characters and we can name all the ones that you don't like that or on msnbc everyday and I don't like him either, so let's just forget those. Some people that we should be looking at that and I don't even mean just black America, but no for people that really care about freedom. So you make the good point. Um, I don't even know. America generally, you know, that we can identify someone who is sane and rational and logical and thoughtful.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       But in the african american community, you've nailed it. I, we had a generation of leaders and they were right for that era and what was going on. Fast forward 20, 30 years, I'm not sure. And I've actually sat with a group of my counterpart, you know, forties successful and said, who's the leader? Who's the voice, what voice captures what's happening in african american community. Now, to be fair, it's not monolithic. African americans, You know, like any other guy. That's why I don't like it, but it was never modeled that they put. We had leaders. Martin luther king was a leader, although you know, he, he wasn't from industry, he didn't, you know, so, but still he represented just, he caught and captured the voice of the community. I have to honestly say, and it's something that bothers me. I don't know who that person is and, and I'm not so sure that if you asked him lack people, nine of them would say, I'm not sure who that leader is.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       Yeah. And it's so complex because you remember a couple of years ago when oprah said the thing about how well we just need these old racists to die and she was referencing, she was referencing some people's grandmothers and grandfathers and I remember thinking, and I have no beef with open, but I remember hearing that and thinking this is so dangerous. It gets back to what we were talking about earlier about how You just live in your times and all that. Like no one wants to look at their grandparents who live grew up in a different time of thing. I had to wait until you just drop dead so you can't vote anymore with it. And it

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       makes me think, you know, I had my grandmother taught school for 46 years in broward county, Florida. And um, I remember she said something to me now and I think the world of my grandmother, she's still alive, 93 years old, 94. It just had a birthdaY. And um, I remember going down to the university of miami and I came home and I said, I think I've met someone and it was, she assumed it was a white woman because I'm at a majority institution, you know, lily white, university of miami. And she said, son, I'd rather you bring a man home that, wow, now this is someone who I adore and I think the world of her. But I had to stop and pause. It stuck me. I remember that I'd rather you bring a manhole than a white woman. And I had to realize that a lot of folks hold these racial things and they are products of their era like, right.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       so when I see, you know, an older 90 year old lady or old white guy who has an harbor, some racial animus, I wasn't around then, I can't really put that in context. I'm not justifying it, I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but what I am saying to your earlier point is I love my grandmother and if you tried to attack my grandmother because she espoused that worldview, I would attack you because I look at the totality of her contributions to this country and her, her racist tendencies. I want a product of the era that she grew up in, but they are also a very, very small part of the full woman that I know. Yes. And that's the key part. Everyone wants to define everything you said earlier. You could figure out some thing that you did when you were 18. something that I did when I was 26 and go man, affordances that matter.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       Right? Exactly. But that's the point that we're just pieces of all of this. Uh, it's easy to. And that's, that's a problem. we just want to collapse on. The one thing that someone did that, by the way unpopular now, what do you think a martin luther king, we would think about the identity politics stuff it. It's I, I would like to think, and by the way I say that because you read so many versions of what martin fought. I've heard people say he was a republican. Then I've heard people help he, he's a womanizer. He said this, you just don't know. I think you can make an interesting argument that he was a conservative and endow a. He doesn't want his children to be judged by the color of their skin. That actually sounds a little more like a conservative idea because that's not an identity politics idea yet.

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       Hit a lot of his economic stuff was veering more towards socialism in a way, so I think you can argue both, but I think on balance, I think he would. I believe that he would be looking. He's looking down and saying, you know, no system is perfect. No set of rules is perfect, but this is a lot better people today than it was what we inherited back then is far worse than what you have today, so why don't we look at the progress that was made and figure out how we build on it. I'd like to think that because his nature was one of working together, finding commonality and peaceful protests, you know, people now you know not allowing people to talk when you disagree with them, literally shouting them down. Think about that era when martin luther king, we were the minority. There were clearly, I mean really in the minority, literally they could have silenced him by yelling and shouting him down and somehow the country allow that voice to, to and people embraced it because they listened to it. Even people who were probably not inclined to agree with him, you know, for that that time, but by listening, they said, oh, maybe he's done to something, and it really piqued their heart. It got to the heart and said, you know what? This is probably not the right way to think about my fellow americans. It was because they listened, but if you aren't even being, if you can't hear, if you're unwilling to listen. Martin has to be sad right now.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       Yeah. I was just, at the moment I was telling me how is this an dc going all these things and that's what I felt. I just felt things had gotten so much better for everybody. It doesn't matter. There isn't racism. It doesn't mean some people don't like gay people or any of those things, but we are. Laws basically are fair and it's like where else are they doing it better? That's right. Are you looking to move somewhere? I mean, the same thing right after even after the trump election, you know, I remembered all of those folks. If he is elected, I'm leaving the country. No, I'm still here and I check every day. She's still here. Right? All of these folks with rosie and the name of the group who all thought they were gonna leave the country. I'm like, you're not going anywhere. Shut up.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       I don't want to go too far down the trump thing unless you want to go there, but do you think that whatever's happening with him right now, and as you said, as we're taping this today, manafort was indicted by the fbi. It sounds like it's not even directly about the trump campaign, that it's about some Ukraine stuff before, but, but we'll see where all that plays out. But as a general rule, what do you make of what's happened? Because to me, what I keep trying to say is if you just let go of the tweets for a minute, you let go over the media hysteria. Basically nothing bad has happened basically.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       Well, two things. First of all, y'all. I know it's hard to get rid of the. No, no. You've only had eight months of it, so yeah, nothing bad could really happen at eight months. Anyway. This is a republic that has been around for a very long time. It's going to be around a long time after him. So that's the beginning. The other thing is it goes back to this media thing. If You are, if you continually. There's a barrage of information. It says everything this person does is bad. At some point you believe it. Right, and I think that's a part of it. He's trying to figure it out. Could he stay off the tweet a little bit? Twitter off? Yes. Could he be a little bit more presidential? Hell, he admitted it this weekend when he said that, but I'm about to say about Michael Morton is totally non presidential. Well knows alert president trump. Several of those sorts of things have not been president, so I'm glad you're acknowledging

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       it. Yeah, he can't though. Right? Because that's what got them there. That's what's got him there and that's what people forget. It worked and frankly, as much as we talk about he's not reflecting America. Yes he does. He, you know, 43 million americans voted for him. Forty six for hillary and people don't factor the sin, but $3 million. Hillary won the state of great state of California by 3 million votes. people forget that. So pull those. That $3, million person spread was like here for the record. I in California voted for Gary Johnson and judge me however you will see another judge me however you want, but I suspect you would do I feel that of the ideas of gary did. In fact I did that, but you know, we know he wasn't going to win so that's a whole different conversation. But I, but I, I'm in California.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       It didn't matter which way. Right. That's like me in Washington dc for the democratic candidate was when full stop. Right? Yeah. And again that gets back to the issue is country is just, you're, you're in one camp or the other and it is when you think 46 and 43 million people we're calling, we really divided. I mean I just don't even know where the center is anymore. That's, that's troubling. So to me, the center basically is somewhat economically conservative in that you earn your money, you should keep it. And I also always argued that's the best way. If you hate trump, the best way to limit government is to stop giving it so much money and power because sometime you know what? You might get bernie and he can use a lot of power that you like, but then sometimes you're gonna get a guy you don't like, so let's just stop giving them so much power, but in a weird way.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Does This all show that our system is working properly? Well, that's. You know, you, you mentioned it earlier. This is not a perfect system, but I don't. There's no other place in the world. I'd rather be. I thank god every day when I wake up and, and, and so you know that I'm here and it because we could have all been born somewhere else and this could have been a really bad situation. It's not a perfect union, but we're working towards it and that's the optimism, but it's only if we have conversations like this, the two of us, this doesn't appear on mainstream television by the way. That's the thing that I got to figure out how to get you. Hey, let me be your age, but we have to get. I believe you could do it. I don't even know that I want it, but I believe that really could because this voice is what's missing.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       You're either msnbc or fox news, you're rachel or your hannity and that by the way, doesn't get us any closer to fixing this because people then divide out. That's What we've got to do because rational people can. I think reasonable people can come to some conclusions that this is good for all of us. You know, relating this to sort of where we started as you're saying this, I'm thinking, you know, there's something interesting here. If this identity politics stuff wins the day and they start taking more monuments and we start judging Thomas Jefferson and the rest of the founders on the morals of today. It's not just that we'll remove them, but we'll actually all of good ideas,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       all of their good ideas will have to go away. They won't even if you're like a lot of those good ideas, you know what I mean? Like they won't just magically keep some of the ideas what you're going to actually remove all of those ideas and then what are we left with and it ain't pretty right and, and it's not America that that's the reality. It's not America. And that's something that we've all got to come to grips with is that this is not a good direction. The trajectory is all wrong. I'm pleased to say, and all of us in the market, so performing the financially you'll do well, but by the way, if you don't have any money, you're not participating in the markets anyway. Right? So people like the two of us, we're going to do fine. Our families and significant others and stakeholders are going to do fine.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       It's the rest of these folks who are being left out and they unfortunately are buying into this narrative that America is bad and somehow the magic fix is to tax the wealthy. like where does that end? Like who. And so is the appeal of that just because it takes, it's sort of lazy thinking, you know what I mean? Like, it just doesn't take much to be like, I want what somebody else has. Like, it's kind of an easy answer. like I don't have somebody all got. They should gIve me some of that. Like you don't have to think that hard. Relax. You have to think harder to understand why you shouldn't or don't deserve someone else's money. Let's see. I don't, I, and why? Maybe. But it's also equally lazy to think if I were a zoo, you know, I'm a millionaire, I wouldn't want to give more of my money to someone else if I earned it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:00       Even if I bought a freaking lottery ticket, uh, you know, just basic. Take some person who's from a fragile community and who's got limited resources and you say to them, you won the lottery tomorrow. You want $2,000,000, 5 million of it goes to the federal government in your state. How does that make you feel? Bad. That's lazy. I mean, you don't have a lot to say. That's not a good result, right? Yeah. So I don't know why this is, I don't know that it's easy. I think it's, we have just pounded into people's heads that taking that the rich people are bad. you're vilified for going to work everyday and making some good decisions and some luck and some god and some fate. All of that into totality. You're bad for having done well and the media plays it consistent. They, you belIeve it. You believe it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:49       What do you think is the right amount of government for us to have? Um, as much as we need. I know that's not a great answer, but I would literally, I'm sort of, I'm not sort of, I'm very conservative in that respect. I don't think you can have no government [inaudible] then you have anarchy. We need. So you don't want mad max, right? I don't want that. I mean if my house burns down, I want to police department to show up. I don't wanna have to rely on my three neighbors with buckets to come at a fire department to show up. So I think government, the infrastructure is important of any society that will endure. I do think that we've gotten too far though, when you have just huge bureaucracy and departments designed to

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       solve problems that frankly will solve themselves amongst people. Yeah, but we become completely dependent on it. Is there any way to scale it back? That's one of the questions that I try to ask a lot of my more libertarian guests like it seems like this, this thing has gotten so big and when you factor it in with, you know, handouts and all of this stuff that if you were ever to take it back, a lot of people think, well, you just be screwing over all the poor people that. Then I have some people who come on and say, no, you just cut it tomorrow and we see what happens. We'll charities come in. We'll churches and synagogues and mosques and all that. Well, they pick up the slack, you know, will. If you cut the funding until planned parenthood would barbara streisand and rosie and the rest of them suddenly put some of their money towards that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       I tend to think the answer is yes, I do. How do you, how do you get that point across to people? Well, they're not going to do it unless forced to do it, so I think so that's something to be said for. Just stop. I mean, what we saw puerto rico's a classic example. We're all forced, you know, worried about what's happening in puerto rico, but this didn't start with a hurricane. Puerto rico was a disaster. I mean when I read something, I was down there last year and they said 70 or so percent of the population work for the government like that has gotten out of control and the only way you fix that, you can't come in and say, hey guys, 50 percent of you all should give up your government jobs for us to get this right. No, you're just gonna have to kind of just have to be.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       You just have to. And that's the. Frankly, that's the opportunity and I want to be careful here because I don't want, I didn't, I'm not a trump sarah got or anything else, but that's the opportunity for someone like him. I think we have just elected our first independent president. I think it's the first time that America has had someone who says what they think for good or bad, but and who is prepared to be unpopular because to make these sorts of decisions you got to be unpopular and okay with that. So was that his best line during the campaign? When he said basically to the black community, he was like, what do you got to lose? Do you think? It was an actual. It ended up being a good line because it sounded off when I heard it. And then I've talked to a lot of people and they kind of were like, yeah, all these democratic run cities, chicago, atlanta, ferguson.

Speaker 1:          00:55:38       That's where it's the worst. So it was funny. I remembered, I knew, I know where I was at that moment when that happened and I was with a group of my friends and one of my friends who is as liberal as they come, I've never sent me. He drips and he said to me, it was this moment like when you eat something that's bitter at first, and then you're like, oh, that tastes good. Ultimately. Yeah. And he said he's onto something and that was when I knew that actually resonated. I didn't feel good at first. I mean I got it checked because it was a little dismissive and frankly the african american community is still enjoying the fact that we elected our first african american president and frankly so are a lot of non african americans, right? It was a big deal. So they felt like it was a shot at obama.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       That's, that was the issue. If you had taken obama out of the equation, having been the president, it was a totally reasonable statement to say ever the guy was before. He didn't meaningfully change your life. I am prepared to do what do you have to lose? So I think you just, if you took obama out of it and the pride associated with him being a, you know, a first, um, I think it was totally logical. Ironically, I think you can make a great argument that the president himself, whether it's obama or trump or anybody else, shouldn't have that much power over your life. Well, that, that would be my greater solutIon here. That's my attitude. People say, well, you know, I wouldn't want to have lunch with Donald Trump. I said, and you're, oh, that's easy. I want my president to do two things. Literally I have sort of drawn it down to this national security and economic security.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       I want the economy economy to be strong globally. I want them on it and then I want to make sure that the homeland is secure in the context of a global kind of his, so it's not just domestic, but you got to do some things are nationally to protect your homeland. Those two things. I don't care what the president thinks about much of anything because he's a man just like I am and you are, so he'll have an opinion about x and that's good for him. Their supreme court does. Congress has all of that stuff, but I just want them to do two things. Economic security and what I'll call homeland, but security, national security. Is it funny to you how everybody's sort of flipped their opinions on almost everything these days? Because as you're saying that, I'm thinking if we just go back 20 minutes when we were talking about daca, it's like, well suddenly democrats, because they didn't like what trump was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       We're fighting for states' rights and it's like, yeah, I want you guys to fight rights all the time. could then I'll start voting with you again. We'll look at the obamacare, the new proposed a affordable health care act. By that, you know, the idea is black granite to the states. I thought that's what we all want, right? It's and I was surprised to see some states. Actually, no, we don't want it. What do you mean you don't want it? The ability of mr or ms.gov to manage and take care of your citizenry with your dollars without the intervention of some people in Washington dc who know nothing about what happens in spokane, Washington. You don't want man. To me that's like the most like perfect example of how screwed up our system is that a governor who is executor of the estate would be like, no, no, no. The thing that I'm supposed to do. You do, let's send it over there. That way I'm free in the clear. That's like the worst. That's why people hate politicians. That's why people hate the media. It's like holding it. I want. I live in California, which they're probably going to execute, but in five years for a little freedom libertarian, and believe me, if they, if they succeed from the unit, I really can I move in with you.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       I'll be in Missouri, but that the Iowa, that's what I do. But. But that point basically of everything's being flipped right now. Like everyone's kind of all over the place. It's actually cool. I mean that's all I know. So many people

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       are depressed about it, but what I've been trying to say is there's opportunity here. It doesn't mean it's going to be bad. It doesn't mean it's going to be good, but let's get in there and fight for what you believe. Even if you believe in the stuff that I abhor. Right? Right. But they're lazy. I mean that you use the right word. People are lazy. This is actually fascinating to watch. Now I want to separate it. Earlier I said, you know, I'm nervous about where this is going. That's true. I'm hopeful. I'm not necessarily optimistic and there's a difference, right? yeah. But I do enjoy watching the process, the sausage making. I do like to see that ultimately, you know, if you go back and look at some of the, at least the reports of the early founding fathers, it was ugly. They hated each other.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       It was divided like nothing you've ever seen and all of the what we refer to as going on in congress right now. Hell, it happened back then to this might be the american experience. Right. And you were just in time. What we do is we put a painting, we tell a story around it and it looks so wonderful and dramatic, but the reality is it's ugly. You know, operating in this sort of a government, this, this model of, of, of governing is ugly and it's got to be ugly or I mean, what's the option? I mean, I think that's what people don't understand is like if anything's going to work, it kind of has to be ugly. That mean the sausage factory there. I think nobody wants to see how it gets made, but you don't like it. No. Shit like it. While I was, I was reading the other day, I know you've seen it, the comments, um, vayner is now talking about what happened, you know, god suddenly the man's curse of his marines and the idea that, you know, some way literally he said got either pulled a gun or a knife on him or something.

Speaker 2:          01:00:59       One of his fellow members of congress and uh, iT's just fascinated. Literally he's had an and but that's. And that's within the party. So the idea that somehow the tension is, is bad, maybe not so much. Yeah. It's also funny because like, you know, you'll always hear all the, all these media people and politicians and be like, house of cards is the most realistic show ever. And it's like, well there's an awful lot of murder and drug use and evil backdoor deals and you're just, you guys are all kind of telling us that are all showing it to us. All right, well we could go a rabbit hole on that one. So let's, let's shift to your future. Because you mentioned, you mentioned earlier, so you are leaving the organization that basically then the next month. Right, and where are you going? What are you doing going to run an organization called the society for human resource management?

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       Sure, and it's the world's largest association dedicated to human resources, so trade association for the profession of human resources professionals and you know, so some have said, wow, that's kind of out there. Will know it isn't for for a couple of reasons. First of all, I've been in higher ed for the last seven and a half years. If you ask nine out of 10 college students, why did you go to college? Is to get a good job period. So it's a very natural kind of thing. There's no point of going if this doesn't turn into some way to provide. The other thing though is it's a natural sort of evolution in my career. I now understand higher ed. Actually. I think I have a really good understanding of all of the education. So pk through 16, we've now got a connected. There's not an article that comes out.

Speaker 2:          01:02:33       We're employers say the system is not giving me what I want. The students who are graduating don't have the skills that we need and so they're frustrated because I'm paying taxes to pay for this system education system and the what comes out on the other end. The assembly line model is really bad. I paid for all of this and at the end of the car I don't like it. So I think this gives me an opportunitY to take what I've done for the last seven and a half years and now take, get industry, bring the two together and say let's figure out how to make this system work. We're spending a lot of money as a country on education and to what end. So what are some of the ways you could shift education? I mean, I think the basic premises of get people to listen and get people to really understand what they believe in, but is there something that's like a little more concrete that you're going to go in and be like, guys, let's.

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       This is what we got to change. Yeah. You know, you know the, the current administration is talking a lot about apprenticeships. For example, the end gain can't be everyone goes to four year college and I think we went that way for too long and that didn't work. So the idea is to figure out credentialing, to figure out what are the specific skills that one needs to go into the 21st century economy industry has to tell us that since they are ultimately the consumer of this education product, and then we got to go back and say, okay, now you've got to tweak your system. I know you all don't like being vocations, vocational schools and you want to teach people how to think and solve the world's problems, but the vast majority of the folks who come through your system are doing what they're trying to get a job.

Speaker 2:          01:03:58       So that's what we're going to do. Concretely. Bringing those education and industry together and say, let's figure this out. We've got to rethink and talking about disruption. I predict that higher education in particular is going to be disrupted in a way as a, as a business, as a sector, like nothing you've ever seen. The pieces are all there for that right now because we see the schools that a lot of the schools that have gone down the sjw route are really struggling. Mizzou is majorly struggling and enrollment. We know evergreen state struggling. I mean, well, you have another problem. America and americans just had fewer babies. The reality is we, we, uh, we've seen there are fewer students graduating high school this year than last year and the year before. So what we're seeing is a problem. You're just not going to have the same number of bodies to come into that traditional college environment that we created with dorms and everything else.

Speaker 2:          01:04:50       So now we are nontraditional student has to be our traditional students. That's got to be a little ironic for you in a way. You come from the higher ed thing, you care so much about it and yet you can also acknowledge that a certain amount of people just because of the reality of economics, don't necessarily need all of that education that you know that's right, and it's going to be lifelong, you know, it's the idea that we came out of the generation where you get your education, your bachelors, your masters or doctorate, what have you get, and then you go into the workplace and do it for 30 years and you retire and now because the economy is changing so much, every five to seven years, industries go away that we were taught to participate in. They go away. And so that's. I'm so excited about that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       Finally, you know, sort of related to that America is browning and graying at once. So underlying all of this is we've got to figure out how to get the system to appreciate a very different America. It's not black and white anymore. It's brown, it's yellow, it's everything. And how these workers, as they come out of college or whatever their educational backgrounds are when they come into the workplace, how do we grow our economy? Uh, and we've got to use people to do it right. And that's what I'm excited about, sherman and higher education and just trying to figure out how to tie that all together. Yeah. Well, I gotta tell you, man, I, I thoroughly enjoyed this. I'm not surprised because as I said, I saw you once and I was like, this guy's going to do it. But I think the real beauty of this is that you're not just saying this stuff, you're actually out there doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       And I believe that that's right. I don't believe, you know, this isn't about my desire to run for office or to get a job. Um, I really believe this. This is something that it keeps me up at night. How can people like the two of us changed the narrative. Thank you. Thank you for. I feel like I gotta I gotta give you one more here. That'll all right. What would you say, what would you say that. Well, thank you. But what would you say then to the to the people, whether they're college students right now or whether they're middle aged, whatever it is that want to get in the fight, but are afraid because of all the silencing factors. You know what I mean? Yeah. Know two things. First of all, you need courage. You've got to intestinal courage. You got to just go down and decide this is the, this is where I want to go.

Speaker 2:          01:07:00       And by the way, that means transferring schools. If that means changing the people you spend time around because you know it can be debilitating in some ways, then do it. I mean, it's just the only way to do it. The other thing is I would encourage all americans. We've got to listen more. The most frustrating thing to me now is we're so busy talking and frankly talking over others that we just won't pause and listen. That's the beginning of changing the narrative because as you're listening, you're going to one, the other person will respect you. Now because you've listened to them, and in the process you actually might learn something. You might say, you know, the world is a little different than I perceived it to be because I got it from someone else's perspective. That's the beauty of diversity by the way. It's not just gender and race and national origin.

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       It's diverse perspectives. How another person sees the world. If we can get those two things now, first of all, listen, But then courage. It takes a lot frankly for me to be right here, the best thing in the world. If I aspire to be a congressman and a member of the cbc and dah, dah, dah, there's a narrative that I'm supposed to follow and you've got to decide that, that that doesn't matter. What's more important is that the american story, 100 years from now is, is a much better story because I was here. I love it. That's
