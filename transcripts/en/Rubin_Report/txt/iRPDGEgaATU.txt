Speaker 1:          00:00:27       Alright, we are back. I jokingly said that we were going to crash the Internet and I'm pretty sure we crashed youtube literally out of every live stream we have ever done. We have never had an issue. I don't know what happened there. I have conferred with these two fine men and we're not willing to completely go down the conspiracy theory yet. We're going to have to just recap what happened in 10 minutes, I believe. Well, first off, Ben Shapiro to my left, ironically, Jordan Peterson to my right. Uh, I believe that we are fully right now in an idea revolution. We talked about this for about 10 minutes. We'll try to recap a little bit of what we started with and then gets a similar all new stuff. Uh, as I've said to the guys, they're welcome to talk directly to each other. If they have questions for me, we can add. There are no rules here, there are never rules in your, but truly today, there are no rules. Uh, and I, I think that these guys are in the thick of something just tremendously important right now in relevant. And that's why they're blowing up the way that they are. Okay. Let's try to do some of that again. Although you guys were both quite eloquent the 10 minutes ago. I'm idea revolution. Do you believe that we are in an idea revolution right now?

Speaker 2:          00:01:32       Well, this is what I think's happening, I think, and I think this accounts for the attractiveness of the content that I've put on Youtube. So when Nisha darkness the death of God about 150 years ago and his, he made three predictions, he said people will be, as a consequence, our culture will shape to the roots will become nihilistic or totalitarian in response, or we'll invent our own values. Okay? Those were. Those were his three possibilities. And then, and then of course we became not listed. Can Totalitarian, totalitarian through the 20th century and many tens of millions of people died as a consequence, which Nietzsche also foretold specifically. He said that 100 million people would die because of the rise of communist ideas. He said that in willpower. So then he predicted that while we would have to invent our own values, but then the psychoanalysts came along and they said, well wait a second, you can't.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       You can't create your own values because you're not mastering your own house. There are forces operating inside of you that are autonomous. And for Freud, those were primarily biological forces, but young took that a step further and he said, well wait a minute. Biology is a lot more sophisticated and complex than you think, and there are symbolic forces at work. He thought of the archetypes has images of the instincts, for example, but the instincts were a lot more sophisticated than people thought. So it's not just an instinct to aggression. Let's say there's an instinct to operating properly that you walk up hierarchies, human hierarchies of competence. It'd be something like that. And that's. That's an archetype of the ideal. In some sense, you thought the gods didn't disappear. They went inside, they went into the psyche, and so he dove down as far as he could dive to find out what those eternal images were and to bring them back up to the surface.

Speaker 2:          00:03:19       And that's what I've been continuing, I would say in my lectures saying, look, there's, there are elements to the ancient story that are not only they're deeply correct and you cannot live and you live in hell unless you know them. It's something like that. And that's the case. So. And I think that's, I'm hoping that's what is happening is that people are starting to understand that people, people's lives do have a transcendent purpose. That's the most appropriate way of looking at life. That our brains are in fact evolved to reveal that purpose to us. Which I also believe. I think the neuro neurological evidence in that regard is quite clear. I believe that. And so I hope. I'm hoping that what, what we're. We're at the end of postmodern despair. That's what I'm hoping. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       So to me, what you're giving there is sort of a realist version of religion. You're saying these stories are needed for a very real way. I suspect you basically agree with.

Speaker 3:          00:04:19       Well, what's what's fascinating about this is a, I mean Jordan, maybe closer to aristotle and Plato, but I think that we almost have a platonic verses, Aristotelian argument going on here because it seems like what you're talking about is the idea that if we dig down deep enough into our biology's and into our neural networks, what we find is a common set of shared values that if you refuse to acknowledge then leads to grave on happiness. And what I'm. I'm almost feeling level right and when I'm coming from, it's almost a platonic idea, which is that the mind of man reflects the mind of God to the extent that you can. That not only is, is I would argue that that extra revelation is necessary, but even if you don't use revelation, that using your capacity to reason, you can find a purpose in something about.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       But we ended up at the same place. Which is the set of values that if you actually, uh, if you, if you stray away from this common set of values, and I'm talking like the most root level values, personal responsibility, free will. It's your job to be responsible for members of your family. It's your job to make good decisions and responsible decisions and not to blame the society around you for failures that you are yourself responsible for. You can't surpass your own innate capacity in, in, in terms of you can't expect society to make up for your lack of innate capacity in certain areas. You just have to make the most of what you have in front of you. You and I agree on values, but I think that the source of the values, there's going to be a slight disagreement on I think. I think it's okay. It's a,

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       it's a. it's a profound place for disagreement because, and I don't understand how to mediate it exactly because I'm not willing to dispense with the metaphysical. No. When I did my biblical lectures last year, I called him a psycho psychological approach. The biblical stories, right? Because I wanted to push a secular interpretation of scientific

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       interpretation by the stories is just not to interrupt. I think that that's supremely useful to people specifically because I mean, despite the fact that I come from a religious background, I'm trying to make arguments that are not religious in orientation. I never cite to the Bible when I talk about values, for example, I never site revelation. It's valuable to me because I think that that's a good source of the values and I think that it's an irrelevant source of the values, but it is not the only way to achieve those values. I've never suggested, for example, that atheists can be moral or that you can be an agnostic and not believe in Judeo Christian systems. Revelation and comes to the same exact set of values that we're talking about now is also a simpler argument to make because you constrain the number of necessary. Very exactly.

Speaker 4:          00:06:36       But having said that, I'm not willing to dispense with the metaphysical and I think like, I think it's an I'm like stretching the edges of my cognitive ability when I'm talking about this sort of thing because I'm in realms that I don't understand that it's, that I just getting vague pictures. Um, but I think it's as if there's a, there's a revelation, a revelation from evolution that matches the revelation from above. The two things come together and, and I don't under, I don't understand how that can be possible. I think it has something to do with the fundamental nature of consciousness, which is something we seriously do not understand. And so I can see you can make a straight biological case for the evolution of archetypes. But I don't think that the biological explanation exhausts the archetype. There's more to it and it, and what I've learned to and delving into these religious stories but also into religious experience is that it's bottomless.

Speaker 4:          00:07:30       Like there is a point where as you dig into the architectural, everything turns into one thing. Biological, spiritual, transcendent. It's all one thing from the top to the bottom. And I think people get intimations of that when they have profound experiences, experiences that are generated by music, for example, if I love or by sex or there's a variety of ways that they can be. Anytime you have an experience of meaning in your life. And I can also see that. And I believe this to be the case is that you are, you're neurologically adapted to a universe where meaning is the highest instinct. And I mean that technically is that when you're sitting in a situation where what's happening around you is meaningful, what your nervous system is signaling to you is that you occupy the optimal position in the dynamic territory that you currently inhabit.

Speaker 4:          00:08:21       And that's, and that sense of meaning is it's not just cortical, it's, it's way deeper than merely cortical. And so that's a very exciting. That's a very exciting discovery. I would say that I think that because again, in a place where we agree is that meaning is uncovered. It's not some, it's discovered. It's not something that you're making up yourself. And that's why I think it's revealed. Exactly. And because we're like happiness. Exactly. And I think that one of the reasons that, that the message that we're putting out there is, is making people happier. Actually, even though we're both pessimist by nature, I would think a, is that what

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       we're basically saying is that in this land of chaos where you could be wandering around with no meaning there is a meaning and if you search for it, you'll find it, but you have to be open to the concept that there is a meaning to be discovered. And if you shut yourself off from that by just saying there's no meaning to be discovered, meaning as to be made up by you and you can just do what you want to have. A phenomenal thing is just, it's just something that you experienced, but it's not really real. That, that kind of stuff is, is, uh, I think disquieting to people. And so there's something that quiets the soul that says you have purpose. And if you don't have purpose, then maybe it's because you're searching in the wrong place for that purpose. That's a possibility. That's really interesting things that you said there because it's like I know you guys pretty well at this point and this crew of people that were sort of in when, when we're off camera, we're actually talking about the exact same things like we are live.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       Whether this camera was on right now are off like we're living this thing all the time. I think I can speak from my own experience in this regard. It's made me a better person and I will and I'm still striving to be about a more authentic, a more honest. I'm constantly. I mean I sit in this chair when it's over there and look at the person over here every week and I actually here and I listen and I sit across great minds and I go, wow, I have to reevaluate some of the things that I think and sometimes it's because I disagree with someone or you know, and I'm like, they really don't know what they're talking about, but often it's hopefully that I'm hearing somebody say some great. This is what's really interesting. And I think what's, what's great about conversations like this one is when.

Speaker 3:          00:10:19       Yeah, if I have Jordan on my facebook live and I asked him questions or he'll have me on his youtube and he's asking questions, what we're all really in the business of all of us who are occupying the space is asking questions or treated as weird because we're asking the questions. Right? If you're actually listening to the answers. Exactly. Because I always think, well, you know, you might have something to tell me. That's my rule number 11. By the way, I assume that the person you're listening to might know something you don't, right? Because then you can, they can tell you about to you and if you learn it then you don't have to run face first into a brick wall. It's really helped. And then it and from Jewish tradition that's deeply embedded in Jewish tradition that the wise man is the man who learns from every man around him.

Speaker 3:          00:10:53       And so this idea is, is, is what unifies this really disparate stream of people. The three of us people like Sam Harris, people like Joe Rogan. I mean like you look at me and Joe Rogan and what we have in right? We like asking questions and we will actually look like you might be different species. Right, right, right. Well, that's how I found the same thing when I was on Jocko willink podcast. It's like, you know, we're, we're very different people, but that's what's in common is that we're able to have a conversation. We're actually able to have a conversation and, and that we're aiming. I think we're, we're all aiming at making things better rather than worse, which is also a very important thing to massively. One of the things that makes that happen is the fact that we are, as you say, talking about first principles all the time. When people talk at the top of the iceberg, then it's impossible for them to even see sometimes that they're actually standing on two different icebergs rather than they're not seeing the commonalities of, of, and they're not seeing what's different. Like if I, if I argue first principles with somebody, then you can see how those first principles manifest in political differences. The business that I'm in.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       Um, but if you're just arguing about a certain political policy without examining anything that goes underneath there, then you just ended up clubbing each other and not even understanding what the other person's saying because you don't understand the set of values that deriving those political principles. Part of the problem that we have right now in our culture is trying to diagnose the level at which the discussion should be taking place. And I think the reason that this is a tumultuous time is because it actually is a time for discussion of first principles and it's, it's that first principles are virtually at the level of theology. Because first principles are the things that you assume and then move forward. It's like, well, what should we assume while the dignity of the human soul, but start with that. You can't treat yourself properly without assuming that you can't have a relationship with another person.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       You can't stabilize your family. You can't have a functional society. So what does it mean for the human soul have dignity? Well, the part of the idea is that you're participating in creation itself and you do that with your actions. And your language and you get to decide whether you're tilting the world a bit more towards heaven or a bit more towards hell and that's actually what you're doing. So that's a place where the literal and metaphorical truth come together and people are very, they're terrified of that idea as they should be because it's a massive responsibility. It's a massive realization of responsibility to understand that all the decisions that you make during the day, our decisions between Hell and heaven essentially. But I think there is no truer way of saying that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       So as you guys have both sort of hit the level that you're at. And I was at the turning point thing with you a couple of weeks ago and you literally came out. It was like the rolling stones came out. I mean people. People were going bananas. I talked about all my political differences with them that we've discussed about being pro choice and for gay marriage. Although they are basically okay with that and, and being pro pot and all that. And I got a standing ovation. We did our thing and in Clemson and the line for you after, it was longer than the line for me and I told you this, but I was like, man, that makes me want to be better. I have to. I wasn't jealous of you. I was like, man, he's doing something great and I have to be better. So my question for you is this was all meant to be right. I mean without going too religious or metaphysical, but the Internet has now allowed all of the people that were watching television and seeing pop culture and going something is really wrong here. Something is missing. The Internet has sort of forced us together. I mean that's this, this growing group is because we're. It's not because we're all looking for it. It's because we're being forced together.

Speaker 4:          00:14:19       Well, it's really funny is the way that everybody is introduced to our work is, is the same way, but it's the way that you wouldn't expect. So most people, I think Jordan originally saw you in a confrontation with somebody over Trans Gender Pronouns. Right? And that's how most people began to engage and then suddenly you are getting 500,000 views on discussions of biblical stories from Genesis, which yeah, I mean, let's be frank if, if, if the first thing never happens, those things at 5,000 views, right? Then the same thing is true for me, right? The way that I originally kind of drew public attention was because I was on piers Morgan's show, I shall act him on his show.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       And so all of a sudden people were now listening to hour long lectures about, about, you know, my, my ideas on philosophy and principles of the founding fathers. They came for the scandal and stayed for the content. And that's, and that's, I think the advantage that it takes a particular skill set for everyone in this space to be able to do that. But that's, that's the beauty of the, of the youtube moment and over the Internet moment is that people are engaging in the news level. If you just watch any cable news channel, the new cycle is about 30 seconds long. Then the repeat the headlines again. Uh, and so that's the level at which we consume, but if you see every sees the flash point for you or the flash point for me or the flashpoint for Sam with Ben Affleck and one of the flash point for you with number many of them for you.

Speaker 3:          00:15:30       And then they and then they want more and it's the introduction of the, it's basically the gateway drug. Like there's a 32nd video that's the gateway drug to these hour long lectures about deeper principles and people and the reason that the. And the question is why those flashpoints flash. And I think the because what makes those different, what makes it that people want to see that and then they go, okay, now I want to see the rest of their content and start streaming tons of videos from these folks. Kathy Newman video is a good example. So let's get to that in one second. I want, I just want to lead that is, is just that I think it's incongruent. They see something different and if you notice a difference in the society on any level, then you are automatically a pariah and an outlier and we all know deep down that there are distinctions and differences to be made logically between. I'm not even talking about groups of people ethnically, you know, for some odd reason. I'm talking about just logical distinctions between modes of thought and logical distinctions between, uh, between certain policies. And if you, if you are willing to draw distinctions instead of just saying that we have to exist in this morass of identity politics, that's a, it's a flash in the darkness and people gravitate toward the light

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       partly because the problem with the problem with rel relativism, let's say, let's say that that did produce a radical state of equality. Well, the problem with that is that there's no up and the problem with there being no opposite, there's no hope. And the problem with that is that people actually live on hope. Yes. So if you flatten out the value structure so that there is no qualitative differentiation between things, then there's nothing to do. So that's just not helpful. And so then you can tell people, look, make no mistake about it, there is down. That's hell, that's Auschwitz. That's the gulags like that's down, that exists, that exists in your own family. You can create that with no problem. And because there's a down like that, there's also an APP and that APP is worth aiming at. Even though it differentiates people as they climb towards it. It's still, without that, you can't have the purpose in your life that gives it meaning and nobility in the face of suffering. Well that's a no,

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       that's interesting because that's why I sort of think it's almost like we're all Frankenstein's monster in a weird way. If the. If the mainstream media had been dealing honestly with the issues of the day, whatever they are, identity politics are postmodernism or just the general political discussion, then I don't think people would react to you guys the way that they do because they didn't do their job. But really quickly, [inaudible] you hit these. So your more I think were three moments and you already hit them. But just for people that are, that aren't falling, all this you on piers Morgan basically bashing him endlessly with facts over feelings about guns was one where it was like this guy from the Internet just beat this CNN per person. How did that happen? And then I think the one that changed me more than anything else, everyone knows this already with Sam Harris on real time with, with athletic, and they got into this stuff about, about the difference between Muslims and Islam.

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       I didn't even know who sam was. I see this mild mannered neuroscientists in a nice suit commonly talking about Pew statistics. Next thing you know, he's gross and racist. But, but this is a good segue to yours because I think yours is the third one and the way that this is just two or three weeks ago, uh, you were on with Kathy Newman on it's Canada channel for UK, UK channel for sorry. And there is, I mean, everyone that's watching this has probably seen this already. If you haven't, you should go watch it. But, but in effect, basically she tried to make an argument that you have heard a good Julian Times before, but why does your right to free speech supersede a trans person's right to feel okay with themselves or something. Even the way she phrased the question was a little confused and conflated, but. But the reaction to it, it was your, your answer was great, but it was the reaction to regular people watching at home that we're going, this is nonsense. This is just abject.

Speaker 5:          00:19:12       No, the only thing that's to make it viral is the fact that she recognized in the moment to what she was saying moment where you could see the light go on briefly and she just went, wait, what did I just say? And there was no escape. It was pretty. It was pretty grand. Yeah. Well, the funny thing about her argument is that it's Pr was predicated on the idea that somehow people have a right to be comfortable. It's like that's just not a right you have in life all the things you can say that you don't have a right to in life. Being comfortable is number one is you can offend me right now, so the thing is is if you, if you're right to be comfortable, trumps my right to talk, then I don't get to talk ever because I'm going to say things. If I'm actually talking, I'm going to say things. If they're, if they're profound things, if they're contentious, things are truthful things, I'm going to say things that if they don't disturb you are going to disturb you and if they don't disturb you, there's someone that's going to be disturbed about them. So what's the answer to that? Everyone can be comfortable in the silence, but that doesn't also doesn't work because then we can't exchange ideas. We're not comfortable in the silence. We're isolated and Dan didn't the silence, so it's a completely incoherent perspective,

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       but what does that tell you about just the way mainstream media operates? Because if you even, even just in this last week when I've read some of the pieces about you that I think are so dishonesty attacking the way you do things or even there was an article about you and it was like Ben Shapiro is the cool kids philosopher or something, something like that. Yeah. And it was like, well wait a minute. When did the cool kid be the smart Orthodox Jew? You know what I mean? Like, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:20:42       how did, how does that. But think about that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       And then you've talked, you've talked about the shit that you went through when you were growing up and all that stuff and you don't want to play the regularly, but I can't imagine exactly the same. Just like small and noisy, bad combat, man. I could have taken care of both of you. I always say I was right on the middle of sort of like loser and cool. So like I actually did believe the kids below me, but I was bullied by the guys that were. I was right there. And maybe that maybe that keeps the world in balance. There you go. But this idea that when they write the article, it's the cool kids will ask her even though obviously you didn't grow up as the cool kid or James Demore is a great one where they write articles about him and they'll say the, the tech Bro. And it's like if you both have met James Moore, he's the shyest. Quietest decent. You almost literally have to drag sentences. Yeah. But, but he's. But a spine of steel though. It's really something. Yeah. Fearless. Despite what his disposition may actually be. But. But what do you make of that? The way that they try to frame it. So they're already trying to undercut, you know what I mean before it, before you even say it

Speaker 4:          00:21:53       is your model. But I think that they're trying to impose their own order on the chaos. It's just the wrong frame. So that's what happened in the channel for interview and it's, it's sort of, I was thinking about the model that you were describing with regards to your position on the iceberg is that Kathy had staked out a position on the iceberg and I had staked one out that was way lower, way lower and what happened was she kept questioning me at her level of analysis and that just wasn't working because that wasn't the level of analysis at which I'm playing. Well, and I'm also not playing, although I'm trying to play, you know what I mean, because it's a little bit. But yeah, I mean I was like wrestling, you had a lower base of gravity and, and I think that that gave you an advantage and that's partly.

Speaker 4:          00:22:34       I wasn't trying to win the interview. Right. You know, like I and I don't try to win interviews. I'd try to go to an interview and have a talk and have a discussion and see how it goes. And I don't have an agenda except to not make a catastrophic mistake, but that's agenda number one. Don't say anything. Unforgivably stupid. Yeah. I think that's the other thing that, that makes all of this unique is that if you actually meet any. I mean we've all met each other in the circle now because it's really funny how life works that way. These circles are so small, but we tell each other and we actually talk with each other and all this.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       That's what I'm saying. They're forcing us together. It's not even that we're seeking it,

Speaker 4:          00:23:07       but it's also that we all have a certain. There's a certain baseline personality that we all have and that is we enjoy the discussion. We actually enjoyed the exchange of ideas and so when you're on with Kathy Newman and she says stuff that like what, what, what you were getting from the right when the lot was how to even stand this. How do you understand this interview? Right? How can you get through half an hour of this and you've done it and I've done it too. And the answer is because I sort of enjoy it. I mean this is what you do for a living. Right? So the idea that I don't enjoy having conversations, even with people who don't get it, it's not enjoyable having your views radically mischaracterized as he as Kathy Newman was trying to do to you. That's irritating, but I was so over the top. It was hardly even irritated.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       It's mostly kept thinking, well, I don't know who you're talking to you, but it isn't me. Right? Exactly, exactly. And so because of, because of that, that's the most infuriating thing to people on, on the hardcore left and in the media, because if they can't fit you into that frame, it's what you were saying before the show started and if they can't fit you into this preconceived notion of Russian nesting doll that they've got for you. If you. If you don't fit in there, then they can't do anything with you. And if you're an open minded person who actually likes to hear exchange of ideas and you're willing to admit that there's a piece of evidence you may not have considered yet, it's almost impossible to be caught off guard. But these people refuse to acknowledge that there's evidence they haven't considered yet. Or do they just throw away the evidence?

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       Like if I brought you a piece of evidence that country that can do roll deed say, okay, that either fits in my worldview or it doesn't if it doesn't, but it's a real piece of evidence. Here's how I have to kind of shape and changed my world view in order to accommodate that piece of evidence. And I think that's what smart and decent people do. But at the media is not in that role. I think that's where Joe show was successful is because, you know, he's not a classical intellectual. He talks about ideas a lot. But the thing about joe is he's actually curious. He, when he asks a question and he'd like to know the answer, you know, and it's not so that he can demonstrate that he's right. But yeah, if this viewpoint, so obviously like everyone does because you have to have a viewpoint, but he does ask the questions he'd like to know the answers to and that's that and youtube seems to reward that, so hooray for them when it's also the fact that it's a longer forum, a longer span forum is also a nontrivial advantage because people can take the time to riddick into something.

Speaker 3:          00:25:17       I didn't think a lot about what makes all of these various people have such different stripes successful and what I realized is that so much of it is just like in any movie, it was the reason you watch a movie is because you know where the movie's going to end. It's going to end with the movie, go turning off the screen and then you're going to leave the theater. Right? The every movie ends the same way, but it's you're there for the journey. And so when you watch your show, Dave, and you're actually trying to pursue things and take people along your thought journey and when you watch your lectures on the Bible and you're tracking them along a journey, a journey of exploration and certainly with Joseph, joe or Joe is taking you for three hours through his thought process, asking questions and going somewhere and even when I'm doing my political show, my idea is here I'm going to lay out all the evidence and then try and piece it together so that we get to a conclusion together and you can disagree with any step I take along that way, but here's the journey that we're going go on so you can follow along with me.

Speaker 3:          00:26:03       I think what the media do is they just go straight from the beginning of the movie to the end of the movie with no journey and they just go, okay, here's the Intro, right? Luke Skywalker is on a planet by himself and then you just go straight to the Millennium Falcon flying where you're like, what? Just what happened in the middle there that why we're we're we then, or let's say your, your moment with Kathy, that we're sort of the glitch in the system now. Like to me that were the undecidable in postmodern terms there. There you go. That's it. That, that, that's a glitch. Like if we were watching the matrix, that's the glitch that you got to the, to the wasn't on Youtube. This was on real television. Not that that even matters more than this because I think this is the real thing now. But you caused the glitch. That's

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       what you did. You caused the glitch and her. She actually couldn't come up with words after, but you actually was actually a glitch in the system that then. Yeah, well that was aided. Everything else that you're doing isn't imposed narrative and I mean, part of that's a consequence of the pathology of the medium, I would say is that one of the things that's really like I stopped watching televised news like 25 years ago, but one of the things that made me stop was my realization that the newscasters would show a politician. Right. And then they'd give him like his 10 seconds or heard her 10 seconds to say something. Then they'd fade out the audio. Then the newscaster would tell you what the person said and what it meant. And I thought, oh, that's not so good. That's, that's there's something gone, gone horribly wrong there. And I think that's. It's become more and more like that over the last 30 years. Partly I think that's because journalism itself, classic journalism is degenerating. It's becoming a more and more desperate game for, for smaller and smaller stakes. But Youtube offers something that, that, that the traditional broadcasters just can't offer. And that's weirdly enough for something that started out with cute cat videos. It's actual depth and the capacity to have like a three hour conversation turns out people actually like that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:53       But that's why I think that youtube are particularly interesting cases because I view you as sort of like a pure political beast. And yet you've. Because of all of this, you now talk about religion. I think more than probably you inherently want to perhaps or all of these other things. And you as a clinical psychologist. But that's where you really started and now you end up talking about politics all the time. So again, this is why we all sort of got forced into this, into this space.

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       In the end, we ended up in the same framework to the ancient Greeks ended up in, right? They would all write a book on ethics and they'd write one on politics and then he would write one on, on the pilot and it all comes together. I mean if there is no such thing as apolitical, but by the same token, there's no such thing as a ethical right. I mean if you're, if you, if you are operating in the sphere of politics, you are going to end up. If you dig deep enough in the same waters that Jordan is used to being. And if Jordan elevates, you know, up on that chain far enough, he's going to end up in these sphere where I'm used to operating. Which is why there are videos of you talking to transgender people about about Pronoun use a. What happened

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       to me, I think was that like I was operating at a, let's call it a psychological level or a level of, of, of archetypal story essentially, and then the political intervened in that and said, I'm going to interfere with your freedom of speech. It's like, no, that's not happening. I know where that goes. Well, and then of course one of the scandals that emerged out of that this year was the scandal of Lindsay Shepherd at Wilfrid laurier university, which was the biggest scandal that ever hit a Canadian university, and it was like, how do I, in my most pessimistic prognostications about the consequences of bill [inaudible]. I didn't envision the inquisition of Lindsay Shepherd and so thank you very much. Postmodernists for making that manifest. So clearly is in the room. So if you. Can you tell that story? Well, there was a teaching. They a great episode on the Rubin Report.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       You should. Yeah. Well she's quite the creature. She's a. They picked what? They messed with the wrong girl when they went after her, but she was in the communications department at Wilfrid laurier university in Canada, and she had the temerity to show a five minute clip of me debating the biological reality of gender, let's say with a professor, Nicolas, Matt, who famously claimed that there were no biological differences between men and women and that was the scientific consensus for the last four decades. She showed a five minute clip to her class while and hypothetically someone complained, although it turned out that no one really did and that was brought to the attention of her professors and to an administrator named Andrea Joel who was basically hired as a, you know, a as an inquisition I would say by the university under legislative pressure. And they raked her over the coals for an hour and she taped it and she made it public and it's, it, it, it was a tape in which they compared. They said that playing a, a video of me debating pronouns was neutrally because she said she did it neutrally and there's no reason to disbelieve her. Was tantamount to playing a video by Hitler neutrally or Milo Yiannopoulos has been there. The radical leftists are so clueless that they can't even get their insults right. So I'm not Milo Yiannopoulos or Hitler. Sorry. It's one or the other and I've been in this building. This building has some people at it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       Yeah, I mean even right now we know that someone's going to write about this and write that this was the gathering of the alt right and all that other nonsense, but in a weird way, do we owe the potter. Postmodern is some thanks then because if you think about it, they took, they forced someone like Lindsay to be public now and I and I think she's wonderful as you know, just the tremendous intellect and Bret Weinstein, right? Like all the, all of these people, you guys, me, I mean everyone out of the James Damore. I mean he only is someone now with influence because they forced him to address these issues. So in an odd way we owed them. I mean, for, for all the complaining that we might do about these people, we owe them because they've sharpened not only, they've not only sharpened us intellectually, but I think they've allowed all these other people to wake up.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       Monitors had a point like the point is is that the world is susceptible to a near infinite number of interpretations that happens to be true. That's why developing artificial intelligence, especially perceptual systems, has turned out to be so difficult. It's very, very difficult to perceive the world because you can categorize it in literally in a near infinite number of ways. Okay, and then the next plane was. Well, it's very difficult to rank order those ways in terms of quality. It's like, yeah, that is very difficult, but then they pushed it too far. Therefore, there are no qualitative distinctions between loads of interpretation. It's interpretation all the way down. It's like, no,

Speaker 6:          00:32:28       no

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       good, good point. Hard to disagree with, but fundamentally wrong. There's a finite set of viable interpretations.

Speaker 5:          00:32:38       Well, the layman's term for that would be that some things are real, right? I mean is that the simplest way to say it? There are some things that actually are real. I think that's, that's, that's one objection. Another objection is there are some modes of being that lead you to perdition very, very rapidly and that's. And that isn't somewhere being human that you actually want to go. So there's the material reality that's outside the interpretive framework, you know, but then there's an ethical reality that isn't material and the same simple sense, but there's an ethical reality that's also not merely a matter of interpretation. I mean, the best example of that I know is Jaak Panksepp, Jaak Panksepp work with rats. I mean there's lots of models of this and the animal kingdom, but that this one is particularly good. So juvenile rats like to wrestle. So if you pair two wraps together, two males, because they particularly liked to wrestle and one of them's 10 percent bigger than the other one with the 10 percent weight advantage can pin the little one can consistently.

Speaker 5:          00:33:36       Okay, so you say you pair them once, they'll work to do this because they enjoy it. The big one pins, he wins. Now he's the dominant rap. You think? Well, there's dominance among rats. Yeah, except that isn't how it works because rats in the wild live in social groups and they'll play with each other, continually cross many games. So then let's say you pair the two routes together constantly. Okay. After the first bout the little rat, the loser has to invite the big route to play. That's the rule. So he does his little play and the big rep thinks, yeah, yeah, okay. I'll play. If you pair them repeatedly, unless the big rat lets the little rat win 30 percent of the time the little rat will start playing with them. I read that. It just blew me away. I thought, wow, look at that in rats, which have been used as a model for human behavior for psychologists for like 100 years in rats.

Speaker 5:          00:34:28       There's an emergent ethic of fairplay that emerges across iterated games. It's like, really? It's mindboggling, so we could use that. That would be an example of like when I'm playing basketball with my eight year old nephew, I occasionally let him live because I want to because he needs that reward going if I just beat him mercilessly and if you're good, you let him. When when he does something particularly spectacular, right? You push them. There's this thing called the zone of proximal development and it turns out that adults speak to children naturally at a level. It's slightly above their level of comprehension, so that's the meaning zone essentially, and so you keep the kid there because the kid can talk but also learn at the same time and if you're really playing well with your eight year old nephew, you're gonna let him win when he's pushing himself a little harder than you normally would and you think, well that's he is winning when he's doing that and so you want to set up the game to reward it, and that's an ethic that transcends mere interpretation. It's not. It doesn't only apply to human beings. It applies. And Frans de Waal who studied chimpanzee's, he's found quite clearly that it isn't the most tyrannical chimp who stays on top because the chimp tyrant who has no friends who does know mutual grooming, who's not

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       reciprocal, it's like he has an off day and two of his enemies tear him to pieces. So the tyrant champ sits atop a very unstable hierarchy. And so I've thought to, in the West, we don't have dominance hierarchies, we have competence hierarchies and those are completely different and you have to be a good player, have iterated games to maintain your position in a competence hierarchy. And that's the beginnings of a discussion about something like a fundamental ethic.

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       So That's interesting. I think I can segue this too, a little bit of the way that some of the media deals with you is that you, because you are fact based, you talk fast, you don't care. I mean you genuinely don't care about people's feelings. I know you pretty well now you don't that they don't. Maybe your wife, but they don't know how to respond to that then because they're used to dealing in a realm that is all about that. So now you come out and you're like, no, no, no, no. This is the way it is. I'll debate you, but you're not gonna beat me just because you happen to be gay or a woman or whatever else it is, and I think actually now that's a lot of the reason of your your surge.

Speaker 4:          00:36:46       I think that most people at root level don't actually want to think of themselves as their group identity first. I think most people would want to be respected on an individual level and so when I say in order for you to be respected on an individual level, that means that I'm not going to respect you on the group level. Meaning I'm not your group. Identity doesn't mean anything to me. Your individual identity means everything to me, but your group identity means nothing to me. And when I say individual identity, I don't mean how you identify, you know, in terms of race or gender. I mean, in terms of your thoughts, are your thoughts interesting, are they right, are they wrong, and they're either right or they're wrong and they're interesting or they're not, and that doesn't change based on who's saying it and if we could all get there, I think that that's what people find appealing is that if you can get there, then you can actually have a discussion about ideas.

Speaker 4:          00:37:25       If not, then you're just going to retreat into your identity and there's no way for me to have a discussion with you. I mean I just had a talk at Yukon and one of the students got up and was talking about abortion. Then she said, you know, I, I would never have an abortion, but you as a white privileged male, how could you talk about abortion? And I said, because right is right and wrong is wrong. Regardless of whether I am a white privileged male. I mean that's the basis for western civilization. Otherwise we can't have. We can't have a conversation. Then what happens if we can't have a conversation across groups and we just fight for dominance. That's exactly well that, and that's the postmodern worldview. That's all we're doing. It's like, fine, but like you're, you're, you're opening the door to the radical right wingers because they're going to come in and say, okay, no problem.

Speaker 4:          00:38:09       We'll play identity politics, but I'm not losing. How's that? Right. Well, that isn't the way you're supposed to play. You're supposed to be guilty. It's like, no, sorry, I'm not going to be guilty. I'm just going to be dominant. Exactly. This is the danger of the actual outright because with the own right is reactionary identity, politics, movements and left doesn't want to acknowledge its own role in helping to drive the, the emergence of, of a reaction or identity politics movement, which by the way, I find despicable because I think all identity politics, movements, artists, exactly

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       what I think, right or left. I did a year of shows on if the left doesn't clean them when I was still saying I'm on the left. If we don't clean up our house, what is going to happen and look what has happened. So shifting slightly a little bit, I thought this would be interesting. Is there a criticism, actually I'll start with you for using this one. Is there a criticism of you that you think is the most legit?

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       No criticism of me? You know, I, I think that

Speaker 6:          00:39:05       the,

Speaker 3:          00:39:07       the criticism of me that I think is legit is one that I think is probably common to most people, which is I, I tend to fall into confirmation bias, which is true for everybody. Uh, so, you know, I think that, but it, you know, when you're in the political realm, the easiest thing to do is to find evidence that supports your position and Cherry pick the evidence in order to support that position. And so if the idea is that I tend to do that, I try to fight that, but I'll acknowledge that that's a flaw, that I have a, that you know, when you're, when you're invested in a political fight, that the easy that, that your easiest mode of confrontation is to find stuff that supports what you already think as opposed to taking in all of the available evidence and then shifting every point as we were talking about before, uh, toward the, toward the right position. Uh, it's because I think it is a weakness. It's something that I, that I tried to fight as often as possible. And uh, I tried to make provision for that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:54       So, so before I ask you yours, um, what, what, what do I think, what do you, what do you think, what do you think is wrong in the band? And B, what do you think is psychologically the best way to deal with that? To be, to be aware, right? You're being aware of what your issues, limitations are, what your biases might be, psychologically, what's the best way to

Speaker 5:          00:40:13       yourself with competent people who, who have their areas of expertise that aren't yours and to listen to them, you know, and that's. That's helped me over the last 15 months because I've had about 10 people around me, five of them are family members, about five of them were friends who were extraordinarily competent people and they go over what I've been doing and they don't pull any punches. This feelings thing, this is something I'd like to spring to your defense about because the rule if you don't have an ethic is don't hurt anyone's feelings. It's like, okay, but which feelings do you mean? What do you mean? Like this seconds, feelings or do you mean the person's wellbeing across a year? Because lots of times when you're having a firm discussion with someone that upsets them in the present. This happens with children all the time, is you're.

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       You're not taking stock of their feelings at the moment except insofar as you have to because you want to help prevent them from cascading into catastrophe. For the rest of their life, it's like, well, I'm going to discipline you, right and I'm going to tell you why you were wrong. We're going to have a hard conversation because if you keep that up, your life is going to be a never ending stream of misery. Well, that's not cruel and so, but because people don't see the ethic of iterated games, let's say something like that. They say, well, you just shouldn't hurt anybody's feelings in the moment. It's like, no.

Speaker 3:          00:41:27       Well, this is why I think both you and I object to the whole idea of the pleasure pain matrix being the, the, the thing that matters

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       in terms of human happiness and because the bottom line is that you may be experiencing a good deal of pain right now, but that's going to lead to a more fulfilled life. That's the utility of sacrifice because everyone knows that give up something now in a rather painful way and you may benefit in the future. Yeah, the pain, the pain pleasures ethic doesn't work because of the problem of time. Exactly on time and other people. That's another reason that doesn't work. So it's, yeah, you need a way more sophisticated solution to that. So. So now let's turn that question to you. What do you think is the most legit criticism that you see? Because I see a lot of blue check, you know, twitter, people with 5,000 followers just attacking. Yeah. Very rarely about your idea though. They'll just make up something. Jordan Peterson says dogs are blue and green, uh, at somebody.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       Somebody basically did that and I invited him on the show to talk to you. And then of course he disappeared for I would say I have some problem with mood regulation, you know? And so sometimes I'm more irritable than I should be. Sometimes I'm more, I'm, I come across. Well, no, I probably am more angry than is optimal in the circumstance, you know, I mean, one of the rules of English common law for example, is that you're more or less allowed to defend yourself with minimum necessary force. And I've had to practice and practice and practice to use the minimum necessary for if you really want to hit him right now. Like that is the temptation. I mean, I think we all struggle with that. I mean there's certain times or somebody says something to say, Oh, I just, oh, I mean it's there, there's certain questions that get asked and it's just a slow pitch softball right down the center of the plate.

Speaker 4:          00:43:08       It's like, do I need to, do I need to hit this soft ball as hard as I possibly can, especially rough if you have a sense of humor too. But, but it's, it's really useful. And I have learned this. It's really useful to not defend yourself to vociferously, which is weird because you'd think, well you have the right to defend yourself. Like no all, no holds barred. It's like, no, actually doesn't work that way, that you have to defend yourself with minimal necessary force. And I think I managed that in the channel for interview, for Shank. Go on. Believe me. People have been talking to me about that nonstop for 15 months and I'm listening and it wouldn't work as well if he hadn't done that or if he just shall actor. If he just gotten right at her and said, what you are saying is so stupid for these five reasons, it would.

Speaker 4:          00:43:57       It would have been bad I think. I think the fact that you sat there and he just said, no, you're asking good questions and you know the fact that you're asking good questions demonstrates the invalidity of your entire field. That that was much more effective. Right. Well, and that's one of the things I've been meditating on for the last years. There's a line in the new testament says, resist not evil. I think, okay, what? Okay, what the hell you're supposed to apply. It's like because it's really a difficult thing to figure out. You really mean that you don't resist evil. Well, there's a couple of problems is if you punch back then you have a fight.

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       Well, but you can't just not defend yourself like weekly. You can't be weak and not defend yourself, but you can be strong and defend yourself minimally, and that's a real art. Like that's, that's the essence of sophistication. I would say. Like I'm not, you know, I come from kind of a rough place. I'm coming from northern Alberta. I come from the frontier, you know, and my town was scraped out of the bloody prairie 50 years before people move before, before I lived there. And so, uh, it's, it's been an, it's been a continual challenge to adjust my sophistication to the level of challenge and I've, I'm trying to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       Do you think that. I don't always manage it. Yeah. So to that point, do you think that we sometimes actually at a deep level use identity politics against ourselves in, in this regard? So you're sitting across from Kathy, she's female at some level. Do you think you may be moderated it because of that? Because had it been a male and you talk about this often, that we have to act differently towards males and females and there's a physical. There's physical reasons for that and biological reasons for that, but that had she been a male, say, say the same exact age from you, from Alberta and all of that, that perhaps your response might have been a little more forceful even though you're. We're all agreeing your response was done correctly and even handedly.

Speaker 5:          00:45:55       Yeah. Well, I. it's hard to say, but probably yes. That's interesting. Well, because you like, I can't. I don't think that you can say that you fight with a woman the same way that you fight with a man. That doesn't mean you can't fight with a woman. Doesn't mean you shouldn't, but I don't think the rules are the same. Now, why are the rules different? Well, some of the rules are, there's a physical limit. It's much more stringent, right? I mean there's a level of hinting out physical threat that you can bring to bear in a conversation between men that you cannot bring to bear in a conversation with a woman. So, and the mechanics of that are very, very subtle and difficult and it's especially challenging in an intellectual discussion because an intellectual discussion is a kind of war and it isn't obvious how men and women should go to war with one another. We don't know. We don't know how to sort that out. You. My sense has been on the panels that I've done is that I definitely have to pull my punches. If I'm on a panel with women, that doesn't mean that I don't. It doesn't mean that it's any less challenging intellectually, but the strategy and the attitude has to be different. It's much more likely that you'll be seen as a bully if you bring the same force to bear on a female opponent as you would on a male opponent.

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       Yeah. So I'm wondering if Hillary Clinton is a perfect example of this in the political sphere. You, Rebecca [inaudible] and hilary was running for Senate in New York and riskalyze. Lazio walk across the stage and asked her to sign a piece of paper and like them

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       headlines where they basically assaulted her. Right? Or if Rick Lazio had walked across stage another man, it's said sentence piece of paper, but like, what a tough guy look at that he's willing to stand up to him.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       So I suspect in that case your answer to this question is no. You would treat people the same if, if Piers Morgan that night had been female, you would have done the exact same.

Speaker 3:          00:47:47       Well, I mean I was, I was actually relatively polite to peers. So it's uh, it's, it, to me, it's, I try to be as polite as possible unless the person is being very impolite, in which case I'm happy to go employed. So I, I tried to, instead of trying to gauge sort of the, uh, we're doing the same thing just from different directions instead of trying to determine how I engage with the person by all of the various, you know, I, I let them take the first punch. Basically you take the first step in the waltz and then I'll respond in kind. So if you, if you wanna if you wanna act polite, that I'm happy to act polite with you and I'm happy to have a nice cordial conversation. If you want to get nasty then we'll get nasty and we'll do that. And I prep for interviews. So I'm happy if you want to go into mine, I'm happy to go to the mind. We can do that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       Yeah. So I want to circle back to something related to religion that we, that I wanted to get to earlier, but we're, we're doing a lot here. Um, do you think there's any difference or do you both think there's any difference? Ben's belief in Ben's Jewish and your belief is Christian comes from the Christian tradition. Yeah. Does that matter at hall? Whatever differences there are in that little place where you're both saying, you know, we see the reasons why our morals and ethics and all that come from this world. So acknowledging, uh, you know, the, the real world and biology and all of those things, whatever differences you may have, which I don't even know that we, that any of the three of us know what those differences are. Do they even matter?

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       They might. All right. That would be a lovely. I'd love to figure out if there are, if there are. I mean it depends. For me, it depends on the brand of religion that a person is, is espousing.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       So, so let's just, let's just do this with youtube.

Speaker 3:          00:49:22       I mean, so my, my feeling, and I'm writing a book on this right now actually, so I, I, there are certain principles that obviously under the Christianity that are from the Judaic tradition and that clearly the first manifestation of the prophetic tradition. Exactly. I mean it's, it's, it's essentially an attempt to merge Jerusalem with Athens is, is I think the, the book of John is the most obvious example of using the logo says as sort of the unifying feature and writing the whole thing in Greek. Right? I mean that was not the, the, the, the Lingua Franca of the time. That was not what people were speaking, excepted and educated circles. So I'm all the Judaic principles, things like a god involved in history, a god who cares about individuals, uh, the notion that you have a choice between good and evil, so choose good, uh, and that and so that you will live long on the earth, right?

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       The, all these things were taken forward into Christianity. The major distinctions in terms of, of Christianity versus Judaism are the idea that, and again, it depends on your interpretation of Christianity. Early Christianity sort of suggested that history had ended with Christ and then in later kind of iterations of Christianity that was moved beyond, right? It wasn't that history had ended, it was that Christ come back when history had reached its logical progression. The progression of history didn't end, but original messianism was, this is the Messiah were done, right? History is over. It was a millennialist religion. It depends on. Every few people think that that's right. So this is why I'm trying to distinguish, you know, brands of Christianity, because obviously there are serious differences even in basic root level between Catholicism and calvinism. And lutheranism and all these things have different iterations. So you know, my very strong belief in freewill and my actual building of a moral system in Judaism is building moral system on the notion of free will obviously runs directly counter to, for example, calvinism.

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       Calvinism suggest that freewill is a, is a miracle and there's no basis for it and uh, that God grants you grace based on what he wants to do. So it depends on the brand of Christianity. But I think that overall the conflict between Christianity and Judaism in large measure is, especially in the early conflict, was political rather than ideological and a lot of ways it was a new religion attempting to establish its own footing and was angry that, that Jews would not join this new religion and leave behind tradition. I think that there are certain ways in which Christianity, you know, like for example, the, the main distinction between Christianity, Judaism, the people usually make is that Christianity is a great space. Religion and Judaism is a religion. Meaning the Judaism says you sort of earn your way into heaven, right? You earn your way toward a better life, uh, and, and Christianity says, if you believe right, I am the way, the truth and the life.

Speaker 3:          00:51:50       If you believe, then you're good. But the truth is that Christianity sort of back doors, the, the Judaic view by saying, if you really do believe, then you're going to act in these particular ways to demonstrate your. There's this weird paradoxical relationship between the idea of belief in Christianity, the belief that that Christ came to save everyone from their sins and that all you have to do is admit that and you're redeemed. Like there's symbolic truth to that. That would take a long time to unpack, but there's also an injunction goes along with that to imitate Christ in your life. Exactly. I feel like a lot of these distinctions are almost, some of them are almost a little false. I mean, meaning that they're, they're either a Christian misreads of Judaism or Jewish misreads of, of Christianity, and that when you get to the root of it, I mean, this is what my mom says, that there are significant differences between Judaism and Christianity, but his view of Christianity from the Jewish historical point of view is that Judaism was never bound to convert billions of people around the world, but Christianity was specifically because we have a lot of crap we got to do.

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       I mean Jews have, we have 613 commandments, you know, we gotta we have to keep kosher. We have to do all of these things. I appreciate you doing a lot of them for me. Yeah, no problem. And taking care of it. Yeah, I'll, I'll transfer over the point. I'll give you one of my afterlife exactly. But uh, but I think that Christianity ends up doing a lot of those same things that, you know, there were supposed to be start distinctions just under a different guise. So when it comes to the, this is why in the modern world when the discrimination between from Christians toward Jews largely has, has ended, I think that what you're seeing is this tremendous confluence between particularly orthodox Jews and observant Christians on matters, on matters of values, uh, because once Christianity and in the late 20th century, in the Mid Twentieth Century in America more broadly with Christianity, because American Christianity is very different than European Christianity, once, once there was an idea that Jews were not the enemy to be converted, but we're, maybe you still want to convert me, but we're not going to come at you with a knife.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       We're going to come at you with the book and that we share a common framework for how the world is supposed to work. You may not agree with the second half of the book. Right? And then I think that that's, that's created a pretty good working relationship with [inaudible]. This is why I'm struggling to come up with what are the significant differences. And so I need, I need a Christian to tell me what is the significant difference. I can argue with that question because I know my own religion better than I know Marshall question is being, I don't know if the rule that the state plays in Judaism and Christianity is the same because I'm not sure what to make of the. Like what I would say is the Jews put a tremendous amount of emphasis on the state as a mechanism for salvation, something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:54:24       That might be the symbolic idea that underlies the establishment of Israel and I would say that in Christianity and the nation, or you mean like the government, I mean the nation, but then it gets tangled up with the government. Right? So, so, so. Right. This is a distinction that Jay, that Christianity is a universal universalistic religion, right? The idea is that it that in the Kingdom of God, everyone is Christian basically, and Judaism is not in one sense, but it is another which is that God identifies a nation that he treasures as his own and he has a special relationship with that nation, but Judaism is not exclusive. This with regard to who gets into heaven. So there's this, there's this basic idea in a in genesis that there are commandments that are given prior to the giving of the Torah, right? That there's the call, the Sheva Mitzvah Day and off the seven commandments that are given to the sons of Noah, meaning all mankind.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       And these are things like no murder, no idolatry, no adultery. They basically mirror a lot of the 10 commandments. And so the idea in Judaism is that God, it's almost like a priestly cased. God chose this specific group of people to be a light unto the nations by demonstrating what a godly lifestyle looks like. If you dedicate every aspect of your life to God. And then he said to everybody else, I know not everybody else is up to this and I and in fact Judy's are supposed to try and turn away conference, but if you, but you can still get into heaven. The idea that we are trying to force anyone into, into being Jewish, that that's not a thing. So nationalism without version. And think about that psychologically as an attempt to both manage the preservation of group identity. So that would be culture or cultural identity, which has some utility and also to be able to coexist with other things.

Speaker 3:          00:55:55       We're doing things in a different way and again, Judaism has had a long history of of it just like every other religion of sort of evolution on this stuff or like when you're the push of the book of Joshua, there's actual forest conversion that happens in the book of Joshua, but by the time you get to a mid, early Christianity and midpoint Judaism, right? Because Judaism and Christianity, then you're already talking about Jews who are not looking to convert people. They sort of want to live in their own state. They don't want to bother anyone else for the most part a. So the idea of like a tidal wave of conquering Jews going out. I mean, even to think about it now is hilarious, right? Nobody thinks about it that way. Except if you're a conspiratorial nutbag inquisitions usually work the other way. That's right. So,

Speaker 5:          00:56:37       so any, anything that you might've heard Ben just say, would any thing jive with the fundamental belief that you have that would cause a problem? You know what I mean, like coding a problem in I think in society. I think that one potential problem that's that's worth discussing, but it would take forever to discuss it is the relative role of the individual versus the state. I mean you see this argued out in the prophetic books and in the Old Testament, I mean there's the Jewish state and it's. It's sort of the central player in some sense, but there's clear evidence that it can become corrupted, can fall away, and then a prophet who's an individual has to step forward and re revivified it. Right, and so there's tremendous emphasis on the utility of the individual. You see that in Judaea, Judaism, I would say overall it's, it's a, it's a very cohesive.

Speaker 5:          00:57:29       It, it, it, it promotes in group cohesion, let's say, but it also allows for individual expression in a very interesting ways because there's tremendous emphasis in Jewish culture on learning and an articulation and mastery of ideas, and so that provides the space for the individual to flourish. With Christianity, you see more of a move away, I would say from the idea of the state now that's not necessarily without its troubles. One of the things you pointed out was, well, as Christianity becomes more about the individual, the religion itself tends to fragment like it did with protestantism until just fragments right to the point where every individual is their own church and then you have no continuity and new tradition and the Catholics were kind of a bulwark against that. But I do think that there's a discussion to be had about the relative role of the individual in redeeming the world, let's say versus the state in redeeming the world. And I would say the Christians come down more strongly on the side of the individual and the Jews come down more strongly on the side of the state now. Like I'm willing to be corrected about that because I've never actually been able to have a discussion with anyone about that. So

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       I think there's some truth to that. I mean, I think the idea of, you know, in, in Hebrew Ami, I like the idea of the nation of Israel being paramount and when you pray, you pray and collective terms, you don't pray in individual terms, everything is, is done in terms of inaccurate, in terms of we praying as a group, right? You're supposed to pray in a minion. So how do you square that away in your own ways? How do you square that away? As soon as there's a lot of enjoyable, there's a lot of play in the joints. Meaning that, uh, so for example, to take the most, to take the most obvious example, if you, if you were talking about the power of the Jewish state, uh, in, in sort of biblical context, there's tremendous argument between whether a kingship is a good thing or a kingship is a bad thing in the Old Testament, right?

Speaker 3:          00:59:10       I mean, it says, it says like Samuel, Warren's the Jewish people, if you take a king, here's what's going to happen. It's all going to suck, right? And then they form a kingship and things suck. And so there's a strong case to made the kingship was not actually what was wanted because you have an entire period of just judges and the judges are legitimately just individuals who are trusted by the people, but then they can be supplanted at anytime by another judge who's not from the lineage. So, you know, so when we say that that group identity matters in Judaism, it matters to the extent that you're following God's law. But if you stray away from that, the idea, I think Judaism has always said that what you do is what makes you part of the group, not what you are. So Judaism has a weird dichotomy in it, uh, that's largely driven by exigent circumstances, which is the idea of biological Judaism versus the idea of religious Judaism.

Speaker 3:          00:59:54       So I care very little about biological Judaism, like when somebody says such and such as Jewish Noam Chomsky's Jewish, like, so what I really don't care. And, and I think that most orthodox Jews, we basically biological Judaism or your mom was Jewish, which is the way that it works in Orthodox Judaism is the sort of the entry ticket to being Jewish, meaning you have to either have converted in or your mind has to be Jewish in order for you to become fully Jewish, but the practice is what matters to me more than anything else. And that's where you get back into grey space versus based a little bit. Right? It's also, that's another place where the group identity issue becomes paramount. It's like, well, there's this group, well, how has membership defined, but let's say it's, it's defined by ethnicity, something which would be related to the descent through the mother. It's like, well that's a problem. I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm saying it's uploaded demarcates. A group say, well, this is a group that only we can belong to. What's weird is you can convert in my way. I'd say when there's play in the joints, a lot of the problems are solvable through the idea that you can convert in. Judaism says you can't convert out, but then we don't punish people who leave. Right? But is it right? Which is different than Islam, but yes, it's actually a relatively important.

Speaker 3:          01:01:07       But I mean, one of the people who I worked with at my company, Andrew Klavan is a guy who was born Jewish and now is Christian, right? So in my view, he's Jewish, but am I going to like drag him down to my synagogue? Like that's not a thing. So it's. But uh, I think that what the group identity that the good, the one thing I will say for a group identity is that what we have seen is that if there is lack of group identity, that group identity is filled usually by nefarious groups. Meaning that people do have a necessity. The idea of existing that you find your meaning or your find your purpose or your find your identity just in yourself as an individual is not only wrong, it's belied by virtually all of human history. Make an argument for identity politics, but the point that, but, but what Judaism does, what America does, it says, find your identity in the ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       Right? That's the difference is when I'm. So this is what I don't care about biological Judaism, you know, particularly the, to. I care much more about the ideas that you hold. So I'm in favor of group identity. If group identity is built around a set of ideas that are worth preserving, I'm not in favor of group identity. Like I am a conservative. That's a group identity, right? But that's an identifier more than it's an identity. Meaning it's a way of identifying me as a person who thinks this way and because I think there are differences in,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       in modes of thought. Then those group identities. Do you matter? I mean this is why we get together. This is why we have discussions. This is why we have friends, family. But I'm glad you. I'm glad you said that the way you did because I. I try to challenge myself on that all the time because I talk about the individual. I believe in the individual and I want to make sure that I'm not going to let. If I, if we can, and this is what I think is one of the things that's broken down is we used to have a common purpose. Like I have this framework that I'm working on in the book that I'm writing where I basically say that in order for an individual to be happy, you need. You need four things. You need individual purpose. You need individual capacity. That the feeling that you can accomplish that purpose or at least make moves in that direction.

Speaker 4:          01:02:57       You need a communal purpose. You do need to feel like you're part of a group that's moving in the right direction and you need to communal capacity, which both allows the community to activate together and also protects your rights as an individual to do what you want to do in pursuit of your individual purpose. And that's the apotheosis of happiness. And that's what I think the founding fathers were trying to do in the United States, for example, set up a framework where you could fulfill all of these things, but you do need the idea of communal purpose. And one of the things that's happened post enlightenment is that people don't even think in terms of they either think purely in terms of communal purpose or not at all in terms of communal purpose, because they think either purely in terms of communal purpose and that's identity politics, meaning I'm black for the black community, should do x, or I'm Jewish, therefore the Jewish community should do x. and then there are people who think not in terms of communal purpose at all, meaning full on libertarian.

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       I make my own meaning. We don't have to have anything in common. We have. And, and that's a lie. Even Libertarians believe we have to have an idea of liberty and common live with other people that were right. Exactly. Harmoniously. And when we don't, and when we don't have any of the. When we don't have any sort of communal purpose and we live with a bunch of people with whom we share nothing, then it falls apart incredibly quickly. So here's, here's how the Christian drama, it looks to me it, it addresses this issue, right? So Christ is presented as a figure who is an absolute master of his tradition, right? He's debating with the Jewish elders when he's 12. So think about it psychologically is first your child and you're dependent on your parents and then you have to make the move from being a child dependent into the world, but you don't move from child to individually.

Speaker 4:          01:04:30       You move from child to group. That's your teenage gang. That's your adolescence. You have to catalyze your group identity. If you don't have a group identity, it's actually a developmental failure, right? But then you might think, well wait, a second group identity is necessary, but is it the highest? Is it? Does it represent the highest plane of moral achievement? The answer to that is no. You have to emerge from your group as an individual. Okay, so now this is how I read the Christian story symbolically, and this is a consequence most of have having students studied young. He said, look, you need group identity. That's the persona that you. Where you have to have a persona. You have to be able to wear a suit. You have to be. You have to simplify yourself for other people. You have to be able to play the game. Otherwise you're. You just have failed developmentally, but if

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       you're only a persona, then that's a big problem, partly because when the group goes insane, so do you. Okay, now you got to emerge out of the group. Okay, so now you need a symbol for what emerges out of the group. Okay, so Christ is the symbol of what should emerge out of the group. Speaking, psychologically, bear the tragedy of life. Speak the truth. Be Willing to transform through death. That's the rules. Now I'm speaking purely psychologically. You learn something new, you learn it, it makes you suffer. The part of you that's wrong has to die. You have to let go of that and it's hard, especially maybe you learn something profound. It's like, it's like you have to regrow and arm. It's really painful, you know, but you identify with the part of yourself that transforms through voluntary acceptance of suffering and that's what Christ represents as a symbol, and I think that that's.

Speaker 5:          01:06:11       I think that that's correct. Symbolically, this is what actually severed the relationship between Human Freud, by the way, because young laid out the, his understanding of Christianity in those terms and Freud, it wasn't a Jewish Christian thing because Freud was really he, he was Jewish by ethnicity, but no, no, not at all. He just didn't want to have anything to do with religious ideation at all. He thought that that would introduce, he called it like a tidal wave of black title wave of cultism back into what he regarded as a science. He had his point, but I think you've got the symbolic structure. Right, and so what does that mean in relationship to Christianity and Judaism? What's really complicated? Because you have the prophetic tradition in Judaism and the prophets are also symbols of people who emerge from the pathological group who stepped forward courageously and who reconstitute the group.

Speaker 5:          01:07:06       You believe these people could exist right now, which, which people? The profits. I think profits of sorts exist always. I think Dostoyevsky was a prophet niche. It was clearly a profit. I mean he predicted it was going to happen in the 20th century. Can you imagine predicting? The reason I asked that was because I think when people, when you say profits, I think people think of someone coming down from heaven and they're going to have a halo on or some crazy, but you think that that's what I'm trying to get to the right now. I

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       fully agree with this. In fact, I was my manatees. Manatees has an entire section in guide for the perplexed about prophecy and what he says is there's Moses level prophecy which is the the legislating profit which is and he says he's the only legislating profit in the Jewish view, but all the other prophets are just people who see things incredibly clearly. Essentially there are people who've studied philosophy and who have studied human morality and has studied the human being and then that's the way down on the iceberg. That's just the thing that makes them different. Exactly. And so in that sentence, people who predicted the thing about, you know, providing a certain level of stability for folks and we're, you know, I think, I think there are levels of prophecy is what I'll say and I think that the better you are at, at recognizing human behavior and the interplay of forces, the better

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       you are at saying, okay, here's what's going to happen next week. I think it's very difficult for anybody to say here's what's going to happen a hundred years. Because if you could predict that you make a lot in the stock market, but I think that you can certainly, you know as well, you can also get a sense of plate tectonics like the details rob out. But like, and I think that's where we're at now. Like I believe we're in, we are in a war of ideas. We're, we're, we're, we're at a point where we're debating the validity of postmodernism now and that's tainted with neo Marxism and that should have been laid to rest a hundred years ago. We're driving because that, that just. I mean, the reason that the DMO postmodernist can't let go of neo Marxism is because there's no impetus forward in postmodernism. That's fundamental flaw. It's like, well, there's no grand narrative.

Speaker 4:          01:09:02       It's okay. Like, what are you going to do tomorrow? Well, I don't know because everything's the same as everything else. It's like, well, you can't live. You can't live that way. It's impossible to live that way. While I will just sneak some Marxism in the back door, it's like, well, that's. That's prime a fascia evidence in my estimation that your philosophy is pragmatically lacking even though you can make a perfectly coherent case for it. It's like you can't live it out. You just can't do it, so you have to sneak in this pathological Marxism in the back door. Well, no, that just invalidates your entire system. But apart from all that, I think the postmodern objection to meaning is actually wrong. While we talked about this earlier, I do believe that there is a transcendent ethic and I do believe that it touches on the metaphysical.

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       I believe if people experienced that because people are perfectly capable of having unalterably profound religious experiences and the naturalistic materialists don't know what the hell to do with that, they have no idea what to do with that fact. Say, well, it's delusional. It's like, well, hang on a sec. People who have those experiences appear to be more successful and healthier, so when exactly in what manner is that delusional and if you induce it in the lab with Psilocybin, for example, among people who are dying of cancer, their fear of death goes away. It's like that's you're going to just lay of the lay that out there as delusional or you quit smoking. 80 five percent success rate with one mystical experience on psilocybin produces 85 percent cessation rate and smoking completely and with MDM, a ecstasy. The three treatments with Mtma. That's what the current research indicates produces a 72 percent cure rate for intractable posttraumatic stress disorder.

Speaker 4:          01:10:42       It's like those are miracle cures and no one, and they have to be accompanied by the mystical experience. No one knows how to account for that and so there was a transfer, so it's a very physical thing. I mean in a case like that, you talked about Iowa or any of these things, right, that you're eating something, you're ingesting something, smoking it, whatever it is. It's physical. It's here and now, but the experience is metaphysical is metaphase. That's a place where the biological and the transcendent touch and we don't know what to make of that. Well, that's why psychedelics through our whole culture into such a such a

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       flip this upside down. No one knew what to do with them. You know? I mean the Indians regarded psilocybin as food of the gods for a reason and when people have encountered psychedelic substances throughout human history, that's always how they've been characterized as, right food of the gods. It's like beware of them, but there they opened the door to the transcendent and well, I think the evidence that they are doing something that psychedelic substances are doing something that we seriously don't understand at all. Not a bit is overwhelming. Rick strassman wrote a book on his experiences giving Dmt to a whole bunch of people down in. He was at in Austin, I think strassman's a pretty straight scientists, you know, he was interested in measuring psychophysiological responses to the drugs. Well, he'd give people dmt and they all came back with the same story. I was blasted out of my consciousness.

Speaker 5:          01:12:05       I went, I met a whole bunch of alien beings. They were really surprised I was there and then I came back and it was the most real thing that's ever happened to me. And straussman would say, well, you know, well, you had a Yogi and archetipal experience, or it was a dream and they'd say, you don't understand. Then he got so distraught because of these continual reports that he had stopped doing the research and like I'm not making a claim for, for anything metaphysical here, but I'm definitely pointing out that there are undeniable realms of human experience that involve religious experience and a sense of the infinite transcendent that looked like they're healthy and that you cannot deny well. So what are you supposed to do with that? Well, you sold a box and you say, well, we're not going to pay attention to. It's like, that's not gonna work.

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       Yeah, that's not going to work. And I've done a lot of those things that you just mentioned and virtually always had good experiences on them. Now is someone that I'm pretty sure he's never smoked weed mushrooms. You haven't? Okay. You haven't done Mtma and all that stuff will take a drink. Yeah, I mean I've done all of those things. I don't really do. Well. I mean I smoked some weed but I don't. I'm not doing. I haven't done ecstasy and years and mushrooms. I did do about a year ago and I had a great day and I kind of wandered around and I thought I, you know, I felt some, some things happening. I didn't. When I did them in college, I had a couple of those type of transcendent feeling. I was just part of something, whatever. But. So when you hear all this as someone that doesn't partake in any of this stuff, what do you make of that? That people can perhaps use some substances that you're not down with on a personal level to get to a place that I think you actually think is a good place.

Speaker 3:          01:13:46       I mean, I think the answer is that it depends on the level of expertise of the person using it is what I would suggest, you know, the idea, like I'm not against prescription medication. So if you're talking about, you know, an actual program that is going to better somebody's life, that's one thing. But if it's somebody who's just, I want to have a religious experience than perhaps in Lsd. And then there's some serious downsides to drugs that I, I do wonder if it is necessary it. Well, two things. One, the

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       in, in, in Judaism, and I keep reverting back to this because I know it's the religion. I know, um, but there, there's two kinds of schools of thought with regard to Judaism. One are called the, uh, the, the Ms Dot [inaudible]. These are people who are sort of enlightenment mentality, hard science folks. And the Hasidim not considered murder. The people he see really Kabod, they have the, the big beards. And of the past, uh, and they, and they like to dance and they drink on, on Purim and, and all this and that. They're wonderful people and they a great outreach specifically because they're so spiritual and I tend to be more of this noggin than a, than a faucet, meaning that, uh, it's, uh, I, I try to get to dance. Oh, it's nice operating. Uh, but I, I, I try to get to spirituality through reason as opposed to through experience simply because I think that, well, I know people who've had religious experience and it's really changed them.

Speaker 4:          01:15:01       I think there are also a lot of people have religious experience and it lasts for a given amount of time and then they're done with the religious experience and they just go back to doing whatever they're doing. Right. I mean this is what you were doing in college. So I think that if you're looking for that as a gateway out of whatever it is that is troubling you in terms of a lack of purpose, like a permanent solution, maybe that works for a small number of people. But I, I, I highly doubt that most people can find a level of purpose necessary to drive the entirety of the rest of their lives outside of a framework of conscious will, moving them in the direction of doing the right thing. You told people, he talked about Mescalin and Lsd in the context of Huxley's introduction of those substances into the Western world.

Speaker 4:          01:15:38       And he said two things in is inimitably wise manner. The first thing he said is beware of unearned wisdom, man, man, that's great. And he also said you, you have to be very careful about about entering the realm of the gods because you end up with a responsibility that might be more crushing than you can tolerate. And it's the same kind of idea. And I thought, I've never read anyone who wrote wiser words about the dangers of psychedelic use than that because he didn't say, well, none of this is real. He said it's more real than you want it to be. And so watch the hell out. And I think that's extremely good advice and it is very difficult for people to integrate those experiences into their life. Although my experience with people has been, and I've seen this with lots of people, they've said that they've done mushrooms, for example, how to mystical experience and that that provided them with a moral compass that they lacked before.

Speaker 4:          01:16:27       That never went away. And I've talked to many people who've had that experience so, but you know, I've also been in Amsterdam watching the 50 year old punk rockers and beer and go pound out some street kid. There was the downside of transcendence is something that's not to be trifled with and there's also the opportunity not to go to heaven but to go to hell. And that does happen to people and that can be, that can induce posttraumatic stress disorder essentially. So, you know, be aware of, be aware of wandering and realms, not competent to wander, rather they, yeah, that's my, that's my central take. And then I think it's really good for you. Like I think that what you're doing really works because you know, you, you do Kinda what I

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       did with a biblical lectures except you take it to an even greater extreme. I would say you're so rational in your approach, like people know that you ever religious over view, let's say, but you don't use that. You use it less than I do, I would say. Yeah, and I think it really works well for you. I think it's very.

Speaker 3:          01:17:26       I think it's hard to for his faith on people and I don't think it's wrong to force faith on people. So if you want also counterproductive. Exactly, exactly. And I, I'm not preaching that you have to agree with how I got to these values to say that these values are necessary for the civilization. And this is essentially what I said to Sam when I was debating him is his, you know, he said, well, you know, a lot of religious people. He sort of suggested that I think that atheists can be moral people. And I said, I don't think that that's true at all. I mean the point that I'm making is you have to get to these valleys to have a civilization. How you get to those values, in my view, you know, I think requires a leap of faith. You can make that leap of faith a variety of different ways, but you're going to end up needing these central values at road if you're gonna build a civilization off of that, so whether you do that through, you know, the, the kind of method that the team wants to get to. What was weird is it, you know, Sam and I come from completely different perspectives on virtually everything, but we share probably 90 to 95 percent of our values and so what I was suggesting is that those values are rooted in a Judeo Christian civilization that is mixed with a Greek civilization that brought us to the same place because we grew up five miles from each other. So of course we have the same values, right?

Speaker 2:          01:18:27       Yeah. It was counter argument to that. Basically would be that you're really talking about enlightenment values, but you would say those values ultimately came to. The funny thing about that is that's actually a silly argument that those are enlightenment. I hope you guys will talk about when you're on stage together. Biologists have already made short shrift of that. It's like Sam can't be an evolutionary biologist and say that the values that run Western civilization sprang from the enlightenment. It's like you don't get to have those two timeframes at the same time. I may have slightly so putting words out there and can see that I disagree with you a little bit about the atheist issue because I think this is the reason. It's like if you think about the layers of the mind with the iceberg analogy, it's like, well, you've got your, your, your, your patterns of action, and then you've got your justification for those patterns of actually might think that those are rational, but, but then there's something underneath that which is like the images that represent reality and the stories that represent reality and then there's something underneath that even and I think that to be religious is to have all of those things in order simultaneously and I don't think that you can have an ethic that's only grounded in rationality because I think the integrity of that rationality depends on the type of stories that you don't understand that that exists.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       So let, let me rephrase that. I actually agree with everything you just said when I say that we have to ground these values in order for us to build a civilization. How you get there as your own business. I mean on an individual level, I don't mean that every way you get to those values as equally valid or otherwise it Sam and I would agree like I, I do not think that the, the mode of thinking from evolutionary biology to the values that I think are necessary for building a civilization.

Speaker 2:          01:20:02       Even if I see weaknesses coming up in Sam's representations for this reasons, the first thing is he has to

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       dispense with consciousness and he has to dispense with freewill and I actually think that's deeply problematic and I think the reason he has to do that and Dennett does it too, is because there is something metaphysically strange about consciousness and you can't allow for that if you're a reductionist, materialist. And so I'm more than willing to say, look, I don't understand consciousness at all. And the more I think about it, the less I understand it because it seems to be the linchpin of being without consciousness. There's no being we could say, well the material reality continues. It's like, well maybe and maybe not because we do not understand the relationship between time and space and consciousness. So there's no, it's not self evident that what you're saying is true. It might be true, but even if it was true, well, exactly. How does the universe that has no conscious ness in it exist?

Speaker 4:          01:20:56       Like how do you parameterize it? Does it have a duration? Does it have a size? Does it have any qualities? Like what is like a video game that no one's playing, right? It's like, well, what is that exactly? Well that this is, this is where we get to, you know, back to that three hour conversation that you and Sam had as to the nature of truth and what exactly truth is. And one of the things that I always will, I don't want to, you know, Critique Sam's ideology without him here to defend himself. Although it's fun. It's definitely fun, but we'll have to have been here to actually actually do that. It'd be a lot of fun. But one of the things that I've always found weird is that he and I have precisely the same notion of an objective truth, but I don't understand where he's getting his from, meaning like I'm getting, I don't either like, well, and he also, because if he, if he, if he, if you base your viewpoint on in a materialist evolutionary biology than what you would say, w what you would say is the truth is that which is most biologically successful, right?

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       That's the claim I was making when I talked to Sam. Right, exactly. Which is which is your claim, and also a claim that leads to religion because biologically speaking, religious believers are more biologically successful. The nonreligious believers, all history, religious belief evolved, right? That's the thing. Not only did religious belief evolve, clearly it evolved. It's one of the human universals. The capacity for religious experience evolved. When you might say, why? Well maybe you could. You could take the viewpoint that seems to be characteristic of Steven pinker and say, well, it's a spandrel. It's just a side effect of something more substantial. In my objection to that is define your spandrel first. You know, you don't get to eat right. You don't get to define a way the side effects of the drug. Right, exactly. That's exactly it. You know, when people talk about drugs, very often what they'll do is they'll say, well, you know, the drug is for a headache, but it has the side effect of causing your cancer. It's like, well, no, the drug causes cancer. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:22:38       right. They're getting rid of the headache is the side effects. I mean, every one of those prescription commercials, you know, headache, diarrhea, nausea, thoughts of suicide, et Cetera, et cetera. But your cough, Michael, you know, it's really nuts. All right, here's what we're doing. So I want to be very respectful of, of both of your times, but yours particularly because you're doing like a two hour lecture tended to the orpheum. There might be a surprise guest there. I don't want to say who, uh, so we're gonna do a half hour more if you guys can do that. We're going to do a q and a from the audience, but I do want to ask guys one other thing first and I just want to try to get this to truly be as as personal as I can get out of you guys in front of thousands of thousands of people as these last couple of years it happened and as you both raising profile and you're out there saying what you think all the time and defending your beliefs and being friends with people like Sam who you disagree with on different things and all that. What, what sort of been the most personal thing that you've kind of struggled with along the way?

Speaker 5:          01:23:31       I want to go deep before we open it up to the audience. Well, for me it's two things. One is for, it's not so bad now. It's still pretty bad. Like I've lived in constant existential terror of saying something that will be fatal because I've been in this situation for 15 months where, well, and there's been a few things that I've done or said that have people have argued skirted the edges and perhaps they did. Because if you say 10,000 things, something's going to skirt the edge, but I've been, I've had to watch myself in an intensely hypervigilant manner to ensure that I don't provide those who would like to

Speaker 5:          01:24:13       provide those who regard me as their enemy with the tools to dispense with me and you know, I have my family resting on me as well as well as whatever else I happened to be doing. So that's been extraordinarily intense. And the other thing is, is persistent feeling of surreal seriality that see one of this, one of the markers of posttraumatic stress disorder is that you can't believe that what's happening to you is real. It's like I felt that for literally I felt that way every single day since September of 2016. And so I just cannot get accustomed to. Well, even just to the scandals that I've been involved in, it's just one scandal after another, you know, and I, I, I don't know, I don't have a frame of reference within which to put this.

Speaker 1:          01:24:57       Yeah, I think that I'll just briefly say for myself, I think, I mean both of those, right? We're all afraid of the one thing that you're going to accidentally just misspeak or say something right out of context. You wave a meeting,

Speaker 5:          01:25:10       something stupid defending yourself in which you could certainly do. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       He had been writing columns since I was 17. No, I know there's one line with you that you wanted one tweet that you sent that you regret now and it's like, I don't need to read the tweet in the actual tweet thread. I explained exactly what I meant in the tweet, but nobody ever reads the next tweet that literally explains what I meant in that tweet. We don't even have to mention which tweet to just add more fuel to the fire button, but very quickly because I do want to get to the, to the audience questions. I think for me, the second one is the one that I struggled with it this surreal one that's sometimes I'll look and see what people are saying about Dave Rubin and I and then I for a moment I'm like, wait a minute. I'm Dave Rubin. I don't think any of them.

Speaker 1:          01:25:48       Even if I do think even if it's something they're nice saying about me, I'm like, wait a minute, that to me and, and also just the other part of, you know, we, we sort of live close to each other. It'll proximity and I'll go out and, you know, the Petco will say something nice to me and then for some reason they always, they like Ben more but they look great. But like I go out and then I'm like, wow, like the things that I'm doing has meaning to people. Like there's a lot of built in pressure or at least for me, there's a lot of responsibility. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:26:14       Well I feel that too because now whenever I go somewhere people come up and they almost always say the same thing. They say, you know, I was in a pretty dark place and I'd been listening to your lectures and they've really helped. Thanks a lot. And I think, man, if you could have your wish and you could, what strangers would say to you on the street? What a cool thing. No kidding. But it's also kind of a terrifying thing because you know, people have pinned, well, let's say they've pinned their hopes on what I, what I'm saying, that's the right way to say it, but in some sense that also means they pinned their hopes on me and like I'm not by any stretch of the imagination perfect far from it. And so I do live in constant terror of sinking my ship in a, in a know, in a particularly awful manner. I still think that's the most likely.

Speaker 3:          01:27:00       Oh No, I wake you up again. This where you just wake up and terror in the middle of the night that somebody is going to take something that you said out of context and you think, did I really say it exactly the way I meant to say it? That didn't mean that that. Yeah, that's, that's a definite thing. And then you and it that the upside is that people listen to what we're saying and take it seriously. And the downside is that people are taking and taking it seriously.

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       So for you then, would it be something, I mean, without getting too in the weeds, like saying related to security or something? I mean, you, when you travel now you have to have someone with you.

Speaker 3:          01:27:29       I mean, it's ridiculous that I filed under surreal because I actually have never thought of myself as in serious physical danger. Even when people say you're serious physical danger. I think it was like this is America. Am I really in fiscal? Like whenever I do these lectures and I've got a security team of 10 people around me when I tell myself maybe it was me whistling past the graveyard is I'm the safest guy in the room. I'm older. Um, but it's. Yeah, I mean that's weird. The confluence of politics now is so odd. I mean, the last night during the state of the union, they introduced trump as the president of the United States and I just find myself laughing out loud because what in the world is going on? Like I forget that I liked a lot of the stuff he's doing, like what in the world?

Speaker 3:          01:28:05       And, and there's a, I was reading a book about Brahms the other day and in this book about Brahms, it talks about how he's hobnobbing with, uh, with various other composers. He's friends with Jacques and he is fights with wagner and he's, and he's, and he's walking in these circles and I thought, wow, that must have been a cool thing to walk in these circles. And then I look around and I realized that the people that I work with in 100 years, this may be the people that they're writing about, right? Is like. And that was the day that Shapiro got together with Ruben and George Pearson and talked about deep issues of philosophy and you realize, well, how did we end up in this position? Like this is one of the issues of existential terror I have is are we the best that we have to offer? Like I look at all the people in the White House for example, I know like half the people in the White House and I think is this the pinnacle, like are like, that's not a rip on the people in the White House. That's some grip on humanity, like is this the best that we can do? Am I even close to like, why should I be in this position of prominence? Like there's got to be people smarter than am I mean a lot

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       of them. There's a beautiful thing I would hope and I got it. I asked somebody this, so this thought experiment the other day, which would, which would you prefer to be the smartest man in the DM civilization or the dumbest madness Martin civilization and I think I can honestly say I prefer to be the dumbest man in a smart civilization and some sort of something disquieting about being seen anyway as one of the smart people and dumb civilization. Well, you know what, there are literally thousands of people watching this live, obviously in that election is over the next couple of months and hopefully there will be some people that will come up with some better ideas than Ben Shapiro and Jordan Olsen and Dave Rubin and we'll find something else do. All right. Here's what we're gonna we're gonna. Take a quick little break. Uh, I know already they're giving me the signal. We have roughly 400 billion questions. We will do our best to be brief. That's easy for you guys. What we're known for. That's another thing. I've known him for A. Alright, so give us just like a minute or two. Hang tight right there. Uh, the questions in a moment.

Speaker 1:          01:32:05       Alright guys, we're going to try to plow through as many questions as possible. As I said, Jordan is at the orpheum theater here in downtown Los Angeles tonight. Um, it's sold out already, right? There's gonna be riots outside. Uh, but if you have a ticket you will see Jordan later. Uh, here we go. All right, super chat for Jordan. We're going to try to do these as quickly as possible. I've recently taken your understand myself personality test and scored very low in all aspects of agreeableness. I have the cognitive ability to emulate these aspects and do so for the benefit of putting my kids in community here is emulation or enough or do I have to actually take the steps in showing and honestly showing, okay.

Speaker 5:          01:32:37       Agreeableness, can you fake it? Basically? If, if, if emulation is motivated by a, let's call it a noble aim, the understanding that reciprocity is necessary, there is evidence showing that disagreeable people do quite a bit better if they go out of their way to do things for other people too. They make that a practice. And the thing is, is if, if you're an introvert, you have to become a conscious extrovert, right? If you're, if you're, um, so, and if you're disagreeable, you have to become consciously agreeable. You can do it. And emulation is the first step to incorporating it, I would say. So if you're doing it to manipulate people, well that's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:11       Different story, man. I mean there's, there's a ton of people here that donated on super chat just to say hi and thank you. So hello to everybody. I'm a quick one for band. I think we've already hit this, but any chance of a future discussion with Milo? No. Okay, fair enough. Um, have something to say. Okay. Here's an interesting one. And Jordan, during the break mentioned that we should be doing a show on the future at some point. Do you think like me, that abortion and artificial intelligence will eliminate humanity as we know it? I'm watching this new Philip k Dick thing on Hulu now, so

Speaker 5:          01:33:44       I'm very, very into it. Come on, you can do it. You're a Scifi guy. You can get it. We could talk about Ai. Ai is going to transform what human beings are dramatically. We're going to have to decide in what manner we want to be transformed and we should bloody well hope and pray that the people who are leading the technological revolution are careful and ethical. People just don't. It hasn't. That ship sailed. I mean, I feel like we know already that that's not how it's going to be. We know there's so many problems related to the diversity memo and the algorithms and all that already from the tech companies, people working on these. You shouldn't be. You should be terrified of this transhumanism. It's like, what do we want to turn into? We need a vision of the future, which is why we need to talk about the future.

Speaker 5:          01:34:25       What am I think one of the things we need to do collectively is to develop. It's like, okay, I believe that the human race can do anything it wants in the next 30 years. You know, Gates was talking. Bill Gates was talking the other day about eradicating malaria. He's really set on eradicating the five major transmissible diseases that could happen. We could eliminate most of our problems. It's like, well, we should concentrate on the future that we would like to have and try to bring it into being and then maybe we can get artificial intelligence to serve that instead of serving whatever in Kuwait and pathological set of principles that it's serving now, which we will suffer for it.

Speaker 1:          01:35:02       Yeah. Well, let's cross our fingers. What is the likelihood that the sjw postmodern left collapse will happen soon? Basically?

Speaker 3:          01:35:10       Um, I think that it's more likely than people think it is. I'll put it that way. I think that right now the, the sjws think that they are on top and they think that they are ascendant and I think that the growing popularity of people who are not that, especially among young people, I mean my entire audience is young people like legitimately mind higher audience is people who are under the age of 40 and probably half. It's under the age of 25 and I would, I probably imagined since him for you Jordan, um, you know, I think that the, there's a whole group of young people who are just looking at this stuff and innately saying I'm bored with it. There's nothing here. And so I think there's a good shot that did the identity politics is actually an older person's game.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       Yeah. Uh, all right. You know, we're, we're only gonna do two more. What will, we'll categorize, categorize all of these and maybe next time you guys are on, we'll, we'll get, we'll hit some of these. Um, but we'll do two more because I think they're good. They sort of hit right where we're going here. Uh, you both can answer this, but it's directed to you, Jordan, any followup on your call earlier this month for students to stand up and leave the classroom whenever the teacher mentions equity, diversity and justice, and I know this is something you've talked about a bit about how you deal with

Speaker 5:          01:36:12       college professor. This was for junior high and high school kids to talk to their parents about. Well, I was trying to provide people with easy markers to note that their children are being indoctrinated, not educated, and I said, well, if they're talk about equity, diversity, inclusivity, white privilege or gender, it's time to leave the class. And I, and now that didn't cause nearly as much trouble that video is. I thought it might be. That's a pretty dangerous idea to be telling that to a 13, 14. Yes. But it's also dangerous not to tell them that. And I mean it's particularly Germane in Ontario where the elementary teachers, Federation of Ontario has explicitly developed a social justice curriculum with that name, whose explicit purpose is to transform kids from kindergarten to grade eight into social justice activists. They've even bent the selection of literature to promote that, so they're perverting art for ideology and that's the official policy, the elementary teachers, Federation of Ontario, if they're going to do that, play that game.

Speaker 5:          01:37:07       Then for me to say, look, here's five phrases that that are pretty decently diagnostic. You can be pretty certain that if these topics come up in your class that you're now into indoctrination territory. Yeah, I think people should walk. What's the risk though of saying that to a kid that may come home and the parents may not even understand these issues enough to defend risk, risk everywhere, man, it's, it's, it's the risk of going along with it. There's the risk of standing up against it and I believe, and that's why I've been doing what I've been doing, is that I believe that the risk of stating that this is dangerous and should stop is way less than the risk of going along with it.

Speaker 1:          01:37:44       All right, so this is going to be. This is gonna be the last one for now. We will pick this up at another point and we also discussed during the break that maybe we can do some kind of live thing together with this whole crew of people that we're talking about. We'll see who we can get to that probably in la, but we'll see. Uh, this one, I'm sure I've asked you some form of this in our other interviews before, but I think it's, it's the one that sort of handed this back to the, to the audience for both of you for some time now. I've wanted to start doing something to protect liberty and western values, et Cetera, but I have no idea where to start. What's the most useful thing I can do to start as an average person?

Speaker 3:          01:38:15       I mean, I think that my answer, this is sort of the same answer as to what you just do in life generally. Find something that you're good at, find something you like to do and find something that's useful. And where are those three things kind of conflate? Well, what are those three things? Overlap. That's where you're going to be the happiest and that's where you're gonna feel you're making a difference because if you only have two of those three things, then you're butting your head against a brick wall. If you'd like to do something and you think that it's going to influence other people, but you suck at it, it's not going to work for you. So try to openly identify your own skillset, find what it is that you're good at, and then figure, how do I use this skill set something I'm good at and enjoy doing? How do I use that for a purpose that is, that is useful, and it sounds like you already have your purpose. It's just a question of what can you do that that actually helps effectuate that purpose without knowing your skillset. I don't know, but if I knew your skillset, then I could help define what you could do with that to get from point a to point b.

Speaker 1:          01:39:04       So I suspect you probably.

Speaker 5:          01:39:05       Yeah, but what about the courage, but I would just add a little bit to that. It's like there are some things that you will see that will bother you. Some of those are your problems. That's why they bother you. Like there's lots of things in the world that are happening that don't bother you. It's like they're not your problems. The things that bother you for some reason or your problems. Find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you could start fixing and start fixing it. That's, that's it. And you know you should do it competently. Doing a domain where you're competent in a domain where you're interested, but there are things that you'll see around you that you think couldn't be set right that you could set. Right. It's like, go for it. You'll get good at it, and then you will get bigger and bigger things. Right. That's, that's, that's where to start. Start small. You won't end small.

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       I mean I can tell you in the most intimate way as you guys are now in my house, in my studio that we built, that's funded by the people that are watching this. I just had an idea that I started talking about it. I started a youtube channel that literally everyone watching this can do. You start. I mean, look at the three of us. We all started putting stuff out there going, is this going to work? None of us were greenlit. I've never been greenlit or had any respect from the industrial together. Listen guys, it was a pleasure. Really. What do you do before so you can take a nap. Maybe. I'm definitely going to take a nap. You don't take naps because Ben Shapiro take that nap.

Speaker 1:          01:40:25       Fair enough. Fair enough. It's been a pleasure. Guys will figure out some ways to expand this to the wider group and do some live events and everything else and we'll. We'll keep this conversation going. Thank you guys for all the comments. I promise you. We're gonna. We're gonna list everything out, so whether you submitted on superchat or patron, we'll try to get back to all this stuff and when I do my live streams, I'll try to address some of this directly. So thanks for watching and thank you for Youtube for actually allowing the stream to be up. What are the chances were
