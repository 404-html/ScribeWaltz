Speaker 1:          00:00:01       No.

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       All right. Before I get to what's going on in the world this week, I want to once again thank all of you who support what we do here on the Rubin report. I'm thrilled to finally be able to show you our brand new home studio today. It took a tremendous amount of blood, sweat, tears, and yeah, even money to build it and we simply could not have done it without you. Of course, the main thanks goes out to all of you who donate monthly to the show on Patrion. As you guys give us the budget to create content as we see fit with no executives, bosses, or middlemen between me and you beyond our patrons. I also want to thank all of those who have given one time donations on paypal as well as to all of you who watch light comment on and share our videos with our new home studio.

Speaker 2:          00:00:47       We can fully expand on everything we've been building here, including more shows, longer interviews, and new segments. I truly believe that the ideas of classical liberalism, logic, reason, and individual liberty are the only solution to the authoritarian and extremist problems we're seeing all over the world right now. I'll continue to have conversations with people I both agree with and disagree with and just as importantly, I'll continue to listen to you from my Patriot on one on one chats to group Google hangouts to emails and yeah, even twitter, you guys consistently amaze me at your insight and desire for truth. My commute is now just 10 steps down the hall from my bedroom and I promised to use that new found time to make this show even better than before. You've truly helped my dreams become a reality and somehow we're right back at the beginning.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       In the course of the month that we were building this studio, basically a million things happened. I'm not sure if you've heard about this, but we had an election in the United States and Donald Trump. Yeah, Donald Trump is now the president elect. While most of the media seemed to be completely blindsided by the results, I can honestly say that I wasn't. I talked to and listen to people like Scott Adams, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Mike Cernovich, and whether I agreed with them or not, I realized that there was a real political movement behind their words. When you couple this reality with moderate liberals and moderate conservatives who are sick of identity politics and outrage culture, trump winning actually seems kind of obvious in hindsight. I'm trying to do my best not to judge trump's actions until he's actually an office because until then, everything people are saying are just guesses and conjecture.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       As I said in my direct message right after the election, I'll be the first to hold trump, speak to the fire once he's in office, but the simple fact is that he's the president elect now and we've got to give him a chance. That's the rub of democracy. Your team doesn't always win, but you can't burn down the system just because you were on the losing end this time, regardless of whether you hate or love trump, there's no doubt that something good did come out of this election. People seem to be engaged in a whole new way. People are talking politics, fighting for what they believe in getting involved in the conversation, maybe even more now than when Obama ran for the first time back in 2008 I think we're going to get a whole new crop of political leaders out of this chaos and I hope some new political movements as well as I've been saying for a year now, if you're an old school liberal than an old school, conservative is no longer your enemy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       I really think a new center can arise from this and if trump is smart, he can actually make that happen. Trump is a populist and that means he wants to be popular. Most of us are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Most of us are not the alt right or the regressive left. Most of us don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home and we want government to take less instead of giving more. I think we can actually push trump towards these ideals, but if not, then maybe we'll just have to create our own movement to do so. Actually, maybe that's already begun with all this in mind. I've got the perfect guest for you this week. Radio host and columnist Ben Shapiro. Ben Is what I would consider an old school conservative, which like me as a classical liberal is a strange place to be these days.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       Does he fit in with the new trump led republican party any more than I fit in with the identity politics driven Democratic Party? Not so sure. We're both on the outside looking in and that's exactly where I think we can start building bridges. I was on the daily wire livestream with Ben on election night and I got to see us. He was alternately thrilled that Hillary lost but also totally dismayed that trump had won a couple of hours in a few beers later. We both managed to survive the evening even if we didn't see eye to eye on the whole thing. There is huge opportunity for all of us to shape the future of the country right now, but there's no way it can change if we just complain about the system instead of getting involved. The rhetoric on Russia, fake news, stories about fake news and outrage after outrage are not only going to keep coming but they're going to get stronger and stronger. The only way we'll stop them and cut through the noise is to figure out what we believe and to fight for it. I've got a new studio and a new commitment to continue that fight and I hope that you'll join me.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       All right, we're back, baby. Joining me this week is a radio host, columnist, editor and chief of daily wire.com and most importantly now to Time Ruben Report Guest Ben Shapiro. Welcome back. It is here. I thought you would be the right guy to have for the first show in our new studio. I don't know what you're thinking, but sure. Well, because a lot has happened since we last spoke. Probably A, I'd say roughly about a year ago and I was with you on election night. You had me over at the daily wire studios and we had a great time and we had some beers. You were reading a lot of m and M's. Oh yeah, and that sugar intake. Now,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       the thing that I found most interesting was that you did not like Hillary, right? Fair to say. Did say, and I think she's awful. Not Like Hillary Clinton clearly do not like Donald Trump. Right. So, so far I'm good. Yeah, you're, you're right on the money. That's so watching you throughout that evening, the rollercoaster of emotions that you were going through, going from when I sat down, when it's still a good for hillary to then it's starting to look like trump then realizing it was inevitable, but before they called it and everything else. I mean you went through every emotion alone. Bizarro world. Yeah, it was definitely, it's definitely weird because you know, I was, as you know, I was sort of rooting for both of them to get left adrift in a rowboat somewhere. But unfortunately one of them was going to be presidents of the United States.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       So there was, there was a bit, there's a lot of up and down and going on, meaning that I was overjoyed that Hillary was not president of the United States. Anything that kept hillary out of the White House. I was very happy about. And then I looked at who was actually entering the White House and I went, oh this, I have some, some trepidation about not, not sold on the, on this whole trump thing cause I hadn't been, I didn't end up voting for either of them. I left the blue at the top of the ticket blank. Neither of them fulfilled my basic requirements to be president of the United States. So now you know, I was wrong about where I thought trump would be. I thought trump was going to lose just like everybody else who is looking at the polls from nate silver to Larry Sabato and uh, and I was clearly a 100% wrong on that.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       So now I just hope that I'm wrong about him as a person and a president because if I'm right, then it's going to be a long four years. I have a feeling that no matter what happens, it's going to be a little no. I for sure. Whether he does good stuff and people come along for the ride or whether he does bad stuff and they don't get as good stuff, then I can feel good about it. Right? Like I'm hoping that he does some good stuff. Yeah. At this point you have to do. Right. Even if even if you like any of his positions, he's taken over the moral center that seems to do root for him as the president. So I root for him to do good things. I don't like the phrase people use this with Obama also root for him. I don't read for trump, I don't refer Obama.

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       I didn't root for Hillary. It's not a team sport there and I like the white sox and the bears and the Celtics. I root for them. I would like to see them win. But in politics it's not just about winning, it's about what you do to win. It's about the policies that you implement that constitute winning. Like how do you actually gauge winning? So for me, when, when trump makes a bad deal, that's good for him politically. That sounds something I'm in favor of. Right? I'm not rooting for him, even though it helps him politically and I'm rooting for him to do good things. So I'm rooting for me. Right? I'm, or even from the country, I'm rooting for him to do the things that will help the country more than makes I'm fine, but help that'll help the country. Uh, but what I fear is that I think people are rooting for him or rooting against him.

Speaker 3:          00:08:28       And if that's your, I sent this on my podcast today. If, if your moral center is basically good for trump, is good for the country or bad for trump is good for the country, you need a different moral center. So that seems to be the place that we're at right now. We're trump said I'm going to win. I'm a winner. And that that force of will was almost enough in and of itself, an amazing bank, Hema winter. So he's your version of winning, which would be, uh, you know, having certain, uh, ethical code, whatever, whether we agree on all, every little policy is irrelevant. But can you win on that anymore? Now that we've seen how trump won. Do you honestly think that a conservative can when you playing the game that's out there? I do think that, I think that some of the things that trump did, and I said this very early on, I mean very early before he started kind of making an ass of himself repeatedly.

Speaker 3:          00:09:18       I said that actually there was a good shot that he would be a better nominee in terms of winning than Marco Rubio because I thought that he spoke a moral language about politics. A lot of the other candidates didn't mean he can go look back at my speech, I gave it University of Missouri in like October, 2015 and I said the trump might be stronger, especially among blue collar whites in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. So I got it right then. I got it wrong and your later right. Um, but, but the, but the idea there is that trump speaks in terms of mortality. He, there are good guys and bad guys, whether you agree with his mortalities and other things, but for politics, for him, all politics breaks down into good guys versus bad guys. Unfortunately, very often it's just I'm the good guy. Everybody who opposes me is the bad guy.

Speaker 3:          00:09:53       But that's a way that people think about politics. And I think that if you had the actual proper moral, you know, content to that sort of narrative, then yeah, you could still win based on that. It's so funny that everybody sort of, because everybody's a binary thinker. Uh, everybody broke it down into a, trump is the only one who can campaign aggressively. He's the only one who can speak this moral language. Now, I wasn't against trump campaigning aggressively or speaking this moral language. I just thought that he was applying it incorrectly. I mean, if you watch me into Bain, I'm constantly applying moral language. I'm constantly aggressive, but I disagreed with trump. You can, you can do both at the same time. So are we at a point then of post truth? Because if you look at what he says now, again, most of the criticism I get right now is that I'm being too kind to him.

Speaker 3:          00:10:35       Yeah. I've been saying for weeks now we have to see what happens. I can't get outraged about appointments yet. I have to wait to see, you know, you can get a sense of what's going on. Know. That's right. I'm not allowed to see what happens, but I think that's right. I'm not, I'm not outraged about the appointments. Um, you know what he does and what he says. I can be outraged by it. And I think that there's an incentive structure that has to exist or if he does something bad now, now I criticized him. The argument was made during the election cycle for people on the right. Well, if he says something bad, Shh, be quiet. Hillary might get elected. Right. And my view was, that's not my job. My job is to, is as somebody who actually believes in something that's truthful. My job is to say what I think is true, whether he's saying it or not, but now, especially post election, Hillary is no longer in the picture.

Speaker 3:          00:11:13       So the question now is if he does something that's false, are you going to call that out? Even if you're a politically on his side overall. And that's, that's the real question for me. So my job, I still is the same as it ever was. When he does something good, I praise him when he does something bad, I don't, which really is not what many people, people don't want that. Now people, people, people, I mean, it's fine. Do they not want it? Because I suspect they wanted, it's what I'm trying to do. I know it hasn't, it hasn't hurt me, you know, with, I think with most people, most people are refreshed when they hear somebody like you or like me say, okay, here's the truth. You know, and I'm putting my own political interests aside and the interest of the person who's at risk here.

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       Uh, then here's, here's what's true and here's what's not. But there's a large contingent that's going to resist that in a major way because it, again, it has become such a team sport. It has become, well, if you say something bad about trump, then you're a cock and you're in, you're undermining him. And it's like, well, again, that's a, Bill O'reilly said there about George will, George will criticize the carrier deal, and Riley comes out and he says, George, will's just undermining. Trump said, wait a second. He's not my dictator. He's my server. It's not right. It's not the opposite. I'm not his servant. He's my servant. He's a public servant. Now I know that he's been in private business his whole life, but he was running for the job of public servant. Now it's his job to serve the interest of the American people. It's not my job to serve as his political interests. Yeah. And so, you know, it's, it's been very weird to watch people kind of invert that. Uh, and I thought that that was unique to the left. So I've, I've been disabused of that pretty radically. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       Yeah. So that, that's really interesting. And maybe, maybe my, uh, feelings about what's happening with the left just kicked in a little bit more a little earlier than yours have kicked in about the right thing. And that's true because you are seeing this and it's pretty obvious. I mean to me the issue will be that once these trump people who have been offered, you know, against political correctness and free speech and all of this stuff and say what you're feeling about about which I'm for all of them, but once on January 20th, once, those are the guys that are in power, will they be as uh, for fighting the power?

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       No. Somehow suspect. No, no. I mean Kellyanne Conway today, right? I mean Kellyanne Conway was out there criticizing a, I think it was a bret Stevens from the Wall Street Journal. Bret Stevens from the Wall Street Journal was making fun of Carly Fiorina cause she went to trump tower and he says like five minutes ago you were saying it was the worst person who ever was and he was making fun your face. And now here you are at trump tower and Kellyanne conway tweets back at Bret Stephens and she said something like, that's really sexist. What do you think? And then she tags Rupert Murdoch, right? Who owns the Wall Street Journal, right? And so is this the way that this is going to go now that we're going to go to the bosses of the people who we don't like what they're saying,

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       right. That's someone literally in the incoming administration tagging someone. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       Let me, Sean Hannity did the same thing today. Somebody red state criticized him, didn't like something that he did. So he immediately tagged the heads of sales. The communications. It's tones, red state. I mean like is this something that we want to engage in? I, this is, this is not like I disagree with people all the time. I generally don't call for them to be fired. Right? I mean that's it. That's it. Sometimes like there was a point where I suggested that there there should be, if someone, if they've left us, we're going to apply certain tactics. Then you have to apply those same tactics to people on the left in order to create a sort of mutually assured destruction. But that's not what's going on now. Now what's going on? As you criticized certain people and those people just say, you ought to be fired just for the criticism. In fact, I've never blocked anyone on twitter. I don't mute anybody on twitter. So all of the, all the evil terrible tweets that I received, I've never called for anybody to be banned from twitter, even though you know, I was, according to the Adl, the number one recipient of antisemitism or one line this year. So I mean it did, but I've never, but that's not my thing. But watching people on my own side do it now, it's like, well, you should shut up because, because trump, no, no, sorry. That's not the way it works.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       Yeah. Can you win that battle? I mean, yeah, I think you're right.

Speaker 3:          00:14:40       Exactly. I mean, as you know, you wouldn't be in this business. I wouldn't be in this business if I didn't think the battle we're winnable. I think that in the afterglow of a, of an election, it's very for people to get past the team sport of it and the, the warm feeling and the excitement. So I immediately, I mean, as you mentioned that night, I kept going from excitement and trepidation and excitement and trepidation to, oh my God, I can't believe this was the election. And, but a lot of people just went straight to, we hate Hillary Clinton so much. Everything is now hunky Dory. No problems anymore. Trump's here, I alone can solve. And I think that'll last up until the point where the pedal hits the metal and then we'll see.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       What kind of policies he actually implements and whether people are willing to stand up my bed is that a lot fewer people will be willing to stand up, uh, and, and not back in when he does bad things then, then you would have thought a year ago.

Speaker 2:          00:15:28       Yeah, I guess we shall see. Um, what, what's next? What? Okay. So he becomes president, he starts doing whatever he's doing the left automatically, and this has been my funeral along is if you demonize someone to the point where even if they do good, you have to keep demonizing them because if he's a racist bigot, even if even if it reads to speak, it does good things for the economy. Well you can't be nice to him, right? Because he's, he's the scum of the earth. What happens after this? Because it seems to me that I think we're going to start seeing more of a trend of violence and you know, the state coming down on more violence, like it just seems like this is where this has all been led up to and he's the guy to to lead the fight against.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       Well, I mean, the level of radicalism that's emerged on both sides in terms of the, the wild and tolerance for people with different political opinions is pretty extreme as you're saying. Ah, you know, I think that if Democrats were smart, they would actually see this as kind of an opportunity. Do that. My guess is that trump's gonna govern as as more of a centrist Democrat. Then he has is a hardcore right wing Republican. I mean he's talking about trillion dollar infrastructure packages and he's talking about tariffs and he's talking about a lot of Bernie sanders kind of policies. He's a populist, right? That's right. And so you could win. So what you could see Democrats is doing is doing exactly what they did to Herbert Hoover. If it, let's say if things go bad, right? Let's see if things go well, he'll be reelected because of president who's president.

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       When things are going well, generally is reelected. But let's say things. Let's say for the sake of argument, things don't go well. Let's say that just as as every eight to 10 years for the last several decades in this country, there's some sort of recession and Democrats blame trump for it. What they could do is they could campaign on triple tripling down on the populism, right? I mean they actually have that opening now, whereas they didn't before and they could actually do Fdr to hoover. They could say, you know, hoover kind of implemented a lot of soft fdr policies and then fdr came in and tripled down on everything and get selected four straight times. You could see Democrats doing this things shift really quickly in the country. And Hillary did win by about 3 million popular votes. So this isn't quite the, the massive majority that Republicans are banking on.

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Um, but I do think that if their, if their rhetoric is this extreme, you know, during the campaign the question is going to be whether they ratcheted up or whether they sort of ratcheted down and wait to see what happens. I'm seeing some of both. I'm seeing some about that. And so yeah, because I hope you're right. Like Harry Reid for example, came out and he says, so far trump's not not that bad, which is something that should make conservatives a little concerned. But Harry Reid says that you could see Democrats move in that direction. He's not that. And then things collapse. Oh, told you he was that bad. Right. But the other, cause they want to get some liberal policy items from a lefty policy out of it. But on the other hand, what's going on in university campuses and the, and the sort of extreme response, uh, that I think is going to get a lot worse. I think Democrats in government will likely treat him with more moderation after the election than they did before the election. Because that's sort of been the pattern. But the typical public is going to treat this is like we're, we're now in an end of times politicking.

Speaker 2:          00:18:15       Right? So I guess that, so that's an interesting distinction that the sort of leadership, whether it's the media or the political leadership, may be willing to work with them in a certain way. What they've ginned up something yes. In the populous that they may be can't control.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       Exactly. And actually you're seeing that battle play out in the Democratic Party right now. You've got the people who want to double down and all the kind of identity politics, rhetoric like Keith Ellison, right? He's going to double down on that and he's going to keep saying racist, sexist, bigot. Homophobe let's get our coalition Together. The Obama coalition will run somebody who's not an old white lady. Next time we'll run cory booker, Kamala Harris, and then we'll just sweep back to victory using this new coalition that's demographically growing. And then you've got people like Joe Biden and some of the old guard Democrats who are saying, well, hold on just a second. Like we can actually, why are we abandoning all of these, these blue collar white voters who are voting for us until very recently, right? A lot of these counties went for Obama the first time. And why don't we, why don't we try to draw them in by maybe working with trump and then if he, and then, and then hitting him when we think that he's over overly selling something or hitting him when things go bad and so that, that conflict will really play out at the DNC level.

Speaker 3:          00:19:18       Uh, and that's, that's a fascinating,

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       yeah. I mean, I would bet everything that they're going to go the Bernie Ellis and rooms dump everybody else. Do you think there's any room for those people that you know for a gym where Biden, those happened to be two older white guys, but he's been anyone in that general line of thinking blue dog Democrat is that right

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       now Jim Webb, right. I think Jim Webb's toast biden still tries to straddle that gap a little bit and he gets away with it cause he's part of the Obama administration. Yeah, but it's, yeah, I think they're going to be gradually drag to the left cause again in our entire life the left has been gradually drag further and further to the left and I'm waiting to see the moderates since Clinton. They've been, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       that's the thing. I think for a long time that the right got dragged further in front of the right. But this election, clearly they weren't. No, they weren't. They were dragged the left actually pretty hard. They weren't, I mean trump doesn't, it's obvious he doesn't care about gay marriage, I don't think. No, I don't think he cares about abortion, cares about weed. I think even some of the tax stuff I think is going to be a little more, you write the ending, at least centrist Democrat, I think he's going to govern a lot more like Bill Clinton. Then he, then he would govern like Ronald Reagan. That's the danger though. If you demonize somebody to that end point and then even if they are with you on so many of the things that you've been screaming about for so long, you're, you've painted yourself into that.

Speaker 3:          00:20:24       Yeah, I think, I think that's right and I think the Democrats have painted themselves in a little bit of a corner except that they're just banking on the growth of the Obama coalition. They keep looking at the demographic numbers. Yeah, and they keep thinking, okay, in 2020 40% of all voters will be of the millennial generation. Those people broke heavily for hilary, so what's to stop us now and demographics are not quite destinee. I mean demographic.

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       What a sad way

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       that would be to live as a society that we would only be following the demographic trend, but that's what we are right now. We've moved in such a tribal direction too. I mean it's easy to look at this election cycle and look at did he went on policy? I don't think that the trump one on policy so much as rejection of tribalism in favor of another sort of tribalism. Like if you look at how blue collar white voters voted in this election cycle by percentage white, we're a white working class. People voted more for trump than Hispanics voted for Hillary Clinton and people are constantly talking about the, the idea that Hispanics are voting block. Okay, well then so are white blue collar people presumably and they voted precisely the reverse. They will be 71% for trump. That's it. Again, I don't have a problem with people with any group voting, however they want to vote, but if, if it starts to look like a voting block, like our group interest, solidarity, I don't think that's, that's totally what's happening, I don't think is a bunch of white people getting together and going, oh, we've got to vote against this black and Hispanic people.

Speaker 3:          00:21:40       Right. Just like, I don't think that it's all Hispanic people getting together. We need to vote against the white people, but it, but there is that, that growing sense that you're going to vote inside your own block and it, and that is not a good thing. Do you think that's actually real though? Because every time I watched John King with the Magic Wall that I'm pretty sure he's having an affair with commercial breaks, but every time I watch them do that and said, well, the white working class people here in the black people here in the Latino people here in this whole thing. And it's like, not only does that actually sort of sound racist and I don't know, it doesn't mean it's actually just pinning everyone by these, these traits. Uh, but it also doesn't sound logical. I don't think, and maybe I'm really wrong here, but I don't think most people vote on the color of their skin or no, I don't think so either.

Speaker 3:          00:22:22       But I think that they vote like their neighbors vote. And so and so if they see that their neighbors are voting a certain way and there's a certain revenge politics to everything, and this is not unique to one group, it's like the system has screwed us. This is the system has screwed us is one of the ways that politics dies, that that notion, the system has screwed us. And I don't just mean like the government, if you can show that the government is specifically disadvantage in your group, that's one thing. But when you just say the system broadly is screwing us and it's to us as white, blue collar workers, or it's us as black people or it's us as Hispanics, that's a really damaging thing. And, and that I think is, is rising pretty dramatically. And, and that's partially because the only way that politics operates, and I've spoken about this at length recently, uh, but the, the only way that politics actually operates and the way society operates is through building of the social fabric.

Speaker 3:          00:23:10       The idea that we are individuals who are going to treat each other as individuals. We're not going to treat each other as members of groups will have to spend so long breaking people down into identity group politics that the Wright responded with it's own form of, okay, well screw you, we're, you know, you've already boxed us in. So okay, now that we're in the box, we're in the box. Like that's what it is. Right? It's almost like they're, they hated it for so long, but now they're embracing it. You sleep. Right. I've tried so hard to have the left back away from some of this stuff. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I'd like to see the right back away from some of this stuff. I think that's what a lot of the outright controversy was about because they're really open about the tribalism. But I mean, there's no question that, that some of what trump was doing was, it was a quasi tribal appeal.

Speaker 3:          00:23:44       Right? I mean when, when he was talking about tariffs, for example, the terrorists that he's talking about, you know, he, he, he's saying that he obviously they're, they're equally applicable to people living in the United States, but really who he's talking to, and everybody knew this and it was repeated ad nauseum in the media was he's talking to white, blue collar voters from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And when you say to people that you can indirectly tax other people for your benefit, which is what a tariff is, but it's okay for the white people, but we also don't like the welfare system for the black people, then you start getting into some really, you know, kind of interesting political territory and the idea that it was a totally race free campaign by trump is not true. I mean, it just, it wasn't like the, the fact is that Donald Trump was making a, not overt references to race, but he was making subtle appeals on the basis of race free campaign or there people, I think there are people, yeah, I mean Kellyanne Conway to go to example, right?

Speaker 3:          00:24:34       She says, she said there was a big debate between her and Jen Palmieri from the Clinton campaign and Jen Palmieri, he said that you guys were pandering to the outright and Kellyanne Conway said, you're, you're accusing me of being part of a campaign that would pander to the alt right. And Jen Palmieri. He said, yeah, and, but Kelly entered the who? Me, me, what? And it's like, oh yeah, you a little bit. And yet at the same time, the Democrats were pandering to everybody keeps saying, we don't exactly, don't talk about race, but every other line was raised. Exactly. And so it's, and so you have both sides playing the same game now, and none of them are playing inside the mentality that we're where I exist. Which, you know, you put it outside the conservative box for a second. I am essentially a radical individualist in the sense that I think that people ought to be treated as individuals.

Speaker 3:          00:25:16       They shouldn't be treated as part of groups. And so treating voters as part of a group or a classical liberal. Yeah, that's right. That's right. And did have that. Sure. Unlike the European style classical limmer. Yeah, I mean except the, yeah, I mean with, with some really like the conservative thing enough that even to say that I know, I mean I'm more, I'm more kind of a conservative libertarian mashup than anything else. I think the government sucks at everything, right? I mean like we've talked about same sex marriage before. I personally against same sex marriage, but I don't think the government has any business in it. And personally, again, smoking marijuana, I don't think the government has pretty much any business in it. If you're not creating extra analogies, I don't think that the government has any business messing with you. So that's why I can sit across from you and you can say that and it doesn't bother me because at this point you're not trying to stop either one of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:25:56       Right. Exactly. Why? So you can believe what you want to believe. They said that this is, I know I'm supposed to be offended. Right, exactly. But this is, this is the thing that is so funny. I was talking to somebody one time and they were saying, you know, as a, as a religious person, you think homosexual behavior is a sin as a right, as an Orthodox Jew, right? It's in the Bible. I think it's a sin. Here's the beautiful thing about America. You don't have to give a crap. You don't, you can think I'm an idiot. That's fine. Right. Welcome to America and, and yeah, you don't use seriously can completely disregard everything I'm saying because I'm not trying to use a gun to enforce my opinion against you. And actually you're not even trying to use the Bible because, right, exactly. We're not trying to govern by the Bible. That's, that's you're saying. That's right. You're saying you have your private belief. Right. Exactly. Exactly. We lose this ability to have the private league because did you see this about a week ago? Uh, buzzfeed did a piece on the two people from that

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       Hg TV show. Blanking on the show. I watch it sometimes. You want to be one of the gains couple. Yeah, the gaines, Joanna, and what I can remember, I don't want your child, but yeah, they, you know, they do this house flipping show. It might be great flip or flop or, or whatever it's called. Uh, but the point is that what it is, so I've watched the show many times, they strike me as two completely benign, whatever. Find people like their jobs seem like these people. And the whole piece in buzzfeed wasn't that they go to a church that's against gay marriage. And I thought this is the worst kind of smear job nonsense. Exactly. And, but when did that become, okay, so what? They go to a church where we don't know what their beliefs are on it and I wouldn't care actually.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       Right, exactly. And even if they believe that as long as they're not manifesting that in discrimination against gay people, who gives a crap, right? I mean, this is, this is ridiculous. I mean, first of all, the idea that HDTV is short on pandering to gay people isn't, it? Is Patently insane. Okay. My wife watches HGTV. We learned all about, but let's, let's, uh, but it, it is amazing. I mean that sort of thought policing. Uh, I mean that's existed for a couple of decades, probably since the 60s for the left. But the fact that it's starting to exist a little bit on the right is what frightens me is, is the, the thought policing, uh, that I see because policies become a loyalty test, but it's also

Speaker 2:          00:27:56       so selective in what everyone does. Because I would guarantee you mentioned Keith Ellison a moment ago. I'm going to guess that the mosque that he goes to is probably the mom is probably not for gay marriage, but buzzfeed I do. I'm just guessing on that. But I'm pretty sure that that's majority mosques are not yet probably 99.9% of mosques in America or not. Okay. That's fine. They can have their personal religious belief, but buzzfeed would never do a piece on that. If anything, they'll whitewash everything he's ever said about fire can and everything else. Right, exactly. So that just shows you how the media has, and I

Speaker 3:          00:28:26       again, they did, they said that they were fine with, with Obama's excuse. Then you went to a church for 20 years where Jeremiah Wright was preaching the most insane crap imaginable from the pulpit. And they just went, okay, well, you know, that's his church and nobody says he has to believe that. And I said, wait, wait a second, why does that, that's okay for Obama, but it's not to confirm gains. Yeah. Obama is like the, he's going to actually run for president. Like if at any point the guy's views are going to be relevant, you would think it's more of that then, I don't know, are you gonna knock out a, a barrier and create an open kitchen concept on HIV baby? Right, right. It's a, yeah, it is. It is. It is pretty, it's pretty wild how far things have gone. Um, and I'm hoping that, I think that a lot of people who are hoping that trump is going to be a blow back against that, that, that there'll be less thought policing, uh, under trump. But that also has to apply to trump, right? Right. Then has to apply to trump himself and it has to apply to the chief.

Speaker 2:          00:29:10       When Kellyanne Conway's tagging people, the bosses on twitter that they don't like, that doesn't, that's not a good thing.

Speaker 3:          00:29:16       Let me, Donald Trump was making those noises all throughout the campaign. Right. He said he wants to rewrite libel law, which for people in our business is like, I mean, all we do all day is sit and give opinions on people. And the idea that we're going to be sued for giving those opinions, uh, is, uh, is pretty frightening thing in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:29:30       Yeah. But it isn't so much of that though, and I think you've already said this, but that it's just a reaction to the lunacy.

Speaker 3:          00:29:36       Yeah. Trump's reaction and the reaction to him is reactionary. There's no question, but reactionary politics is bad politics. Right. You should have the, the reaction to the left has been breaking people down by, by race and by identity. Politics is not, well, screw them. Let's do identity politics too. If they can do what we can do it, you know, that's not the, that's not the way they got to play the game. I mean, it's, and if you think that's the only way we can win, then we're bound for a European style politics. It's the end of American politics. Like what America used to be about was the idea that as individuals, we disagreed about a lot of things, but we agreed that we were going to be treated as individuals, or at least that was the, that was supposed to be the promise that we were attempting to fulfill. Uh, in Europe, it all breaks down according to demographic lines and you just have a battle between the big government right in the big government left and are you going to let in immigrants this time or you're not going to get let in immigrants this time? That's, that's, yeah. And I think that we're in danger of moving that way. Just we're going to, we're going to show it and freight our way right into something really ugly.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       Yeah. In a weird way though, this presents a tremendous amount of opportunity, right? I was telling you right before we started, I was with you a couple of weeks ago, a Dennis prager had a, had a fundraiser and I thought he gave a really great speech about basically saying the world is in a really nuts place right now and maybe we have to find allies and other places. And that's what I think I've tried to do. So there is for all the chaos of it. Yeah, there's some real life.

Speaker 3:          00:30:50       I mean, I hope so. I hope so. And I hope that it's, I think it's a good opportunity for a, and when I do my podcast, I actually keep a physical shoe on the side and I, and I hold it up and I say, put this on the other foot. Right? Whenever it trump does something. So you just put this on there that with Obama did this, how would you feel? And it's a good opportunity for people on the left to do the same thing. I think that if we all sort of take the shoe and put it on the other foot, like now you're very upset with what trump's doing, but how are you with it? When, when Obama was doing it, if you think is bad, when trump's doing, and maybe it was bad when Obama was doing it and for the right, if you were really pissed off about it when Obama was doing it and now trump's doing it, maybe you should be pissed off when trump's doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:31:20       Ah, and if everybody applied, that sort of intellectual honesty I think to, to whatever our politicians do, we'd be significantly better off. Because the fact is that it's the team sport of it, the ruins it, it's a team sport of it that where you end up with, I'm going to root for, for my guy, just no matter what he does, no matter what rules he breaks. And this is why I've said it's not seems more politics is not team sport. Like as a white sox fan, there was a catcher who caught for us named Aga presents gate at aeg presents. He was a player that everybody hated and still hates in the major thing plays to the braves. Now they despise him cause he was this guy who had like cut any corner to win. And when he's not on your team, you hate him. And then he's on your team and you'll love him. Right? Yes. Anything in order to win. The problem is that when you apply that to politics and it's, if he's on my team and he'll do anything to win, that's awesome. Yeah. Well except for it isn't because now you have to, you have to be standing up for people doing bad things.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       Yeah. And that's the strange thing. I mean, look, if you were for all these people that are upset that Oh, trump might be a warmonger or might be against the press neck, he might be, but at this, but hey, he didn't run certainly on on a pro war policy will be, Obama has been doing drone strikes into Afghanistan, strikes in Pakistan, ask Edward Snowden how he's been for press freedom and all that kind of stuff. So regardless of what, how were you feeling? Terrible for press brakes. It's like, wait, nobody, why weren't you guys saying anything that you'd have a little more right. Yeah. You'd have a little more weight to your words now.

Speaker 3:          00:32:35       Exactly. I said this on Brian stelter show on CNN is they were going over, this is when, when trump was tweeting against Hamilton, and I said, like, let's, let's be fair to both sides. If Obama had done this to a nascar event, like some Nascar event in 2011 boot, Michelle, and he'd gone on and said, these Nascar people should shut up and apologize. Basically, you know, it would've been applauded, but he would have been applauded by the left. And now trump does on Hamilton and it's just the end of the world. Oh my God, he's going to shut down our beloved Hamilton. And he's, by the way is right. It's an overrated musical. But the, but, but on the other side, I haven't seen it on the other side. Uh, you know, he had people on the right and they're like, yeah, look at trump.

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       Really punching, really, really taking it to them. I was like, all right, but when Obama did exactly the same sort of stuff, when he was calling out Fox News by name and saying that it was that they were destroying the political process, we were saying, wait, the the president of the United States should be going out and attacking specific news outlets for how they report. That's really gross. It's so funny. I had somebody tweet me saying, why didn't you ever say this stuff about Obama? And I linked directly to a video from 2013 I said exactly this about Obama and it's in again, you could probably spend your whole life trying to correct the things that people tweet. But that's what happens is that people get into this, the, the, the, they get into this mode where, yeah, when Obama did it, it was the Democrats didn't care.

Speaker 3:          00:33:43       And it's like, yeah, but that, that argument also applies to you. You did care when Obama did it and now you're pretending not to. So the hypocrisy argument cuts both ways. It's double edged sword. He can't claim the Democrats are hypocrites about trump at the same time that you're being a hypocrite about Obama. All right, so let's shift away from a little bit of the horse race pilot from broader themes. So the free speech stuff, you have been in the thick of it. I mean, yeah, it's going to party truly, truly in the thick of this, you get protested at pretty much every, when's the last time you were at a university that you weren't protests? And I mean, I would say half the universities. I go try, I protest protested. I mean I go to a lot of universities. I, I've, I've spoken at 10 in the last two months I would say.

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       I guess I only hear about the one, we only see the headlines about the ones where there are heavy protests had taken maybe a third of them. I get heavy protests. Okay. So about a third of them, you're getting heavy protests now. I would venture to say that for everyone that's listening to this interview so far, whether they agree with you or not, you don't seem to be a hate monger or some sort of white supremacist or Jewish supremacist or some other Nazi related something or other like, okay, what are these people thinking? What do you really think is going on for these people? Cause it's a lot of misguided nonsense. And, and I've spoke at Ucla with Milo, which is a whole separate crowd. Your crowd obviously. Uh, but there are protesting him too. Yeah. Well, I mean I think that the, for the most part people, I don't assume my own level of notoriety. So I think that most of the people who are protesting me, I've never heard anything that I've said or read anything that I've written.

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       Yeah, exactly. When I was at Wisconsin, one of the things that a lot of the fliers come out and the fliers put like the most provocative title they can to get people to come. Right. Um, and then usually that they're, they're fine. But it did. But, uh, for example, Wisconsin, I had people getting up and chanting. I had a guy right at the beginning stand up and say something about how I was enabling Hitler. And I was like, dude, do you see the Yamaka? Like what are, what are you even talking about? Like what are you talking about? And then they were chanting, they were chanting f white supremacy. It, man, it's like I've been spending this entire election cycle under assault from the white supremacists, right? Because I told them that they, that they're wrong. And I think that they're evil and the, and literally the number one online target of the, all right, so how about right?

Speaker 3:          00:35:48       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so, but I'm getting protested by it, by the, by the blm crowd. And so it's, I think that it comes from ignorance. I think it comes from this place where any opposing view must be attacked and we don't even have to do our research. We don't have to try and debunk it. It's a bunking. It actually takes effort going and yelling about it doesn't take any effort at all. And that's why whenever I do these lectures, the first thing I do when we do q and, a, as I say, if you disagree with me, you get to go first. All people who disagree go to the front of the line and it's and it, cause that's always more interesting and I treat the people who disagree with me actually with respect. If you're not, if you're not yelling at me and you're not flipping me off and shutting f white supremacy, I'm happy to treat you with respect and have a civil discussion.

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       I do it all the time and that's the one you can win over. Right, exactly. It's selfishly rewarding for you because that's the guy who was on the fence that might come to your thigh or at the very least we can have a discussion where the person gives a point. I get the counterpoint and all the, all the whole audience is smarter for it, that the audience is not smarter for having these people chance and stand in front of the stage and try to disrupt an event and me write more ons on the trop board behind them. I mean, it's fun for me and I think it's fun for the crowd, but it's not, but it's not informative in any way except to show that there are these people who are out there. How does it feel just just on the personal level when this stuff's happening?

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       Cause there are threats. I mean, again, when I was at Ucla, I think there was a bomb threat. People bashing on the door, seemed like they were coming in screaming like we didn't know if by, you know, uh, anything violent could happen. Like all that stuff. Like just on a purely personal note, you are a person, you're a relatively new father I think. Like, yeah, I've got two kids in three years. Yeah. Okay. So just on that note, like putting yourself out there like that, what do you make of that? Uh, well, I mean, I don't tell my wife about it. She, she not on twitter, on twitter. She does not do the facebook thing. I off everything. Yeah, exactly. Like, Hey, she's, she's kind of protected from it. Um, I have, I feel like I'm usually the safest person in the room. I'm the only guy there were security, right?

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       So I've got my own private security, uh, that we contract to do these things. The first time we did it, I was like, why are we even doing this? And turned out that was cal state La and there's like an actual riot there. So it's, so yeah, I'm now, I'm now, I've got security guys who come with me. Um, I'm always relieved when it's not that because again, I would much prefer to have just a normal, like I'm not looking for the, I really am not looking for the headline that says protesters come in, Shapiro finishes protesters or whatever like that. Honestly, that's easy for me. It's not hard. Like these people have a combined icu in single digits. It's not difficult to make stupid people look stupid. It's more difficult to actually have a conversation with somebody who has a point of view and some facts to back them.

Speaker 3:          00:38:15       I was more interesting. Um, but you know, as far as the personal safety aspect of it, um, I, it doesn't, it doesn't concern me. It's physical safety as much as just sort of your men mostly puzzled. I'm like, what? Why? Like what am I saying? Like I'm here preaching decency and non identity group politics and I'm getting protested for that. Like I have people yelling at me and threatening violence because of that. Right. I could understand if I were coming here and I was saying something that's, that's you know, actively calling for violence or something or even implying that violence is okay in any way. But half of my speeches are about why violence is never okay. Right? Like you don't get to hit people if you disagree with them. And then to prove my point that come and they try and hit people who disagree with them.

Speaker 3:          00:38:50       It's just like, it's so bizarre. Right. Where were you with the, with Christina Hoff. Sommers Paul. Yeah. Paul. Which depaul is banned by low. Right. And then the, the, well they ban Milo and then they immediately banned me on top of that. Right. Like housing. They're like, and, and then first of all, this is absurd. They Ban Milo. Everybody knows about the disagreements that I have with my, but it's absurd. Milo getting banned from campuses. I'm sure it makes me really happy because the headline, but um, but it's, it's stupidity of the highest order. Uh, if you disagree with him, go into bunk him. Um, if you disagree with them, don't show up. I mean, that'd be the worst thing you can do to Milo is just not show up for one of his lectures. Um, but it's it. But the, you know, they banned me on top of that at Depaul.

Speaker 3:          00:39:27       Uh, and then they didn't even give it like they're only excuse was the security and it was like, he can't control your own students. That's not my fault. That's your fault. You're a university. Should be doing that. And then you can go view the video. They actually, uh, we announced that Christina was going to be speaking there and I was going to, you know, accompany her and they wouldn't let me in the building as a guest. They wouldn't let me in the building as a member of her team and they wouldn't let me in the building and just sit in the audience. What are they saying to you at that time? Are they saying because their people are threatening violence and there were no threats of violence? That was what was amazing at Depaul. Like we walked up and the whole day they'd been telling my security team that if Shapiro shows up that we're going to arrest him.

Speaker 3:          00:40:03       If he shows up then we will literally and at the, at the place for trespass. Right. So I mean that would be the crime is trespassing on their campus. They literally went out and got a share from Cook County to sit there to facilitate the transfer of arrest. If the campus police arrest you, they have to have somebody from the county actually be, it's actually, you have the guy sitting there in the law? No protesters anywhere. None. Right. I mean it's 30 police officers and security guards and me and I walk up and I was like really? Like I can't it like Sofa. And I said, you know, if I take two steps forward, are you going to arrest me? And the guy said, yeah and giant guy. Yeah. People were like, you should have, you should have gotten arrested. It's like well you know at that point I'm really not so hot on spending the evening.

Speaker 3:          00:40:41       And They Cook County prison, Cook County jail for the, for the of your beliefs, but not to the point of, well again, they actually have the right to arrest me. It's a private university. If it were a public university, I would have walked, if you were in private, if a Republican diversity, I would have made them arrest me at a private university. They do have the, they do have the legal right to, to band whoever they want. It just demonstrates how ridiculous they are that they're willing to arrest me. And the fact that again, that they're taking everyone from you to milo, it's like that's showing real intolerance. Cause it's not just a sleep. It's not just [inaudible]. It's people that disagree wildly on things. Exactly. Well they except, except if they are remotely construed as right wing. Right. So if you're, if you're in a, if you're a terrorist convicted in Israel, you can speak at a, they had one speaker in 2014 I think at Depaul. So if you, so you have to be within a certain spectrum, but they refused to even acknowledge a spectrum. Right. Although depaul actually did write depaul, depaul came out later and they, and they tried to distinguish kind of what I say from what Milo says, which is kind of interesting. But that didn't change their behavior enough to actually let me speak.

Speaker 2:          00:41:45       Yeah. All right, so let's, let's just do the Milo thing quick. I don't want to, I don't want to dwell on it, but, but so many people ask. So for the record that you sitting here right now, I will fully say what I've said many times on twitter, which is that my low had the original idea of doing it. He sent an email to our team, said, let's do this debate. Me and Ben, table moderate, you immediately responded, yes, you gave dates. And then Milo basically dipped out that says the truth. As much as I know it

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       and say, no, that's exactly right. And so, and then went around the country proclaiming that I had chicken down and trying to derive this rivalry with me that I could not care less about. Like Milo, I wish nothing but success to, to my low based on the good things he does. I hope nothing but failure for him, for bad things that he does just like anybody else. And it's, and you know, as in, you know, I'm not going to play Lucy and the football with him and he ducked out. He chickened out. And uh, and I mean, look, the fact is that even the fact I was willing to do it in the first place after he was tweeting pictures of me as a black baby on the day that my son was born because I'm a cock, it was, was a bit generous. But then now that I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna play that game. That's not my game.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       And the thing is, I genuinely liked both of you and I think we could have done something really good. I have my own coming back in in February. I think that, my guess is that the ground, the ground is a little too scorch. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not interested.

Speaker 3:          00:43:05       Yeah, okay. Again, I'm not interested in doing the Charlie Brown lucy routine so that he can go around the country proclaiming that he's brave after having checked it out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       And for the record, when he comes in in February, I'll say the exact same thing to him and he can say, well, that's fine. That's fine. Um, all right. I'll be very sophisticated in British stuff. Uh, the alt right thing. Now I have done a couple of videos on the alt right. I general feeling, although I think something is changing now that trump is in power, is that for the months leading up to the election, this was mostly a bunch of shit posters. It was mostly a bunch of anonymous four Chan and reddit people. It was not really white supremacists and neo Nazis. There were some of these people in the mix of it, but it was just people who were home in their basements or wherever that were tweeting at people in power media, people, politicians to upset everybody, to get them retweeted, to get everyone to show, I'm such a victim, look at me, look what's happening to me online. I'm separate. And basically what I've said is if we deal with some of these issues, honestly, like immigration or Islam, Islam or something, that's how we'll defang some of the rhetoric around all this stuff. And so I think there's truth to that. Now. I think it's starting to shift a little bit now that, that trump won the election,

Speaker 3:          00:44:14       right? No, I think, I think there's truth to that. So what I've distinguished in interviews or talking about this is the outright philosophers and promulgators Milo's a problem we had of the alt right. Uh, and he denies head, but he likes to play the clown nose off clown nose, offer a teen and clown nose on clown nose offers him with the outright. Yes. I'm not, I'm not really a member of the outright. I just write stories giving they're expressing their viewpoints. Uh Huh. Um, but it's, uh, but the, the piece that he wrote for, for Breitbart about the outright is a really definitive piece about what the alt right is. Uh, and I think that for the most part it's pretty accurate. Uh, there, the, the outright philosophy isn't a lot of people who consider themselves outright right or not technically outright right? They are, as you say, shit posters, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:50       There are people who have been drawn in by the idea that they're being politically incorrect and they're violating taboos. And it's kind of fun to do that. And it's very teenagery and all this kind of stuff. Um, the people who are actually hardcore old writers, people who, Milo, he knows that her philosophy and he talked about it and that piece, right? The people, the Richard Spencers and the jury, Taylor's and all those groups, those people out, our actual honest to God, white supremacists. And there's a line in that piece where he talks about about civil as Western civilization being inseparable from ethnicity, uh, which is white supremacy, right? That that is definition of white supremacy. So it's a, so that's the philosophy, but a lot of people consider themselves outright, had been dragged into that by people who have been inaccurate in their definitions of the alt right.

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       So instead of just saying, okay, there's the, the people who actually believe this white supremacist crap, and then they're a bunch of people who are just posting stupid stuff online to get a rise out of people. They had conflate the two. And then what's even worse is that you get people who are legit, you know conservatives who don't know what the alt right is. And so they assume that everybody who is antiestablishment is outright. And so that gives them a number that they don't actually hold. Right. The number of people who are definitely, who are really outright, like the people who actually believe in white nationalism or white superiority, that's a really small number of people. It really is. And then they've built themselves out. They've kind of built this, this, there's the, there's the core and then there's the chaff. They've built this kind of large chaff sphere around themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       And one of the, I think tasks we have is to try and separate the core from the chaff and say, okay, you know, all you people who are anti establishment, listen, I'm antiestablishment too. I think Mitch Mcconnell is terrible. I was not a fan of Paul Ryan, but that's not the same thing as being alt right. And so, you know what I'm fearful of is the winks and nods to the actual outright. Like I think when I say winks and nods, and I've been saying this for awhile, like when, when Donald Trump was on tv and he was asking about the KKK, I don't Kkk, I've never heard of them. What are you talking? Okay. Like we all know that you've heard of the KKK. We all know you've heard of David Duke. You're your microphone didn't malfunction. You were, you'd be like you, it was two days before the Louisiana primary and you didn't want to alienate voters who thought you were going to win in the Louisiana primary.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Right? That's, that's what was going on there. That was, that was a wink and a nod, right when Donald Trump was retweeting white white nationalist accounts, right. When he's, when he's granting legitimacy to some kind of, I wouldn't say fully outright figures, but people who are very popular with the alt right, the Alex Jones crowd. Uh, that's, that's the kind of stuff where you're getting into kind of a gray area. Um, but the do I do, I think they're an upward moe, an upwardly mobile threat. I think. No, because I think their philosophy is so repugnant that most people, the vast majority of people think that's stupid. But I think it's easy to sucker people into thinking they're all right. And the game there is you sucker people into thinking they're all right and then like me attack the outright, then they go, oh, he must be attacking me. It's like I'm not attacking you. Yeah. Okay. So you post a puppy meme, like, okay, so I think you're stupid, but I don't think you're all right. Right. I think, but as I said before on your show, and I got a lot of flack for it, if you tweet at me something that's indistinguishable from David Duke, it's not my responsibility to determine your motive. Like it's a tweet. I'm going to treat that the same way that I would treat treated tweet from David Duke. It's an idiotic tweet from an idiotic person. So how much

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       then is just related to the Internet culture in general? Because so when I saw the, was it spencer in DC? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:48:01       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       So I've had a family members on both sides. My Dad's side and my mom's side die in the Holocaust. I suspect you probably did as well. Um, so I don't take kindly to that in any way. Uh, I don't like it. I'd rather not see neo Nazis and all of that stuff. However, I saw that and my thought was these are 200 losers. And unfortunately we've now, the media will now run this. It'll be on CNN all day long. Everyone will keep talking about it, talking about and talking about people. Tell me all the time, talk about it. Talk about it more. Yeah. And it's like all we're doing is inflating this thing that these people have always existed. Hate is always going to exist. I can't make every person Niagara eight black people, I can't make every person not a juice or gay people or whatever it is. It's, it's human nature. You may not like it, but it's human nature. And I think we're, we're inflating this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       Yeah. So I, I agree with that and I've, and I've argued against sort of the inflation, but by the same token, I think that there's been empowerment of the fellow travelers and people who the outright sees a sort of ideological forebears people like Pat Buchanan and I mentioned Alex Jones. Alex Jones probably isn't technically all right or wouldn't consider himself thoughts, but when he talks about Jewish influence in the media, in his rand's, he's obviously granting them a lot of kind of credibility and, and he's giving them some ammunition to feel like they have a allies. There are a lot of people who seem to be okay with, with benefiting from the shit posters and the, and the alt right groups. Uh, if they can gain traffic. That was my main critical Breitbart by the way. Like when I said that, that Steve Bannon was appealing to the alt right.

Speaker 3:          00:49:28       That's because he called himself the Plat Breitbart a platform for the alt right. And the idea was that he was, and this is always been my critique of Steve and the left doesn't understand anything remotely approaching moderation. So my critique of Steven Breitbart was always that what had happened was that Breitbart had been moved and direction when they were willing to pander to some of the worst people on Earth. My posting material that appealed to those people. Uh, and, and that demonstrates to me a tremendous will for power from, from Steve and a willingness to work with anyone to get there. And that's my main critique. And the left immediately sees done, oh, well he must be an antisemite. It must be a racist. And it's like, no, that's what I said. I said, he's an opportunist. You've gone out of your way to say that you don't think he's in it, but no, I don't. I don't have any evidence at all. But Steve's an antisemite. Yeah, no, I think Steve's an asshole. But I don't think she's an asset to them.

Speaker 2:          00:50:13       Right. So what do you make of that then? So you worked with the guy who worked, he was technically your boss, right? And you're like, yeah, and he's chairman of the company. Yeah. So he was technically your boss. You have no evidence that he's an antisemite, right. You as the, as the Adl said, you were the number attack, a recipient of antisemetic abuse online. So you are aware of the idea of it. For sure.

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       And I will say it again, there are people who probably will get this following. So for example, when Milo was banned from twitter at my Auntie's medic feed went down 70% immediately. Really? Oh yeah. And so, but see the question, to know where those his, where those actual antisemites or shit posters in all likelihood they're shit posters. Yeah. I would guess that 90% of them are. But what you are doing is you're mainstreaming the idea that this sort of rhetoric is okay. Because in, this was always my critique of, of sort of the, the notion that it's the same thing to be politically incorrect as it is to just be a bad person. Right. Like if it like political, the, the whole point of fighting political correctness is so you can say true things in order to promulgate better ideas. It's not, you can then you're not doing it in the world any good by just shouting the n word.

Speaker 3:          00:51:13       Yeah. Right. Not doing me any good or the world any good by just tweeting people pictures of black kids. Cause you're a cock. Yeah. What, what, how, how is the world become a better place because it has the dialogue become any better because of that. You certainly have the right to do it. I'm not arguing. You don't have the right to do it. Yeah. But you also have the right slap yourself in the face of the frying pan. You know, that's the, you have the right to do lots of stupid thing. Yeah. The question is there are people who aren't making the affirmative case that this is making the country a better place and making the dialogue more open when in reality what you're actually doing is you're breeding the resistance to the dialogue. Right, because then,

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       yeah, look, I guess what those people would argue is that the system has become so rigid and so afraid of everything and every idea that the only way you, I mean, I think my actually said this to me on my show, which was a year before the election that this was the only way we were going to break any of this,

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       but even Milo knows he's lying. Yeah. Next one mile is on. Ask Him one question if he thinks that's true, ask him to say the n word on your show. That's the most rigid taboo in American society. Asked me to say the n word. If he really believes that all taboos oughta be broken because taboos are worthy of being broken, and then we have to break down the system. Ask Him if he has the ball sitting on word on your show.

Speaker 2:          00:52:13       I will do that. I guarantee you, he says no. All right, so I'm going to guess that we can't solve the entire alt right thing right here, but I think something we can possibly solve is the media question related to all of this because mainstream media is absolutely crumbling. Everyone knows it. Yeah. When I was on with you on election night, what I kept saying was we've watched the mainstream media slowly crumble as the online media has risen, and I think as of the election, it's actually starting to tilt and now the online guys are kind of winning, which is why you're seeing all this stuff about fake news. Not to say that, and some people online are a bushing out fake news. I get that. They are, but what do you think first of the, of the meme of fake news, it seems pretty obvious to me, although I don't know who the full conspiracy behind it, that someone in power is pushing out this idea because they lost control.

Speaker 3:          00:53:00       Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't think it's a conspiracy so much as somebody says, there's one story that comes out, right. And fake news and everybody sees is on it. Right. Which is usually how I like being in the right way. Media works. It's, it's, it's like, it's a, it's a, you know, to sharks grom like it's, it, the, the term is in the water. All the sharks come. So somebody says fake news, they go, ah, that's a great excuse for why Hillary Clinton lost because everybody believed all these fake things right now

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       mirasee of basically lazy.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And think that, that it's, again, that's not to say there isn't such a thing as fake news. There is, I mean, there are a lot of stupid headlines that glow around that are not true and that we spend time to banking, you know, from the right and from the left, things that things that are just patently false. Um, and it's, and trump himself was a rather large promulgator of things that were false. And it was important to try and debunk those. But the media had so shredded a total credibility that it couldn't fairly debunk any of this stuff because they were saying things that were false were true for years. And then along comes trump and he basically runs a post truth campaigns. You have two candidates running post-truth campaigns, the media insisting that only one is running a post truth campaign.

Speaker 3:          00:54:01       And then everybody going, wait a second, like you don't get to be the arbiters of truth because you blew all your credibility a long time ago. Well, the problem is that now no one's an arbiter for truth. So I, the, the media certainly wasn't. So I'm glad to see them come down. Yeah. What I would like to see take its place is okay, now it's honestly analyze what's true and what's not true as opposed to what serves our interests in what, what doesn't. So The Washington Post called me recently and they asked if you're trying to determine whether a news source is credible or not, what are sort of some quick keys. Yeah. And I said, well, the easiest thing is are they open with their bias and do they run stories that counter their bias, right? If their, if their news outlet and they only run leftwing stories and there are left wing sites, they only run leftwing stories.

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       They never run a story that counters anything that they say, then you know, you should what you should double check for sure. They're probably just a propaganda outlet. But if they're a site, like I think the Washington Post actually better than New York Times this way. The New York Times is entirely one perspective. The Washington Post not, not talking bout their opinion columnists. I'm talking about the news that they break. Like the Washington Post is actually breaking some anti Hillary News in the past, in the, in the last three weeks before the election cycle. And so, you know, I think it's important to distinguish those. But um, yeah, I mean when there's no gatekeeper, the good news is there is no gatekeeper. The bad news is there's no gatekeeper. Yeah. It's not a full, it's not a fully great thing because nothing has emerged yet that act as a, that and it maybe that's just because we're demanding more of people, but people have to demand more of it. I'm not saying there should be somebody who like, I'm not the gatekeeper. You're not there. No one is the gatekeeper. But I my own gatekeeper. Right. I analyze the news for myself and I don't just believe every headline that I see on facebook. Yeah. And that that I do think is a concern because that's going to polarize the news. If you're just picking the headlines that reinforce your bias. Yeah. Then you're in, you're not likely to, to achieve anything remotely resembling the truth.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       And it almost seems obvious that this is where we were going to end up because everyone, this is what everyone does on twitter. You cater things to yourself. I try not to do that, but every now and again, something gets to me to the point where we're like, I cannot follow this buzzfeed, my final Straw. We, I unfollowed them already before that gains thing. But I was like, wow, that's why I am followed this drivel. But, but even that, there's a risk in that. Yeah. By slowly just filtering everything into your own little ideology that

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       the best indicator is if somebody is hated by both sides, that's a pretty good indicator that they're at least baseline honest. Yeah. Right. That's, that's, that's like that. There's a level of honesty. And what I mean by that is, is not, you know, people who are obviously conspiratorial, but people who are flack from every side because they don't please one side all the time. That's it. It's not a foolproof test, but it's, it's an okay test for people who tend to be more honest. So you exist sort of in both worlds. Do you consider yourself a more, more mainstream than no, I'm kind of straddle it. But because you're on Fox a lot and you're on CNN a lot me on that often that because they, because again, I have the troublesome quality. If not, they don't know not, I'm gonna say. So it's, it's a little bit of a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:56:51       It's hard for them. A little. They'll have me on like I'm on a Fox News once every three weeks maybe, and I'm on CNN once a month perhaps. But I'm not like a regular guest on any of these places. So if they continue to crumble and if the online thing grows, and as you're saying when there's no gatekeeper, anyone's in, and this is a problem now, okay. As you said, it can be on us, it can be on, it should have us individually, but most people don't have that real risk there too. People are lazy. Right. And that's, and that's, and so that laziness is going to apply except there's not even a shred of, of gatekeeping. So that the problem with a lot of the news that the problem with the fake news critique is that it's encompassing a lot of angles on the news.

Speaker 3:          00:57:30       So it's not that the news itself is wrong, it's angles on it. It's like how politifact does their analysis. So politifact, we'll say about, Mitt Romney will say this, I, this happened during the campaign. Hillary Clinton said something about she liked open borders. Trump goes on stage and says, Hillary Clinton says she likes open borders. Politifact analyzes it and gives it a half true. Right? And he's just repeating exactly what she said, but say, I bet his implication was that she was saying x, y, and Z. It's like, well now that's your calling his stuff fake news, but you're the actual fake news because you're reading implications that you're reading into him. Uh, once, once you get into reading other people's implications, uh, you ended up in some pretty dicey territory. But it used to be that when there was actual fake news, people lost their jobs, right?

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       Like Jason Blair promulgated Fake News and lost his job at a publication that we on the right hate the New York Times. Um, but that's it. There's a difference between that and the angle on the news is wrong or the facts of the story, right? And the angle is wrong. That's not fake news that you don't like the angle on the story. Right? And so, but the left and the right trade, it should recognize this. Not everything that comes from the Washington Post or New York Times is false. It may just be that the angle that they're giving you is an angle that you don't like or an angle that that doesn't reflect underlying truth. It's been out of the facts of the story, right? Yeah. The facts of the story. Right. So when the New York Times reports something like, you know, a, when the New York Times reports a, the, the, if they'd reported, uh, the hands up don't shoot thing just straight.

Speaker 3:          00:58:49       That's, that's fake news. If they report that a black guy was killed by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and then they went with proceeds to report it as though it's a serious problem all across the country. The fake news part of that is their angle. It's not that a black guy was shot by the white guy, you know, in, in Ferguson, Missouri. And what I've seen is that people are throwing the baby out with the bath water. So it turns out you can't believe anything in the media says right now you can't believe their angle. You can't believe anything they say. So if they say Donald Trump hasn't turned over his, his irs reports, he hasn't turned over his, his tax returns. There's a tendency for people to say that's fake news is we know that that's not fake news. That's true. You might not think it matters.

Speaker 3:          00:59:24       You may have 10 excuses why it's stupid, but that's not fake news per se. When everybody just called stuff they disagree with fake news and it's happening now again on both sides. I've never felt simultaneously less bipartisan and more bipartisan about life than I have in the recent past. And then again, that's where I think opportunities because there's so much being reset right now. W what do you think about the risk of, it's not coming from the government in some ways, censorship right now, but we know what's happened with prager u videos where they've put hard restricted lists. We've had, I did an interview with John Mccain who is on, who was on cable news every single day to decided to demonetize it. I mean, you know, I did my interview with Ion Hursey. I leave 80 monetized. Uh, we have all kinds of stories now. If things getting hurt and algorithms, even my low being banned, I get it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:10       Twitter can do what they want. Yeah. So all of this stuff is starting to add up to something, right? Like there's something cracking down on this new wild west out here. Yeah, for sure. And I think that you've seen, you know, twitter pay for some of that and in market share, it's going to be incumbent on people on the right to build an alternative structure to these things. And that's very expensive. And people on the right don't tend to think in terms of media too much. So we invest a lot of money and politicians and we invest a lot of money and think tanks, but we don't invest all that much money in media. There are a few kinds of people who will invest money in media, but the number of like we gave $100 million to somebody to start a business very low. You'll see a lot of people who spend like five to $10 million to start something, but to start an actual twitter, you know that that requires enormous expenditures, the capital.

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       And most people on the right don't see that as a winning business proposition because people on the right tend to think in terms of Roi and twitter hasn't even seen an Roi, right? Whatever twitter is losing money still. So it's, and, and also it's, it's hard to go up against the behemoths like youtube, like there've been some attempts to go up against against youtube before there is a conservative attempt to go up against youtube. It didn't do particularly well because the problem is that it was billed as the conservative attempt to go up against youtube. It wasn't built as open to everyone. And so you sort of have to, to do the open to everybody routine in order to really succeed. But you're at it, you artist systemic disadvantage. Youtube has existed for, for forever. But again, youtube is just what the New York Times was 30 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:01:36       The only thing in the space as, as things progressed, I think that you're, I mean the truth is that youtube is just a search service with a lot of big w with a lot of servers that provide space for the videos. And I'm, I'm old enough to remember when ask jeeves was a threat and then Google eight. So or hotmail, I mean like all the prodigy. That's probably before your time. Yeah, exactly. They're all, all these things look insurmountable at the time and then over time the market destroys them, right? Aol was the big thing and now nobody uses say, oh well, I mean the thing is, look, this show is on one of our, our main method of distribution is youtube. So I want youtube to work, I want to work. So it, and I think that it's, it's, it's a very interesting debate.

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       I will say it's an interesting debate when people look at private companies like youtube and they say, well, they shouldn't ban anything. And it's like, well, you can make the argument that youtube should ban certain things like a, like a graphic terrorist video, for example. Should it, do they have the right to do that? Now for me, I'd rather err on the side of everything goes up, then think and then certain things come down because I don't really trust people in charge of anything to to to do that. This is why I'm more libertarian, even when it comes to things like youtube, but I see the argument. I mean not all, not all forms of speech are created exactly equal, at least in their merit. They are in there in terms of your right to say them, but they're not necessarily in terms of merit. And when you're in the private sector, you're speaking about merit. You're not just trying to speak in terms of right to say.

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       Yeah. Do you think there could be a first amendment issue related to all this? Now I get it. It's

Speaker 3:          01:03:01       governor. When people try and make the utilities argument, I don't think it's a particularly good

Speaker 2:          01:03:04       really, because to me it seems, it seems maybe not fully because we don't know what a public utility, if there's something else going on. So it's not utilities. But I would argue that the owners of these companies, the people on the board, you know, Jack Zuckerberg and all these people, they are so intertwined with our politicians right now. Yeah. That now we actually, I'm not saying it's directly a first amendment thing, but there's something there because it's almost collusion with it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:29       So I, I agree. And the, and the solution to that is to downsize the government radically, not to, not to have, you know, our guy do it. Right. You know, that's it and that, that's, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm seeing generally is like it's a, it's our guy doing it so it's okay now. But um, but yeah, of course. I think that that Zuckerberg working closely, here's the thing, Zuckerberg wouldn't be working with the government if the government were powerful. Right? Like if we, we spend a lot of money on the government, we give money to political candidates. We spend all of our time talking about trump or hillary because the government's powerful. I think anybody spent tons of time talking like in 1836 about, about the national election. I'm sure they spend some time talking about it, but it wasn't dominant the way that it is now. The idea that people were just, they could be the most important decision that I was. People not dating, right. Destroying their lives because if who won the presidency when it was Franklin Pierce, no, nobody, nobody was doing that. This is part of the reason is that the federal government just was not particularly powerful. So what do you care what some bureaucrat in Washington DC is doing? It doesn't affect you.

Speaker 2:          01:04:26       So that really, uh, I've said this a couple times. To me that's the best argument for small government. Yeah, I agree. Which is if you don't like Hillary and you don't like trump, it's not, well then I should vote for more Democrats or vote for more Republicans. These idiots out of our way.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       Exactly. Exactly. And that's, and that's the, I think the only smart thing, the repair, he said in his presidential campaign in 2012 and you said you wanted to make Washington dc insignificant in your life. I was like, yeah, that sounds great to me. Yeah. Because I said or anything else. Yeah, exactly. I said, I set it up. I say this on college campuses all the time on college campuses. Kids are constantly thinking, oh, there's so many obstacles to what I want to do. And you see in politics now, trump keeps saying there's an obstacle to what you want to do, and I'm the left. Hillary says there's an obstacle and I'll knock down all obstacles. We're all gonna knock down all the obstacles and they erect new obstacles, right? Yeah. And it's in, what I've always said is nobody gives a crap about you. Like no one cares about you.

Speaker 3:          01:05:12       No one sitting around going, Dave Ruben, I got to stop that guy. How do I stop Dave rule? But there's a couple of people there. There are, there are a few people. That's true. But as a, as a general matter, if you weren't even in politics, if you're just a guy, right? Nobody would be sitting around going, how do I stop Dave Rubin for becoming a successful accountant right now? Nobody is doing that. And except that the government does do that actually. And so if we could apply that same sentiment to the government like nobody, it's none. It's nobody's business. What you do with your life, leave me alone. Solve your own problems, right? Those, those few sentences in conjunction would solve a lot of, would solve a lot of problems, right? Solve your own problems. Get the government out of your life. Nobody cares about you except like you and your family and your friends, right?

Speaker 3:          01:05:51       Know nobody's actively plotting against you. I know that we all live in our own little movie and we did. We all live in our movie where they're a great villains and you're the great hero and we're all like this. Every human being is like this, which is why movies are successful, but in reality, how many people in a lifetime actually have active enemies who are acquiring, attempting to thwart their every move? You know how many people just have like the jerk of a boss? He's bothering them. Although oddly in our space now for public people, the idea of the enemies is growing. Oh yes. Yeah. I get it. For the regular person. You know, it would be nice to think that now you say regular, we don't mean like less than we just people, not politics. Exactly. I think people that are probably doing much, much more for the world, but we are but, but the idea that you stake out a position now publicly and you immediately have enemies.

Speaker 3:          01:06:36       I mean I see all the time now things will be written about me that I know were absolutely not true. And they'll call me your far right winger and they'll all of these things, what I've said about this or that and they misquote me or any of this or like partial quote and it's like I could spend the rest of my life fighting this stuff or I can ignore it. And I usually try to ignore it because I got to live somewhere. And again, it's because of these topics have become so intense because there is so much control over how these things go. And also when one, when the government's very small, everyone on the eye, everyone on the inside is a little bit fascist. But I mean by that is everybody wants to be the king, right? It's just you don't want anybody else to be the king.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       You want to be the king, right? You'll be the good king. You'll be the one person in human history has been an excellent, excellent king who is always generous with power and decent with everybody. You're going to be too narrow, storm, boring. You're just gonna go around breaking chains and everything's going to be spectacular and that, and so as politics, when politics was small, that didn't matter because the best thing you could hope for to be your own, you know, your, your fiefdom was your house, your fiefdom, you're homeless, your kingdom, your fiefdom was your family, right? It was. Those are the people you were, those were your subjects and those were your citizens, right? Those were the people. You took care of a, and now government is so big that you actually have a shot at being king. And when people think they have a shot at being king or at least getting into position a person who is going to be the king for them, then you're an obstacle to their utopia, right?

Speaker 3:          01:07:56       It trump, if trump is utopia and I'm not voting for him, I'm an obstacle to their, you'd hope you have hillary is utopia and she's going to be the great, the great chain breaker and I'm standing in her way, then I'm an obstacle to utopia, right? Everybody either becomes, as I've said before, a tool or an obstacle to utopia. If you think that utopia is realizable on a political level, if you don't think that you're a fool, like one of the things that, one of the things that I've, uh, I think there are certain areas where it just in life you become more mature as you get older a little bit and you see more of this. And one is that when you're, when you're 18 or 19 or 20, your utopian, you think, how do I solve this problem and this problem won't be a problem ever again.

Speaker 3:          01:08:30       And then you read more history and you deal in politics more, and you realize there's never a problem that actually goes away. All the problems come back. And it's just a question of, can you push the ball a little bit this way? Can you push it a little, a little bit this way in favor of human liberty. Can you push? Can you, can you push the looming disaster a little bit further down the road? Right? Is that it? And, and when you do that, you become, you become a problem for people who want utopia. Because Utopia requires a lot of people to be willing to sacrifice their present for a future that doesn't exist. Uh, and that's, that's a scary thing. I think everybody's a little bit Utopian now. And that's, that's everyone's feeling that on both sides, right? Because you could argue that the trump people are feeling it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       He's gonna bring all the jobs back to Ohio. All of them are coming back, right? He's going to make sure that we never have a terrorist attack on American soil again, and he's going to do it with his magic wand. Right? And he's going to do it by not trusting the CIA or the FBI, but still we'll get it done somehow. We should pause there for a second because what, what are you making that we were just for one minute. I have no idea what to do. So, so yes, I think Russia hacked the DNC. Uh, do I think that it exposed things that were, you see the evidence, right? Okay. So was legit, right? Yeah. I mean, the Democrats are basically acknowledged that the contents of it were real. They weren't making things up. So I think Russia was behind the hacks. And so I think that shaped the election.

Speaker 3:          01:09:41       Not really. I think Hillary would have lost anyway. And the, I did a piece a few minutes ago about this where I think that there's some evidence to that effect. One is that hillary is unfavorable ratings. In January of this year, before any of the wikileaks stuff happened, her favorable ratings were, I think it was 43% favorable. Uh, sorry, it's 38% favorable, 56% unfavorable. November 4th through seventh. Right before the election, she was at 43% favorable, 56% unfavorable, so she did not move at all. Right. There was no point where she built, she was consistently unpopular all the way across. It wasn't wiki leaks made are unpopular. The big thing that hurt her in the last couple of weeks was the comey thing was the FBI director saying he was reopening the investigation and that had nothing to do with Wiki leaks that had to do with Anthony Weiner's computer. So it wasn't the wikileaks that actually shifted things, right?

Speaker 3:          01:10:26       It was. It was. It was a lot of other things, but it wasn't the wikileaks per se that that said, again, this is a case of shoe on the other foot. If the Russians had hacked the RNC and trump loses by 80,000 votes in three states, right. Are we crying black or, or be up in arms. Oh, right, right, right. Exactly. Would we, and would we be, you know, we have people on the right would be crying bloody murder. It'd be the end of the world. Again, the hypocrisy on both sides is pretty astonishing. I'm the on the left going, although those evil, evil, evil Russians, they're so evil. I hate the Russians. In 2012 Obama was openly saying caught on microphone. I want flexibility. I can give flexibility to Russia if they helped me out in this election cycle, no problem. That's fine. Months of when Romney said they're our biggest geopolitical foe and everyone mocked him.

Speaker 3:          01:11:07       Right. And and also within months of hint of, of Obama backing off the red line in Syria and within two years of him backing off of the Ukraine stuff, right? And so they didn't care about Russia for years ago, but now they care deeply about the threat of Russian on the right. The same people going, Russia's our major geopolitical foe in 20 [inaudible]. I don't see the problem with gluten. Well why? Why can't we be friends with Putin who, how's this? How's this a problem? And say, my goodness. I mean if, if your, if your belief switch that fast, I'm going to go with you really had not a lot of core. So to me because I can't really figure out what the actual truth is. I don't think anyone really knows that. We haven't seen the right out of the question is do you believe the CIA and the FBI or do you believe self motivated people on both sides?

Speaker 3:          01:11:43       Although right now it sounds like the CIA and FBI aren't even in complete agreement on what happened. They both do agree that the, that the Russian sources were behind the attacks, they just don't agree on what the motive was. Right, right. So the FBI says it was to undermine the election integrity and the CIA says that it was to get trump elected. Yeah. Given trump's position stated positions on Putin, which were incredibly warm throughout the campaign, I don't find the CIA's claim implausible, but again, their motives doesn't, don't matter. Bottom line is did they shift the election? There is no evidence they did. So the reason I guess I'm a little more skeptical is that if, let's say we really knew it was true at some, that this was true technic, wouldn't that basically be an act of war at this point? If, if Obama knew right now, if the FBI or CIA came to him that this actually happened, they were in cahoots with trump or whatever it is, you would be an act.

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       I mean either way down sanctions or some sort of military, I mean that would, that would be a true undermining of our democracy at the highest levels. So the fact that we're not talking about that, not that I want to be a war with Russia, I would be completely again against. Right. But the fact that it's not getting to that level shows me that this seems like more of a game or political showmanship then something that's real. It also demonstrates a massive increase in partisanship. And the reason I say that is because go back to 1972 and Richard Nixon is bugging the Watergate Hotel and an attempt to get information about mcgovern. Right. And he's swamps mcgovern. It's pretty clear that he didn't need to bug the hotel in order to get the information. Matt mcgovern to swamp them make up the winds like two states. So, and then he's impeached by row Republicans.

Speaker 3:          01:13:13       Republicans are getting, and he's not technically he retires, but he's about to be impeached by Republicans. Or Republicans are going to impeach him for that. Now you have a foreign power doing what Nixon did write the exact same thing and they bugged the DNC, right? They, that's the, that the allegation and nobody on the right cares and nobody on the right care. It's like, it's, I don't think that has to do with, you know, people aren't taking this seriously. I think that one of the questions is just, all right, how happy are you that they did it and when the question is and, and so I think that there are a lot of people on the right guy. Well, it's good they did it. I don't mind that they did it. I mean, after all hillary had it coming, that's like that. So didn't mcgovern kind of in the sense that the government was awful, but that doesn't really change the activity.

Speaker 3:          01:13:50       Well, isn't the other piece of this that if this all happened, doesn't it show ineptitude at the highest levels of our current government? I mean this, not that Obama in self would be making decisions related to this, but you'd have to fire almost everyone at every security service. And then at the DNC, right, everybody was responsible for the, for the security of the DNC. Yeah. But it has been government agencies apparently there, there's some hacking of government agencies has been going on for a while and the word cyber war with, with China and we have been for a long time. Um, yes. I mean the government, as I've said, socks at virtually everything and the solution seems to be more government from both sides. Now the year of small government is over and the, the, the idea that the government is going to shrink in any margin in any measurable way, I think is, is fallacy.

Speaker 2:          01:14:34       So on the history repeats itself for a long game idea. There is opportunity here, right? Because let it get big so that people will ultimately see that it does not work. And then, and then the era of small government may be can come or do you think is right and get to a tipping point where you just can't come back.

Speaker 3:          01:14:49       Yeah, I mean I, I do think that you get to a tipping point, but it sounded tipping point where you can't come back. It's a tipping point where we actually hit disaster right here, the Greek tipping point where at a certain point you must hit the austerity button because otherwise your country is absolutely bankrupt and then you get riots in the streets. And so the question is how, how ugly are things when reality sets in? Because the reality is you can't keep affording to pay for all of this stuff. Eventually one of two things happens either wise up or you go bankrupt like California's about to do when things get really ugly. So it's, so the question is which one we head toward and the fact that a lot of the gains of sort of the Buckley, Reagan conservative small government era had been put behind us in favor of this bigger government nationalist populism.

Speaker 3:          01:15:28       That's not a good sign that we're moving in in the wising up direction. It's actually a sign that we're moving in the opposite and that word that we're kind of now, okay, fine. The government's peg, we except the government's big. What can the government do for me today? Yeah. Um, and that's, that's a, that's a problem. This is why like people were very intense during the campaign. Conservatives saying, Mike Pence, trump selects him. Isn't that great? They're very enthusiastic about the pens. Peck. And I was like, yeah, Mike Pence seems good. And then you've got my pencil now going around to rallies with Donald Trump is free markets here saying that he's okay with tariffs and saying the free market fails when it's tried and from going every time, every time. And it's like, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hold on. That's very sick coming from trump. Okay. That trump's been saying that stick the whole time.

Speaker 3:          01:16:09       But like pence rally good. At what point until we, as I say, we're not going to see, you know, really where the Republican party lies until the first conflict between trump and the republicans. Like, are there enough republicans who are going to stand up against him? I don't think so either. And I think the trump has building machine outside government in order to take down the ones who do. Right. He's, he, he has Kellyanne Conway building this uh, this apparently this machine, it's going to seek to push his message outside government and maybe primary people who, who don't grant him the leeway. So

Speaker 2:          01:16:40       such a sad state of affairs because it's like we've never needed a strong independent fourth the state more than this. That's right here. That functions properly now and it's exactly what we don't have.

Speaker 3:          01:16:50       Yeah. Well this is a, I've been saying this now for several months and I was thinking during the Obama era too, is that it was clear that the country is ready for a demagogic fashion efficient stick leader. Cause they just want something done. Right. That's the fascist. Like people, the Word Fascism always brings to mind Nazis and Jack boots and all this stuff. But the truth is that most kind of, most dictatorial governments don't start off that way. Most of them start off with, we have a breakdown in the political system. We need somebody to do something right now. Right now there are too many pressing problems. Get somebody in there to fix it right now. And if you look back at history, most dictatorial governments don't start with the ultimately bad dictator. They start with a couple of educators who actually are not quite as bad, right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:29       If you look at it like Germany, 1930, 1932 you're looking at at people who actually aren't that bad, right? You're looking at it bruning and you're looking at it on paper and you're looking at a bunch of people who, uh, who are I hurt people who are like basically not terrible, awful human beings, but the centralize all the power here and then the next person who sweeps in is the bad guy, right? So whether you think that Obama was a bad guy, whether you think trump is the bad guy, once you bring all the power to one place, once you've created the, once you forged the ring of power, then it's only a matter of time before the bad guy gets ahold of the ring of power. Unless you destroy the ring of power. Because you'll have a bunch of people who are seduced by the ring of power.

Speaker 3:          01:18:05       But eventually somebody bad we'll get ahold of eventually he'll bring a power will make its way back to sal Ron. So you may think that trump isn't the guy who's the threat, which is fine. Maybe he isn't. You know, I assume that he isn't because I don't really see that we necessarily is. Maybe you think Obama wasn't the guy. Maybe you think that Obama wasn't the true threat to American democracy and liberalism, but once you've got this much power in one place, somebody will be, somebody will be elected at some point who just says, screw all of the norms. Things have to get done. The trains have to run on time. Right? It's not only

Speaker 2:          01:18:33       that, it may not be the guy you like, it could be someone heard, it could be somebody. Really. That metaphor was pretty good, but can you get that into a star wars thing? Is that possible? Can you get that into some?

Speaker 3:          01:18:42       Well, I mean, there were no real good way to destroy the dark side of the force, right? Yeah. So in, in it's, it's not quite as, it's not quite as good, but everybody is, everybody has to do so well. Like when you're a kid, everybody wants to be darth Vader, right? Yeah. When you're a kid, nobody wants to be Luke skywalker. Everybody wants to be darth Vader, darth vader. As much cooler, you can strangle people, but his mind, right? I mean, like he can relate to it. It's much cooler. There's only one problem, which is that you also have to build this enormous staffs starting below planets. So eventually the powers, right. I'm in. Come on. Alderaan screw those guys. Lauren. Screw those guys. All right, one more for you. Shapiro.

Speaker 2:          01:19:15       Uh, because I get this tweeted at me a lot. People say, Dave, you should run for president in 2020, but on the second part of the ticket, Shapiro

Speaker 3:          01:19:25       number wine, you'd show people that bridges can be built, blah, blah, blah. Would you ever go into politics? I'm not in California. Uh, and, and given the way that our current politics is going, it seems like only celebrities can be elected. So, um, well you'll have that part down. I mean, you have your following. That's, yeah, but it's, you don't have to be, it would have to be a lot larger following than that. Right on that necessarily. It's, uh, it's something that, that I could see doing at some point. Um, yeah, 2020 is a little soon. Uh, it's a, it's a, but yeah, I'm, I'm not averse to the idea of, of running for office at some point, but it depends on whether you can do more good outside of government. You're inside government, especially when you want to destroy the instrument itself. Uh, so is it not just read the entirety of the government to destroy a lot of the power of it? Uh, and

Speaker 2:          01:20:11       so it sorta could never in a way you'd suffer from. Although I know you don't. I'm telling the truth with a little bit with Rand Paul and a lot of stuff. Um, you'd suffer, you'd suffer [inaudible] policy by the way. I agree with a lot of what Ram I'll ask. Right. But, but I know in foreign policy and some other things, but you would suffer from the same thing that he suffered from, which is I'm the out, I'm trying to make this thing smaller. You're even if you're all conservatives, you're still trying to make it bigger for the party. Can't really rally around you cause it, it doesn't really fit the way people think. Yeah. I mean I think that

Speaker 3:          01:20:38       to benefit from backlash politics, you have to have, as you say, there could come a point where government is so big that people are actually willing to hear a message of solve your own problems. Screw the government. These people have, have destroyed lives and power centralizing in one place is not the answer. Um, but you know, people will have to be convinced of that because until then everybody has the everybody on the inside, once that ring, everybody inside, once the, the dark side of the force. And so, uh, my job right now is the same as yours, which is tell people the Truth and hope that they awakened to the fact that your life is in your hands. Um, and if it's not in your hands, then we need to, we need to change the system so that it is in your hands and people aren't taking things away from you or promising you things because the promise is just another way to take something away from you. Sometimes it's your, your actual, uh, your, your actual self control and self esteem. Uh, somebody makes a promise to give you something and they're taking something away from you too. Nothing is, nothing is free. So if you want to be totally self sufficient, then we need an actual place that that allows self sufficiency.

Speaker 2:          01:21:39       Nothing's free. I thought if you, if someone gives you something, it's free. You mean that someone else is paying for that? It's right. It turns out, yeah, I see. I have to do it. It's that inability to understand that may be screwing all of us. Yeah. Guilty liberal. Exactly. Exactly. All right, well it was a pleasure talking to you. It was great. Great to be here. And our, uh, your office is not that far from my new student. Yeah, that's true. So I suspect we'll be doing a lot more of these crossovers. I think we could, you know, 2020. I just, I really, I just could never be president. I could be vice president. Well, it's a, it's a cush job. I mean like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:22:10       he just sit there and you go to like a nice house and

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       I've yet to meet Joe Biden. Yeah, I'd be very good at that. I just, I feel like you'd be much better in terms of the big anyway, uh, for more on Ben Shapiro, follow him on twitter at Ben Shapiro. I tried not to send him Nazi memes if you could. Uh, but again, if you do, if you do all frame them, put him on my wall, you know, really just take pleasure in them and enjoy them. Yeah. And I know he won't ban you, so there you go. That's true. All right.
