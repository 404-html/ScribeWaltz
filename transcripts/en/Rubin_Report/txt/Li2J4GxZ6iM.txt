Speaker 1:          00:00:54       All right people, we are live on the youtube. I've got the lobster and I've got the hair. It sounds like some sort of seventies because that, could that be a rock band or is that like a, it could be some kind of violent flick or a mafia movie or violent band. Violent rock man. Yeah. Alright. I've wanted to get you guys together. You two have never been seen on camera before. I think that's true as far as you know, I, I did appear in front of Jordan, but uh, we never intersected onstage at the masonic. When you decided I should have opened a. When you paid your mean harmonica, Harmonica, Solo. Out of all the Zany moments that we've had in the last two months, would you say that bringing Eric Weinstein, mathematician out onstage at the masonic to play the harmonica and have 3000 people give him a standing ovation?

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       Would that be at the top? That was good. That was good. It worked really well too because he turned out he actually could play the harmonica, which is a good thing if you're going to try it in front of 3000 people. It was a first for me. I've done. I didn't play it in front of a smaller crowd before that, so that was a bit of a bio. It was pretty sweet. All right, so good night. Yeah. All right. I want to cover 100 percent new stuff for the next two hours. There's a bunch of stuff obviously that we've been hitting on on tour and some things that we've been sort of catching up on as this has all been going on, so I thought the place to start I think would be something that I've been starting a lot of the shows with when I go out there and I do a little intro and to get everybody going and warm it up for Jordan.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       The idea that we're starting to win and when I've been saying when there's a feeling in the crowd of like, Whoa, maybe all of this madness that we've all been talking about for all these years. Maybe enough people have woken up now that there is something shifting, so I've brought that up a bunch and you've sort of picked up on it on a couple of the shows and talked about why winning isn't necessarily the way we should view this or what winning actually. So I thought that would be a good place to kick us off here. It's more what winning actually is, you know, because one of the things that has to be contended with in the current situation is that, especially in the United States, but also the rest of the Western

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       world, there's a political divide. Americans have been voting 50 percent Republican, Fifty Percent Democrat for, for lecture, pretty much split right down the middle and there there can't be any final victory by one side over the other because everyone has to live together. So the victory is how can we continue to live together peacefully and productively and, and, and, and we have to figure out the pathway forward to that. But then I think there's another kind of victory that it's deeper than that that's on the horizon, which is that I think the narrative that underlies our culture as a whole has to shift. And I started to think about this when I was working for a UN committee about five years ago. I worked on a committee on sustainability for the secretary general and um, I had a chance with the people that I was working for and with in Canada to rewrite the underlying narrative because it was very pessimistic.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       It was real cold war narrative north against south and capitalists against Socialists and doom and gloom on the horizon. And it seemed to me to be outdated really by about 40 years. And I started to read a lot of the economic development and ecology literature. And mostly what I found was that things are getting better globally so fast and on so many different dimensions that it's almost inconceivable. And yet no one seems to know that. And in the aftermath of that, there's been about six books published in the last five years that like pinker's book and lightened it right over here somewhere. Yeah, right. But, but uh, but by no means that's by no means the only book detailing now a revolution in living standard progress and, and ecological progress for that matter around the world. So I think there's two victories to be held here to be had here. One is to pull us everyone out of the pessimistic apocalyptic Cold War narrative that enveloped us for four or five decades and to notice that the future could actually be bright if we were careful. And the second is to make sure that the political dialogue in the West doesn't polarize to the degree that we start doing things that are fatally stupid. All right, so let's talk about the second part first

Speaker 3:          00:05:09       because I think that's where we've really been focusing on the political part. So it's interesting to note there's a 50 slash 50 divides. I don't think that's a reason. I guess I have a strongly different take and maybe it's the same. We'll have to figure that out. To me, the 50 slash 50 mark is going to more or less hold as long as these two parties can calculate a what's the maximum they can, uh, w with the minimum they have to give up to win an election. And so the, the key issue is what is the 50 slash 50 composition look like? And unfortunately what it keeps looking like is the two parties becoming more and more a nightmarish in my mind and less trustworthy. So we, the 50 slash 50 continues to hold. But what it represents as a tension, the tension increases is getting much worse.

Speaker 3:          00:06:01       So the key issue is that those of us who are sort of center, I mean I don't love the left right spectrum, but let's just use it as shorthand that the center left and the center right have to see each other as our natural allies and the center left has to Clean House and get rid of the night he left and the center right has to get rid of the far right. And that's the optimistic scenario. I think winning is incredibly important. Okay. Well, that's an interesting way of conceptualizing it and let me go a little bit further. Sure. I think that we have to stop being apologetic about winning and what winning means. Winning means that the advanced guard of the a radical center, uh, has to make this a safe and habitable space again. And so in order to do that, um, and the reason I, you know, try to focus mostly most of my negative energy on the left is, is that it's my responsibility to clean house on the radical bad progressive movement that is almost certainly going to fuel the far right.

Speaker 3:          00:07:04       It's not efficient for me to go after the far right because, I mean, of course I'm going to be anti Nazi skinhead, right? But what we've, we've talked about that a lot too because when we do the events, you know, you will all these hit pieces that come out and we'll talk a little bit about that. Well, when they say that your audience is all these angry white men, you, all of this nonsense, which every night it is proven to be false, um, it's like, yeah, you address that every night talking about the bad identity politics of the right, but it's not something that well bullied. The thing that's strange and then that ties into what you're saying as well, is that it isn't obvious to me who the dangerous right are, you know, it's obvious to me who the dangerous Lakhdar because they occupied the universities but not just the universities.

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       This is an, I mean, this is so mispunch, if you will, that we have to really break the frame and, and reweave it. So, um, the journalists keep saying, oh, you guys are focusing on a tiny problem afflicting a few universities that mostly nobody's ever heard of. That's definitely not true. Well, the first thing is, is that it deflects the problem from the, the number one problem isn't the universities. It's journalism. And so the idea is that the journalists are saying, you guys are complaining about, uh, the small story in the university. It's like, no, no, you're getting it wrong. We're complaining about the number one story, which is the sensemaking a apparatus having gone haywire. And if you think about these journalists that we're now dealing with as like the hermit crabs that have crawled into the shells that we used to know, right? So whether it's CNN or NPR or national review or whatever these structures are, it's a different group of hermit crab shells are the same. And the great danger is that if you recognize the font at the top of the La Times, The New York Times, you think you're getting the same product, but the product has become radically different. Uh, and there was a problem

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       back then. I'm not saying that, that, that there wasn't. And you know, of course, the, the issue is that when we criticize journalists now they think we're criticizing journalism far from it. We are praying for journalists and the idea is, is that we are fighting this thing where they've got their fingers so clearly on the scale that everything is being tipped and what you're getting is a more distorted reality. There's some point at which, and we have to talk about what happened with, I don't know how to pronounce it best. IATROGENIC medicine, the idea that doctors are creating a, created a huge amount of the harm done found in hospitals. Well, maybe stairs are the fourth leading cause of death, right? So now we have to talk not about yet regenix which is the, you know, the, the, that which originates from the healers, but journal genics, which is what is the harm done to the truth by journalists.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       And that is, so I have a, uh, a technological slapped on that to some degree because one of the things that I think is happening because I've watched large organizations degenerate because I've worked as a consultant for a lot of years now. It's really interesting to see how fast a large organization that you think is semipermanent can disintegrate. It can happen. Well, certainly within the span of a couple of years and sometimes a lot faster than not. Yes. Well, and I think one of the things that seems to be happening to me is that as television dies under the weight of youtube primarily, but let's say online video and perhaps also podcasts, is that the remaining journalists, the hermit crabs who occupied the old shells, which is a good way of thinking about it, gets increasingly desperate for attention. And so there are pushed by economic pressure in some sense and situational pressure to exaggerate the danger.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       It's like. And it's a clickbait phenomena essentially. And it seems to me to be akin to what's happened with, with reports on the crime rate. So, you know, over the last 25 years, the five major indices of violent crime have declined by 50 percent, which is absolutely in, in the United States. Staggering decrease. But the rate of reporting of violent crime has gone up substantially. And so people think that things are more dangerous now than they were, even though they're safer now than they have been since the early sixties. And they were safe for them than they'd ever been in history. So I think one of the things in it, and it's interesting to think about the technological forces driving this because youtube and podcast do pose a fatal threat, I would say certainly to to to television and so it makes sense to me that as the journalists become less professional and less in demand and their messages Ha has, has, is, is chasing a diminishing audience that they're going to get noisier and noisier about what's going on and the trick for everyone else who's being immersed in that is to stay sane and sensible while the death throes play themselves out.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       So wouldn't you naturally think though that more of them would start seeing this? I mean what we

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       now see, so clearly I meant more of them would be jumping ship or is that old shells so tainted or corroded? That getting out of that thing is almost impossible. It has to do with systems of selective pressure. So Jordan raises an excellent point that the dying throws of an institution tend to be its most violent because it's go for broke mode and not worrying about tomorrow. It's worrying about maybe serve up buying another month or two or who knows what, but there's another issue of course, which is that the formats are set. Uh, so your news comes to you in a form that is more or less the same every day and so you know how to consume it. So everybody listens to NPR, has a pre, grooved a template in their brain. I'm going to get the top stories at the top of the hour and then they're going to be this many pieces and there'll be like a feel good story.

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       So you know exactly what you're going to get. Like here, we don't know where we're going to. Maybe Jordan and I are going to come to blows open. You've got to change the drink. But the other thing that, uh, is, is it in the system of selective pressures, as the business model fails, you have a fascinating phenomena which people who are willing to accept, um, strange, uh, uh, blends of payment. So lower financial payment and security job security, but higher psychic payment stemming from the idea that they are crusading, uh, are going to start to dominate. So you're seeing many more people who are willing to substitute activism and the sense that they are protecting us. And a great story about the resistance, let's say. Yeah, so that, that actually becomes more and more necessary as the stability and the viability of the system degenerate, right?

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       If you could offer, um, you know, $200,000 salaries to a good reporters, uh, in short order so that they could start families and buy homes and have an easier life. Like one of the things that you need to do is you need to pay people more if you're unhappy with them. And this, I think I learned about that, about professors to actually sociology professors had, their salary's tripled. They'd be a lot less radically. I learned this from the New Orleans police department where at some point they had a corruption where people were ordering a mob style, hits over police radio. And I think what happened was that the new police chief came in and he said the first thing he did was raise salaries and the idea being that you have to have skin in the game thanks to the scene to levees that phrases a proliferative thanks the same wherever you are, um, and you need to give people something to defend.

Speaker 3:          00:14:26       And so it's very important to pay the people that we are, um, decrying all the time. Say everybody who's listening should go online and donate to quill. X patron page is doing great. What I'm saying that we should, we should try to figure out how to get vox more money as well and we should try to figure out how to get slate and salon and all of these things so that you can afford to pay people in ways in which they don't have to take a large portion of their payment as psychic gratification from having Feld Imaginary Dragon. But just to be clear there, when you're saying that, you're not saying that the current people who have screwed this whole thing up deserve more money. You're going to find, you can find, I have a very strange position on this, which is in, in, you know, my, my friend Peter Teal, and I talk about this all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:15:18       Uh, his model is that, you know, at some level when the economy isn't working, people engage in this kind of nonsensical, a fratricide, uh, of a, of a type. And my point is slightly different, which is this, this bad nature is always there, but it's like a compromised immune system when the, when the economy starts to fail, you start to become aware of all of the pathogens in the world because it can't fight them off. And so it's, it's very much the issue that if you're the guy with compromised immune system, you're the only one aware of all the pathogens in the world. Um, and so at the moment our collective economic community system is failing, uh, and I actually am much more pessimistic than you are Jordan. I see lots of reasons to be happy about the decrease in violence. But you know, one of the problems with the accounting in these theories is that the sword of Damocles that hangs over our heads is, has gotten quite large and the number of threads holding it up or seem very few in number and so you have to do the potential energy accounting as well as the realized violence and also understanding that the nature of an income inequality and um, differential access to financial markets and technology is creating a lot of very justifiable concern that the post World War II stability it is constantly in jeopardy and we don't, I personally think we should think about once every five years above ground nuclear tests to remind ourselves of what it is that we've pushed underground and we haven't seen for years because we are engaged in some kind of magical thinking that the world is fairly stable and that can turn on a dime.

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       So what kind of out do you think we could for this crew of journalists that were talking about that we want to be doing more journalism. We don't want them to be attacked or any of those things. Of course. What is the out? So the I get it. You can give. You could fund them in a way that gives them a little more breathing room, but one of the things that I'm seeing when we're on tour is p, everyone that comes up to me after says, wow, you just gave us a little room to think. Yeah, so is there a way we, instead of beating these journalists, instead of getting the wind where you crush them so that they are losers, what's the way that we can give them maybe a little. Well, I mean it, it's, it's sort of standard behavioral practice. In some senses. This is something that was established by skinner a long while back even though he used threaten punishment as ways of altering the behavior of his experimental animals. He also used reward

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       but rewards a lot harder to use because what you have to do is you have to watch very carefully and then when you see an increment in the behavior that you want to want to promote, you have to reward it, but it requires a tremendous amount of tension and subtle attention. And so one of the things that we can certainly do, and that I've been trying to do to some degree with my twitter account is to, is to distribute good news, good credible news and good journalism when I see it, which is partly why I started to get engaged, say with Colette, because I think they're doing a credible job, but one possibility is to distribute those pieces that seem to be increasingly reasonable and another is to also leaped to the defense of people when they're taken out as individuals and because one of the things that's happening now is that when an individual stands up and says something especially that annoys the radical left, is that they tend to get mobbed and taken out and that's a bad thing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       It would be good if we could figure out ways of defending people against that. I mean, Brett has been defended to some degree by the emergence of this group of people that, that Eric has been describing as the intellectual dark web. And so there is some strength in numbers there that might be usefully applied. Can you just quickly talk about that? Just on the personal level, because I think one of the most moving things that I've heard on this show is when, uh, I had you on and I think, I think it was with bread and you said that standing with him was really one of the most validating things that you've ever done in your life and it's such an example of what you've been talking about on the tour that if you want to fix the world than fix yourself a little bit and then the more that you do that, you might start effecting things around you. And I think that that's by, by helping your brother in this case you were sorta helping the world. Well, um, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:19:44       that's nice. But the returns to me, um, were high and has nothing to do with follower counts on twitter or anything like that. I don't think that, you know, we should talk about positive models of masculinity and I'm standing shoulder to shoulder with somebody in a fight is an important part of what it means to be complete in a masculine sense. And I think that we are all incentivized by shows like survivor or the last contest or whatever, all this stuff. And they do the promos with the contestants on these shows. I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win. Okay, well what is that? That's corporate America teaching us how to stab everyone else in the back on your way to the top, which actually doesn't work very well by the way. Didn't work at all right or not for that long. If you can't follow, you can't lead, can't make friends, can't make friends.

Speaker 3:          00:20:44       You're alone and vulnerable, right? You, I mean maybe stolen had gotten to the is the best example of a really malignant person who managed to kill everybody, including I think his wife. But it's very rare that anybody, you know, does that really what, what these things are. Because you have to remember that fragging is a possibility that the lowest person in your organization can take you down if they're not happy. Right? Right, right. And so I think that what people need to understand is that there is this lost art of standing with somebody that you don't. One hundred percent agree with who says things that are like, you know, there are definitely things you do on stage that I'm not comfortable with, but if somebody comes to attack you a fundamentally, um, I know that all of those points I can bring up to you, you know, face to face.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       I assume it's true in reverse. And so this idea of standing with people, you know, Dave, you've been going down to libertarian path that I'm uncomfortable with often, but somebody says, you know, we hash it out publicly and privately, publicly and privately and so, and there's stuff I'll do privately with you that I won't do publicly because I think that it is important to learn how to stand in units because otherwise you just get picked off. And this is, you know, there's a topic that I want to bring up a little bit later, which is what do I think the Idw, since you've discussed it gets wrong. And one thing I think we get wrong is that the tribalism that we keep seeing is so toxic that we decided that we are anti tribal. It's not the right model. You want to be adaptively tribal and adaptively individualistic, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:18       These things matter. Groups matter. Groups have specialized knowledge very often, you know, I, my group has certain stuff. Your group has a different. We engage in trade. Um, it is important to understand that tribalism can be adaptive and so it's very troubling to me that the dumbest voices on the other side are causing us to overreact too simplistically. So standing with my brother. Yeah, there's a reason that people say he's like a brother to me because it means that you will put yourself at great risk. And I, you know, I've taken a lot of slings and arrows for, for Brett, and there's a pleasure in it. I'm not going to say that it didn't lead to sleepless nights and that I don't worry about friends that I've lost, but it's also, you know, in some sense, good to know and people respond positively because it's in our, it's in our makeup to to say, well, that guy didn't run from a fight.

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       So do we basically have to just model it out for people in our behavior. So for example, when the New York Times piece came out on you about three weeks ago, the enforced monogamy piece, now that the author of it, I, I'm not even going to mention her name, but if you want to, you can go ahead and she sat in the green room with us, I think on the first night in Toronto. She was all smiles and friendly. You even said to me how much you like her and you introduced me to her and we were, you know, we were chatting. Um, she seemed perfectly pleasant and lovely. And then of course this piece comes out, it implies that you're for forced monogamy, which is which money. Just explain that real. Just do a, do a one

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       minute on what you were taught. The implication was, and, and, and to the degree that this has been, let's say exaggerated in the aftermath of the piece, the implication was that I was promoting the idea that, you know, perfectly innocent women would be lined up by the state and distributed en mass to undeserving males. They wouldn't be violent. We've only done that at one show, right? Yeah. Well, exactly, exactly. It's, and it didn't, it didn't go. So yeah, so, so, and, and that, that was quite curious because that part of the conversation I had with the journalist lasted probably two minutes out of what was essentially a two day interview and it was obviously something that triggered her imagination, um, in, in the sense that she saw that she could use it for, for, I don't know, for political purposes or something like that in the piece, but it was so palpably absurd because the, and I would say amateurish in some sense as well because the position that she accused me of holding a, a, I didn't hold so that that's the first problem.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       B, no one holds. Like if you're going to try to pillory someone in a manner that's at least vaguely believable, you should accuse them of holding a view that at least some person has held at some point and no one has ever held that view. And then the other thing that was quite off putting let's say is that she's not stupid. She knew perfectly well what I meant by enforced monogamy by the term. It's an anthropological term, it's been used for a hundred years and the idea that polygamous societies, which would be the contrast say to monogamous society is the idea that there are more violent, is no one disputes that. It's, it's like a, it's an anthropological, sociological and psychological truism. And it's also one that's been. It's not like the left has been promoting polygamy, you know, so, so it was, it was, well the, the, the, the, the article uh, surprised me to say the least, but you made an interesting move

Speaker 3:          00:25:44       after that which ties this all together because you did a little checking on the phrase in the Archives of the New York Times. And the whole point to me was if I could take Jordan out of the equation and I could make it into the New York Times wrestling with itself. Uh, I was pretty sure that the New York Times would have some record of having used the phrase enforced monogamy at some point. And so I went to the search engine and I put in quote enforcement Origami close quote. And sure enough, there were two relatively recent references within the last 20, 25 years, both of them positive. One, I believe coming out of evolutionary theory in drosophila where it's a less common term and evolutionary theory, but it has leaked into the evolutionary literature and the other one coming from Afghanistan where you have polygamous marriage and that leaves too many violent young men with nothing to do.

Speaker 3:          00:26:38       And that can be useful if you're conquesting other lands, say, well, you have no wife here, but there's a, there's territory over there. And this is exactly, you know, the New York Times was celebrating the idea that in a culture that was at that stage in its evolution, uh, enforcement origami was something that went hand in hand with women's rights because of course, having the classic art, you having fewer violent men with no romantic prospects is in general good for the safety of women. And so the whole thing, which is actually my point, but the point was, can I take Jordan out of it and say the New York Times is wrestling with itself and not unfairly. And this is the great danger is that that finger is on the scale. Now, the other thing is that that particular journalist first met, uh, was talking with Brett. I'm well before talking with you and then Brett set this journalist to me.

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       And by the way, I don't think that we should not talk about the name of the journalist and the journalist is certainly using your name and the idea. So it's Nellie Bowles. And I found her engaging and charming, very quick, intelligent. The thing that I didn't appreciate and they got fairly far into my discussion with her and I was off the record, is she began with the gambit. Well, of course I'm going to be running your tweet on James Damore, which, um, you know, went viral and was widely misinterpreted. And again, in a deliberate fashion, which my tweet was responding to somebody saying, you know, if human resources that somebody else from Google tweeted, if human resources won't do something about this, then you know, they're going to have trouble on their hands. And I was like, okay, you're telling people to run to human resources because James Demore, uh, is looking at big five psychometrics for personality and asking the question, how do we increase the accessibility of Google to female coders and whether you agree with his technique or not.

Speaker 3:          00:28:30       Uh, I think that that was clearly his point. So the idea is I'm going to bring up this tweet that has been widely mischaracterized of yours, Eric, and you know what, what became clear was she had the idea that you wanted to find the men's rights activist community and you know, she said something about, well, your Mra. And I didn't even know what that meant. So I said, NRA, National Rifle Association. And she's like, you know, men's rights activists. I said what? And so we had this. Well that was just you being disingenuous because of course, you know it, men's rights activists are right.

Speaker 3:          00:29:11       But the point would be, you know, it's like you, you believe in human rights. Yes. Well, you know, men are human so you believe in men's rights and you believe that one should be active, you know. So you know, at some level it's a reserved term for people who are very often kind of veering a spectrum of people who are talking about bad aspects of family law versus people who are downright misogynist. And I was just aghast, which is like, why are you trying to shoehorn me into this preexisting thing? That's the question. The motivation for the, for the shoe horning and well this is. So this is the big issue coming, you know, it's hard to track all the threads. Let me, let me just get back to what we don't understand is that they've invested in all of this cognitive Lego, right? So they've, you know, equity or toxic masculinity or white privilege, whatever these things are.

Speaker 3:          00:30:07       And so everything in high dimensional space gets shoved into this completely inappropriate kind of cognitive lego. Which furthermore, the format of these things, like I recently got asked to do a bit on a, on a show on television, on an established network. And they said, you know, we're really blowing it out. We've, we've, we've got the message that this new form of a long form interview, uh, is the wave of the future. It's like, well, how much am I going to get? We might go from five to eight minutes, right? The idea is I want to say hello in five minutes. This is the point, right? It's like I have access to three hours when I want it. Right? You're like, well, that's insane, right? It's like they can't move that much. And so that's partly why the formats dying. And it's also, I think one of the reasons that we think we're stupid or than we are.

Speaker 3:          00:30:57       I like listening to a lot of our, including our audience is that, you know, because tv, one of the things I have noticed about television in general is that it's predicated on the presumption that the audience is stupid, but if you have to force everything through a channel whose maximum dimension is six minutes, then everyone's going to look was. The stupid thing is if you think about what happened where television went from being the dumb medium to the incredibly smart medium when you went from TV dramas have a half an hour, maybe an hour in length to many, many shows over a season and developing characters at a level that a film can't touch literature approaches. Right? Right, right. So the idea is that in the sopranos or mad men or game of thrones, people are following incredibly difficult enrich plots and you have to go back to this old adage which nobody ever lost a dime a underestimating the intelligence of the American people.

Speaker 3:          00:31:55       Well, that's only true if you don't understand opportunity cost because people have been losing dimes, but millions by not understanding that anyone who can follow game of thrones, right? How is it that this thing that we're about to do, I have no idea why. You know, we're just having a conversation. There's going to be over 100,000 views of this thing. I think very quickly. Yeah. I got one video on my channel of any substance, one video. It's got nearly 60,000 views. People are hungry for this thing that they're being starved for. What they don't understand in the regular media is is that their format is killing them and I know this is something we really. We really have to pay attention to it because a tremendous amount of what's going on is the consequence.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       You know, you said that a complex reality is being shoveled into a, a, a tiny dimensional space and so there's some ideological reasons for that, but I think some of that is being fed by the channels of the media because it's a lot easier to take a complex situation like that and shovel it into a preexisting April interpretive space because everyone already understands it. So if you've only got a few minutes, then there's a bunch of things that you don't have to explain because you're just telling the same old story. Because what, what, what we also don't grasp

Speaker 3:          00:33:12       is that we don't file flight plans like you're having me on the show. You don't know what, what I'm going to say. You don't know what my positions are on immigration. You don't know what my physicians are an abortion. We've never gotten to that, I don't think, and I was actually thinking that about both of you. I don't think we've ever discussed it. We can't get it, but what the way the, the, this commentary at works and I've been waking up to the idea that the slayer even exists because they didn't think about it too much, is that mostly these people have consistent takes that is they are counted upon to take complicated reality and you know, give us the Tom Friedman point, give us the, give us the Paul Krugman point, you know, give us the Ezra Klein view and you're thinking, well, why is there a sort of regular, consistent view on these things? Like, I've watched Jordan, I've watched you change your mind in real time as somebody makes a good argument and it's a little bit painful because somebody was listening to you and then they say, well, how do I have faith in your argument? And that might answer is how do you faith in any of this stuff? All of this stuff can reverse it. Won't you have more faith? If somebody can reverse themselves? And I'm thinking about this thing about the the cake baking a cake for a gay.

Speaker 2:          00:34:21       Yes, yes. Well look what happened when we'll get back to nellie bowles because I want to return to that. But you know, one of the things that was really interesting to watch in Vancouver, I just had two discussions with Sam Harris and the. The discussion was set up from a promotional perspective by a promoter who was doing his job as a kind of a combat situation, right? There was going to be a victory. It would be sam or me in, in the final analysis versus it actually versus. Right. And so, but what happened was that Sam and I actually had a discussion where we were trying to lay out our points to understand each other's points. And we set this up. It was one of Brett's ideas actually because your brother a moderated. When the second discussion opened, what he had us do was summarize each other's arguments.

Speaker 2:          00:35:06       So I put forth Sam's arguments in the strongest possible terms. Steel man, he did the same and that worked. That worked just fine by the way. But what was so interesting was the audience would have settled for a debate that culminated in the victory of one of us over the other. But instead what happened was they got engaged in a discussion that we had both designed to push both of our capabilities of thinking farther along and so, and we weren't sure if that would work because we weren't sure if we could talk, but it turned out that we could partly thanks to breads help and then the original format was we were going to talk for an hour for the first one and then we're going to open it up to q and a. But the discussion got very intense and I would have, I likened it to approximate level of a pretty good phd defense, you know, if, if you're, if you have a good student who's, who's defending and you know, they know the literature, you can really go after them because it gives them a chance to show their mastery.

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       Right. So it can be a real positive thing for them. And so it was like a dual phd defense, D U, a l and D u e l at the same time, but the audience was right there with us and then at the end of the hour, Brett asked them should we switch to the q and a or should we continue the discussion because we're in the middle of something. And overwhelmingly the sentiment was continue the discussion and so we did model the process of, I wouldn't say respectful dialogue because first of all that's a cliche and second of all, that wasn't what this was. What we were doing was actually engaging in the process of trying to make both of us smarter than we were. And and people are are in for that. They're there, they're onboard for that and they would. They would prefer that to the cheap victory by all appearances.

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       So what do you think that says then if that the audience that was there and from what I can see with our audiences, that they care more about an unlocking some truths than they do about the victory. When we live in a time where everyone wants to dunk on everybody constantly, I keep seeing the phrase pop up, we'll get you a dunk. Dinah, you haven't. That's nobody wants it, but they keep shuttling, loves he wants it. I mean, well, it's better than being bored and it's better than stacy's and it's better than capitulation, but it's not as good as what could be if you got what was optimal. When I see this with my own videos, people keep chopping them up and say, you know, Peterson demolishes, obviously that's click bait, but that was also one of the things that made me think about the degeneracy degeneration of journalism per se, and to Bait clickbait mean that's emerging spontaneously on youtube as a method for attracting attention and these people, as they get more desperate, as their, as their modality dies, then it's not surprising that they, that they turn to their oversimplifications for the reasons you outlined, but also to attract attention real quick.

Speaker 2:          00:37:52       Is it possible that it worked for awhile, that that sort of exposure and clickbait nonsense made sense? Sort of at the beginning of the Internet, because we were all so stuck in the, uh, in the old structures that we needed something to really wake us up, but now we're sort of past that. You don't think so that we don't think we're past it enough that it doesn't work anymore. If you want to avoid having me as a guest in the future, here's one of the standard moves that I may stop talking about what's good and bad and started putting the phrase adaptive and maladaptive in front of different modalities. We like adaptive dumb dunking. I've got this problem with this guy, Noah Smith. I don't know what his problem is. He, he's an economist. He's engaging. He's a relatively

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       charming. He has got a position on immigration where he just loves immigration. There's nothing. You can't have too much immigration. Immigration is just the best thing in the world. Maybe it has some problems in some sector, but in general it's a free lunch and I've done work on this to try to show. No. It's a much more complicated situation and behind the scenes it's being abused as has nothing to do with immigrants. It's Americans transferring wealth into their own pockets from other Americans using immigrants. We can get into this later. I've tried, I've had lunch with the guy I've shown in my papers, my research. He absolutely does not want a discussion. What does he want? Well, he wants to have an idea that immigration is a pure good. And that know the National Academy of Sciences has found that if we get this benefit from it and it has to do with one rights which don't show up in, in a, in a maximum, in an economics framework.

Speaker 3:          00:39:34       It has to do with something involving the securitization of rights so that people don't have their rights taken as if by eminent domain. Um, he knows all this stuff and he just chooses to continue down this path. And that Sam has seen this with Reza, Reza, Aslan, um, and with Glenn Greenwald, who in some ways I always thought of as pretty positive. And then I, you know, he gets, he gets a bug in his head and you get these incredibly negative people who don't want to come into a discussion and it's important to reserve the dunking on modality for when people are really not acting as good actors. You know, that's kind of what I did with. I decided to take a lawsuit out against Wilfrid laurier two weeks ago and that was, um, you know, I've been trying to reserve my twitter defense that say or attack because it's not always easy to distinguish between those.

Speaker 3:          00:40:31       Like I, I, I've learned to leave people alone when they make untoward comments, unless they are journalists of some repute or professors of some repute, in which case I think I have a moral obligation not to remain silent. And so it's not so easy to figure out when you should defend yourself and when you should shut up. Well first before is the wrong time to do and prefer that we don't defend ourselves because it's, as you always have this problem with special pleading, are you defending yourself because you believe in the ideas? Are you defending yourself? Because it's a possible threat to your own reputation. Right? So that's one of the reasons I came to your assistance on the enforcement origami thing because I didn't want you having to make that point. And if at some point in the future I get into trouble and you think that I have married my position, perhaps you'll return the favor.

Speaker 3:          00:41:18       We can figure out the game theory later. But that's, that's what culture actually does. But doesn't that also just feed the beast in a certain way? So if you defend a professor goes after you, who has, you know, no, no notoriety, but just wants to get in on the game. Well now you've defended yourself. Now next thing you know, voxer, buzzfeed is writing about the professor. Nobody knows. And Jordan Peterson. Well that's a danger for sure. Look, I am also, I am not a huge fan of the dunk on mentality as a opening gambit. I am slow to anger in these situations. I tend to give people three benefits of the doubt, which is what you should do. Yeah. And so, you know, for example, I had as recline and his wife over for Shabbat dinner with Gad said, um, you know, after the Sam Harris thing, and I wanted to understand as position and Ezra had, in fact, vox had done a piece where I talked about the need to blend hyper capitalism with hyper socialism in the future because I think, and throw up, I think about this thing of anthropic capitalism.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       The capitalism that worked in the 19th and 20th centuries may have been an accident for where the parameters were set on in our market so that it could function as well as it did. And you know, Ezra, um, I don't want to get into all the personal details of the interaction, but it was fascinating talking to Ezra and his wife as to how they see the world and getting a behind the scenes look at what generates vox. So I think it's very important to try to be charitable in understanding other people and understanding their motivations. But there is a point when you hit something three, four or five times the person's evidenced comprehension. And then they go into this mode, like you talked about this with Kathy Newman where you had one kind of interaction with her before and then suddenly somebody three, two, one go.

Speaker 3:          00:43:04       And it's like, so what you're really saying, where did that personality come out of that has to do in part with the masks that we all put on. I think that one of the things is, I know you guys both personally, um, this mirrors it how we talk in a different context. But when you know, when, when vox is the weeds discussed the intellectual dark web, I thought it was incredibly confused. Very interestingly, after the Barry Weiss article, almost no one from the standard media called me up to clarify, sort of learn more because barry was the owner of this thing and so it was assumed that barry had named it that this was barry's beat. And so barry was the goto person as if we were all owned by the particular member of the commentary. That who decided to actually blow this up and make it large?

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       We have to become more charitable. I do think that in part, part of the problem that we've been having with the sort of madness in the progressives is that first of all, unlike the Charlottesville, right, the progressives are in the establishment. Whereas the Tiki torch holders are like often their mother's garage and that's a big, big difference. And so one of the reasons were animated is that, you know, you remember that line. It's coming from inside the house. Yeah. It's coming from inside the house. Definitely. On the other hand, I do see a lot of points that these people have that they're just terribly missing stantiating the problem of the progressives in my, in my estimation, I might have. My family has been progressive since the twenties, is that they're terrible at what they do. They're just not good progressive. It's like really malignant form. Let me give you an example.

Speaker 3:          00:44:47       English is odd in that it is inflicted for gender only in the third person singular. Now Turkish for example, it's not inflected for gender. There's one pronoun. Oh, for Kishi it. So you don't have this problem in Turkish. Um, when you were referring to a character in the story who is not present, um, we had this problem for a in English form inflicted influxion for marital status, which was true for females and not males. Mr Was Mr. but miss and Mrs gave you more information. So there was a one time backwards, incompatible change that got made with ms and it, you know, it's still rankles because it doesn't sound great, but I think it was a good idea and to make, to give women the equality that they deserved and shouldn't have to ask for. Okay. If you wanted to actually do the pronoun thing for English, would you start with trans or would you start with intersects now?

Speaker 3:          00:45:46       If you started with intersects, everyone is intellectually sympathetic with Intersex. There are people whose gender or sex is ambiguous, right? Because of the way in which development sort of takes female and turns it into mail if the SROI protein is present. So this, everyone who understands this, just to be clear, not everyone who hears about this, but everyone who has in general, no matter how conservative somebody is, if I tell them there's a person born with ambiguous genitalia, um, or you know, they've got an Sroi protein, a on an x chromosome or they have a malfunctioning one on a why, so that they appear to be the opposite phenotype for their genotype. There's compassion. The person was born in Seoul, was born without the expected assignment and there's no question about development. And should we be steering. You should be more male. You should be more masculine, more feminine in order to avoid the sky high.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       I'm suicidal. A temptations for people who feel that they are one thing well evidencing that they are something else in the physical. Okay. You would make the change based on intersects. You'd make a onetime backwards incompatible change to the language with a approach pronoun like Turkish has. And then trans would have what it wanted without this craziness of everybody gets to design their own personal pronoun, which is a disaster. Like in a computer science course, you would never allow people, you, you'd give them a choice so that the coding can go through. Everybody can't have their own pronouns. Right? And so that's how you do it. And if you wanted it to win, that's how you push it through. Now what they want is something else they want to say something like Trans Women are no less women than women who are born biologically female. Well, that's not true, right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:38       I understand. It is the case that every single culture, every traditional culture of which I'm aware there is gender ambiguity in South Sulawesi. You have a priestly class from it. In India, you have the hidden cameras. Um, Turkeys, national treasure, a Zeki Muren was more feminine than Liberace. Uh, I just came from Italy where the Uffizi Gallery, there's an entire room called the hermaphrodite room, a dedicated to a beautiful statue, uh, of, uh, ostensibly female, um, recumbent a model with a male genitalia that there is, you know, not the Shah of Iran. The ayatollah in Iran came out with a proclamation that it was okay to have gender reassignment surgery. So it's not like traditional cultures don't know about this, it's not like we haven't made accommodation, it's always been an issues, whether it's the [inaudible] and in Thailand, um, which are among the best spoken in most educated people that you meet as a traveler.

Speaker 3:          00:48:37       The issue is that we somehow wanted to make a wedge issue out of this. I am going to force you to say things that aren't true as an evidence of my power as opposed to, well, that's why exactly why I oppose the legislation in Canada to begin with because part and parcel what came along with that as part and parcel of it, and this was no accident, was illegal insistence that gender differences were associated associate socio culturally constructed. It's like, well they're not. And I thought, well, what the hell? Why are we enshrining that viewpoint into law? I mean, that's not to say that gender doesn't. Very gender expression doesn't vary substantially because of sociocultural conditions because you have to be a fool not to see that that's the case. But that's another situation where the multidimensional complexity seems to exceed the processing capacity of the ideologues.

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       Is that there's more than one factory work? No, no, no. They know what they're doing. Like for example, should a skirt be seen as feminine or masculine? Well, we know from India where the lung is popular for Scotland where there's a kilt that this is a variable. In other words, you shouldn't hardcode skirts are for girls. Right? And so the idea is that there is a huge developmental aspect to learning. Here are the assignments in your culture. Now at some point you want to steer people into, we have a huge interest in the breeding family is the core of lineage in a society and we need to care both about gays, about um, people have uncertain gender, non binary people, etc. But we can't lose sight of the fact that we also have to care about the family, the breeding family in distress, but also have to provide people with an easy pathway to a reasonably stable identity.

Speaker 3:          00:50:23       Well, it doesn't confuse them too. This is the point is that they have an argument that I think we are learning that gender and discomfort is far more common than we ever thought, although far less prevalent than the discussion seems to suggest you do have a societal interest in steering people to roles if it's possiBle, but once somebody is like committedly nonbinary switch has to flip on us and we have to become compassionate and recognize that we have a soul that we have to take care of and we do have to make some allowances. If you, if you know anybody who's intersex for example, you know, that it's a terrifying state, that they face violence. I mean, you know, why don't you see dudes kissing. I always claim that it's the implied threat of violence where if it makes people uncomfortable, um, you don't see people holding hands quite so comfortably and you don't see people being themselves. So if we, for example, in the idw, stood up for intersex and say this is the right way to do what you're doing, I think it would be an absolute service to the world because that's something we could push through. I don't think that the key that the conservative christians in this country are going to have a diehard, they're gonna feel like, well, if the lord made people in that way, we have to accept all the products of god's creation. Where do you fall on that? Because this is where people will say, well, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       was against trans people and gay people. I mean all the, all the nonsense. Yeah. Well then I hear about your situation in Canada. It was quite clear is that the federal government following the provincial governments decided that it was okay to impose requirements for the regulation of speech. And I didn't care what the reason for that was. I thought that it was a terrible legislative move and partly not because it wasn't only compelled speech. I read the policy guidelines that were the framework within which this bill was to be interpreted. There's pages and pages of them all on the ontario human rights commission website, which was late to the federal website, um, where they had announced how this bill would be interpreted and it contained all sorts of terrible things. Like the insistence that gender was was a social socio cultural construct and it's in part a socio cultural construct and these things are this, you cannot do that because all of a sudden the legislation seemed to imply that at discussion about the biological differences between men and women might be regarded as hate speech and I also think we're a fair ways along that pathway in Canada.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       So I don't think that my fears about the bill were unwarranted and I think that what happened at wilfrid laurier university is an absolutely perfect example of that. So I think that my stance on that piece of legislation was substantively correct. Now the problem is is that or, or the the treachery that was involved in the bill because I see the bill as an attempt by the radical left to gain linguistic dominance over increasing linguistic dominance over the conversation as a whole. Using trans people as the sacrificial victims. And by the way, I got no shortage of letters from trans people saying I not so happy being

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       you used as a sacrificial victim for the left to advance its linguistic hegemony. I got a lot more letters like that from trans people than I did from trans people criticizing what I did. So. And I also think that this would have all died away very rapidly if all it was about was one professor's objection to the rights of trans people that had very little to do with it. But let's just take this, take this bull by the horns right now. Am I correct? And I, you and I have not discussed this. That your point would be the law is the wrong place to do it and the culture would be the right place. Absolutely. has to be bottom up like the ms thing was. I understand that. so my point is law is absolutely the wrong. Why not let it come from us. I mean, in other words, this thing has been so crazily interpreted by the press.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       This is absolute malpractice as far as I'm concerned by our journal. This journal agentic malpractice. I should, I should speak up for some of the journalists in Canada because the post media group is 200 newspapers came out and supportive my stance. So I appreciate those who aren't doing, but my point is, is that the fact that we're still having to discuss this as a tax on all kinds of discussion, that the more time I have to spend saying I'm not all right, uh, you know, transphobic, I don't want the fact that I'm in an interracial marriage because I oppose these equity proposals that are complete abomination. Right? It remember when you and I were in tempe, Arizona at the comedy club and I said something like, you know, we shouldn't be celebrating this. I'm in an interracial marriage and everybody clapping, I said, stop it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       Unless a feW of you are admissions officers to ivy league schools, in which case we'll talk to you later. But the point is a terrible thing. Credit for that, like you happen to fall in love with a person of color, is there's moral victory. Lord, is there a metal you know in your future, you don't want it. Now what I'm trying to say something slightly different, which is I want in on the positive aspects of the social transformation. I know that my intersex people are hurting and I know that trans people, um, are present in every culture without this social justice stuff, and we should be spearheading what the incompetent progressive, left can't get done. WhaT is that? is that what we're doing? One of the things that I want to be doing, like gay marriage turned on a dime over a very short period of time, like smoking, right?

Speaker 3:          00:55:54       Somehow that there's no smoking in bars. It's almost incredible. You know, if you're old enough to think about that we should be spearheading this thing because they can't get the job done and what is our point? Not in law yet, not in law, but do it in culture. You can't have everybody do his or her own pronouns, which is an absolute disaster. But we could settle on, you know, and you could do, hey, hey, and they, you know, pronouns or something like this. I don't know what the right thing. Get a linguist and a to figure out the minimally intrusive

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       one time backwards, incompatible change to the language Is, it's going to be painful. Uh, I'm not looking forward to it, but we could get it done. So one of the things that I've been doing in my public lectures is talking about the appropriate and responsible position of the left. So you know, it seems to me that if you're pursuing goals that have value, which you have to do because you have to do things in order to stay alive, you have to pursue goals of value. If you do that in a social social space, which you're compelled to do, then you're going to produce hierarchies because people, different incompetence and you actually want to produce hierarchies that are based on competence because they're efficient tools for getting that particular job done. And so it's a reasonable position for people on the, in the center and on the right to say stand behind the hierarchies.

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       But by the same token, hierarchies can tilt towards a corruption and tyranny and they tend to dispossess people because talents are distributed on equally. So the left, the position of the left, that's the appropriate position, is to speak up for the dispossessed, to keep the, is flexible enough so that they don't turn into tyranny and so then you have a dialogue between the right and the left that's necessary to maintain the hierarchy, but also to prune it and keep it healthy. And so one of the things that we could conceivably contribute to is to improve the health as you're pointing out conceptually and otherwise of the dialogue on the left, it's like to give the devil his due, so to speak. And to say that of course there's a place for the left. The question is when do they go too far? Which is what I've been trying to push to be a moderate.

Speaker 2:          00:58:00       So think about this. This is beyond communism. If you think about one phrase that sums up the theory of communism, what would you, what would you say with the most famous for it? Well, probably from each according to their ability to each according to their need. And I'll look at the first part of that phrase from each according to their ability. Right? So the idea is that there are different abilities acknowledged in the very core of communism beyond that, right? Right. Oh yes. I that. Well, I think the most pathological, the deepest unidimensional pathology that characterizes the radical left is actually an attack on competence itself. And so when I was at the aspen ideas festival a couple of days ago, I made the case that, um, our hierarchies in the west are determined to, at least in part by competence right now, the degree to which it's pure competence can be disputed, but intelligence and conscientiousness are the best predictors of longterm life success, even though they don't predict more than about 25 percent of the variance. But the buzz surrounding what I said was that Jordan Peterson is validating the current patriarchy by making the radical claim that it's predicated on competence. It's like, well, why would they twist that argument? Because they didn't want. I said, I said that their competence is a partial contributor to our successful hierarchies. And I think the reason is, is

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       that the very idea of differential competence is unacceptable to the most radical will hang on for his left. Let's look at two separate systems because I think that what people do is they focus on one rather than the other, and I've had to learn how to do this. If we look at chess, which can be made blind where you don't know who you're playing across the internet, and we look at musical additions for classical orchestras, uh, where you can put people behind a screen and I think this became popular in the eighties, nineties, a particular basis who is also a psychologist may have been instrumental in getting this change. When you introduced the screen, women's participation in orchestras went up, right? So it was a very positive social program because competency was apparently being suppressed by people's perception, by prejudice. It was a structural problem. Now maybe it didn't go as far as people won't want it, maybe didn't get to 50 slash 50.

Speaker 3:          01:00:18       I don't know what the stats are. I can look in on that. When you do it in chess, I don't believe it has a positive effect. When they did it in the australian civil service for blind cvs, it had the opposite effect. Women got under selected right? So, so you're saying even though you're saying is that this is situationally situations. The point is, is that the people who want to talk about chess, where the top hundred players last I checked it was 99 to one male to female, which is so like even with structural bigotry, man, that's hard to explain.

Speaker 3:          01:00:52       In the other case of the classical orchestras at what was it? Twenty percent increased participation of females. That's a giant amount and they're both true. And so the problem is when you push everything and you shove it into the low dimensional space, you have this idea of is this structural a misrepresentation or is it something else? Well, it's both and it's situationally dependent. My wife had to make a point to me, which I was blind to because in physics almost nothing matters other than like horsepower and creativity. You don't care whether somebody red, green, blue, male, female. it's just like almost nobody's got interesting ideas. It's so hard to make any progress whatsoever. You just want to take the far right tail of the distribution and you don't want to be harassed about anything other than that. Math, math, math, math is potentially even more.

Speaker 3:          01:01:51       My wife had to say to me, you know, eric, not everything looks like theoretical physics or differential geometry. In fact, if you think about community policing, it can be extremely important to have diversity a because why do you want one ethnic group policing another ethnic group or all cops being male? you want diversity in order to have good relations so that people see themselves reflected on the force and if there is bigotry and prejudice, it manifests itself. Uh, it's harder to manifest if people are in fact diverse. So that was a bit of a wake up call. The other thing that came from the harvard math department where it for a period of time, it appeared that they would let in one woman a year into the phd program and then she would have a terrible year and she dropped out and then one year a woman deferred her admission and so they added another woman and then she had two women in the first year and the two of them reinforced each other's reality.

Speaker 3:          01:02:47       Like, you know, I think I just said something and everybody ignored it or I made a point and then somebody else went to the chalkboard and wrote it down as if it was his idea and this group of two women stayed in the program and that meant the next year that there was one woman lead in, okay, now there's a group of three, and that was a situation in which there was an organic change in the apparent ability of women. Now we need to be differentiating. we can't keep reacting to the madness of the analysis. Right? Right. We can't. We have to be the ones who are saying, look,

Speaker 3:          01:03:24       let me steal, man. Your point. You're making a terrible version of this argument. I think I can even do better. And you're welcome. Right? Because the other thing it's doing is it's deranging our conversation. This is why I had you talked to ben. Ask him point blank about whether he would use the pronouns. And his point was, I will in general be happy to use somebody preferred program except if we're discussing a trans issues, which in which case it is to see the argument that he doesn't want to publicly see the argument for privately mystic grounds open about it and this is what we have to stop reacting to the mat, to, to the crazy making substrate. So basically you think that for the people that are keeping their foot on the pedal at the highest possible level, we sort of just have to let that go.

Speaker 3:          01:04:14       But do you think it would be enough? So if let's say tomorrow you started, we finished the show today and you say, all right, I'm going to start being the champion for all the. The compassion that trans people. I mean I know you're compassionate to all people, but I'm going to be publicly more compassionate to trans people and intersex people and all of and address all of the issues that you just brought up. If there's another set of people that are never gonna, throw you a bone on that, that are never going to give you a little outreach on that. Does it actually do anything or you think it just allows us to get the refugees that will kind of wake up around it. But I think that we're being drained of our empathy. I mean, let me, let me say I am being drained of my empathy. Um, you know, there was a, there was a tweet that Kentucky planned parenthood put out where it was one of these. Remember it was, uh, some, some men have have a uterus and they repeated it like 11 times. Yeah, that's the big thing. And

Speaker 3:          01:05:08       if they've written, some trans men have a uterus or if they'd written something, but we have to be compassionate to people who as what, whatever. I would be okay. But the idea of some men have you. Well, there's actually something called persistent mullerian duct syndrome where people who were phenotypically male at birth appear to have a uterus because of the mysteries of development. And again, the fact that males and females are one protein away from each other and treating each other like we're separate tribes as opposed to, um, you know, fisher like compliments is absolutely insane. And so I find myself making fun of these people and I had some tweet about, you know, either we're talking about persistent mullerian duct syndrome or you're just eating crayons, helping pooping a rainbow. And, you know, I thought about this, I thought I'm so unsympathetic with you're trying to smuggle ideology into my world, into compassion to the laboratory and you know, this is reprehensible ideology under the guise of it just gets back to this issue that we have been having this expert conversation in the literature where all sorts of things that cause people to clutch pros and they're feigning couches are absolutely parts of the parts of the literature and biology and psychology and anthropology, all of these places.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       And now everything is discussed everywhere. So when you hear, you know that there are group differences, um, it's shocking if you haven't been part of the professional civil conversation. And I think that that's a big problem is, is that this is this esoteric versus exoteric speak, which is the sort of intellectual elite in the universities have this private way of talking amongst themselves in journals and in this public way of talking, and this is absolutely essential in some areas, but it's being abused and others. So, for example, the trade theorists, um, know that, what they talk about, that the importance of free trade based on ricardian equivalence and comparative advantage is a bullshit argument. Um, it's a very crude thing that's very hard to argue with mathematically, but it's behind the scenes. They're having a completely different conversation and they have the idea of we're entitled to do this.

Speaker 3:          01:07:28       And the answer from my perspective is you just replaced one concept which was a caldor hicks, uh, improvement with, uh, with paredo improvement. Pereno improvement makes everybody better off. Tyler hicks leave some people worse off than some people better off. And you'd have to tax the better off to compensate for the worst at. Well, we're, we're having a countrywide freakout because the economists have developed two separate conversations, one for the public where they push out things that are not necessarily good for the median individual, very bad for particular communities and a separate conversation that they're having amongst themselves and they are serving these interests. What we have to do, something about this, we can no longer. This goes back to your gutenberg point and the technology issue. We cannot have this level of division between the private and the public conversation. I know more about what's wrong with the immigration, uh, in the high tech sector than the national academy feels.

Speaker 3:          01:08:26       A national academy of sciences wants to discuss. They are at the center effectively of a conspiracy in the 19 eighties and early nineties to change the laws of the United States in order to make it impossible for young scientists to bargain with phds in hand with their employers to get the six figure salaries that the market was going to give. Now we can, we can play a game where the national is having a private conversation with me where they've had me four or five times over there and they're not going to have any reflection of this in the public, but I now have 100,000 twitter followers and I know why people are angry about immigration, has nothing to do with immigrants. It has to do with transfer. It has to do with the fact that our ruling classes had been figuring out how to transfer money from one group of americans to another group of americans and if they could use puppies, they use puppies because you can't object puppies.

Speaker 3:          01:09:22       Okay, well the problem is is that you now have a group of people who are able to have these conversations to say, let me show you the playbook. Let me show you what's really going on on in these technical discussions. There are, there are differences between groups that are measurable. Iq, w, I don't think any of us really want to be talking about race and iq particularly, but when you try to say there is absolutely no evidence to show, well that's not going to be true and the scientists are going to have to say, look, I don't, I don't right. Reality, I report on what the literature says. Let me tell you what the literature says, and the literature says some things that we don't want it to say, but that's not. There's nothing new about that. Lots of science is very upsetting. Evolutionary theory is upsetting.

Speaker 3:          01:10:08       Psychology is upsetting and it's upsetting literature. We haven't figured out what we're going to do culturally as it becomes available to everybody and we have people who are sort of gleefully talking about things like race and iq and I want to tell them, cut it out. That's the, you know, we don't really know everything but we're getting more and more knowledge and I'm worried about where it can go. And we have other groups of people who say, you know, there's absolutely nothing to this race and iq thing. I'm just thinking, oh, this is like as best as you're, you're, you're now making an attempt to stir up the asbestos to try to get rid of it and you're going to loosen all these fibers rather than doing this professionally and scientifically the right way, so I do think that there's an issue about the esoteric, the exoteric and what it is that we're going to do as experts to handle the knowledge that we've been sort of exposed to and that the public hasn't and it's coming out in the worst ways and this is part of what's fueling the whole. Make America great again. Situation, which is the public knows something is off with their expert communities. The expert communities are not being honest about what the literature, so I would say that right

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       there is the magic of what I've been. It's been such a pleasure of being part of with you for these last two months or so that you are giving people a little bit of all of these people know something's not right. The information we're getting is not right. The language we're speaking is not right. The way we're talking about government is not right. Everything that eric just said right there, and you're giving them a little room every day to figure it out for themselves. That, that strikes me. Two things that are happening. One is because of the long form, it's actually possible to have more in depth discussions about these things. And the other is that because my lectures, let's say, and the discussions that I've been having focus on the development of ideas rather than on the ideas themselves, but that gives people a bit of breathing space.

Speaker 2:          01:12:00       Um, one of the questions that I'm really curious about is, um, and I'd like to know what you think about this. What do you think it is that's fundamentally driving the radical newness of the left? Like why? Because it, it does seem so counterproductive. Even two to the left, so on stated positions, you know, because when I was an aspen for example, I talked about the literature on biological differences between men and women in, in psychology, right? It's like mostly men and the women are similar. Even in the dimensions where they differ most, there's way more overlap than there is difference, right? So aggression is a good example of that. So if you take a random man and a random woman out of the population and you had to bet on who was the more aggressive, if you bet on the man you'd be right 60 percent of the time, but that's not that much.

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       But then all the actions at the tails, right? So you don't care about how aggressive the average person is. You care about how aggressive the really aggressive people are and they're all male and so you end up putting them in prison which accounts for the massive differential between men and women in prison rates and so you can have small differences at the meeting and radical differences at the extremes. So. And that's the fact that people don't understand that is he is partly willful blindness on the part of the ideologically committed, but also partly because it's somewhat complex statistically. But then I think about the like the audience that I was addressing it aspen, they weren't happy about me talking about biological differences in personality between men and women and I thought, well, what the hell do you want? Exactly from your leftist perspective is like, why is it so necessary for you to make the presumption that there cannot be any differences whatsoever between men and women?

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       It's like, well first of all there are so that's a big problem for your theory, but why all of a sudden has this become an axiomatic position of the left that these differences can exist when what you want to do in principle is free up people to make choices. I think that or to make choices in a market that would allow for those choices in keeping with their intrinsic nature. Like why did that? I don't understand why that shifted. And what's interesting is you're talking about the intellectual liberal elite. That's the type of people you were talking in front of, right? If

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       you were just talking in front of just a group of lefties or a group of writers are saying about you, about the commentariat yeah, right. Exactly. Yeah. Alright. So what, what do you do with that? Well, let me come straight at it. We on the left had an idea that if we could get rid of cultural bias in iq testing, if we could get rid of misogyny that was structural in the workplace, that we would get a particular kind of outcome. And we did make things better in many ways, but it didn't go as far as we were expecting. And so this is what people are wrestling with and you know, I hesitate to call it this, but I think it's the most powerful way of saying it. It's the great depression shortage of 2018. And the problem is, is that there still is structural oppression.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       I mean, look at Robert Moses is design a of New York city's a highways, bridges and byways, um, famously trying to keep buses from going to jones beach, I guess as it jumped to jones beach. He literally, I mean I grew up on long island, the bus, the bridges going over the la at that area are lower because they didn't want us to bring the people from meals out into harlem so that it doesn't affect real estate prices somewhere else on the east side. So you know, there really is structural oppression the way there was when there were literacy tests for voting which were constructed so that no black person could, could pass because it was impossible. Okay. But there's less of it now and there's not enough of it to explain some of the differences. And the great fear is, is that the left program to try to produce better representation and better opportunities for women, for minorities, whatever is going to stall out if we start to think of these things as differences.

Speaker 3:          01:16:04       So. So why is it a problem that. Okay, fair enough. Why is it a problem if it stalls out though? Is it because there's all sorts of radical activists who then don't have anything to do or is there that's part of him that. So what you've seen with the southern poverty law center, which is that you have an institution that fundamentally a accomplished much of its mission, but then it still had a large kitty and idle idle hands, it sounds like humanities departments to me. Right. Okay. And then we can get to that. But I also want to steal man, the other position so that you have something to fight against or directed, wrestle with. If I think about I do something different with women in the workplace with respect to trying to figure out what is unfair to them because there are things that are very unfair to them and one of the things I do is to say, tell me about the great ideas of females and the great contributions that are sitting there on the table in part because they had a female discover, right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:00       So you could look at, you know, vira ruben's work in which never, you know, never got a nobel prize. Everybody knows about it in, in astrophysics. But I went through one of these things with my wife where we did this thing with gauge theory in economics in the harvard economics department, and I think it was one of the most sensational breakthroughs in a mathematical and bedrock economic theory and the last 25 years, and I'll just be very clear every time people want to figure out how to tax americans more and cut their benefits without paying the price of touching the so called third rail of politics. They realized that the cpi indexes both tax receipts and entitlements, so payments like social security and medicare, and if you can show that the cpi is overstated than the ideas that you get to take in more tax revenue and you get to pay old people and sick people less.

Speaker 3:          01:17:54       And so it's a very popular game in Washington to gerrymander the gerrymander, the measurement. Now, the two ways that you do that. One is, is that you go from a fixed basket where you have a, let's say basketballs and glasses and you figure out what the price of that basket is over time to something which is what is the utility. So the idea is maybe I want slightly more glasses or basketball, you can do it with coffee and tea. I'm willing to trade off some amount of coffee for some amount of tea to get my caffeine fix if there's a problem or a bumper crop in Brazil. Okay. The other thing you do is that you keep updating these baskets and that's called chaining. Well, you can't do both of those things together because there's a, a presumed impossibility results that you can't have a true cost of a chain cost of living index, except that my wife and I solved that problem in the mid 19 nineties at the same time that the boskin commission was trying to back out a, an exact one point, one percent overstatement because that would save a trillion dollar.

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       So in other words, you have to understand they weren't given the task. Go find a one point, one percent overstatement and justify it so that we can cut benefits and raise taxes. And my wife got in the middle of that bank robbery, uh, as it was being attempted. And so she got whacked. Now I wanted to fight these sons of bitches, absolutely. In particular as a professor named dale jorgenson who spearheaded the attempt to, uh, really crushed her and when, when she was on the, she was getting her dissertation. This is great work and the cost of it, Jordan is, is that there's great work done by women that is sitting there because fundamentally the women don't want to fight the way you and I would fight for our work because it's not necessarily fun. It's unpleasant. And you know, with me, I have a very aggressive response to this.

Speaker 3:          01:19:47       It's like, how dare you talk about my work, do you know how much better my work is done, your work and let's do this now. I got that. That's a complicated thing too because you know, for, for a piece of brilliant work to rise up to the point where it's universally acclaimed, it takes a lot more than merely the brilliant work that's like. It's like, it's like putting a product out into the marketplace like a consumer product. You might have a brilliant product, but the fact that you have a brilliant product is about five percent of what you need to have a successful product because the rest of it is sales and marketing, and then if so you might say there's many ideas that we have taken stock of that we should have taken stock of those that we have taken stock of over this weird combination of brilliant idea plus brilliant and forceful marketing plus luck.

Speaker 3:          01:20:36       Right, and so, so if, if, if it's the case for example, that because women are less assertive, they're less likely to fight those ideas forward, although equally likely to generate as many brilliant ideas, then that's going to cause a detriment in their movement forward. Well, we need to contend with, well that's what I'm trying to say, which is that fundamentally the reason I asked for don't tell me about the women being suppressed. Tell me about the Ideas of women so I can. I can use my aggressive as long as we have a male dominated system. You have men who want to fight for great ideas. It's good. Well, but then the question is, do we have a male dominant system or do we have a dominant dominated? So this is, let me, let me, let me tease this apart. I have been in I think five, almost all male field.

Speaker 3:          01:21:20       Um, I've, I've, I've touched mathematics, theoretical physics, economics, finance, and a tech and they're not all male, but the male dominated fields, one of those fields I found had a cancerous attitude towards women that was just visible. So I got a chance to see in finance all of the bad behavior that people talked about, about the objectification, about, um, you know, locker room talk, which was just absolutely natural. Not in every context, but it was often enough in the other fields in general. Like in math, I don't think I ever heard people making nasty comments about women. So in the same weird way, it's not like I'm deaf to it because I can hear it. In one case I didn't hear it very often and the other kids in physics, I didn't hear many nasty comments about women, but it was incredible. Particle theory for a period of time was incredibly aggressive, like labor economics was super aggressive, symplectic geometry inside of math was super female friendly.

Speaker 3:          01:22:23       So there is definitely this difference in texture between, um, the, these different places in male dominated fields and having seen relatively benign male dominated fields at hyper toxic male dominated fields. I can tell you that I don't love going into a particle theory seminar where everybody's peacocking because it's relatively uninteresting relative to the work you would say to some degree that would indicate that the, that the system has become somewhat corrupt in the ways that systems can be corrupt and that what's pushing you forward in those fields is less about competence and more about them. And I don't know. Well, I don't know either, but you could, you could, you could, you could generate

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       that as a hypothesis, but I'll tell you one of the things our psychometric work has revealed this is quite interesting is when we've looked at differences in men and women with regards to outcome and then controlled for personality. The personality differences almost always obliterate the gender differences, which means it's actually not a gender difference, it's a personality difference, but let's flip that because this is. It isn't always the general. I understand that, so I think that that's very important, but now you're going to get, because I could say then for the the ideas of agreeable man in these fields might be as likely to be totally, totally agree with you. Now here's, here's the next part of it. Many let's say let's. Let's not do it as male, female, many agreeable people have the idea that the problem is is that the fields are so tilted towards disagree ability.

Speaker 2:          01:23:52       No, I don't happen to believe this, that we're losing good ideas because agreeable people can't make progress and in those circumstances the claim isn't. Let's just have an open competition and see what rises to the top. It's let's change the structure of things now this. Okay, so there's a problem wIth that. So let let. Let me find out what metric problem with that. Okay. If you look at what predicts success in workplaces, generally what predicts his iq and conscientiousness, agreeableness is a very trivial predictor. Now, one of the things you do see is that agreeable people tend to get paid less for the same work, but we don't know why that is exactly. We don't know if they don't bargain as well. I think that's the simplest explanation is that they're there. It's easier to take advantage of agreeable people. It's almost like the definition of agreeable.

Speaker 2:          01:24:44       It's the downside of being agreeable, but agreeableness is not a very good predictor of workplace success. There's actually a corrupt literature that's associated with this because there's a whole literature on emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence puts you ahead in the workplace. It's like, no, it doesn't. Emotional intelligence is almost in indiscriminate from trait agreeableness and trait. Agreeableness actually puts you behind in the, especially in the managerial domain. Now you might say, well, that means the managerial domain is prejudiced against agreeable people, but then there's some evidence that disagreeable people make better managers, and the reason for that is that they can't be pushed around because, you know, if you're a manager, you might say, well, what you have to do is you have to deal with the concerns of your employees and that would be the agreeable interpretation, but sometimes if you're a manager you have to take the slackers and give them hell.

Speaker 2:          01:25:31       And that's, uh, that's somethIng that only a disagreeable person can do this. But there isn't much evidence on the psychometric front that agreeableness, um, that, that agreeableness is a, is a major contributor to workplace success in general. So it isn't obvious to me from the psychometric work that the idea that hierarchies in general are contaminated by a preference for disagreeable people. I don't see any evidence for that. Well, look, part of the problem with this whole discussion is you have, there are roles in which agreeability works. There's, you can have a team where there's, you need a certain balance of these things. It's probably works for customer service, for example, to be agreeable or right carrot people. So all of these things. I mean, the world didn't come up with a big five traits a and distribute us across them. Uh, if they, if they don't have advantages, like are you color blind?

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       No. father is and he can, he can, he can see animals in the bush as I was going to make the point is that from my perspective, your contrast blonde, right? Right. And the idea is that when I'm talking about this, that strikes color normal people as very strange with, well that's a strange way to look at the world, but the fact is is that these traits are retained because they have different uses stats, right? That is the fact that if you focus on the right tail of the distribution of the extreme right tail, if you hang out with billionaires, very often in order to get to a billionaire status, you have to be able to oppose large numbers of people and say they're all wrong and I'm right. And then you also have to be right and you didn't even worse. You have to be disagree.

Speaker 2:          01:27:15       Absolutely right, but you know, if I look at some of the things that, that my friend peter teal can do that I find very few people can. It's like, can you hold a position? Even if you know two years from now you're going to be proven right with two years of scorn, the average person is going to crumble. Yeah. Well that would also be partly trait neuroticism is that people have to be able to tolerate that level of stress and that's very, very difficult. This is what I'm trying to get at, which is that people are looking at various reward structures and they're saying, well, that doesn't match my particular set of traits and I feel that my traits are valuable in those traits. Probably are value, but we're not all destined to become beyond say or peter teal, but what seems to be happening that.

Speaker 2:          01:27:56       That's exactly right. That's exactly right, but what seems to be happening? I think like if you look at the scandinavian countries, the more egalitarian scandinavian countries, that's where you're getting the most radical assortment of occupational status by gender and so I would say for example, that if you tilt towards agreeableness, which is actually a pretty good predictor of interest in people rather than interest in things, the biggest difference between men and women seems to be an interest, right manner, reliably more interested in things and women more reliably interesting people. The difference is one standard deviation, so it's a big difference and what seems to be happening in the scandinavian countries is people are sorting themselves by their temperament, which is what they should do because your temperament, as you just pointed out, predisposes you to success in some realm and not in others, right? You don't get both failure and success and failure, so because women are on average, more agreeable and perhaps higher in negative emotion, it isn't obvious how that fits into the equation. there are more sensitive to the distress of others and more likely to be compassionate in their care. So what happens? You open the landscape of

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       competitiveness to women. They immediately dominate the health care field and that's exactly what's happened now and part of the problem with that is that healthcare as an occupation doesn't scale well like engineering does for example, and so it's very difficult to generate large fortunes in healthcare and that's one of the things that skews the gender distribution of wealth, but it looks like if we left people be to the degree that we can, they would sort themselves into occupations by temperament and that might be the question of like when when we had our first child, we had a wrote a, a practice where there was a rotation of the ob gyn who deliver. We had this one woman we were totally on the same page with. We loved her. Everything about her was fantastic. We were, we were simpatico and my wife's labor went on and on and on and on.

Speaker 3:          01:29:48       We've supposedly, we were getting closer and closer. Finally sheet. This woman couldn't take it anymore and she said, I got to go to sleep, and the guy that we dreaded the six foot four guy with the bow tie who came from a totally different era. We called them, the undertaker, comes in and he says she's completely blown, uh, where we are in the process. You're barely dilated at all. We need to deliver this child immediately via says area. It's like, huh, right. Well, the son of a bitch saved the situation for my, for my, my wife and my daughter. Yep. And the idea is I didn't like them. One absolutely mad that happens. And that guy was a woman who diagnosed our daughter with, with arthritis. Same thing. I was really mad at her, really mad at her. She was very disagreeable and she was right and let's be very clear.

Speaker 3:          01:30:34       PaSsion and right are not the same as same thing. The woman who, the reason that we didn't have big flipper babies for thalidomide commonly in the United States was one woman who I think went to university of chicago at like 16 and she stood up and said, I don't like the data on this drug and I don't know, I don't think you drug companies have done enough to prove to me that this is safe to prescribing to pregnant woman. And she just put up her hand and stopped it. Now I don't know what I'm going to use, son of a bitch, son of a bitch saved how many. And then she's a national hero and we shouldn't be celebrating. The issue is is that it's not down to healthcare, agreeable or disagreeable. The problem is, is that we now have so much information about ourselves and about the occupations and the reward structures and there is a lot of structural unfairness and there is a lot of unfairness about here's your endowment and you were given different gifts and then there's a certain amount of luck that we are all struggling with the idea that we have so much information and not enough oppression to explain this and we're not necessarily happy with the outcome.

Speaker 3:          01:31:42       We don't necessarily want to have an honest conversation about, well, so then, okay, so there's another element to that too, which is okay. The question might be to what degree are we required to tolerate a certain amount of ineradicable suffering? Because that's the argument you're basically

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       making. You're saying, look, we can, we can equalize and we can provide opportunity. And we've done, we've hit the point of diminishing returns now, not everywhere obviously, and and not in every sector, but you could make the case that we've hit the point of diminishing returns and stIll there is a tremenDous amount of inequality and suffering so I can, We don't find that acceptable at csu, but the problem is the more you push to remove that last bit of eradicable suffering, the more likely you are to produce a worst kickback in another place. And it's not an easy thing to contain in the fact is that we're going to be discussing this, whether an nbc, cbs or abc lIkes it and they can't do anything about shutting this conversation down until youtube or twitter in a really decides to get heavy handed and give us the boot.

Speaker 2:          01:32:43       And so fundamentally we don't sound like what we're supposed to send. Is the sound like an outright conversation? Does it sound hyper conservative? No. It's a very difficult picture. And the key problem is, is that the only place that's being explored is in these super luxurious long form interview. I have no idea how people tune in. Like when we went to tempe, people were tracking these conversations at a level that we're not tracking conversational. It's incredible care. They actually care. They know that the cognitive lego they been handed is not capable of getting a look surgically. Look what's happening at harvard. This is such an interesting example about, about, about the entire landscape. It's like the upshot. It looks like the upshot of the, um, of the policies designed to produce something approximating equity or at least equality of opportunity. The gerrymandering of the admissions process has have the number of asians at harvard and then harvard is of course denying that strenuously.

Speaker 2:          01:33:43       And they say, well, our selection method is too esoteric to be captured properly by the statistics. It's like, oh, that's really how you're going to do. Right? There's nowhere, there's no. The harvard math department I think had one female mathematician, I think it doesn't have a senior female mathematician and I can be wrong and I'm sure that the university is trying to put pressure. Hey, what's wrong with you guys? Get with the program. The national science foundation is trying to do that across the entire stem disciplines now and they're really gonna muck up math by, by playIng around with this because the data show, it's quite interesting. The data showed that if you look at junior high, there's approximately. There's some dispute about this. There still might be evidence that there's a small percentage of a small advantage demand at the highest levels of mathematical ability, but I'll leave that aside for now. The more general data show that there's plenty of gifted women and there's plenty of gifted girls. There's plenty of gifted boys, but the gifted boys are gifted in math and not verbally. Whereas the gifted girls in math or gifted verbally too. And so one of the consequences is that because math is a very specialized opportunity, costs are higher. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The girls decide not to pursue. The thing is, is that math perfectly well tolerates

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       the females that it understands their work and can't live without. I mean, if I think about emi, nurturer or karen [inaudible] bag, or do some mcdevitt, there's a huge number of women who are very well integrated, uh, you know, in physics, people like Lisa Randall, I, I don't even think about there being women. Mathematicians are women. Physicists like that result, this paper. Right? And the idea, thank god for that. Right? But the point that I'm trying to get at here is, is that there are still structural barriers and there's probably something that isn't a structural barrier, like for example, the incentive structures and pay keeps going down. My guess is that you'll get more females in, which is a totally perverse effect that's been studied that you start going into the female and minority, uh, sectors when men feel that they have higher, uh, opportunity cost based on their level of aggression that they can go into management consulting or wall street or a sheet question is we didn't need to be able to have the real conversation somewhere and it needs

Speaker 2:          01:36:00       tonight. We also need to have a conversation about white. It might be advantageous to be paid less. One of the reasons it's it's advantageous to be paid less is the demands are less on you, so if you have other things that you want to do with your life than taking a job that pays less. This happens in law all the time. All the time. I worked as a consultant for legal companies for, for law firms for 10 years with lots of high end women and I saw the same thing happened all the time. It end the law. The law firms know this right? To the core and all the women in the law firms know what to almost all the women bail out of the high end positions in law in their early thirties. Well, why? Well, it's partly because if they're making, say they're making 350 to $500,000 a year, they're charging a thousand dollars an hour while the workload is absolutely insane. You better be buIlding 2100 hours a year, right? If you're going to stay in that position and you're on call all the time and you're basically working 16 hour days, but so maybe maybe what you want to do instead is find a nine to five job that pays half as much, but you get to have a light more psychotic inside of the universities. And here's what. Here's what nobody really wants to discuss. The great danger according to many of my colleagues in

Speaker 3:          01:37:14       placed well placed in in high level a science departments, is they say the followup. We don't know which females are going to discover the pleasures of family after we've invested in. And so the idea is is that sometime in their mid thirties, some number of of women, they think discover, oh my god, I've never been so fulfilled is when I've had my child. And some women say, I can't wait to get back to the lab. Right? And these are two different reactions. So by pushing the point of commitment farther and farther towards middle age, what you're doing is you're actually screening out the fact that you don't know which people you're going to invest in and they're going to decide that they have something more interesting to do in their life in terms of work or that Compelled because also has to do with aging parents right now.

Speaker 3:          01:38:04       Right? The fact is that women are more conscientious with respect to child rearing and with aging parents generically than men. And so part of the game and a function of being agreeable, probably a function of fitness where yes, the idea is that uncertain, uncertain paternity and maternity means that in a highly k selected species, females are going to be ever more focused on, on, on, on kin in this way. Maybe that's the reason that the differences in agreeableness evolved. I'm not even thought about that because while that could be, I never thought about that, that's likely explanation, but the issue that fundamentally we would defer tenure as a means of screening out, um, females who are going to invest in fertility. That is very interesting. If you look at feminist, uh, scientists in the fifties, you have women who had four kids and they spent a life in science and very often you look, you poke and prod at these things.

Speaker 3:          01:39:01       Well, there was an army of servants because there was wealth in the family in a very often. Right? And so what, what are my claim is if you really want to do something profound for women in technical subjects, you should pay them more and you should get them help in the house. Didn't work in law. Well, this is the issue because to some extent it's a question of fulfillment. Most of them, most of the women that I work with, they all have nannies. They outsourced all their domestic duties. Like that was covered man. And that was part of all lemme tell you more successful group of people than I do because very often had the money for if when two people can't get jobs together and contiguous states, you know, it's like, oh, I've got a job in Oklahoma and he's got a job in Alabama and we try to see each other two weekends a month.

Speaker 3:          01:39:46       You know, things have gone wildly off the rails, but the key point is that employers are playing games, trying to figure out this change in the Life cycle where some women are very, very happy doing kickass work throughout their life. maybe they can figure out how to do it all. Some of them can. Some of them can. Yeah. It's pretty hard to do. It's pretty hard to do at all. It helps if you have money. It does. It does help, but we are not owning up to what, what are these games and what are these differences and where should we be, where should we be subsidized? We're also not owning up to the fact that that gender difference in pay isn't a gender difference. It's a mother difference because women take the big hit and their salaries when they decide to have kids that no, it's not just that, but that no one and nothing is ever just one thing.

Speaker 3:          01:40:36       Right. But the whole thing about equal pay for equal work and seventy five cents on the dollar, right, is that when you poke and prod at that there is an unfairness and there is a misrepresentation. And the point is we're not comfortable having open conversation about do we want to subsidize people based on this different than my wife has a really interesting point. And she said, look, I believe in the fish area in equivalence between male and female is strategies were males tend to be the high risk, high return, moderate risk, moderate return. There was a time when wars were common in men got called up and women didn't have as high end prospects and everybody's working in the fields or you know, washing clothes at home. And then her point it's really interesting is knowledge work became wildly more fulfillinG very quickly and the number of wars, and this is my identity to it has gone down.

Speaker 3:          01:41:30       And so suddenly it's much better to be male in her way of thinking than it is female in a way that was never true before. And so there is a novelty effect, which is that, um, knowledge work is outpacing the fulfillment of child rearing at some level because the, the problems that you can solve if you're well placed to do so, uh, have increased in number and they're very, very fulfilling and there are also disproportionately lucrative at least in some situations and disproportionately lucrative. And so I, I do think that one of the things We have to do, um, you know, look at the Vietnam war memorial and I got like eight female names on it and it's just, you know, george, tom, Chad, you know, right. So there is this forgetting of the fact that maleness has this huge downside, which is the high risk part of the high risk, high return strategy.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       Know you're point about interest in things over people at my local pinball. Well, san francisco would, you know, I take my son there, there's a, there's a woman's room and they're clearly pinball machines that are intended to get a female audience, but it's like 20 to one males too few meals because it's, it's this kind of robotic activity where you're just putting money into a machine and you're watching a ball and some flashing lights. I find it quite entertaining, but I look at myself and I think you're saying cigs, man, I'm out of my mind. Well, you know, it's interesting too, is that that high risk, high return strategy is also not that common among men. It's just that the people who do the high risk high return strategy are disproportionately men. And so one of the things that I've been trying to struggle with is that like there's a small number of people who are hyper productive in any discipline.

Speaker 3:          01:43:16       That's the price's law phenomenon. So you see, for example, in scientific publishing, the median number of publications for men and women is very similar, immediate number, but the people who poe, who hyper publish are almost all made that telimans of zach's. That's right. The gas box of science and then the painful part of that is is that it's the people it looks like it's the people who are hyper productive that drive the science forward, so the median types are actually somewhat irrelevant. It's only the hyper productive people that count and their disproportionate. But even then I've heard you on this point, I want to take issue. Is kurt girdle hyper productive or was he and I would say yes he was. Did he publish very much? Almost nothing. Well, quantity isn't the one good one. I don't think so correlated at point three with citation count independent of numBer of publication count is.

Speaker 3:          01:44:10       I know, I know we've got. We've got a really dangerous problem in that. The metrics that we've developed, we've put way too much on and you know that's, that's the. You could say that that's a universal problem. Be careful what you measure. Right? And I mean it's hard to measure scientific impact with any degree. This is why I'm so an unpopular in this area, which is I just believe in giving slush funds to highly disagreeable people of high achievement and say, go figure out who you want to fund because a lot of this stuff can't be justified by any metric, and by the way, that's why I'm big on the selection end of things. Should you select qualified people and leave them the hell alone? Well, I mean I actually working together on this. I mean my. My take on this is that the best way to get radical progress is stopped worrying about the median individual worried about the tiny number of people who break new ground for everybody and then you find that a hell of a thing for a leftist to say, but I mean this goes back to and back those back to the problem I laid out at the beginning is that if you're going to pursue things of value in a social environment, you're gonna produce a hierarchy and there's going to be hyper productivity at the pinnacle of the hierarchy.

Speaker 3:          01:45:16       It's a big problem, but if you want to produce things, that's the problem you have to contend with. And so it is the case that in most fields that are attempting to advance rapidly that it's a very tiny proportion of people who are doing the advancing and how could it be otherwise? Well, but because oTherwise everybody would find the advanced. so, you know, I have this trick. It was a good measure. Well, here's another one. You asked the leaders in the field, uh, effectively who they would block, but they will not publicly short. So in other words, yeah, joe's on some crazy tangent. A, he's wasting the department's resources or you know, jane fundamentally doesn't play well on this team and the, I think we need to send her a strong message. Okay, well why don't we say something publicly, but I don't know. I don't want to say that.

Speaker 3:          01:46:07       Why is it you don't want to say something. Well, because you're frightened that that person has you on the losing end of history. So you're tryIng to block that person in private, but you won't short them in public. So you use the people who fundamentally are the regular establishment to tell you who the most dangerous people are. When you get those people money and you try to decrease transparency and accountability because giving people freedom. The old part of this bargain was, it's not the best paid career in the world, but you do end up with freedom. The ability to know is the and that's gone and that's gone. They ethics committees have killed that. Well, my point is, is the accuracies if killed, it's gotten so bad man, but it is our job to rally for unaccountability at a very high level. Lack of transparencY.

Speaker 3:          01:46:58       You can laugh, but let's. Let's go through this, right? The fact is when you have a slush fund and you can make decisions that you don't have to justify based on an h index or a citation counter, any of these poison metrics, you get people who are able to make use of what we still have over places like China. That's What we have over a place like China is we're a little bit richer. not much, maybe so we can, but we're freer and that's mIddle finger. That's less middle finger. Well, that's disagreeableness there yet. Well, I know, and I mean you were the one who knows me over dinner over my tenure is necessary because you could say, well, I'm 95, I don't believe this, but you could say 95 percent of people waste tenure. They take advantage of it and I would say that's fine.

Speaker 3:          01:47:43       As long as the five percent who are taking advantage of it have their freedom hyper produCed and justify all the rest of them. Nobody has real tenure because real tenure, academic freedom was first of all sacrificed by the association of american universities, aau in 1953 at the height of the cold war in the face of the rosenberg. Who's so fIrst of all, let's be very, very honest. The trade group that represents the nation's top institutions of higher learning, the research universities fucked up and they killed something and I don't swear very often. This is very important. They sacrificed academic freedom, freedom on an altar when they were facing something like we're, we're facing with left carthy is right when they were facing real mccarthyism, they buckled and the einsteins of the world stood up. There's a beautiful testimony of a guy who was facing senator mccarthy.

Speaker 3:          01:48:37       Uh, he says, well, I was just talking to my friend albert einstein. You can see in the transcript. He's like, excuse me, your friend albert einstein? And einstein said, look, you have to be prepared to lose your salary, lose your livelihood if you're going to be a true intellectual. Now the fact of the matter is disagree ability needs to make a massive warring comeback. Right? And one of the things I think is just fascinating is how many top departments have invited bret weinstein to give a talk on evolutionary theory after watching him tossed out by the radical departments? Expect the answer to that is zero. It's almost zero. I don't know that it may be zero. So is so with lindsay shepherd, her claim for, with wilfred laurier is that the controversy there is controversy has made her permanently unemployable with. And when I read that, I thought that's, that's correct, because no hiring committee will take a risk on anybody touched who did green fluorescent protein.

Speaker 3:          01:49:30       Uh, he was supposed to get a nobel prize for it. He was acknowledged by the three guys who did as the fourth guy, they flew them to Sweden. And what is he doing? He immediately, afterwards, he was driving a shuttle bus in huntsville, Alabama. One year later after the New York times a covered doug pressure story was still driving a shuttle bus in huntsville, Alabama, talking about margo tool at mit who stood up against david baltimore and a theresa and issue shikari, you know, destroyed. Now my question is, hey, where are the universities? Is it the university of chicago? Is it down to the university of chicago? Where are the places? Chicago? If you're out there, you know, w w we need you. We need fundamentally strong departments and weak administrations. This is absolutely critical. Is that anything on that's on? Okay, we need an accountability. We need strong professors, we need strong departments, we need weak administrations.

Speaker 3:          01:50:27       We need to get people tenure radically earlier, like in their twenties, late twenties, early thirties. We need when people have the ability to make great new ideas, this is not appreciated and the fact that fundamentally nobody can hear bret weinstein who has great interesting theories and you want to shoot them down by all means, but you won't invite him to give a seminar on his, on his work at a time like this. This is absolute madness and I'm so you know, what a privilege to be able to deal with our tiny group of people who can actually open their throat and say find a much larger audience than he would have gotten any other way. Well, that's exactly what I was gonna say. Maybe marketing this all the way back and then let's do one more thing and then we're going to bring in shapiro, but maybe that brings us back to where we started about this.

Speaker 3:          01:51:09       The speed of technology, the amount of people that can listen and watch and all of that and that what brett may find. I just brought bread up in front of a sold out comedy club in bellevue and he got, when I just mentioned his name, he got a standing ovation. How many of those people edit journals of evolutionary theory so we have to get it to them. I get it. It's a different set that are watching this right now to be sad. There's something to be said even so on. The question front is rough, but there's something to be said for being able to bring your scientific expertise to a mass audience who are actually interested in the content of your discourse, so I'm not saying it's. It's, it's, it's the revolution in the journals that might be necessary, but it's not nothing. It's and it, it, it, it, it looks like there's the possibility of bringing these things directly to a mass audience that's appreciated.

Speaker 3:          01:51:56       I appreciate that, but the thing that nobody gets about what we're doing, because I spend my time attacking a most of the things I'm trying to save. I want to save the New York times from itself. I want to save the university. How old are you? 50 to do, you don't have enough time left to do spoken like a baby boomer and my friend, he might know kurzweil, you know, what we need to do is either cure it or kill it. These things need to. We can let it kill itself, which it seems to be. I don't have time for that. And, and it's not a pretty death. No. And the fact of the matter is, is that it's crowding out what's next and so fundamentally, if it can be saved, if they can be saved, they need to be saved and if they can't be saved, if they want to keep their

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       finger on the scales and push everything in this direction and the cowardice is a palpable everywhere. Um, it's important that they stopped crowding out what's next? And I think that that's the major decision and you know, quite the thing to market the marketplace might make that decision for them. We'll see. We'll see. Maybe it'll be fast. Maybe it'd be fast enough. So let's, let's do one other thing before shapiro is gonna. Join us. We're gonna. Take a little break and have lunch and then shapiro is going to jump in here. So I thought this would be a good segue too to him because we haven't done that much political snap right here. Is this, is this a political movement?

Speaker 2:          01:53:25       Is this the beginnings of a political movement? No, I, I don't think so. I think what it is is the, is the, is that conduct, it's the conducting of proper political discourse and maybe you could say, well it would be a political movement to foster the conducting of proper political discourse. ThAt's possible, but it's a strange political movement because it's a political movement that's concentrating on process rather than, than, than, than, than content. Yeah. Um, I think that partly what I'm doIng in my tour is the fostering of genuine discourse, but I don't think that's as political. I don't think of that as a political movement. I think of it as a psychological movement or. Yeah. Or it, I don't know, our constitutional principles in the political domain. I would say no. they're outside the political domain because they're axiom, so they're inside some other domain.

Speaker 2:          01:54:17       They're inside a philosophical domain or a theological domain, and I think a discussion that's associated with proper political process isn't a political discussion. I think it's a meta political discussion. It would be what a better way to ask the question and then b, do we just need a political party or a political group or a politician or whatever to just pick up on this and then incorporate it so that it's not a movement in and of itself. I understand what you're saying. Well, I've been. I went and talked to, um, uh, what's the name of that group turning point in America? I went and talked to everybody who was a turning point usa. I went and talked to their women's meeting. They had about 1200 women down in, uh, we were in dallas and one of the things I recommended to them was that instead of concentrating on the content of the radiology, because they're branding themselves in some senses, the conservative movement that they devote themselves to educating themselves as much as they possibly can because they're going to produce a much bigger impact by becoming better individuals than they are by promoting conservative doctrine.

Speaker 2:          01:55:16       That's what it looks like to me, even though there's some utility in promoting conservative doctrine on the campuses, at least as a counterbalance to the overwhelming preponderance of radical leftist thinking. but I don't, I don't think the fundamental movement necessarily necessary here is political because I think the political is actually part of the problem. So that's, that's how it looks to me. I think we're, the advanced group said to send to take a hill for a healthy political discourse

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       that follows us. That's hopefully that, that, you know, situations turning point usa. Uh, you know, I was shocked that charlie kirk and candice owens reached out to me and I was like, you, you do understand who I am. And I'm very confused by it because I find that a lot of the rhetoric that comes out of that absolutely unpalatable and the private discourse is much more sympathetic, much more understanding. I think that the political, some of that's a lack of sophistication actually on, on the part of the people who are doing it. But I think we can move those guys because just for the record, I just want to say that when they invited me to speaking gigs, charlie said to me from day one, he said, I disagree with you on a ton of stuff, but I want to invite you here to speak. And I go up there and I talk about being gay married and pro choice then faculty and all of these things.

Speaker 3:          01:56:34       And they give me a standing ovation. So yeah, but the. But then the problem is, is that nobody can figure out why I'm talking to candace owens because when she's going in red meat conservative mode, I don't recognize the same person who reached out to me. And you know, I don't think it is the same person. Exactly. I think that there's a fractionation, they're as interested because of the niche and the idea is that there is not yet a niche. This came up with Douglas Murray. It's a super important point in general. People are in a restrictionist mood on immigration and they want more protection is with respect to trade. And the question like, let's take within an immigration is why is it that no politician finds it easy to exploit, um, this without going completely far right or completely open borders, like either it's ethno nationalism or it's all people are equal.

Speaker 3:          01:57:25       Why should we dIscriminate from people in any other country? The sensible positions are uninhabitable. So the question is why. And so the claim that I'm making is you have to really know your stuff at the moment. If you're going to hold a position like we cannot be easy a phobic, we have to be somewhat restrictionist. We cannot close the borders. Immigration, I mean, I particularly want to put your finger on it. You have to know your stuff to hold that position, but you shouldn't have to know it at this level. I mean, in other words, to work I had to do to figure out what the hell happened with technical and scientific immigration is a hidden study from 1986 that nobody outside in the outside world knew about. Nobody can devote two years of their life generically in order to figure these things out. So the problem is we have to actually take out the ground for the middle, get rid of the crazies on both ends and have an idea that fundamentally, or at least stopped the crazies from taking out the reasonable people. That's the issue with. I don't we are stopping the craziest. That's like, well probably not because they're always there, but getting their hands from around the necks of the people who are sensible would be a useful, at least intermediary stop. I have learned painfully that I have more in common with what would now be considered center. Right? Than do with radical

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       left. Yeah. And so this idea of reaching across the aisle and saying you, you take out your trash, I'll take out my right is a very important move that is not happening. And so that's. but that's one of the things that's weird about the candice own charlie kirk situation is like when I went to the aspen ideas festival, the people who invited me there, I wouldn't say we're there not canonical members of the commentary. There are people who are feeling tremendous pressure and that's partly why they invited me and I did get invited, but, and then I discussed the things that I was discussing, but I wouldn't say that I felt welcome there at all. And so one of The things that's weird about going to talk to these conservative groups, it's like I went down to dallas and I talked to these women and I like, I didn't give a conservative talk.

Speaker 2:          01:59:28       I gave this talk that I'm having right now. And, but they were, they were conservative, but at the same time they were actually listening to what I was saying and they were receptive to it. and so then when I go to the talk to the leftist types, it's like that, that there are ideologically possessed, let's say in the same manner, but they're not open at all. Okay. But, but I experienced something slightly different. I, I see exactly this, I'm more welcoming center right circles than I am in even center left circles because of the contamination has gotten much farther from, from the extreme into the center and the left. But there's still this other thing like, you know, I heard the word lib, tarred and I'm just like, oh, for christ's sake, really, you know. Oh, you want to enslave everybody? Oh, your monster. Turn on you.

Speaker 2:          02:00:14       And I just think, okay, this is some preprogrammed set of moves. And you know, in your comment section, there is much more of this stuff that I'm used to in other people's comments. Something about actions or not. No, no, no, but I'm saying something about your audience that somewhere in your evolution, um, you have to watch the fact that there is this increase in the incivility on the right. And, you know, I focus my energy on the left because it's my responsibility. I don't think the right is my responsibility, but while these people are struggling with the same prOblem you laid out at the beginning though, it's like we can, we can make the case for civility and should but, but you say, well, tHe civility only goes so far until you defend yourself. It's like, yeah, well that's a big problem. It's like exactly how far does it go and then how do you defend youRself and when you're defending yourself, what strategies to use.

Speaker 2:          02:01:11       Now, one of the things I learned, and I talked about this with dave last night and it's something I think that we should think about as members of this loose group, is that you don't defend yourself more than is absolutely neCessary, right? It's a minimal necessary force. A doctorate is the correct one and so lived hard and that sort of thing could probably be shelved as ineffective and counter productive. Right. Although part of the reason that it's coming up at least in part, isn't an attempt to ineffective and counterproductive. It's offensive and stupid. Well, okay, that's fine. That's fine. That's fine. But, but my point is it's actually, it's actually technically complicated. It's like it's not that easy to mount an effective defense that isn't simultaneously and attack like you have to be very like I want to push you back just far enough so your back, but no farther. It's like, I mean that's worked out in my situation so far because generally when I've been a dark publicly in the press, even in interviews, I'd been able to use minimal necessary force and every time that's happened it's worked. And so one of the things I would recommend, and this would be to your listeners and viewers and props to mind as well, perhaps two years, is that don't push back any harder than you have to write because it's. It gets rapidly do it, are balanced fashion.

Speaker 3:          02:02:32       A typical thing is if somebody's going to come on gang busters, like you have three opportunities are so to cut it out and they refuse to it, you know? Yeah. I liked the rule of three. You've been telling them to the curb and then I offer them a hand up. Then the question is, okay, are going to bite the hand up then and then we have a further problem because now you're just on some sort of unbounded, the descent into hell and I'm not interested in following you there, but I think that what's really going on, and this is the hardest point to make, is that we need to new sort of hermaphroditic parties that combined elements of right and left the don't look like the terrible situation that we inherited from the baby boomers. No offense sir. Um, where for a very long period of time we've been under one group, a group set of ideas that are crashing and burning and whatever the new thing that replaces right and the new thing that replaces left is, is going to have combinations of these things.

Speaker 3:          02:03:35       And so for example, maybe situation specific, well differentiated. Every smart person I know is pro market. The key question is, do you believe that the market should be allowed to do everything? Like you get these very purest things. I am the, I am an iron randy and I'm a guaranteed free markets here. but then you put things in front of them and you say, look, should physics be allowed to sign a licensing deal where we charge you for everything we've created, like the semiconductor, you know, or, or, or the communications equipment that you use to run your life. because if you want to talk to me one more time about tax dollars for science, I'm going to point out to you that you're breaking a compact that we had, that you were going to support us and we weren't going to charge charge you because we charge you.

Speaker 3:          02:04:19       We're going to be the ones with the yachts and the fourth homes and you're not going to be able to, to pay your physics bill. You know, and the point of this is when you welsh on a contract and you start to say, no, no, no, it's the market. Well guess what? You know, public goods are part of markets and they're very valuable and they're hard to get to pay for them. And so you have to use some amount of violence, right? Weber's theory is that a government is a monopoly on violence and that's why it exists. When you have these very pure ideological positions that are not tutored by reality or deeper theory, they are very, very difficult to dislodge people from now because you are taking a ton of risk. As a smaLl business owner, you are going to be predisposed towards and libertarian mindset because you're not only making money from your hard work.

Speaker 3:          02:05:06       You're making money from the fact that you're taking on huge amounts of risk. And when people don't identify risk management as a source of inequality, we've got a problem. On the other hand, there are a ton of people I know in New York. We're making money hand over fist by extracting it through rent, seeking by putting themselves as the toll collector so that everybody's got to do business, has to pay them off in some sort of legalized form of corruption. And those people. I fundamentally think we should have clawed back their property on long island and come up with clawback national seashore. Uh, when we bailed them out in the great recession and collapse in 2008 now, well maybe we'll get lucky and you know, and I'm thinking that the possibilities that these increasingly long form, uh, opportunities for communication and the rise of podcasts and the rise of audio books and all of that is going to produce a more educated and committed electorate and they will be sophisticated enough to start to sort out these problems without recourse to these ideological or with last recourse to these ideological overseas still fighting Jordan.

Speaker 3:          02:06:10       They're still, they're still not coming. I mean the number of people I know who are privately aware of me and publicly show no awareness of what I'm talking about. A actually the same thing for you. Well, it's a running joke. Tilting fast was much more for you. I mean because I think by breaking it has to get there first and you broke through with the book and it was, you're doing a different thing than anybody else in this network is doing. But my point would be that they had to contend with you because they had a mystery, which is why is there a number one bestseller, um, by somebody who's, I mean, how do we explain any amount of this, dave, it's just that I come to weddings, availed my angry young white men followers, but those aren't the people who are buying funny. And I started taking pictures with all of the people of color and the talks are up to about 40 percent women now and the age at least at least the age. The one thing I do see though is that lots of men come alone, but very few women come alone. But it's about 40 percent

Speaker 1:          02:07:13       women now. And I'll tell you about the group of grandmothers that I met about a week or two ago. I forget what city it was, and there was this group of grandmothers they get together and it was, there was about nine or 10 of them and all in their sixties and seventies. And they all love you and it draws in september. Oh. Then you'll get all right. You

Speaker 3:          02:07:31       know, one, one kid came up to me and one of your talks and I said, you know, he started talking about how important it was that you were there. And I said, well, what is this done for your life? This is what has it done for my life. He says, you know, I was, uh, I was at home smoking weed, masturbating too much, playing video games, and, you know, six months later I've got a job, a fiance, um, you know, I think he had some gal who was not interested in because of his situation, but liked him. And he turned his life around. And I thought, this is partly what's so incredibly fun about these events is that people just tell that story over and over. It's so fun because they come up to me and they say, look, here's six months ago I was having all these troubles and sometimes it's serious.

Speaker 3:          02:08:17       I was suicidal. But what was really effective, what really affected me about this conversation was nothing about this guy said, loser. and what, what it told me is that some of the difficulties we've had in our markets, particularly after post 2008, there was this thing that worked less and less well over time and people who were college educated, who were hard working, who were creative. We're still living at home with their parents. And I think it's an added kick. It's like, you know, when do you hit the nitrous oxide in order to get the car to zoom into hyperspace? Uh, I think, you know, I. Before I ever met you, I had this shtick about the world uncle shortage, that fundamentally we needed a class of uncles and also aunts who aren't exactly parents to put a cigar in your mouth in a single malt and in your hand and say, listen kid, this is how the world actually works.

Speaker 3:          02:09:14       Get the hell out there and master it. Yeah, don't, don't, don't you bucko me. But the key issue is, is that I think you became the one man answer to the world uncle shortage. And I think it's important at some point to deepen the offering because there are many different kinds. like fundamentally, I need to not focus on cleaning my room. I have because I'm a messy room guy and I need to get my physics out and I need to do certain sorts of things to get my life in order that are different. They're not doing anything. You could start by cleaning your room. No, no, no. I didn't. It's not bad advice. I know. I know, but it's also the case that we need sane, tough, funky ants because there's a lot of bad advice being given to women and oh well, a lot of this radical stuff on the left isn't going to be sorted out by matt if it's going to be sorted out.

Speaker 3:          02:10:02       It's going to be sorted out by sensible women who put it into it and I'm hoping that will happen and just a sensible women that I, that I've talked to who would like to do that are terrified, terrified, shredded by. I'm so glad you sent. Oh, absolutely. I hear that over and over, and these are often women who are in positions of substantial power. You wouldn't think that they would be terrified of this, but this, this, this, this is what one of these women who will remain nameless said to me, she said, I've never been afraid of men, and I said, well, what are you afraid of? And we worked through it a little bit and she said,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       I guess what I'm afraid of is weak women. Yes. Yes. What an interesting observation that fundamentally, you know, strong people can say that comment was a little sour. Yeah. It doesn't have to be lIke, oh yeah, what did you say? Because very often how many boneheaded comments I make boneheaded comments you make if you, if people don't have a chance to play with ideas and to come back from it, if the answer to everything is your cancel, well then, then there's no hope. Well then you're not in. You're also just not inviting people to play with the ideas that actually they can't play with them and never be stupid in their initial formulations of the ideas. Then they don't get it on the nose. So on that note, I want to take my two uncles out to lunch and then we will bring in my cousin ben shapiro. How does that sound? Sounds good. Sound good? All right guys. So we're going to do the second live stream. Uh, this is gonna end in a second. We're gonna. Do the second live stream with ben at 1:00 pacific. and be nice in the comment section because that's what your uncle want. Addie, you guys. all right, we'll be back in a sec.
