Speaker 1:          00:05          Well, mainstream media focuses on trump's locker room talk and Clinton's emails. There are actually a whole slew of other interesting political stories happening right now related to the presidential election. This election has seen a massive shift in America's political alignment on both the left and the right on the left. We've seen a real divide between the Bernie wing of the Democrats and the Clinton camp. Bernie's message against Wall Street money in politics, and his chastising of the political establishment has been swallowed whole by the Political Clinton machine. While Bernie is now supporting Hillary, it's pretty clear that many of his supporters aren't following his lead in either donations or enthusiasm. This division is one of the reasons hillary is still struggling with young people and overall connecting with new voters. Meanwhile, on the right, we've seen the absolute fracturing of the Republican Party as we know it. Mainstream Republicans like Paul Ryan, John Mccain, and Jeb Bush are now on the outside looking in.

Speaker 1:          01:06          As trump has aggressively gutted the party. It's pretty clear that if trump wins in November, the old guard of the Republicans will be out and his inside circle of people like Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, and Ben Carson will be in while the list of Republicans not voting for trump continues to grow. The Republican base who voted during the primaries is still with him and whether the party is supporting trump or not, those people are trump's rise also fractured. The Republican Party ideologically neo-cons are either and hiding, are defecting to Hillary. While the Christian conservatives are backing trump, a candidate who is probably their last choice when this election began. Let's not forget, this is a guy who compared his own book to the Bible as they say, politics makes strange bedfellows for both the Democrats and the Republicans. Twenty 16 will be looked back on as a watershed year regardless of who wins.

Speaker 1:          02:01          It's clear the parties are in flux and they both desperately need new ideas and new leaders. The fact that we have a 69 year old Democrat running against a 70 year old Republican tells you all you need to know about the aging state. Of our two party system, how is it that these two were the best? Our system can churn out while it's easy to mock millennials, just imagine how you would feel if this was the first presidential election you ever really paid attention to or had a chance to vote it. We've got the ultimate reality star running against the ultimate insider, and while they may hate each other, they are also perfect for each other. By the time this thing is over, they'll have thrown out everything but the kitchen sink, but that'll only be because they needed it to wash their dirty hands.

Speaker 1:          02:47          One of the many issues which seems to have been almost totally shelved during this campaign is science. I guess in some ways science is the obvious sacrificial lamb in an election contest focusing so much on mudslinging instead of discussing the actual issues that affect our lives. As we discussed during my chat with transhumanist is all time van two weeks ago. There are so many huge upcoming scientific breakthroughs coming down the pike from stem cell research to cloning to artificial intelligence that we must talk about these issues now so that we'll know how to deal with the ramifications of them both good and bad when they're right in front of us. Scientific breakthroughs will continue to happen, whether we're prepared for them or not. Perhaps we can never be fully prepared, but we at least need leaders who believe in the merits of science in the first place.

Speaker 1:          03:35          My guest this week is theoretical physicists, Lawrence Krauss Kraus, the foundation professor in the school of Earth and space exploration and Physics Department at Arizona State University, as well as the director of the origins project at Asu, which focuses on the origins of humans and the universe itself. Cross has been outspoken this election related to politics and science, particularly the seeming lack of knowledge in this department by Donald Trump. We're going to dive deep both into science and politics as well as the many places that the two intersect. I figure if a guy can spend his adult life trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe, then maybe just maybe he can figure out the mysteries of our current political existential crisis. Joining me this week is an author, a theoretical physicist, and a professor at the school of Earth and space exploration at Arizona State University. Lawrence Krauss. Welcome to the Rubin [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          04:37          It's great to be here. You are in the middle of like 8,000 things and we're going to have to use some theoretical physics to fit this in the time space time continuum. Eighty thousand plus or minus a million. Yeah. Yeah. Plus or minus a million. All right. Well I'm very excited to talk to you. I think I publicly shamed you into doing this several times at the reason rally. Yeah. Well it's hard to publicly shame me, but you did try. Yeah. Yeah, he did. Yeah. And, and uh, but I wanted to do it. It's just a matter of fitting in and it's great that we can be here today. Yeah. All right. So I'm very excited you're heading to ucla to do some more talk to after this, but let's, let's jump right into the election because I have to. Maybe we'll talk about the science. It's about, you know, why not as a man of science, how do you feel about just the tenor of this and, and not just the tenor, but as someone that cares about empirical evidence, they don't care about facts.

Speaker 2:          05:23          How do you feel about just the state of what is going on right now? It's every, every year. I always wonder if it could be worse because you know, let's face it, politics and empirical evidence that don't go together very well as a rule. I know for a long time I've been interested in trying to make sure public policy is based on that and in a lot of different ways in my writing and, and we, we actually created a group in 2008 called science debate, which we tried to get a presidential debate on issues of science and technology. Not to ask them to 10th digit of Pi, but if the issues that really matter that are gonna affect the future for people are not the issues that ever talked about, their energy, the environment, security, all of that depends on, on, on an understanding of science and technology policy and so it's always been ignored and we.

Speaker 2:          06:07          And we've been frustrated by it, but I have to say that this is this year, of course with Donald trump takes the cake in so many ways. He's the. I wrote a piece in the New Yorker which more or less called them the anti science candidate if such a thing as possible. The only person I think on the Republican slate that was more anti science remarkably was Ben Carson. Right. Let's just talk about Carson. Really? Yeah. Why not? Because he's such a fool. How can you be? He's an. He's a neurosurgeon. Neurosurgeon, right. How can you be a neurosurgeon and against so many of the things that a scientist as well, not just against ignorant about them, that that's what amazed me. It's, it's, it's, it's one thing to be I logic ideologically opposed, but he would talk about evolution away which clear, clean them under, didn't understand evolution, which is the basis of biology besides calling the big bang a hoax from the devil and all, I mean just fat.

Speaker 2:          07:00          Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You know, that in fact we didn't land on the moon, but uh, uh, but, uh, so what it demonstrates is, and it's unfortunate, but actually it's relevant. My mother wanted me to be a doctor and, and, and she made the mistake of, of sort of getting me interested in science and wanted to be a scientist. And then I discovered when I was in high school that doctors weren't scientists. I apologize to all doctors, they're not. And, and he's a perfect example, you to be, to be a good that, that's not to say how many doctors try and keep up with science obviously, but to be a good neurosurgeon requires eye hand coordination and a, and an understanding of what to what to do when you open up a brain. It's, it. I will get in trouble for saying this, but it's a very sophisticated kind of car mechanic and so he clearly was very good at those technical things, but obviously you don't.

Speaker 2:          07:52          Obviously he he not only did not know much science, but he he willfully, and this is the real problem with with religion it with someone like him, he decides what's right based on the scriptures and anything disagrees with it must be wrong and that's that's the real difference between religion and science were in religion. You know the answers before you ask the questions and in science we try and ask the questions and find out the answers and they may surprise us and they may change over the course of not only may they often do and the willingness to say you're wrong or to change your mind is profoundly important in science. Which brings us back to Donald Trump, but real quick just to finish with Carson because it's such an interesting example of this. I'm glad you made the distinction of saying that he's a neurosurgeon.

Speaker 2:          08:36          Surgeon. Scientists now fumbled twice. It's okay because a neuroscientist has to really have the scientific knowledge, the way you're describing the souped up car guy, car mechanic. It's like, really? He's doing, he's doing a physical act. He's, he's repairing damage and, and he needs to know how to do that. And you know, I, again, one doesn't want to generalize for all neurosurgeons based on Ben Carson, but it demonstrates that there's a difference and he, and I'm assuming he was good at what he did and it wasn't all hype. Uh, I'm willing to grant him that, but in everything else he says he expressed more ignorance, not just antagonism, but ignorance about fundamental science than any other candidate in the Republican Party, which says a lot because, because they're, you know, they're, it has unfortunately become the anti science party of late and it wasn't always that way. There party has been a big supporter of science over the years right now because they insist on denying the existence of climate change.

Speaker 2:          09:36          And many on the right insist on denying the existence of evolution or even the Big Bang, uh, and their, their attitudes towards homosexuality. They have necessity by ideology, been forced to confront the evidence of science and ignore it or, or disregarded or or, or lie about it, right? So basically they've staked out a position based on non fact and then that sort of boxes them in their own real problem. What do you do when you're wrong and you can't afford to say wrong. And the problem actually the real problem with politics is people are not willing to say, you know what? We have this policy but it was wrong. We've changed our minds because it and, and I read the public. One of the reasons I want to have wanted to insert more science into, into public policy is not not the knowledge of science, but the process of science which is based on empirical evidence and testing and, and evolving your views.

Speaker 2:          10:32          And if we really want to have sound public policy, we can't. We can't just be willing to say, oh well someone was wrong once and therefore, you know, we're not going to listen to them stating that you're wrong. And explaining why is to me raises you to a higher level. Someone. It's a beautiful thing, in fact, as a scientist often say as a theoretical physicist, I say the two greatest states to be in our being wrong or confused because then that means a lot more to learn. Yeah. There's a little room there for a of. I mean, I mean it's really learning is a process of discovering errors and what you were thinking. And, and uh, I have often said, in fact my new book, I said somewhere that, that science one of the purposes of sciences to make people uncomfortable. And I don't mean that in a bad sense, but if we're always comfortable, it means we're never going outside our comfort zone.

Speaker 2:          11:20          It means are myopic. Views are never been questioned or confronted. And that's what living is all about. That's what mute music, art literature all about. I mean, it's, you know, I'll bring in, happens to be today. I'm excited because Bob Dylan just won the Nobel Prize in literature, but you know, but you know, people like Bob don't force us to confront. I remember when I was young, our views about waste society worked and science should be the same way. And, and good politicians should be, should be all about that. It's amazing to me when I've been in some other countries and, and, and, and uh, and uh, confronting, um, presidents or prime ministers who actually who actually

Speaker 2:          12:01          no something. And then that's, you know, that's not to say, I mean Obama is a. yeah. Anyway, I don't want to hate mail no matter what. You're going to get hate mail, hate. Well wait till you see what happens on twitter. But uh, but we can talk about Obama and Clinton too. But interestingly, it sounds like you're saying you don't necessarily care if the, if the president knows that much about sites, but you at least want them to be intellectually curious enough to, to assign the right people. It looked. The president can't be an expert in everything, but the president needs to know they're not. The first thing is to know you're not an expert in everything, which is Donald Trump hasn't yet figured out. And secondly, to be intellectually curious and thirdly, to choose the right people. That's really what you want a president to do, is have good advisors, is to know enough to distinguish people who are full of garbage.

Speaker 2:          12:49          I'll use that word. Uh, and, and, and, and people you can trust who's opinions you can trust because you know that they're willing to be wrong too. And so I think that's really the president. And uh, and uh, uh, in, in, in the current climate, you obviously can't be an expert in anything. And an amazing me when we talk about, you know, having debate on science, they say, well, the president shouldn't be a scientist, but you know, you know, we have a debate on national security, but with the president doesn't have to be a military expert. He has to be surrounded himself or herself with, with reasonable people who know what's going on or, or on diplomacy. So is the intellectual curiosity part of it, is that the part that about trump gets you the most? Well, it's intellectual curiosity and skepticism. Skepticism is a key part of science. Be asking yourself, is this evidence reasonable and why should I believe that? Yeah. The the thing that, it's hard to know what trump is such an anomaly, but the fact that when he says, you know, who do you take advice from? He says for myself, because I'm, you know, I know that are mad when when someone says that no matter what they're running for, whether it's president or, or, or, uh, or, or head of a school board or whatever, you should worry about that. And so I think it's that and his incredible

Speaker 2:          14:08          anger and vindictiveness and you know, people have called him a, a bully, but you know, I did a, I did a dialogue with the Hollywood friend of mine named Johnny Depp and he and he pointed out that wasn't who he actually, he actually played Donald Trump in it. You should watch it on Netflix. And it was a great show where he, he looks just like him. It's great. But he said that Donald Trump isn't a bully. He's a brat. And that, that defines the man to me. He's not a bully so much as just a spoiled Brat. Who, who, if he's losing, finds a reason to blame other people. It does. Again, he's the center of his own universe and all of that is, is, uh, is, is terrifying and uh, and ignorant in the extreme. I mean, one of the, when I wrote about science and, and the candidates this year, one of the statements that trump made that just to me epitomizes the level of ignorance of the man because first of all, a lot of what he says is just meant he doesn't care whether it's true or not.

Speaker 2:          15:03          He thinks it'll play well or not. That I can understand when you say, you know, why are we worried about the ozone? Why can't I have know aerosols in my hairspray because I only use my hairspray indoors. So it can affect, can affect you that Mr said that now that's the kind of thing you say. Oh my goodness gracious. So anyway, yeah, that one's tough. So, okay, so we've got your feelings on trump, I think. I think they're clear, right? Yeah. Well I have, I've been trying to moderate them less, uh, um, you know, the p, I just wrote a piece in the New Yorker Today on, on, on the nuclear threat. And, and, uh, to be more serious, his misunderstanding of, of the fact that nuclear weapons are not meant to be used. And in fact, the, as I pointed out, it demonstrates a lot of our, of the illogical nature of our nuclear policy.

Speaker 2:          15:54          But when he says, if you're, you know, if we build them, why can't we use them that anyone has thought about it, I realized that you can't, you can't use them in any strategic way. And so it's, and if he wants to encourage other countries to build them, he, he misunderstands the whole point of proliferation and those things are serious. They're not, you know, we can't laugh over that stuff. So I really tried and I think mostly people that watch your show, I really tried to be fair to him and, and, and whatever. So when, when he's talking about the nuclear stuff, and I'll say something like, you know, uh, Japan should have nukes so that they could defend themselves potentially from China. It seems to me that there's some grain of truth in the, in the concept of that, that, that we shouldn't have to feel like we have to defend Japan.

Speaker 2:          16:36          Well, you're saying it really throws off every sort of preceptive how all these nations have. Well, it prints rolls off the precept of, of, of really what we should be trying to do with nuclear weapons, which we isn't talked about enough today, which is we want to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, the world because there's really no good use for the right eye. And we built up this incredible stash of nuclear weapons because of the Cold War and we had this policy of mutually assured destruction. So we had to have enough to ensure that total annihilation of the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union. And uh, that's okay. But we then have in, even at the time of Nixon, we signed the Nonproliferation Treaty. Most people think the Nonproliferation Treaty, and this is so typical of the US, is designed to say no one should have nuclear weapons but us. And that's not what it's about.

Speaker 2:          17:24          It's trying to say we don't want to have nuclear weapons to spread, but the other thing that the nuclear nations agreed to in the Nonproliferation Treaty was to disarm and so we have an obligation. We are violating the Nonproliferation Treaty today in this country as much as North Korea may be by trying to get nuclear weapons are getting new weapons or Iran, which happily they've been stopped from getting them for the moment because we are not making an open effort. Did it's arm and Obama who whose heart was certainly the right place. He said, you know, we see the world should, should get rid of nuclear weapons, and initially the, the, the, his administration actually did an, an agreement with the Soviet Union with the Russia to reduce the number of arms, but we still have way too many. We still have a thousand nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert, which means they can be launched instantaneously if, if there's a warning of an attack, whether the warning is real or not.

Speaker 2:          18:20          The president only has a few minutes to decide that is not necessary in the modern world. And also, unfortunately, and I'm happy to see that, that Hillary Clinton seems to be against it. We are barking at a $1,000,000,000,000 modernization of nuclear weapons fleet, which is only reasonable if we plan to keep our nuclear weapons level at what it is. If we say no, you know, eventually want to reduce them. We don't have to spend that much money trying to maintain the arsenal we now have. And so it's interesting to me to see that the nuclear issue, which over time has been, has raised and lowered in importance. The public doesn't seem to think about it, but it is still the major threat, the major existential threat to civilization. And, and we as a country are not doing enough and it is true at the same time that we're probably going to this more than you want to know.

Speaker 2:          19:11          But it's true that Russia is getting more worrisome than they were afforded the saber rattling the arguments about nuclear weapons are much worse now under Putin in the last few years. And they were. So there's some concerns in that regard. But, but, um, we could take unilateral steps which would lead us in the right direction, right? So even if Russia was 10 times worse than you might, if we had half of our stockpile it, we'd still be more than enough to destroy. If we had a 10th of our, if we had a 10th of our stock pile, we, we, we could still not only annihilate the Soviet Union, but essentially create enough mess to destroy the world. And, uh, uh, it, it, we, we need to, we need to realize that fact and, and, and realize that we can, as I say, unilateral actions are often responded to. For example, another area where we spend money that we, that's a waste of time for the most part is missile defense.

Speaker 2:          20:06          When one of the things I love is a, George Bush claimed that they were gonna have a missile defense system ready in 2004. He was during the election. And, and of course it turned out that most 50 percent of the American public thought we already had one. And as they was going at the time, what they should say is we already have one just as effective as this system that doesn't work, but it doesn't cost $100 million. So it's a lot less expensive and, and it serves the same effect. So how much of this though is just that a huge percentage of our economy is tied into the military? It is, but you know the. But what you're hearing in the president of the election is we're not spending enough. And that's what scary. What we need to do is spend rationally. People said that for a long time, you know, we, we spend almost a trillion dollars on the, on, on defense every year.

Speaker 2:          20:53          And the question is we have to look and say, what are we need? Look, it's not as if we can disarm as a nation completely in all ways the world is a dangerous place. But the question is, do we need to spend that kind of money? And the answer, I think for many people as we could spend less more effectively. Do you think there's any situation where ethically we could use nukes? I mean, if, let's say, because I don't think it's going to be through a nation state, but let's say they, you know, somebody got a dirty bomb in here and blew up times square. So the question is, what do you, I think the answer generally is no nuclear weapons right now are useful for deterrence to stop other people from doing things, but it is, you hit an interesting point that, that when might you use them and see what many people may not realize is that the country has no.

Speaker 2:          21:39          Most people think the US has a no first use policy, namely we would never be the first ones using them. We don't write that because we said, well, what if not someone who uses nuclear weapons, but what if someone launches biological weapons? You know, shouldn't we be allowed to nuke them? Or what if someone nukes South Korea shouldn't be allowed to nuke and response? And so these are questions that you can debate. But uh, on the whole, the question is what, what do you gain versus conventional forces? And you know, other than active anger, right? If the act has already been done yet here, so the question is what do you, the idea should be to stop that in the future? Uh, not an and inevitably the problem is that under many scenarios, once you start using nuclear weapons, the, it proliferates and, and what's been pointed out by a bunch of his sister even bout 10 years ago, you may remember nuclear winter with Carl Sagan and that there was, that was sort of discredited a little bit, but in fact even at a limited nuclear war between India and Pakistan have 50 or a hundred weapons, which may sound like a lot, but it's the kind of thing you might expect in a nuclear war would, would raise enough basically dust in the atmosphere to for a decade affect agriculture.

Speaker 2:          22:55          Ultimately perhaps killing a billion people through starvation. So there's no such thing as a limited nuclear war. And, and it, and everyone, including the right wing guys like George Schultz and Henry Kissinger came up a bunch of years ago and said, we need to basically work towards a nuclear free world because as long as we have nuclear weapons, we're all at risk. So how do you untie that then from the legitimate parts of deterrent? If your argument is that deterrence is an important piece of the strategy, because might be by having deterrence, you don't necessarily have to fight a ground war. How do you untie those? Well, for example, well, how many you can ask right now? How many nuclear weapons you need to deter a, uh, an aggressor and you certainly don't need. We, the United States has $5,000 over the Russia. Russia, excuse me, I grew up in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 2:          23:40          You forgetting what year it is? Yeah. Yeah. I know Russia has Russia, another $5,000. That's, you know, we don't need 5,000 weapons to deter him. 100 nuclear weapons would be more than enough to destroy basically any country and, and dramatically affect the world. So maybe we could immediately go down to a hundred weapons will be indifference then ultimately for someone that's hearing you and saying, well if we haven't but we're not using, what's the difference whether we have $5,000 to maintain a fleet of a 5,000 weapons, including the infrastructure requires an incredible amount of money. Got It. So that alone, in fact, this $1,000,000,000,000 modernization gives you an example of the infrastructure costs. So there are economic costs as well as security costs. And if we decided rationally, you know what? It's better to know it. It's like if you have 10 cars that cost you a lot more money to maintain them, then if you have one, it's not just the cost of the cars.

Speaker 2:          24:31          Yeah. So as a theoretical physicist, when you talk about all of this stuff, you have an insight into how things actually work that the average person doesn't have. Do you worry that you'll ever stumble upon something or you know, somehow accidentally or maybe intentionally you find something and then realize how it can be turned into something horrific. I mean that's like the big apocalyptic. I he not happily what I, I'm always pleased to say that what I work on has no practical significance whatsoever. I heard you say that, but its origins and history of the universe and, and, and uh, you know, you can never. Of course, the great thing about science is you never know what's going to be discovered or what the implications so that I guess. But if you had to pick one area that had less direct practical significance, you, it'd be hard to find one that more than mine, which was where I try and understand how the universe began and how it's going end.

Speaker 2:          25:23          And these, these questions are incredibly important for us culturally, but the but the kind of new physics that we try and develop and understand affects the universe on scales that really are divorced from human scales directly. Obviously they, they relate to what the reasons. You know, how we got here. My new book, which I will plug called the greatest story ever told so far, the subtitles on March 27th, March 2017. And it's. But at the subtitle is called why are we here? And ultimately we want to understand those questions and unfortunately, religion tries to usurp those questions that I want to point out how science can dress them. So their fundamental sort of cultural questions. But, but I like to say, although it's pretentious, because I don't want to meet comparison, but my work is, the work by people like me is as useful as a Mozart symphony.

Speaker 2:          26:12          I mean, it's at its best at its best. It can be as useful as a Mozart symphony. It enhances the cultural experience of being human. Um, so I'm happily, uh, I'm not as worried about that, but on the other hand, what we need to do is for. There's an old expression, I think from Pesto, but it could be from later on. I never, I've tried to track it down at fortune favors the prepared mind and what we need to do or think about what the possibilities are. So we're prepared to act and we can't be prepared to act if we put our heads in the sand so we can say, oh, we should never, you know, uh, uh, do genetic engineering. But it's happening. We w we, so we can talk about artificial intelligence and say we need to, we need to stop that, but it's not going to be stopped what we need to do or think about the possibilities.

Speaker 2:          27:03          And that's one of the reasons why the origins project that run at Asu is so for me, so exciting because we try to bring scientists together to look at forefront questions, but then we have public events were 3000 people attend and listen. And the point is to, you know, you can't have a good democracy without an informed population. And, and so to try and raise these questions and get people to think about the possibilities are, will allow us to be better prepared for an, for surprising possibilities in the future because we don't know where the future lies. Uh, uh, I, I often say, and I said it on a film recently that I'm not. If someone tells you they're a futurist in my mind, that's when he stopped listening because I try not to make predictions about anything other than like 2 trillion years in the future because that's a.

Speaker 2:          27:47          What do you call that as a super future? Well, yeah, because first of all, no one will be around a test and it is much easier but, but, but we don't discoveries are called discoveries because there are surprises, but we can try and at least anticipate the set of possibilities so it will be a little less surprised and all of us can do that and that's why you know, you say I'm a scientist and I have access. It's true. I have access to some information people don't normally have access to, but the process of science we can all be at least have a perspective of what's happening and that's why it's important. That's why I spend time in the public hat trying to, trying to explain and explore science for the public, not just because it's interesting and exciting and it is. It's fun and people are fascinated by it, but because hopefully it will be useful when people try and confront the challenges of the 21st century.

Speaker 2:          28:33          Alright. So I want to spend the rest of this talking about your actual work and origins and stuff like that. But my last question on this part, I have no agenda but I know you don't. You've made it very clear which I love that. So. Well my last part goes to your public happy because clearly you're, you're willing to talk about politics, you're willing to, you know, speak about things freely. And as you emailed me, I have no no agenda or anything. Um, do you ever fear that that will have a professional cost just by saying things quite already? It does all the time, but I suppose to some extent, no, I, if I feared about that, I would've stopped a long time ago. I guess. Look, I think there's not a day goes by that I don't realize I'm fortunate in a way that people, for one reason or another want to listen to me, or at least I have a public profile and therefore I have a responsibility.

Speaker 2:          29:23          It seems to me to use that profile responsibly. And that means of course, to try and, uh, and, and, and, and popularized science in a way, but also to try and do what I can to, to have an impact. So in some sense, you know, it goes hand in hand with what I said to you about my work. My work has no practical significance whatsoever, but I'm, but as a human being, I'm very political on. I'm very interested in what's going on and therefore in some sense, maybe I make up for the fact that my work has no usefulness by take advantage of my public profile to try and, and do useful things. And one of the useful things can try and be leased to provoke people to think about these things. And so, uh, that's what I do. All right, so now let's, let's get into the work part of it.

Speaker 2:          30:07          Part that apparently has no meaning or no, it has lots of meaning but no significance. No one has significance in a global sense, in a cosmic sense and a in a, in a, in a, in a existential sense, but it doesn't, it won't cause a better toaster. Bob Built and you know, that's one of the problems with science is that it has practical utility. It's obviously not a problem because we couldn't be doing this show. We wouldn't. People wouldn't live as long as they live. All our modern society is based on the results science, but because science produces technology that changed our lives, people suddenly think that unless it's related to the technology, it's not an interesting. Whereas I say art doesn't produce anything practical so people don't expect them to say, you know what, that Picasso painting hasn't produced something that makes me live longer and, but, and so because science has that practical side, people forget the cultural side that they, the knowledge side and that's to me is as important as anything.

Speaker 2:          31:01          What I've, I've quoted a number of times and uh, but I'll quote it again here, one of my favorite statements from a guy named Robert Wilson who was the director of the first director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, which is a particle accelerator near Chicago, which accelerates particles to look at fundamental structure matter. It was the largest such machine in the world until the large Hadron collider was built in, in Geneva, but when it was being built, he was called by Congress to testify and he was asked will it aid in the defense of the nation? And he gave a beautiful statement, but at the end of it was basically no, it won't help aid in the defense of the nation. It'll just help keep the nation worth defending, uh, that, that actually is really beautiful. I think it is. So that's why I quote them. So that's sort of it.

Speaker 2:          31:45          It's a problem of funding things in a way because if you fund something, people want results and what you're saying is basically the whole playground. If science is entitled to that. And it's a real problem now in government funding and in the public. People seem to want to fund things based on, in fact, I wrote another piece on the House Science Committee, which basically wanting to require an did to some extent scientists in their grant applications to justify why what they're doing is in the national interest and the net doesn't necessarily have anything to do with science. Well, the point is that it seems to me the natural, the national interest is an increasing our knowledge and, and it's not in. And so if you, if you require things directly to have a practical application, then you're going to miss almost everything. You, it's already been well documented that probably 50 percent of the current gross national product of this country is based on fundamental curiosity driven research that was done a generation ago.

Speaker 2:          32:42          Accidents, you know, discovery of penicillin. They weren't looking for antibiotics. So even the development of transistor wasn't. If, if people had said we need to make better computers back at the time when they were using wheels and other things and they would have missed the use of transistors. So all of the things that have changed our lives, even the worldwide web, which was developed at at Geneva, the home of the large Hadron collider to help scientists communicate in large experiments when you have 10,000 scientists around the world, it was important for them to be able to exchange results without worrying about where the results were and being able to communicate. That's what developed the worldwide web. And of course that changed the world. So you need to support fundamental curiosity driven research. If you stop doing that, then not only do we suffer as a species by law, not our learning going not increasing, but ultimately the spinoffs that are going to change our lives are not gonna occur.

Speaker 2:          33:35          Yeah. So you mentioned Carl Sagan before and my, my scientific awakening was a little slow. I hate to admit it, I was always into Scifi when I was growing up and star wars and all that stuff, but my real scientific awakening, I saw the movie contact and I'd eaten pot brownies before and I thought I was going to see, I think air force one, but it was sold out. So I just went into, I had no idea what it was about, it didn't really know much about cross Hagen, but you know, the opening Panorama universe in my mind on pop round, he's, I mean, it exploded. I sensitive, right? Every Carl Sagan Book and all that. Kind of what, what was that moment for you? I suspect it was a lot younger than it was. It was. I was a little younger and a lot earlier because a lot older.

Speaker 2:          34:12          But I'm actually, you know, well I, I, it's hard. I'm not sure there was an epiphany in that way, but there was a. But the first thing I can remember was when I was in grade six, I'm reading a book about Galileo and um, and, and, and it seemed romantic and remarkable to me. The fact that he was the first one to look up that the moons of Jupiter and it changed everything and, and also the courage he had at or, or lack thereof at times to, to confront conventional wisdom. That seemed to me to be a romantic adventure that captured my imagination. And that's probably one of the reasons why write books is because it was books about him and then books by people like Isaac Asimov, well before Carl Sagan and George Gamma of and Albert Einstein, and then Richard, Richard Feynman books by people like that got me excited as a young person about the romantic adventure to be the, to to be the first to understand something new about the world.

Speaker 2:          35:15          And, and so I returned the favor and I'm old enough now that it's for me, very satisfying. Although a little depressing to think how old I am and what I mean. Scientists now say, you know, I read the physics of Star Trek and that's what turned me on to be with scientists. So, um, but it was those popular books and I, and that's why, although it takes time out of, out of my research directly, it, I'm not sure which is more useful in the long run. And besides I don't have control. I have to do what I have to do when writing. It's one of them, but, but it's very satisfying to be able to connect because the importance of a university or of the research enterprise is two fold. And that's one of the reasons why my origins project is twofold. University Research University should be based on the creation of knowledge, but if you don't disseminate the knowledge, it's impotent so it has to be to, to fold.

Speaker 2:          36:02          And, and so, uh, I like to be involved in both for some reason. Yeah. So the origins project, you're trying to figure out the origins of humans and the universe and we're looking at the origins of everything. It's [inaudible]. It's a wonderful playground because we look at everything from the origins of the universe to the origins of life to the origins of violence and, and, and, uh, uh, um, we're, we're having, we're having and the origins of the future, we're having a workshop, uh, in, in February and the AI and its challenges. So if you think about it, forefront questions, there's a relationship always between the future and the past. And forefront questions are always based about the origin. What's the origin of disease? What's the origin of of intelligence and so as a curious person, I can go well beyond just my area of physics, which tends to be more related to the origin of the universe, when which has gotten me into it, to all these other questions.

Speaker 2:          36:54          I'm like a kid in a candy shop. I get to meet and work with the most interesting people in the world and learn a lot about a lot of things. So it's just, it's really self indulgence, which is most of my life is based on, but it's bringing a lot of good to a lot of people. Me Self indulgence and individuality is good. Yeah. Well, you know, that's the other thing I guess I want to say is that most people become scientists not because they want to save the world. It's because they like doing it. It's fun and, and there's nothing and that's fine. I, I tell kids, that's when they asked me what they should do. I say, do what you enjoy because if you don't enjoy it, you're not going to do well anyway. But I do science, you know, it's great if it has an impact in one way or another, but I do it because I enjoy it and, and that and I and I am an unabashed about that.

Speaker 2:          37:40          Yeah. So I'm very proud that on this show, which I try to bring on people of all kinds of beliefs and political persuasions and all that stuff. I get tons of emails from religious people even though they know that I'm not a believer in that stuff, so we don't have to dive too much into the atheism thing. But can you, how about you give me the best sell job in like three minutes on, on the big bang, like just something that someone that, that is a believer of religion could say, well maybe there's something here. Maybe there's some. Well the point is it's, it, it, it's, it's, it's sad that I have to do that because. Did I leave too much with that question? Maybe I should untangled them. No, no, no. But I mean, one, it makes it sound like the big bang is on a different footing than the fact that the earth is round.

Speaker 2:          38:19          It's not the big bang happened. Same with evolution. It's not, you know, people get hung up in the word theory. Well, you know, someone just wrote me and said, well, you know, it's a theory. And I said, well, gravity is a theory too, so if you don't believe in walk up to the 10th floor window. But the point is a theory in science means it's been tested theories a very high level in science. It means it's satisfied the test experiment over and over and over again, and the fact that the universe began, that the universe was smaller than it is today and smaller and smaller and smaller and was once contained in a microscopic region. 13 point 8 billion years ago. That expanded dramatically is, is, is a fact. And it and everything we sit, we recognize about the university is only understandable in that context.

Speaker 2:          39:07          There are lots of independent ways to measure the age of the universe. And we come up with 13 point 8 billion years. We measure the fact the university expanding, working backwards, it was smaller than it is and if we extrapolate back and say what happened when the smaller we make predictions about things that we hadn't seen before, people say evolution or the Big Bang our historical science because no one was around. They offer. I mean no one was around to know, so how do you know? And I say, well the point is all sciences historical because all science is based on explaining some observations but done, but then making predictions of things that haven't been done and both evolution and the big bang make predictions about things that weren't seen before. If, if the big bang happened, we predicted it was predicted. Although a lot of sciences didn't know about it until after the fact that there should be a universal background of radiation coming at us.

Speaker 2:          40:00          That was once 3000 degrees in temperature. That's now three degrees. That's been measured with exquisite prediction. Exquisite precision. Sorry. And also we predict that 25 percent of the universe should be helium and almost 75 percent of the industry of the hydrogen and one part in 10 billion new universe will be lithium. We go out and measure that 10 orders of magnitude. So we make tons of predictions of things. That's what science is, not just a story like religion. It makes predictions and if those predictions don't agree with the observations, they're wrong. So we throw the, we throw it out like yesterday's newspaper. So the history, that word historical science, which a lot of fundamentalist use to try and discredit evolution, the big bang is nonsense because they're not historical anymore than anything else. They make predictions about observations that are gonna be made in the future.

Speaker 2:          40:49          And every observation we made about the university's consistent only with that picture and inconsistent with any other ideas. Yeah. So you would say the evidence that we have for the big bang is as much evidence as we have. The dinosaurs existed, right? It's just a different that we have physical. Moreover, we have evidence that dinosaurs didn't exist when humans, humans exist, no matter what they show in that is wrong, is that it's easy to say, yeah, I've been there. I would there the day it opened. And how you feel about that. It was a remarkable experience. I was there that they opened. I, I flew to Cincinnati and then into Kentucky on the other side. Where was that morning to lead to be the keynote speaker at a protest that morning. And then um, at, because it is, it, it's, it's that willingness. The Saturn, it's child abuse.

Speaker 2:          41:35          The idea is okay, they believe something and, and therefore they don't want kids to know what really happened. They don't want kids to know that evolution happened because somehow it might reduce their faith in God. And so the idea that you want your kids to not know how the universe works because for fear that the loser faith is no different than the Taliban when they won't teach the kids anything but, but memorizing the Koran and, and, and so it's, it's worse than ignorance. It's, it's, it's child abuse. So W, so I went there and protested and then I actually, I had credentials, I was a commentator for NPR and I went up to the right afterwards and they recognize me and they said, oh, Professor Kraus, your credentials didn't arrive. You can't go into the museum. So I said, that's okay. I happen to have a crew from pbs and, and BBC are that are following me right now.

Speaker 2:          42:22          Do you mind if they filmed me not being allowed in the museum? And then I got, I got a tour by at that time, the vice president of museum. And it was, it was, it was shocking. It's an amazing. They do a bait and switch. It was amazing. And um, uh, they start out quite upfront in saying reason and faith. They brought it in the front door, reason to faith why should, and they point out that the two are different and then they, and they, and they, and they are, you should believe in reason, you should believe in faith. And then, and then they halfway through the museum, they make it seem like a natural history museum. So they do this bait and switch and uh, but the, but it's hysterical because they have the garden of Eden With Adam and eve both politically correct.

Speaker 2:          42:58          Adam is in grass up to here and eve has hair down to their, but they have dinosaurs, you know, in the garden of Eden of course. And they trying to source wrecks, you know, is there, it's got sharp teeth. Why everything was a vegetarian in the garden of Eden. You may not have realized that but, but if you go to the museum will discover that and it's so they could open pineapples so they could eat. That's why the tyrannosaurs rex had sharp teeth. Wow. You know, I knew I was going to learn something. There you go with you here today. I'm glad that that will end up being. All right. We will. We only have a couple minutes left. I'm curious, do you find that you have colleagues that believe in everything that you just said there are, you know, everything that we've talked about, the, the ideas of everything you've said, but at the same time, are there some people that do take the leap of faith?

Speaker 2:          43:37          Oh, sure. Then believe in things that aren't quantifiable at the same time. Yeah. For the first, by the way we should say as scientists, we should never use the word belief. I know. No, I mean, I mean it's just. I fall into that trap to believing is not part of science is is it likely or unlikely, and that's the question. Yeah, but of course their religious scientists, but as I like to say, there are scientists who are Republicans. I mean the scientists, believe it or not, are human beings and human beings are in some sense hardwired to believe to mutually inconsistent things. At the same time, I often say that we all have to believe in impossible things before breakfast. Just to get up in the morning, you have to believe you like your job or your spouse or whatever. Yet we all invent stories to go by and so, uh, there are scientists religious as long as they don't let that religious faith interfere with their work, it doesn't matter and the good scientists so that way, but, but, but the, making the claim that there are scientists who are religious does not mean that they're compatible.

Speaker 2:          44:34          Neither does making the claim that science derives from religion because it does, I mean, but in the history of West, at least all of universities were once religious institutions because as I like to say, the 17th century, the church was the national science foundation was the only plate. If you want it to get money, then that was the place to get it if you want it to support your ideas. So it's not too surprising that science grew of religion. But as I also like to say and again to plugged set in the APP and to say it in the new book, that children often move away from their parents. Okay. And so, so talking about the background does not mean that that science and religion are compatible because they're not there. They're not compatible in the sense of being compatible with the specific doctrines of the world's great religions sciences and incompatible with a vague notion that there might be purposed to the university.

Speaker 2:          45:24          There is no evidence of it whatsoever, and there's no need for a god. As I showed in my last book, there's no need for even supernatural stuff to create a whole universe, but science can't disprove the notion of some vague datey. Okay, but what I can say is, you know the earth didn't stop when someone blew a trumpet and there wasn't a virgin birth and all of those things that's incompatible with what we know about the universe. All right? We have two minutes left is one thing that people aren't thinking about, that you were a theoretical physicist. You're thinking of something on a day to day basis that the average person is not thinking about. Give me something that we. Shots of things that we should be thinking about that we're not. Well, I don't know whether we should, but something something fun is that the m is the future of the universe.

Speaker 2:          46:13          Is is different than we might believe it might be. In fact, we may be living at a very special time in the history of the universe. And, and, uh, when it turns out that what we've just discovered about the Higgs Boson tells us that everything we see in the universe may be unstable, that that matter as we know it could not immediately. So don't go ahead and sell your stocks or anything, but that in the far future that not only we know the rest of the universe will disappear because it's already expanding away from us faster than the speed of light. At least it's receding from us faster than the speed of light. So the and, and so the longer we wait, the less we'll we'll be able to see if the universe. But it turns out that like an icicle on a window or on ice crystal on a window and a summer morning will eventually melt.

Speaker 2:          46:59          The Higgs field that is allowing everything we now see to exist could eventually melt in a different kind of way. And if it does, then matter as we know it will disappear. So we should enjoy our brief moment in the sun so it's not going to happen tomorrow. No, we're on the hairy edge of it. It may never happen and we, what we're trying to discover at the large Hadron collider is will it happened, uh, or, or might it happen? But even if it was, we know it's not gonna happen for a heck of a long time, so there's time to try and make sure we keep the present world working, which means we have to vote responsibly and ask yourself quit when you hear something on TV. It as, as a former publisher of the New York Times said, and I use as my mantra. I like to keep an open mind but not so open to my brains fall out. Alright, well that's a perfect ending. I hope you'll come back in March when you do a proper press tour and. Okay, that'll be fine then I can promote you again. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. It's good. And it sometimes works it occasionally or. All right. Well, for more on Lawrence's work working, there is a ton of it and he's written a gajillion books. I will put the link down to, uh, to the new book right below a checkout crowd.
