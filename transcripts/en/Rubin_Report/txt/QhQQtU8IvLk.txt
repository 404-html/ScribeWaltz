Speaker 1:          00:00:05       All right, we're doing a panel today and joining me is old, Grizzled Rubin Report Veteran and author of heavens on Earth, Michael Shermer and new returning champ. I'm giving you a returning champ. Read before you've even sat down here once author of the new book, political tribes, Amy Chu, and how are you? Great. Thanks for having me. Yeah, well thank you guys for coming in. And Michael, you set this up so I'm going to not let you speak for just a moment. I know you said up, you said the three of us should sit down and talk about a whole slew of issues, but amy, just so my audience can get to know you a little bit since they know a lot about Michael already. Just give me a two minute synopsis of who you are before we talk about the book and why.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Okay. Um, well, I'm a Yale law professor. Um, I, I'm principally by about foreign policy and democracy and ethnic conflict. Um, mostly developing countries. Um, and I teach at Yale Law School in 2011. Something crazy happened to me. Uh, and that is, I wrote in three months a memoir that I thought was going to be really funny and it was called battle hymn of the tiger mother and the world exploded. I created an international firestorm. Everybody hated me. I got death threats. It was sort of just at the beginning of people going bananas on twitter to exactly. And I didn't have those tools. I had no social media tools. I wasn't on facebook and I was just caught off guard and I became known as the notorious Tiger mother. And so in some ways this, um, this new book is, um, I, I got sick of only being known as the tiger moth.

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       I was on a TV show talking about Ukrainian nationalism, which I actually, I know about nationalism, I've written about it. And afterwards I saw the twitter feed and they were like, why does this woman that's tiger woman thinks that she can talk about nationalism? So like I did have a career before he goes, that's it, you know, I've lost control of the situation. So in a way the new book goes back to what I, what I actually know a little bit about. Well, I just want to go on the record as saying that as I am sitting next to the tiger mom, I feel an undue pressure to do this show correctly. Normally I can phone it in when I assure him here, but I feel a little extra credit. David Book is actually about my younger daughter rebelling. It's a huge book about. It's a rebellion but you'd like it people. The whole book is so wildly misunderstood, but it's. It's been. It's been fun. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       You do want to talk a little bit about some tiger mom stuff towards the end because I think there's some interesting things happening right now that we all kind of need a little bit more of that perhaps then the outrage machine thought a couple of years ago, but Michael, why did you think that this would be a good group to sit down together when he sent me that email now? Well, because the book kind of political tribes kind of set me back a little bit in the sense that I've kind of had this lifelong mission of spreading science and reasoning, critical thinking, and then after I'm reading

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       pinker's book, the better angels that inspired me to write the moral arc and and kind of go into this other direction of spreading, not just science reasoning, critical thinking, but liberal democracy, market capitalism and other social tools that can be measured in the same way that scientific things can be measured. And one of the things that I like about Steve's work is that he as a social scientist tries to tease out what are the causal variables that are influencing people to do this or that, you know, can we tilt the incentives to get people to be less violent by doing this? Rather than that? Exactly. Like any scientist would. So and so this idea, and I'd read all this literature about spreading democracy is a good thing and spreading capitalism is a good thing. And, and, and so, but as you show him political tribes, it's not quite as simple as I like to think in my head, if we could just go to all these places around the world and bringing liberal democracy, bring a market, capitalism freedom and prosperity, you will prosper. And it's quite. We'll have this global community, which is where I'd like to go. I mean, at some point we're going to be a multiplanetary species. We can't be fighting these little tribal battles on Mars or, or, or, but actually I think we might end up doing that if you're right, that in fact these tribal tendencies are pretty deep,

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       right? I like these things too. I love democracy and liberalism at capital, these enlightenment principles, um, but there's sort of no natural reason that they should have ethnically neutral implications, consequences. So democracy, you know, at some day, you know, uh, if you had a global democracy, but what, it makes perfect sense that democracy is going to empower the majority group, the one with the bigger numbers. That's just, that's just a number that's very scientific actually. Um, but similarly markets, this is when I coined the term market dominant minority in 2003. Um, we all started in different places. So just free market capitalism, even though it's fair in many ways by equal, you could argue that or we can have a huge debate, but there's no real logical reason that at any given point in a given society that though that free markets will benefit all ethnic or racial or all class are all religious groups equally. So once you acknowledge that you, like, you have these transition questions.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       So I thought maybe we should then with that in mind, start with something that's sort of happening right now that might help people frame a little bit of what all three of our political positions are. Because you, I know we've, I think the first time I had you on you, at one point you had said you're a libertarian. I think you've also kind of said you're a classical liberal. Then you've kind of said enough with the labels altogether. I consider myself a classical liberal tee shirt on you. I've seen you, I've seen you in the classical liberal tee shirt. That's right. Of course everyone knows that I consider myself a classical liberal, but I definitely like a lot of the ideas of libertarianism and I'm always sort of more drawn to that. If we were to put a label on just to start

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       before I get into the specific issue, I'm definitely not a classical liberal and um, I love classical liberals. But, um, I think that one of the things I pointed out in my book is that a lot of people are tribal who don't think they are. Right? So if he liberal cosmopolitans enlightenment people, you think of yourself as the opposite of pride because that was, came out of the alignment on anti religious warfare. And, but what I'm saying is where we are now in America or even the world, these, it be a liberal. Cosmopolitan is actually a pretty hard trying to get into my. First of all, you were very judgey tribe and you probably met a lot of different kinds of people to be so cosmopolitan. Um, you know, I was very struck and shamed myself. I'd have a student, I'm poor white person from the south who had never been on a plane, uh, and that was actually kind of startling because we, the first question some professor was asking, so I think that I'm, I like writing about tribalism because I'm very aware of its effects, you know, I'm the child of immigrant parents, but I'm very proud of my ethnic identity.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       Um, but I also love this idea of America as this umbrella, um, uh, uh, identity, so that it's a complicated answer, right? Because I guess as a real, you know, real liberals don't have an account of why even have the nation state that's how far you want to go down. Right? So patriotism and all this stuff. And My, presumably that's, that's, that's at best a transitional thing for you, right? Well, that's where I don't go so far. It depends how far you want to go down the road of freedom depending on how you find me a classical liberal ideas. There is some utility in the state. We just have to figure out what that is. And I would want it to be the lightest touch possible. But just to answer it in one, what I really am as I am somebody that loves about America, that it's, uh, it's, and it's very unique that this is a country that at once has a very strong collective national identity or at least did we can get to that and secondly allows individual subgroup or tribal identities to flourish.

Speaker 2:          00:08:08       Like you can be an Irish American or I'm Korean American, um, or I make classic liberal and possibly be very patriotic at the same time. I think that's a very unique thing about this country and that we're in danger of losing that kind of magic formula. Possibly. So I think you just described the melting pot, right? I mean, isn't that the secret sauce? Well, I melting pot suggests that everybody loses their identity like. And I think that happened very successfully with a lot of the northern European immigrants, but we've never really been a great melting pot. Like if you take the African American population, there've been many discrete groups that never melted into that pot. So I think part of it is a melting pot. Some assimilation for sure, but I think this common identity thing can, can coexist with a lot of different kinds of diversity. Some might be closer to the Canadian kind of mosaic thing. Um, but I do really believe that you need this connective tissue telling everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       So I guess it depends what analogy, like whether it's melting pot or mosaic or, but we've basically done multiculturalism better than pretty much everybody else. Do you mean

Speaker 3:          00:09:12       that's where you say, yeah. So the balance here is how can I maintain that, my, my local group identity, which is easy to do because I identify with people that look like me or live near me or whatever. That's totally natural and still respect others because there's some umbrella. And there previously when I was younger, I would have thought, well, we don't need a government government. You know, this can happen just from the bottom up. I've become a little more cynical about human nature being dark, uh, in tribal, in the sense that at some point you need some kind of rules to govern, say the marketplace to a certain extent, at least steer it. And that's why this, this cake baking thing is I just go back and forth. It's like, yes, yes, this, she should be able to bake any cake he wants. We're not in the battle days when people justified racism and know lunch counters and buses segregated. And at some point it took the federal government saying we're sending the troops in to set to integrate your schools even though they're down there in Alabama saying segregation forever. At some point sometimes you, you have to use force to get people at least to start

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       to bring them around. Right. Okay. So that is the one issue that I wanted to do up top before we dive into the book. So you. I tweeted out when when the decision was made that basically my feeling is that you have to offer. We have the civil rights act of 1964. I don't want to re litigate it. You have to offer products to every person regardless of race, color, creed and all of that stuff. But that if there is a specific artistic quality to it or a customization to it and that happens to go against your beliefs that you just don't have to do it. Whether I think that's abhorrent or not, you just don't. We wouldn't ask a, a satanist wouldn't be allowed to walk into a Muslim baker and say paint, you know, put my helmet on the cake. No one in their right mind I think would think that that's the government's job to force the baker to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       There's always do when we teach this and start spitting out the hypothetical. That makes complete sense what you said. But then they say, I think Justice Kagan might have asked how about a makeup artist, right? Can a make up artist refused to, to, to provide services to, you know, to gay people to, you know. So once you start pressing what counts as being an artist for photography, photography is a form of art or. Right? So that is the

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       interesting. So, right, so go grocery store bagging right the most. So it sort of a mundane task. We all go to the grocery to buy the products that are there and they're, all they have to do is put it in the bag and walk out if a, if a grocer, we're saying we're not going to bag groceries, groceries for black people, that, that is actually in violation of the 1964 civil liberties act. Um, but the. But the idea that we would force a specific product. You wouldn't want a, a Jewish painter. We shouldn't have to be forced to take commissions from a Neo Nazi or they tweeted out several other examples on this, but your fear basically where I think we don't quite see eye to eye is that eventually, if we don't do some of this, that things will devolve

Speaker 3:          00:12:18       that. Is that fair to say? I don't know. You might be right that in, in 2018, it's not 1964, so maybe we don't need such draconian laws historically when you. But also we needed those lows to reverse Jim crow laws, which don't exist in the battle days. You needed to send the federal troops into this to integrate the schools. Maybe we don't need to do that now. Maybe this one baker out of 100 will refuse to bake a cake. But as the, as the justices pointed out, okay, we're gonna protect, this guy's really just expressions. But if it turns out that every other baker refusing to bake cakes for blacks and gays and so on, then that we, that we can't let that happen. That may never happen. Yeah. What do you make of that? Part of the decision that struck me is like a really, like kind of slimy way out of this. Like, well, you're the law professor. You know why they did that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       I think, you know, it is, as everybody says, it's an extremely narrow holding. It's like a pundit just said that this particular commission was displaying hostility to religion in a way that couldn't make them impartial. So, um, I think that will be another decision. I mean it's, in a way it's just kind of kicked down, right? It just seemed like it had no teeth in that regard. Was like, why didn't you make. Yeah. I don't think it was an unreasonable holding, but I do think they, they just avoided the question. Um, you know, what I, I, I think is what worries me right now is the constitution was supposed to be the vaccine that sort of what protected against political tribalism and I know we're going to get to that, but what I see that's kind of dangerous and dismaying and the twitter feed right now is that, um, it's like tribalism as attacking of the constitution to, you know, it's not just something that we disagree with, but it's like there's a lot of demonization of the other side.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       Look, there are, if you teach the law school, and I'm not a con law professor, that's not my area. I teach contracts and you know, international business transactions. But one thing you know is there are hard cases and this is a hard case, right? You will have print multiple principals are different rights clashing or weird facts. And what would I think is almost more scary is you see people on the two sides right now. It's like if you think that a baker should be allowed to refuse to bake a cake celebrating gay marriage, then you're a bigot and homophobe. Right, right, right. But on the other side there, no. You know the it, it's like you're on the other side. If you are take the other view, then you are declaring jihad on Judeo Christian values and this is the is so ratched up and it's not good.

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       I think the main takeaway is spend less time on twitter. People are normal. Well that that actually is part of it because if you talk to average people, not not average. People don't even like that phrase. If you talked to the neighbor and everyone else in real life, they don't behave the way they behave on twitter. It seemingly has taken a hold of our entire national discourse. So let me ask you this then, because I do think most of these things become local. If there was a baker that did not want to to bake a cake for a for Chinese people or a whatever it is, how would you feel is the right thing to do?

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       Well, that's just a personal thing. I would just go to a different bakery, but that's what I wanted to. I wanted to make it personal. That's even saying that doesn't mean that I would, um, disrespect somebody else that did it. It's really just my approach to life, you know, like, well, I really wouldn't want that wedding cake.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       What is it that the only way really to respect freedom, I mean the freedoms that we have here is in your decision to either do something or not do something or, or go to a business or not go to a business or whatever. I was like, the only real way to broadly protect freedom is that it's Kinda Shitty, right? It doesn't, it doesn't feel great

Speaker 2:          00:16:12       and it could be, we don't need the laws now because we have social media. People shun that Baker on social media or, and not go to that store or if that's what you want, you do give them your, your business is that the market sort of sorts it out. That mismatch your point about the civil rights and needing force initially, like where do you get there? How do we get these? We didn't end slavery by by market forces. We took a walk and sometimes you allow a lots of people to do this. Can you get an regressive norm change? It depends on what you think about human nature. I think I'm similar to you. I believe my journal going back, I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:16:55       well I would. I always say I'm a world weary optimist that it's the only way that I could do this the way that I do it, but I look, I, I just don't think. I'm not calling for reversing, but just to be very clear, I'm not saying we should be litigated or reverse the civil rights act, but the idea that we need that in 2018 so that people aren't opening up white only businesses or anti gay businesses or bowling alleys that aren't for trans people are giving you a couple other good ones here. You know what I mean? Roller Skating rinks.

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       It's interesting. Going to the political situation. There are, there are some differences in America today because I studied American history. That's kind of what I've been looking at for the last hundred years and because of these big demographic changes that we're having now, so-called what with whites about to on the verge of no longer being a majority in this country, that's about 15 years. The numbers from 20, 44 to 2050. And then there are debates about whether that's the big had happened, but most people can see that even in Texas, in California, it's already happened. And um, again, the study's kind of show, I mean, this is going to sound terrible, but for most of this country's history, it was dominated economically, politically, and culturally by a white majority. And the result of that is lots of bad things could happen, but there's also a little room for generosity and it's a little right now with this demographic change about to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       Um, what I write in the book is that every group feels threatened. This is, you know, it's not just the minorities felt threatened, Whitesfeld threatened, um, Latinos, Asians feel threatened, you know, with the me too movement. Men feel threatened, women feel threatened, straighten it. So, and it's when people felt threatened that they retreat into tribalism and get more US versus them. So on this Baker thing, you know, you just never know, like we're, we're at a funny moment right now with are candidates running on like white nationalist platforms in a way that wasn't like in the last 50 years or openly at least.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       Right? So, okay. So, so granting you that. I guess what I would say then is that if that's all true and we maybe are about to get much more tribal and start seeing more outward racism and the rest of it, that perhaps even if we allowed those businesses to exist, that your answer is still the right one. The answer of use social media, use your influence, use your dollars. Don't live in a state or a town that is supporting these things like that. The experiment should still go on with the least amount of government. But I get why this is. So

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       for example, when you brought that up in the book about everybody feels personally as an atheist, I'm always amazed when he's born again, Christians go, we are a persecuted minority in this country. It's like, are you kidding me? Nine out of 10 of you were around me. You're the person that we really feel that you are. Well, I live in La. It's not so bad. But when I travel it's like, okay, well I am really in the minority here, but two, two quick things on sometimes the need for government for us, like the burning of widows in India. That was ended by the British colonialists that said you're going to stop doing this or else. And they said, but you have to respect our culture. And they said, all right, here's our culture. If you burn women, we build gallows and paying you. So you go ahead and build your funeral pyres and we're going to build our gallows and we can respect each other's goals.

Speaker 3:          00:20:19       And that put an end to it. And then in Papa New Guinea, jared diamond tells this story about, you know, rates of violence A. I mean, it was like a hundreds of times more than the natural background, but rates of violence even in the sixties and no one liked the violence, but it was just the result of these little local tribes. And finally the overall government, when they got some power, they said, all right, no more violence if you kill somebody at a vengeance or whatever. He took your pig and so whatever. We're gonna put you in jail and we're gonna lock you up and that's it. And, and, but, but most people were happy about this. Jared said, it was like, thank God somebody came in, the parent came in and said, stop fighting.

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       Right? And I guess I would say we don't live in Papa New Guinea and you don't live in British colonial India.

Speaker 3:          00:21:03       Maybe more of a local example would be in sports, like insightly. My sport, most cyclists don't want a dope, but there's an escalating like the game theory escalation thing where if you think everybody else's dope and you got to do it and what they really want is somebody on top say, okay, no more doping and we're going to test because they don't really want a dope, but they feel they have to dope. So you need some kind of structure. So stop cheating stuff, kill Ya. We don't want to cheat, but you know, but so you've got to tilt the incentive somehow, and I hate to say it, but sometimes that has to come from the top down a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       It's, it's very interesting. So right. Your book is called political tribes now. As you know, I'm a. I'm a believer in the individual. I think that the individual is the answer to stop bigotry and prejudice and all of those things because you won't look at someone as the member of a group and you owe black people think this or Muslim people think or gay people think this. If you look at the individual will wait until you know what they think. So sell me on the value of tribes. Actually, I'm just, the reality of

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       tribes grabbed reality. I'm closer to it. You think? I think we all need a big dose of individuals in this country right now. I teach on the college campus and I, you know, uh, that's what we're supposed to be famous for. White America is a bunch of Mavericks, but all, you know, I don't think these things are inconsistent. I do say that human beings, and this is not a me saying it first, but human beings are just biologically tribal. We need to belong to groups. Um, there are very, very few hermits. There can be individualistic, but there are not hermits, even monks to orders, they compete with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       Right? So there's very few sort of jd salinger's at the end in the forest, many of those.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       Right? Right. I bet that if there were a retreat for those people, they probably really get along and tribalism doesn't have to be bad. And in fact it can be consistent with a lot of individualism in sports. You were saying like, you know how, but that's a great example. Can you imagine somebody telling you to get stopped liking your favorite team? But I'm the and family it can be very tribal of what I'm writing about now is when tribalism takes over our political system and that is what is really dangerous because a feature of the kind of problems I'm talking about is you just want to stick to your side no matter what. You actually take pleasure in seeing the other side. Failure to sticking it to them. And by the way, I experienced this all the time, right? Um, if somebody hurts you, it's just human nature.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       Um, but we are, we have massive problems in this country right now. And as both of you have talked about, we're at a point where we just can't talk to each other. You know, Americans can't talk to each other anytime anything happens, whether it's a shooting or anything like, um, the, the, the case, um, I think even worse than I'm not, you know, you could say it's all Steve Pinker. It makes a great case. And I'm not saying that we're worse than in every way in terms of violence, but in terms of tribalism in the political sphere, I think this is an unusual moment. And partly that is, I think because of the demographic change, it's very dislocating. Um, and, and so I anyway, no will not to bring everything back to social media, but I'm still partly convinced that it's not just, I accept the changing demographics and I trumpism and all of those things.

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       But I still think, and I see this as I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson now and I'm getting back into stand up in a meeting people across, you know, from all the diversity that the left loves but across a true diverse set of ideas to who they want answers. And we're just not hearing from these people. I mean, there's a reason that the things that we're all doing are working. It's because we're fighting the forces of that. So for that reason, I'm an optimist and you know, when I had you on the first time, which seems like 18 lifetimes ago, and we were talking about the moral arc. I mean, that really was what you were selling me that thing. I mean it's, it's very similar to the pink or idea that things are bending in a good way. It's just harder to see it now perhaps.

Speaker 3:          00:25:10       Well, and also because we set our standards higher so that people say students in the sixties would be outraged by the Vietnam War. Now they're outraged by Halloween costumes

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       and that's actually good because it shows you where were the smaller thing that we're obsessed, right? It's awesome. There's a correction. I think that went too far. I think that's a good example of suggesting that what you are calling the market. I think we're seeing a correction right now, um, that whatever people think about the 2016 election, many, many, many people including elites were shocked and such. There's a lot of new thinking and even from the Halloween costume thing now, I think it's, I, I feel, I feel that there's a little bit you can't tell immediately you're still going to see the controversies, but I think there's a shift. Well, I think that's what's interesting because it seems to me that some of us in this intellectual darkweb or whatever you want to call us at this point, we saw this for the last couple of years of Matt's what drew people doesn't match. That's the confirmation for me that there is something bigger

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       growing here in identity politics thing is a problem because it feeds into the tribes, your chapters, a chapter on the trump phenomenon going through nascar and world wrestling, entertainment and, and, and it's like, I never really thought of those as tribes, but of course they are.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       Yeah. And I contrasted that and I can't believe I didn't get in trouble, you know, I teach at a very liberal school. I just wait, you're on the Rubin report is going to happen. Well, about the occupy movement, which, you know, uh, and again, I supported a lot of my students. I love my students. I have to say I am, I am, I am an independent. Um, and a lot of them are doing great things for justice. So I even think, you know, social justice warrior is again too big a term, you know, I think that's also the label, but occupy is a movement that I say was a movement ostensibly to help the poor that included no members of the poor. It was vastly up at an elite group, highly educated, all these postgrads. Um, and then, and yes, then I say, you know, actually a lot of the progressive elites don't, aren't aware.

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       In fact a lot of the working class white working class or any working class are actually very suspicious of a lot of the activists that are supposedly trying to help them. So that was an irony. And then I talk about so many of the poorer, including minorities belonging to the Prosperity Gospel, the irony there, praying for money, they want money, they're not trying to occupy. So. So yeah, that's part of the thing that a lot of thesis that a lot of elites in this country wanting to do well actually just aren't, are, are very blind to the group identities and tribal dynamics that matter most to, to just people on the ground. So to that point

Speaker 1:          00:27:52       was trump's greatest coup here that he was able to take the white working class mainly, but, but other groups do and break them out of their tribalism or even if you, even the Christian conservatives who voted for him at record numbers, I think, and still his support with them is through like 90 percent or something crazy that it. They didn't vote for him for tribal reasons because he's actually not one of them. Right. He was a rich New Yorker,

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       so it wasn't. Yeah. I think that he has done a into job. Well, I think he's done a brilliant job portraying himself as a member of their cultural tribe, cultural tribe as, as working white working class Americans. And I don't think it's all a show because a lot of group identification is aesthetic. It's an aesthetic. It's a matter of style and values. And in terms of the way that president trump dresses and stuffs themself on Mcdonald's compared to what, you know, not Vegan, it just looked donald and steaks and the suits, the world, the NASCAR and worldwide wrestling. Are these things that are right about these or not? I got, there was a negative review that said, oh, this fringe phenomenon. And I showed the numbers. These are NASA phenomenon, these are the Prosperity Gospel. These are millions and millions of trump's in the hall of fame were all arrested.

Speaker 2:          00:29:13       And so in my circles, you know, every time he said something sexist or racist, everyone was like, now he's gonna be out of the office. Nope. And that, the point is that people, actually, a lot of Americans actually identify with the way he talks and says something wrong or maybe lies and gets in trouble than he's called out, that they should, like, this happens to me all the time. That's how they feel. They don't feel like. So. So I think that he, he has established a, a, a cultural tribal connection even though. Yes, he's is. And that goes to the other thing. I think a lot of elites, um, I've been doing some research into this. The socialists include a lot of people who attend our top universities. Um, there are a lot of, um, working class Americans have, whether they're Latino or African American white who actually, um, would love to hit it, make it big, would love to enrich, to have a big building and have a nice car. So there's a lot of irony in end in who was championing what and it's actually very, very fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       Yeah. So it's just tribalism, tribalism of a different sort. I suppose. So it's like all these rappers years ago were rapping about trump because they liked all of the gold and the blaming and the branding and all

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       that's tapped into lots of different strands. Of course there was a racial thing that he was able to tap into to, but there was a lot of stuff there.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       Wait, I want to just slightly jump back to this, to this liberal tribe that thinks that it's not a try because that seems to be the group that I'm sort of most personally frustrated with. I go after you get a lot. Well, I guess so that probably has a lot to do with it. I'm not denying it, but just accusing you of being in a tribe and they're not in a tribe, but that's not true. So I guess that's what's driving me crazy about this is that they constantly are telling you, you know, that I'm totally talking about the New York Times elite sort of. I lived on the upper west for 15 years, so I like a lot of these people personally, individually of course, but that set of people that think that everyone else is this thing and that they are actually the ones who have saucy while drinking the New York Times.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       I, I really do think that all of us are tribal and that is definitely a tribe a. and it's even by like, if you take like anthropological or social scientists definitions, you know, in terms of what you eat and your values and your self perception and you know, people vacation all the same places. Um, no, it's, it's, it's definitely a tribe. And you know, I, and I'm, a lot of them are. My friends are in that tribe and it's very, it just because it's one thing I say is a lot of progressivism is actually, it could also be doing great things, but it is also really fun. It's an identity formation, you know, people go, like, occupy was a very, um, it gave them some solidarity. It was a fun feeling of them. A lot of the marches. I think people are going to get a lot of the politics while, because they keep measuring the size of the crowds everywhere, the size of the protest. And I think that's, I don't know, I think people have to watch out because that's, I think if you just look at the size of the crowd, you're like, oh my gosh, I see what the is going. But maybe those are areas where the whole. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       So, so when you were reading Amy's book as someone that's sort of tracked moral progress through time, um, do you think there is a right amount of tribalism that allows us to be the best we can is as people in society?

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       Well, I your epilogue talks about how to break through some of that, which I liked because there's a lot of social psych there. How can we quit thinking of each other in that way? But the other bigger issue on the spread of market capitalism say that you identified these a market, dominant minorities. I had no idea this was happening in Vietnam and I just binge watched Ken Burns's, you know, 18 hours of the Vietnam war and I, I don't remember anything about the 10 percent of the population over 90 percent of the

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       companies. As relates to your point about this is something funny. I keep getting in trouble for every book that I've written about the taboo for reasons that I think are silly. I don't think they should be terribly. So I coined this term of 2003 a market dominant minorities and it refers to small, usually ethnic minorities like the three percent Chinese in Indonesia. Just three percent ethnic Chinese who control 70 percent of the economy. Now what I wrote that I think the instant us liberal progressive responses. Wait, how could she say that? It's like she's got to be stereotyping. She's, but I just documented it

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       even though it can also be argued that that's a positive stereotype because it's through work and education and all sorts of questions.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       So comfortable with any group, acid make generalizations. Um, and I was saying, look, if we're going to ever solve these problems. So it also, when I even say whites in South Africa about 14 percent controlling, you know, 80 percent of the best land. So even the reasons for being a market dominant minority can vary. Sometimes it can be a history of colonialism or apartheid. So, so nobody celebrating it necessarily, although groups like the Chinese or the Indians or the Lebanese are harder to explain because they were non colonizers. So yes, this is a phenomenon that fits, um, it's, it, it's, it coexists in a complicated way with these enlightenment forces. Um, because you want would be nice if, if, if markets just just benefited all ethnic ethnicities, Ito.

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       But what, what does this tell you about how we treat victimhood? Really? So the example I can use, we do, and you just mentioned this about the three percent Chinese. It's like when, I'm sure you guys saw this a couple months ago when this documentary came out about Apu from the simpsons. Yes. And I saw night 90 percent of what I saw online. And again, it's just what you're reading online was actually no, he was a good character. He's beloved by everybody. He's actually the hardest working guy in the town. He's one of homer's good friends. They did an episode on on immigration because of him, you know, he's a Vegan at all. All of these wonderful things. Indian Americans I think are the number one socioeconomic group in the country are pretty damn close to it. I think their average median incomes, six figures or it's a great measure of success in all of these things. And yet I saw this sliver of the people that I'm frustrated with, this sort of elite, lefty, whatever you want to call them, progressive's demanding that this victim hood should exist. And that to me is the root of. So much of our

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       tribal problems are about forgetting your successes. Yeah. I, I, um, well, first of all, I just, again, just personally I understand where the people are coming from, but personally I, I, I, I just don't like the victim put thing. I think it's also psychologically very difficult waiting and you get this oppression Olympics where you're, you know, your who can be lower, you have more problems. Um, but on this, without getting, because I have had a lot of south Asian friends say that they were very upset about it. To my surprise, I try to understand and I wonder if there's a big generational thing, which is partly, it feels bad, but it partly what makes America great. Um, you know, my dad, when I was young, my dad was immigrant and get a Chinese accent and I would see him being what you might call discriminated against somebody, like whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       And I would feel so bad. I'd be like this eight year old kid and just feels so shameful and so angry and think my dad didn't even notice, you know? And then later had mentioned to my dad and he's like, this is such a great country. She's thinking, I came from, I came from and I'm going to rise and, and, and, and he just made it the American dream. But, um, so I, I often in, you know, as an older person now I see very generationally, I think I, I bet if you asked an older generation of, uh, of, of South Asia, it's about that I wonder if you might not get a difference, whereas you get the children or grandchildren of those immigrants and they're in a very different mentality, educated in our campuses, much worse than you know. Uh, so that's, that's really what you're talking about when you talk about the Halloween costumes, right? That the arc here has meant so much that you can actually put aside all of the successes and then to just be upset by a cartoon character. So this is, again, it's a net good.

Speaker 3:          00:37:27       I think it's important to that good, but, but it's fine tuning younger people's intuitions to go toward smaller and smaller, uh, assaults on their ego or dignity or whatever that they then elevate into these massive, like this is the equivalent of slavery, rapey and the environment is the equivalent of rape or whatever, you know, it's just elevating the, these words in things that they can get worked up about because we do have a, a moral module or network or whatever in our brain that we get worked up over things and whether, if it's the Vietnam war, okay, but now it's the Halloween costume, but it's the same emotions that are still being driven. And that's another problem with these tribalism, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:38:07       maybe the moral arc. Maybe again, I'm an optimist too. Um, and I think something is changing after 2016. I have many. I quote this guy, Giovanni, extremely progressive student, um, Latin American parents from Mexico lived in a trailer park and he saying, I think we went to bar week stop on this Halloween costume. The line he uses is that crying wolf too much. Right? So that when you get serious and um, so, so I actually think there's some correction, not everybody, right? There's still things that um, are just, just a waste of time, you know, we have serious, serious problems and um, but, uh, but I think there is some sense even even among this group saying, you know, maybe this is not the best thing to focus on.

Speaker 1:          00:38:53       Well, what do you guys make of the fact that this seems to be global right now? That I know that because of technology, that this movement, whatever, whatever's happening here now where so many people are waking up to the overcorrection or whatever you want to call it, that the amount of email that I get from people that are seeing this in India is what I'm getting from people that are seeing this in Canada. That, that tells you something really interesting happening despite the differences in the political histories. And, and, uh, you know, the political establishment of those.

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       It could be a selective focus because of social media and realtime covering of these incidences. I do wonder to what extent the problem really exists on college campuses of the this campus craziness like Chapman University where I'm at, I'd never seen anything like this and, and, and, and most of the time when I travel and give talks at colleges, you never see anything. It's just people just students are hunkered down doing their thing. I got to bring you to University of New Hampshire next time, changed your opinion on that pretty quick. They shaking or something that's made, but it could be that the minority, it's a minority, but they're loud and they're instantly covered now. So it seems like Tucker Carlson in his weekly campus craziness. It's like if I walked on campus, I wanted to see riots going, well, no, you don't hardly ever see anything. So there's this idea of pluralistic ignorance or the spiral of silence where a minority can take over.

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       Toxic ideology can take over a country like Germany in the 19 thirties were probably. Most Germans were not on board with Hitler's program, but they thought everybody else was and there's punishment for descent. So you get the spread of these toxic ideas. When actually most people, like most college students, will it privately say I'm against binge drinking, I don't want to do it, but, but they, but they think but, but I know all my friends are into it so I do it, but everyone says that that's what I'm more concerned about. So I want to know about your experience on college campuses

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       because I find when I go there and I'm usually invited by, it's usually libertarian groups are saying in a center, right or something. Right now it's College Republicans and I, as I always say, I would gladly do it if the Democrats would invite me and I'll get the same exact speech. Um, but what I find is that even for Libertarians who basically just want to live and let live, they're finding they're afraid to say what they think. So it's not that all of the kids are screaming and doing violence, but I'm more concerned about that secondary set of students that at college is afraid to say what they think because you're not going to get out and suddenly start telling the world that you think.

Speaker 2:          00:41:26       This is a great irony though, because for the Libertarians, the, I think you need strong leadership.

Speaker 1:          00:41:32       Yeah, no, they were doing could do a hell of a lot better in that department.

Speaker 2:          00:41:35       Like even for the campus. I think somebody, you know, like I, um, I, I so agree with you Michael. I think that it's, um, this is a positive thing. I think. And again it's both sides, you know, um, and it's, it's the loudest voices and then there's a lot of bullying and shaming and I've talked to so many students one on one or even like even in my own classroom I'm, I'm pretty well known for having one of the most diverse, actually maybe the most diverse class, but not just ethnically and racially, although that too, but I had 15 members of the federalist society, you know, in addition to 15 members of the black students association and Non Muslim Americans. And admittedly it wasn't constitutional law. It was, it was a class that was a little bit, not as charged now, but I still talk about democracy and an ethnic conflict and all these issues.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       The 2016 election. But I set the rules, you know, like, you know, I just said these are the rules for this class and you there's, there was a wait list so don't come if you can't do this. But if somebody for this particular conversation, I know it's going to be difficult, but if somebody says something and they don't quite use the vocabulary that you would use or they say something that maybe offense you for this, just this class, I'll say, can you just not assume worst motives? Just assume that they just. Can we just add, I, I can have success with it now. It's not easy. And I've seen like, you know, even our dean said these are free speech norms. You can protest, anybody can protest, but you can't. They have to be allowed to speak. So I think leadership, I think there's been a lot of cowardice

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       for this. So you're selling me on in this instance on a ton of top down version of this that you think it has. I basically, especially at a college campus, I do agree with it because you can't, for lack of a better phrase, you can't have the inmates running the asylum. These kids are supposed to learn there and there have to learn by people that are smarter than them. So in this case, I am okay with some top down.

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       Yeah. I, I think, um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       have you had any pushback against that though? Because I'd imagine that's got to be hard pill to swallow.

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       Not the Dean our Dean has. Yes. And if they're always hard cases, they're hard cases and um, uh, uh, I've do, you know, yeah, I get in trouble all the time, but, but I not terrible trouble, you know, I think maybe it's because I'm a minority woman to uh, not everybody is going to be

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       you using identity politics against a very clever.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       I don't even get used it. I just like, you know, um, and I definitely know what it feels like to be an outsider of your first question. You know, I'm, I'm, I, I've always had a lot of classical liberals try to speak for me. So, uh, so I, I really kind of get it. Um, but, uh, yeah. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:44:13       well you identify as a minority woman, don't you? I've been feeling that more and more. Yeah. So, um, the other thing about reading your book though was how, um, our state department did not seem to get these, these tribal conflicts in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, does no one call a professor at Yale and go, hey, we're thinking about this is our strategy. What do you think? So when, when I was reading that, I kept thinking of, do you remember during the 2008 election, so Obama running the first time during the primaries there having the debate, the democratic debate, and Joe Biden was still running at the time and they're all talking about Iraq and Joe Biden goes, you know what, actually, Iraq should be split into three countries because there should be a Sunni country and a Shia country and a Kurdish country. And because this, this tribal stuff has been going on way before us, way before the bread from the Ottomans and blah, blah, blah. And people thought he was completely bananas. Now I think there's probably plenty of other reasons I think he's been at it, but putting that aside, he was getting to the heart of what you were saying.

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       Yeah. And I don't know if that was the right solution, but yes, absolutely. And you know, this is interesting. This half the book is about our foreign policy fiascos and how it's our us blindness to these. Again, these, these, the force of identities that we barely know anything about Sunni Shias current kind of the same or, or Afghanistan, Pashtuns, Uzbeks, whatever, you know, um, Vietnam, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, all the same. Um, and it's amazing. It is something that I have not gotten in trouble for this because it's a lot of very critical chapter saying that our greatest foreign policy disaster stem from this one thing, our failure to see that, that there, there's this, this, these tribal identities that um, uh, we imagined that democracy will just smooth and away, but just have some elections and everything will just kind of melt away or markets. And what I show is that democracy under a lot of circumstances actually catalyzes those group conflicts. It gets worse.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       Are there moments though that for whatever reason, either because of war or famine or something else that actually we can get past those things. So like for example, things actually were going pretty well in Iraq after they had their elections, um, you know, at, toward the end of the George W Bush for getting, whether we should have gotten in there or anything like that, but they were actually having free and fair elections. It sounded like he was getting a little more secularized then we left and okay, so be it. But then things got reversed, but we actually built out of the chaos. We started doing something good and now, now,

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       yeah, I, I tell a slightly more detailed story than that slight disagreement. I think we are really messed up the democracy bit when we first got in there. And I think actually most of the key players say that now, you know, like secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice said, you know, we should've paid more attention to the tribal structures. Um, and worked with that. What you're getting at is I write about a success case and this is the 2007 search. Again, putting aside politics that's gotten so polarized, but most Americans, they even know about it, know that we put it in more troops. What they don't know is that it was a 180 degree change in our foreign policy. The people in charge said, let's pay attention to the groups now let's go talk to some sheets, and she used to, and by the way, they educated their troops like here's the difference between them. Here's what they were, here's what they eat, your their ceremonies, and they really turned it around it and I document all the numbers within at a point when things were so bad, they brought sectarian violence down. They brought suicide bombing casualties down, and then yes, at that point us lost its political wealth. We've left

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       politics really just straight up mess it up, right? Because things were getting better. They had real life

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       is it shows that if we do, again, the weird optimist in me, I think that we have done so many things in our foreign policy so foolishly that we can really do so much better. We just have to pay a little bit of attention to these groups, which are what people raised it, it, that that's the first thing they hear about. Um, and by the way, the reason for this is something also I think positive. Well, why are we so blind to it? Because I contrast us to the British, the British, and they're divided in rule. Um, they were incredibly group conscious. They had these huge documents detailing all the different caste differences and they used it to divide. I mean, they, they, you know, that's not what we should do the opposite, but I think it has to do with our own extraordinary success with assimilation. You know, we have an, of course, not every group but more than any other country we, you know, the idea is if Irish people and Italians and Hungarians and Polish can all become Americans within one generation, let's have some election because Sudanese and she isn't currently and it's, it's other countries are not like us.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Yeah. So if, let's say, if there is a movement building right now and some of these enlightenment values are coming back, there is, there is. I'm with Ya. All right, so let's say there is a movement building. What do we have to do as people that are part of it or want to build something good to avoid the negative parts of tribalism that will inherently come along with it.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       Well read, read Amy's. It ends positively about, here's some of the things we could do. I mean just, I call this the Indu who effect from that Jack Nicholson's film about Schmidt where he told us he adopts a child watching late night TV. You know, if you give $15 a month, this will help little Enugu and they show a picture of indiegogo. Now, as we know from studies that if you show a picture of 10,000 starving kids in Kenya, people give a dollar. If you show a little indigo, you're willing to give you 100 times more than that, so it's tricking the brain into thinking little Hindu who is an honorary member of my tribe and so that kind of we know how to do that from fundraising and so on. That has to be applied. I think politically that you know you have to identify with these people. As you pointed out. You know actually when you actually know a gay person or a black person or a Jew or somebody like this, that's not your normal tribe. That does break down those tribal barriers. Your colleague Paul Bloom and his book against empathy points out that the dark side of empathy. If we're, if we're super cooperative

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       and supportive of our tribe, that makes us even more wary of other tribes because they can be a threat to our people that we liked so much and so we have to break through that. Acknowledged the tribalism, but also counter. It comes back to your favorite work individually because those studies that are really positive at the end show that if you can pull people out of their groups and by the way not just dumped them altogether to more hating of each other, but if you can interact with another person as an individual, which of course is the whole hard part, it's astounding how much progress you can make. The best example I like is the integration of them, US military in the 19 fifties, everybody was against it. So it was like 80 percent and this can't work. And afterwards they found that the integrated troops were as, or more effective than the all white troops.

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       And then they interviewed everybody and it was just kind of your point. They were like, you know, if you're in a foxhole, you, if you miss your family and the same way you have to put your life in somebody else's hand, you don't care what their accent is or you don't care what the color of their skin is. And that was like an actually an incredible, uh, cross pollinating moment. Alright, so let's shift a little bit here for the, for the last little bit here. So I want to talk about some tiger moms stuff because I do think that partly what I'm seeing right now is I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson, is not that he's Tiger Dad, but he's filling a role of something like that. So it's not necessarily as outright aggressive as say tiger mom would be, um, but he's fit. He's filling some role there.

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       Do you think that's sort of fair to say? So funny that you said that because obviously it's an incredibly polarizing figure, but when I watched a few things and read a few chips, that's what it reminded me of. You don't, it's kind of, you know, one of the things I said in target mom was assume strength rather than weakness in your children. Um, and I got a lot of trouble for saying that, but what's the pushback on a statement like that? Like a, Oh gosh, you know, all these mental health issues that I've gotten a lot of trouble with Jeff. It's a first of all, um, what is tiger parenting? Right? I mean, and it is really true that a lot of Asian Americans have parents that are too stifling and too strict on both sides and they make their children miserable and people have committed.

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       So I mean, it's trust. It's a parenting is one of those things that affects everybody because not everybody has a child, but everybody had a parent. So it's always personal. But I think there is something, um, because I, you know, I was, I didn't understand why I was in the middle of this firestorm either. Um, and it's, it's interesting because you're in this moment, you're experiencing it and people would ask me at the time and at the time I had no idea at the time I was just trying to defend myself. I was stumped. Somebody told me to stop apologizing, you know, that I just kept saying I didn't, I was supposed to. It's just a memoir and you're misunderstanding. And finally I just decided to own it. Okay. I, it is just a memoir that's true, but I'm a proud strict mom and then things got a little bit better.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       But I think somebody, one person said, you know, amy, I think that if the book had been about like a strict Italian mom or strict Romanian bomb, nobody would have cared. It was at that moment that I hit fear of parenting and fear of China at the exact same moment because that was when all these, those test scores came out and the US this great superpowers, like at number 30, eight, China, Singapore, and they were all like one, two, three, and it was going to, they're going to eat our lunch. Um, and, and I think also

Speaker 3:          00:54:05       Greek tiger mom would have been more okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       It's, but going to your point, I think it did fill. People said it touched a nerve. It's often where there's something missing already. Like people need something. There's a vacuum, something's off, the pendulum has swung too far. Um, and then you, this random thing comes in, fills a void. So I think it could be a slightly similar phenomenon.

Speaker 3:          00:54:29       A quit apologizing in a way that's what Jordan is saying on some level. Quit apologizing. Just be who you are, set the rules and have goals. And don't apologize for it. And there's a lot of people going, yeah, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to be successful and I'm not gonna apologize for it. Yeah, that's right. You shouldn't have to do that. What do we do about that set of people though? That is just looking to take everybody down because I that that's part of the overcorrection crew, but they're not going to just go one. They don't want to. Restorative justice. Social justice is not restorative justice. It's the Old Testament. Retributive justice lives must be destroyed. You know, you have to go down and grovel and then we're going to destroy you. Yeah. Well that's why our friend people goes and he calls it a this he calls this social justice thing or this idea of a secular religion.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       Yeah, it is. That's what I believe it is. Yeah, that's right. Original sin, your, your white male, whatever. And there is no. There is no restorative justice. You just have to be destroyed. So what can we do? It's, it's a hard solution. Push back and just say, no, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna apologize. Uh, you know, if I do something wrong I will apologize, but I'm not gonna apologize for something I didn't do or who I am. I'm a white male. I, why should I apologize for that very quickly. When you made the decision not to apologize anymore to stand up for yourself, how quickly did it all kind of stopped? Because I think that's what a lot of people that are watching this are wondering. They're afraid to say anything because they don't want to just get caught in that meat grinder. So I want to show them instances of, because every one of us that has stood up and said, we're here, we're not just going to bow to you. We've made it eventually. I'm not

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       a huge fan of this. I'm not exactly sure what these apologies accomplish. I think in a way I, again, I, I, I see things through a tribal leds, right? I think that's like a, like a, it's a victory. It's a point. It's like, trophy, I got an apology. I'm going to extract this. Um, it, um, it was more of myself to, um, uh, to, to just kind of say, wait a second, I've made a lot of mistakes if you actually read the book, who realize it's about my younger daughter rebelling and it's funny and there whatever, unreliable narrators, but you want. I'm actually pretty proud. I'm pretty proud. Standby everything. And um, yeah, I, I think it's hugely empowered, hugely empowering psychologically. Um, but you know, to play devil's advocate on the bigger picture, I think we all need to elevate ourselves because I'm sort of in a different camp than you guys.

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       Like I'm looking at the country inn where and as the optimist, I feel like we all. And I, that's why I admired Michael so much. Like it's hard to recognize yourself as being somebody that's being tribal or whatever the US versus them always. And what I have noticed because this happened to me is one bad thing happens to you because we've all had this some just terrible attack, very cruel thing, incredibly unfair. And it's human nature. I get so angry at the other side, right? And rightfully so. I think the warning I would have is how many people do put in the them category. I think we should all narrow that, make it smaller, you know, because there are these big labels and people do it on all sides and I even do it. I just get so mad at this massive pool of people that I think of as my enemies because something horrible just happened to me, you know, it was something incredibly insulting or this terrible stuff that I get on twitter. I mean, we all get the hate. Um, and it's so easy just to hate back I think. I think that's the hard thing. So actually I think he narrowed the enemy.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you listen to conservative talk radio, oh my gosh, it's just so polarized. I mean, every other word is, you know, the liberals, the left, the Lib, tards yards, uh, you know, the New York slimes, the Washington composed, that's pretty quickly. My wife calls him the screamer. She's Germany's, are these people in the radio screaming? It's like, that's what gets ratings. Apparently they're just as bad as the people on the left. India, we, yeah, we have to stop doing this, that the principle of charity just be charitable to the person you're talking to. You don't assume you know, because they slipped up and used this word instead of that word. Therefore they're Hitler. No more reductive ad hilarity. You have to stop that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       So do you think it's possible to wrap this up on a nice boat and use a little of our optimism here and a little of you or moral arc here that the exhaustion with all of this, enough of these conversations that actually clearly are breaking into the mainstream at the moment and all of that will lead to a sort of political realignment where it seems to me that I would argue at this point we basically needed trump even though I didn't vote for him, we needed him for this now for years of just upheaval and fertile ground and ideas and people realigning their thinking and strange alliances and all that. But that what we can get. We don't need another trump after. I don't think if, if everything actually goes okay, we will actually be okay with something decent again, but we needed the thing to be shook up before we could get there.

Speaker 2:          00:59:34       Yeah. I'm an optimist for the say I, I think, um, and it's very hard to say people are so angry. So there was, it's also possible that it's completely the other way. For sure. Yeah. You know, it's funny. I'm also, we started with the masterpiece cake thing and I said I'm not a college professor, but I, I've been giving talks a lot of places. And the question is, is there another, is there a model? Is there a country that you've studied that could be the model for us to get out of our political tribalism? And actually this is actually could even get me in trouble because it's. No, no, but I just say we're the model. We are the bottle we. And it's not that we're per, oh my gosh, you know, we have made so many mistakes that we're in a very bad moment in many ways, but we have the apparatus, we have something special.

Speaker 2:          01:00:18       This thing of that I call the super good context, um, our constitution, of course we have repeatedly failed to live up to those ideals, but the ideals are there and this is an ethnically and religiously neutral document. Again, not the way it's played out in reality is always the, our ideals have always exceeded our reality. So it's an aspirational country. It's an aspirational document and this is why we come full circle, you know, I think we're worthy. Enlightenment experiment. Yeah. I never thought, and this is where maybe I was not somebody that you remember in the late nineties when the Berlin Wall came down, it was like, we're going to be one world, maybe Saudi Arabia and Turkey will join the EU. That navy, the United States will join the EU. I was always like, never too big. So I'm still a little bit of a tribalist I think that I think the world at this point is too big a unit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:15       Well you use figuring out that for countries that are in Europe. So. Right about. Yeah. But I'm really glad that that'll be a good place to wrap this, um, that you mentioned he's aspirational documents because as you guys can see through our window, right in there in our control room, we've got an American flag in there, but also what you can see, maybe you can see it. Amy's, I just got these two huge print giant print of the declaration of independence and a giant print of the constitution that I was given at a, at a speaking thing that I did for three turning point. And yes, we haven't always lived up to those things, but if we could get back to that, that's why I care about these things. I'm always tweeting about these things and when I'm in D, c, I go and I take pictures of all these things and put up, oh, this is what Thomas Jefferson said, that they've given us the blueprint. It doesn't mean that they were perfect. It doesn't mean that we've always done it right. But this idea that someone do it better than us for as bad as it may seem, we're not killing each other in the streets right now. Yes, there is. They're unjust murder. Yes. Is there just this or that, but it's still pretty damn good. If we were going to bring it home schermer well, I mentioned being a multiplanetary species when we call an Eis Mars

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       and we're going to do it. You know what? We got to set up some kind of government, some kind of economic system. What? What documents would you bring? Yeah, the declaration of independence and the constitution that that would be the place to start. Maybe they'll tweak it and experiment and then it'll get a little bit better or worse, and then we can look at that as an experiment and go, okay, here's what we should do here, but that also, that perspective also gives us that Sagan esque Pale blue dot look back at the earth and go, oh, there are no borders from Mars is just this blue dot and maybe that'll change our perspective. A little bit about the tribal nature of our species.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       That's actually a great idea. Maybe my new argument when people are telling me how horrible America is, it's like, you know what, if we were on a Mars tomorrow, we're going somewhere tomorrow. You got a better document that to start us off with and I'm pretty sure nobody would have something better. No, you know, they probably wouldn't know what to say, but that would be. That'd be great. I know you could do something to finish this up strong. That will bring us into the future and into outer space and all that. Well guys, this has been, I mean this hour. You by. This has been a pleasure. I am A. I am demanding that you come back for a one on one and shermer. I'll do this one more time. It's been a pleasure guys, and we're going to link to a Michael and amy's websites and books and all that good stuff right now below.
