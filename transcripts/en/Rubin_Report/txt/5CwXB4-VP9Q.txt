Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Joining me today is an author, a screenwriter, the host of the Andrew Klavan show, and one of the few same people on the Internet. Andrew Klavan. Welcome back to the Rubin report. Thank you. It's nice to be here. I love your new studio. Thanks. Well, you are one of the last guests before we built this home studio, and we had you on at a very odd time because it was right before the election, but we were going to air it after the election because I had to pad some shows because we were, we were building this. So I, and perhaps you too, when on the assumption that Hillary was gonna win and a, and then people immediately after we heard it said, you got to get Cleveland back on because you guys got to, got to clean this whole thing up. So you're ready to do some cleaning?

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       I'm ready. I'm here. All right. So where I want to start first is I do consider you one of the few sane people that I, that speaks ill of view, but I consistently, every time I watch one of your clips or I see what you're tweeting about, you strike me as just, you basically striked me as decent, which these days I think has a correlation between decency, insanity. Uh, that's a lot of pressure I'm giving, you know, is right. It is sad that being decent actually elevates you heard these days. But if, but you know, it, it's the thing with me is that I have, I can say I can state with my principals are I can I fall, I tried to follow my principals and I try not to get too mixed up with personalities, which in this day and age with a president like trump, with like the people around you know, around him makes things a lot clearer.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       You know, because that's what people are paying attention to. They're paying attention to the big faces, the paying attention to that. He said this and she said that, and I'm just like trying to follow that principle. Would I know what it is and I'm trying to follow that thing. Yeah. So I think I come from a similar place and I think you know, our politics, which do line up in a lot of ways, not, not fully, but that that's what I try to go for. Where do you think that comes from within you that you don't go for all of that other stuff that, that so many people do well in me is actually a matter of time or observing over time what works, what doesn't work. And also, you know, it's just been a basic, maybe it was the time I was raised in, but it has been a basic principle of me, that peace of mind that people should be free.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       That you should be fruit, that you are, you know, made by God to be a free person. That the things that are happening inside you that are expressed in your, and the things that you like and the things that you want to say and your opinions on that, all of those things are a uniquely valuable. And even if you're a jackass, even if you're saying stuff that makes me want to strangle you, you know, if you're a racist or something like this, I think that there's something uniquely valuable bull about that. And I know that it's more important than some guy in Washington who knows better than you. And I think that that's, that's always been my assumption. It was, I was raised in that all American way. I was raised in the suburbs and the early sixties you know, it's just, that was kind of what that was the civic religion and it always good to me and the, when things changed I would listen to the arguments and I fall, I've changed you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       I've developed and that things get are different over time, but certain principles stay the same and if you stick with that you basically, I don't know, you know, it's, it's a question of actually enjoying other people and even when they can be jerks. Sometimes I like them, you know, I'd like you can enjoy sitting across from someone that you don't agree with you saying that, that you can do that. This is the thing. When you don't, whenever I see on Youtube, it says so and so destroys someone else says so and so talks to someone else and big letters, you know, because yeah, when you talk to people you disagree with, if they don't get angry at you and they're not shouting at you, you know, you learn a lot of stuff and he can and, and you hone your own arguments and sometimes on occasion you change your mind.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       I mean, I'm a, I would say if I had to place myself on the political spectrum, I'd be a libertarian, but one of the reasons I changed on abortion took 20 years, but I had an argument with a guy and I lost it and I thought like, you know what? I can't defend my position against this guy, which is a great teachable moment. It's a real teachable moment that it reminds you to listen to people. Yeah. I like that you just used the phrase civic religion because one of the things I've been talking about on here is that to me, leftism has become a secular religion. Yes. I've had a couple of people mentioned this idea of Peter, but goes in what's on a couple of weeks ago, uh, who really explained it well, but that basically this has become this infallible doctrine that you must never leave. And if you do leave you're going to basically have a fat wallet on your head.

Speaker 1:          00:04:35       Right. But a civic religion is, is an interesting phrase because basically you were just, your civic religion in that regard was just live and let live. But we're pretty much, yes basically. And the idea that you know that the more government there is, the less of a person there is, you know, that the fact that a woman comes into a town and says, oh I know how to do people's hair and the government says we need a permit for that permit to do hair. Do you know that that's, it's just a kind of ongoing, he's a bald guy issue. Right, exactly. You know, you read those occasional stories where some little kid has a lemonade stand and the police pull up, you know, cause he doesn't have a permit. I mean that is the stuff that is so offensive to me and, and it's like I guess over time I've kept watching people who told me that they were trying to make the world more free and more fair, but it always turned out, not always, but it often turned out that what they were really trying to do is take the power away from someone they thought was a pressing them and take it themselves so that they could oppress a person who had been oppressing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       And I have like just steadfastly maintained that like I want the world to be more free and more fair. I'm perfectly willing to accept that somebody has been marginalized and needs to be included, but I'm not willing to force this other guy to like it or to include them or do serve him or do anything else. It just seems to me that freedom is a balance. Yeah. You mentioned something very briefly, God now, last time you were on. Yeah, we, we did sort of your whole evolution, which is really kind of fascinating. You were born Jewish, then you are atheist. For what a bulk of your five years. For 35 years. GNOSTIC atheist. And then about how old were you when you then I was, I was about 45 when I became an atheist when I start to believe in God and I was just about 50 when I was baptized down.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       Yeah. So how, I just had, uh, your friend Dennis prager on, hey, my friend Dennis prager and, and Michael Shermer, you know Michael Michael who runs a skeptic magazine. Oh yes. And we had a great conversation about belief and morality with God or without God. It was really great. And at the end we all agreed, wow, how nice. We can sit in a room and not agree on everything and we might have dinner together, you know? Um, but for, for you as someone that's traveled in and out of religion, uh, how important is the idea of religion as a foundational belief for society? Well, the only reason to believe in religion as far as I'm concerned is because it's true. Okay. That's the only reason. So the idea that it's good for society or it is, um, or conducive to law and order are conducive to politeness.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       And I'm not interested in believing in a fantasy just because it works. I, and I've always hated arguments based on practicality when it comes to metaphysics. You know, to me, uh, you can be a nice person and obviously without being, without being a theorist at all, plenty of Nice atheists are lovely people who are atheists. But, but I do believe that most of what you think is true is illogical. Without religion, without God. And many people don't follow their own thoughts down to the ground. And this is true of both atheists and believers. And I do believe that. Here's what I think has happened to us. I think that, you know, right around the 17th century, the science became science. We the of what we know it to be and certain questions were put aside in order to do science. So in other words, you had people saying, Hey, I can measure this and I can predict this and then I can heal this and I can build this and all these things are such a great, you know, obviously such a great benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       This is idea from the iphone, the penicillin, whatever you're talking about. All this stuff has revolutionized human life. It was assumed and it was argued that there was an underlying logic to science which precluded God which eliminated God. Even though most of the people who invented science, we're Christians, there was presumed that there was an underlying logic. So in other words, they say there's evolution and if there's evolution, everything is random and you go, well, okay, there's evolution but random, you can't tell randomness from within a system. You can't say I'm in a system and is random because obviously the order of every system comes from outside the system. I believe that logic is starting to collapse. I believe that logic has played out and I believe it has been to us in the materialism that basically materialism, that everything is material. Everything has a material because the material explanation is better than that.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       That I believe is toxic because it doesn't make sense because you cannot get from morality to materialism and from materialism to morality that I believe has had a toxic effect on our society. And so I don't want to replace materialism with theism because I think it's toxic. I want to do it because I think the truth is healing and liberating. So without going too far down, just specifically the rabbit hole of belief, cause we've done it a bunch on the show, and I think I find that even for atheists, unbelievers, everyone kind of gets to a point where it's like, all right, well I the good ones at least get to a point where it's like, all right, well that's what I believe in. And it frames some other stuff. So let's talk about that. So without going too far down that rabbit hole, if you think that that those systems are collapsing, is that a, is that really a metaphor or a or a bridge to why so many systems seem like they're collapsing right now?

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Media politics. I think that's exactly what's happening. I will sit here and predict to you that I believe in the next [inaudible] actually, I believe it's happening now, but I believe it will erupt at some point. That there's going to be an intellectual revival of uh, it's, it's really Aristotelian thought. The idea that we're here, we have a purpose and that bottle has a purpose, that this body has a purpose. This mine has a purpose that is already coming back. And when you talk to people, it's really interesting when you go in to the top universities and you talk to the young people there who are the best minds of the country. They're all believers. They don't believe in God, which wouldn't have been true I think 30 40 years ago. And this is because ideas play themselves out over time. And this idea that the world is material is ending.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       And yes, I think a lot of the craziness we're seeing and that, you know, I hate talking about some of these extraordinary political things because see, it sounds like you're being mean. Like it sounds like when I say if a man has an operation then turns himself into a woman, he's not a woman. That's a statement of fact in my, to my mind, it doesn't mean that he should be abused or bullied or hurt or anything like that. It's a totally different question. But some of these questions where reality is starting to disappear I think are built into the fact that this idea is collapsing. It's so interesting because I do believe that trans people exist. I mean, I mean I, I'm not saying, yeah, I don't think you said that they don't exist but, but that I believe that it is, it is a, an actual, um, I don't want to say it's an, it's an actual existential thing for this particular person, but yet I can still go with you in that place because it seems like the hysteria is constantly surrounding it is making people question everything.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       You know what I mean? Like if you don't accept Trans people the second that everyone else except more, not even accept them because I think most people accept them. But if you don't celebrate it immediately or, or wish for a trans child, it's like they, they will turn on as you're a transport. And I think some of the things that to, uh, give a child a to hormone treatments or any kind of opp operation based on some kind of state of preference and that I believe is abusive that I, that I believe is wrong, but for an adult to decide that he wants to live his life in any way he wants. As long as you're not hurting anybody, it means it means nothing to me. I mean, it just means nothing to me. But, but when he says to me, you must call me a woman, then he is taken away my right to experience reality as I experienced it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       And that's where he loses his rights as this is, this strikes me as you're sort of like a mature Republican, you know what I mean? Like that's what it strikes me. I was like, if, because everything you just said makes sense within a conservative viewpoint. Yeah. You know, within a libertarian conservative viewpoint, except there's so few conservatives willing to say that. What you just said. Well, you know, it's funny you asked me at the very beginning how I kept hold of some of these principles and it didn't occur to me until just a moment ago is we were talking, I'm talking about one of the things is I'm a novelist. I've lived most of my life writing novels. And when you were a novelist, what you do is you create characters and each one of these characters has a full complete existence and a full, complete justification. Even when you're inventing the bad guy, you realize that in his mind, the world makes perfect sense and it, and he makes perfect sense in that world.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       And I actually think of people that way. You maybe that's a novelist training or maybe you start out with that and it turns you into a novelist. But I actually think of people that way. I actually think of somebody who says to me, I'm having this inner experience of being alienated from my sax, say, or whatever, whatever it is. I, you know, that's, that doesn't offend me. It doesn't, I mean, that seems like, I feel it might be painful and it offends me if he says that I have to react in a certain way or this guy has to react by law in a certain way. But his experience is like, it's, it really is part of the kind of fabric of the world. And I think, I think that there has been too many people on both sides of conflated, what government does with how we live.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       So in other words, I've had this argument with conservatives a lot where they'll, they'll say, well, they want to legalize marijuana. And I'll say, she's fine. Just don't let people drive with marijuana, you know? And like what you want to poison yourself? I think it's bad for you, but you know, it's none of my business. Go ahead. Do you think marijuana is bad? I do think is bad for you. But what I've read, it's bad for it, but I don't use it. So I don't really know that much about it. And you don't seem to want to stop someone from using cocoon. Why would I want to stop somebody from using it? Except, except if, if we were you, I might say, Dave, you know, I've read some articles, not good for you, whatever. But then, then you know, it's coming from me and you can say the vape pen, there's not even room for the lungs.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       Come on. But this is the thing. Government should not have the right to approve or disapprove. It only has the right to protect me from you. It shouldn't protect me from me. If I want to throw myself off a bridge, you know, do I think that's right? No, but I should be able to throw myself off a bridge. What? I shouldn't be able to do. The best example I was using, the seat seatbelts versus a cell phone. You know, when you use a cell phone in a car, you're endangering me. When you don't use your seatbelt, you want to fly through the windshield. It's none of my business. And that I, you know, I, I knew that libertarians take some extreme crazy positions, but in general, free markets, free minds seems to me that the way forward in Canada. So I do see the, the freedom thing gaining traction for sure. Even the way that I've talked a lot, obviously about classical liberalism and libertarianism in all of this, I see that now. I see it, I just see it in society and on social media. I see it more in a cooler fashion than it would be if it was maybe coming from Ted Cruz or something. Like I see it's gaining a little traction in, in a bigger way. And I'm not, certainly not all because of me, obviously. Um, well because of you.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       But I liked what you said about that there'll be an intellectual resurgens too because I am starting to see a little bit of that, that it's starting to feel cool to have knowledge again as opposed to the 15 years of endless reality tv and just the worst of us constantly and endless bickering and one upping. I think we're starting to turn a corner on that, which you, which I've been waiting for for a long time. It's an awful, you know, I recently spoke, I don't get to speak to often, uh, at places bark, partly because like ignore the request and out. Now I have somebody who does it, so maybe I'll speak speaking, I spoke at Oberlin recently, which is a deeply like the heart of liberal darkness and went in there and I was, I felt that these children who were my age, they now look like children.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       You know, I felt that they were being almost abused by their heritage of, of knowledge of wisdom was being taken away from them. That if, you know, you should come out of college, you should have read some shakespeare. You know, and you should have read all of some of the great writers. You should know some of these great thinkers, Plato and people like that. And you should know them without the professors standing between you and the guy. You know, Shakespeare has traveled through time, 400 years to bring you the wisdom, a unique vision of the world. I don't need a professor doing anything but explaining the context to me, you know, and they have this thing called theory and all this. And you know, it opened when there were, it was a black dorm. I mean, Martin Luther King would roll over in his grave, you know, there was, there were kids who showed up, uh, you know, kind of aggressively displaying their sexual proclivities and then, um, heckling me from the crowd.

Speaker 1:          00:17:31       And, and I kept saying, you know what, hold your question and I'm going to, I'm going to discuss everything you want to discuss. And then the minute I finished and, uh, talking, they ran away, you know, and, and I thought, these are that something. It's just right there. You know? And, and what was interesting was a lot of the liberal kids who are just ordinary little, they state and we had really good conversations. Only the hecklers ran away. Yeah. And so I just think these kids are being deprived. They're being deprived of their intellectual heritage. They're being deprived of the idea that, that I can't fix their problems. What they're being told is that they're unhappy because, um, they'd be unhappy because of the way I treat them or you treat them or society treats them. They're unhappy because of things inside themselves. And then there was this, this gay guy yelling at me the whole time. And at, at one point I mentioned to somebody else in another context that I was actually a supporter of gay rights and he let out this loud, we'll thank you. And I thought, you know, I thought you think people don't like it because you're gay. They don't like it cause you're allowed.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       That's what a quality is all about. That you just want people to be equal so that you can treat them in a shitty is you treat everybody else. I don't want special treatment for being gay and give me equal treatment and now judge me according to exactly. And I think this, this is come, you know, I see guys like this, a ton of Casey Coats and he writes these letters to the sun. You need, you need to be made good for the sins of the past. What a terrible thing to tell a child. Nobody can solve the sins of the past. That's the whole point of the past. It's past, you know, and you cannot fix the things that were done to people. You cannot fix history. You can't pay people back for things that happen to people who are dead. You know? That's the, that's the tragedy of, of a fallen world.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       You know, that, that things are written into the fabric of life. And to tell somebody that, that he's not going to be happy until he gets paid back for slavery or whatever it is. It's condemning him to misery. Yeah. It's, it's just sounding because it never stops. The payback, the payback, whatever it is. There's never a moment where you go, okay, well we, we got to where we're supposed to get and now we don't need anything else anymore. It just, by human logic, it doesn't make sense. And this used to be the question of education. What is the good life? What's conducive to happiness? What does, you know? What makes you miserable? That used to be what you discussed and it can't. The answer can't be my happiness depends on you. Be Nice to me because you're going to be what you are, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       I'm curious, what was, what group invited you at Oberlin? The some, it was a bunch of Republicans who was like the 15 republican's. Yeah. I kind of surprised they just wanted a 16th guy to finally show up. They were like, they were like trolls, you know, they were kind of, they wanted me to come and make fun of the left and I didn't. And I thought they, even though the whole thing wouldn't be incredibly well, I actually just talked about ideas and people listened and I thought, well, that's a victory. Right? But he felt that the conservatives are so sick of being shouted at, that they've just turned into, uh, into trolls. They want to mock the other song, which I think is kind of interesting because I say it all the time, but I only get invited now to colleges by the young Republican's are the Libertarians and smarter students for liberty or et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       All of these things that are technically right, even though they don't, they don't seem to mind that I'm gay, married and pro choice and against the death penalty and a litany of other things, and then it's like, well, who? Who is the tolerance side? I don't get any invites from anyone. No, no young Democrats or progressives up tomorrow, whoever called me and been like, Dave, you know, we actually see you criticizing her side, but let's come and talk about it. But I'm getting a ton of love from those other guys who by the way, you're right. There's a lot of trolls in that too. They, they've started being the funny people too. That's Richard. Is that for you as a, as a screenwriter and a guy that's bounced between Hollywood and politics, is that fascinating to you though? That is starting to become funny. It's a joy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       I mean, I always, my, my joke used to be that the reason conservatives aren't funny is because liberals have no sense of humor, but it is, it is a joy to see conservatives becoming funny and becoming the people of freedom. Because let's face it, conservatism in the old style did have its oppressive elements and it did have, it's kind of, uh, you know, when, whenever people are in charge of the culture, as conservatives were until the 60s, basically, uh, you know, they abused that control. That's part of, that's part of power corrupting. And there was that element in, and there still is among conservatives that somehow, you know, uh, you are destroying the republic by not being exactly, you know, a, a Bible beating Christian or whatever it is. And, and that's just largely lifted, you know, I mean, so this is actually an effect, I would say a positive effect that the sixties revolutionist haven't conservatives.

Speaker 1:          00:22:23       This is day two of loosened up. Nobody wants to go back to wearing ties to baseball games. Nobody wants to go back to, um, you know, uh, a rigid life where you can't be, look, I, you know, take feminism. Feminism right now to me, like environmentalism is largely the enemy. They are, the feminists are insane. They're not about, you know, actual sexual relations between people just like the environmentalist aren't actually about conservation and all this stuff, but nobody wants to go back to a world where a woman doesn't have, can't choose what life she wants. I mean, I always say to people, if you draw a circle that's called individualism and a circle of is called feminism in that place where the Venn diagram where they meet, you know, I'll, I'll agree with feminism. Everything outside of that I don't agree with, but nobody wants to go back to a world where a woman can't be fully whoever she wants to be and nobody wants a, certainly wants to go back to a racially segregated world except the left.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Right. They oddly are the ones that are pushing these things. Like you just described it overland and so and so. The, the modern right is to some degree a function of certain things that left this have also brought to the table and have now become the party of freedom. The party of hilarity. You know, I mean you do not laugh a lot when you were around leftist and when you actually, when you watch Samantha B on, it's not funny. It's not funny. It's painful. It's dead at that a trump. Yeah. You got to put it in the right and they have to bleep it cause it's on TV. So even if the body man, anything to you, you would really exciting. Fuck yeah, no, this is, this is the funny thing about it is like when you hear them doing that, that the cursing and the anger and the rage and a lot of laughs there.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       So then when you see, uh, people on the right, so like a jeff sessions, cause there's a lot of talk that he's going to go in and try to close medical marijuana dispensaries. Now you just made it very clear you don't smoke marijuana, you prefer everything being equal with people didn't for health reasons. And I think there's a lot of debate around that. But I'm just going with what you said. When you see that as a small government guy and a state's rights guy and a, and a libertarian, that must be the part of the right that you don't like. Right? Yeah. I don't even know why you would bother with that. I mean, I don't know why there should be medical marijuana dispensaries. Why shouldn't just be like a liquor store? You know, you can't buy it if you're not 18 or whatever, the proper ages and you can't use it behind the wheel of a car and all those things.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       And then we get to tax tax it, you know, and, and get all that money. So, but I don't know why that should be what's bothering him, you know? I mean, I really liked jeff sessions. I'm a pro jeff sessions guy. I think he's going to be a great age, you know, I think he's going to do. But are you concerned about that state stuff? Because to me that's one of the biggest issues. The states' rights. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And one of the things that's kind of a joy about the trump era is all these liberal states suing the federal government. Because I think I win that either way, either because the federal government gets the conservative thing in there or I win because they get states. Right. So, and that's why the whole that's, I've now been saying every week, I mean the whole chess board is just throwing up the traditional left right thing barely makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       It's authoritarians and Libertarians and allies, you know, coming together in some interesting spots. I describe it as like being in a room with a gravity has gone out of the room and all the furniture around and you know, you don't know where it's gonna land. And I understand some of these guys like national review and even my pal Ben Shapiro, you know, I understand that they're worried about where the furniture may fall. Uh, I'm kind of optimistic and I'm not sure how much of that is constitutional. How much of the does observational, you know? Right. But I do feel that good things are coming. I look to the generations down the line. And what, what I see coming up is kind of a cultural liberalism, which I agree with, but, but an understanding that freedom is economic and freedom is governmental. And if the government can tell you what to like and what to do, you know, it's just, it's, it's not, you're not free and they're not that smart.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       I'm going to give you a rare choice here. Do we, do we want to go media first or trump first from here? This is a choose your own adventure. It's really interesting because it's kind of the same thing. Let's start with trump. All right, let's go trump first. So when I hear you talk about trump, so I was with you on election night actually. We were, we were at the daily wire offices and it was me, you and, and Shapiro and uh, who else do I build? Widow was there and he was a funny night because we were all having very mixed emotions. I voted for Gary Johnson. I didn't really want either one of them too, when ben was alternately like thrilled and depressed because, you know, but he didn't vote for trump. But he, but he didn't vote for trump. Has he publicly said who we voted for it?

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       I can't remember. Yeah, I'm not sure. It actually comes from, you could, you did vote for trump. I didn't vote for trump at the last minute and I made this very public decision and I explained my reasons and all that. Yeah. And, and then the fourth guy that was with us, Bill Whittle, was a huge trump supporter. And he was talking about the things that we're talking about now that this whole thing has been flipped in that there's room. Right? Okay. So since the election, when I watched your videos, you strike me as one of the only people making any sense on trump because you don't strike me as a, as a pure fan boy and think that he can go out into fifth avenue and shoot someone. You might turn on him for that, but you also don't strike me as, as just what is what most people are at the moment, which is just this hysterical lunacy.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       Um, just hilarious. I, I write columns a lot of times a PJ media and I'll say, well, trump has done this right and this wrong and I get this vicious attacks. You know, you're an antique trumper and they'll let you know you're a cock cock cannot. And then I go to work and uh, everybody there who was kind of anti trump yells at me for selling myself. So I get it from all sides. People always think we're selling ourselves though. Doesn't that seem odd to you? Will people think if they disagree with you, your, their reasons irrational, your reasons or personal? That's what they think, right? You're always doing it for money or for some other reward somewhere, but they do it just sure it's pure intellect that has gotten them to the whole thing, but you don't have that intellect. Yeah. And so it is funny too, cause a lot of the guys I work with are younger than me and I always look at them think, do you think maybe it's occurred to me to examine my own motos yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       Well that that concept though, before we dive fully into trump, that concept of impugning your intellectual opponents motives. I think it's such a sad thing that seeped into everything and slash or, and it doesn't teach you. I mean there's some people obviously who were so corrupt that it's obvious and true, but people are trying to find their way. Most people in you know, in the middle are trying to find their way. So trump. Okay, so, so make some sense out of trump. Okay. What are the people that voted for trump? Because I genuinely thought that Hillary Clinton was a threat to the American experiment. I mean, I'm not over I that I usually don't talk in those big terms, but she did not believe in free speech or hatred of the citizens. United ruling was just indicated to me that she believed the speech should be controlled.

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       There are four justices on the supreme court who have signed onto a theory of the first amendment that says essentially that it does not guarantee you the right to speak. What it guarantees is that the government should control speech so that our values continue to be upheld. That's a very dangerous, sick, stupid and wrong theory. One more judge, I don't believe all of them would sign on everything, but one more judge. And that obviously there was an open seat and we could have lost the first amendment. I don't believe that was the most likely thing, but it could have happened. So can you take the counterpoint on that, just just for devil's advocate, the people that would argue against you on, on citizens united? Well, oh, well, citizens united just says that if you form a corporation, if you and I form the Reuben clave corporation, we don't lose our right to free speech.

Speaker 1:          00:30:04       I mean, what happened was citizens united put out a documentary against Hillary and they said, well that's campaigning so you can't put it on the air. And they said, it's free speech. We can. And they said, well, you're a corporation so you don't have the rights in the New York Times signed onto that. The New York Times said, no, we are a corporation has free speech because we were oppressed corporation. But your corporation does not have, you know, it's nuts and that's, it's typical of the left because as I say, I believe their, their reasons, their logic is collapsing. So they have to shout you down. They can invite they've Ruben to Oberlin there, you know, to, to talk with the left. They can't because they know their argument is over. So I voted for trump, 5% of my mind and in my mind 5% I was thinking the guy's Hitler, you know, there's a 5% chance I am making the biggest mistake of my life and I'm pretty high percentage.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       If you're going Hitler, you know your apps. When when Reagan was elected, I remember having friends called me up and saying, is this the end? I said, no, he's a good guy. You know, it will be fine. I'll be on the other side for a while. You know, you, you will die when people call me up with this. I was going like 95% and I think, you know, like, like you said, that's a big percentage if you're talking a genuine authoritarian tire. I just thought the bet was worth it because I thought that Hillary was the end of the American experiment in the piece fullest possible way. Like, you know, they, there's something in sports called losing comfortably where you don't even notice you're losing and then the game is over and it's done. That's what I thought she was. And, and so I thought that it was worth the risk and I have been largely delighted with how good he's been.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       Now. That doesn't mean I think he's been great. It just means that I was really worried that he was going to be really bad and instead he's been pretty good, you know, um, crazy things about him that are hard to get over the mean tweets, the personal tweets, you know, all that. So I don't mind that. I don't mind the mean tweets, but, but I'll, I'll tell you like three things that he has done that have really lifted me, you know what I mean? Like I really just felt like, wow, I did. Obviously Gorsuch, that's the obvious one. I mean that's a big deal. And and people who on the right who don't like trump keeps saying, oh you keep bringing up gorsuch. I'm going to keep bringing it up, but until I'm gone, you know that's a big, big supreme court appointment and he did a great job.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       It's also kind of a funny one to diminish regardless of what side you're on because guess what, the supreme courts are a third of the government. That's right. That's right. That's one of the brands you left has been using them as a super legislature and of course it won't do that. He said opposed to that. The other one, and this is a little wonky of me, but I've been, I was talking about a way before the election, so I feel I come by, it naturally is he's been rolling back regulations and we were talking about this before, the idea that you need a permit to get your to be a hairstylist permit to sell lemonade on the street. You know, he's been rolling that back and there was a deal, luge that was Obama's kind of, you know, uh, Parthian shot as he was leaving office.

Speaker 1:          00:33:05       He just left all these regulations in place and he's been repealing them. And I think that that is a huge deal. The regulatory state is a genuine threat to our freedoms. You know, just the fact that you need, you need to ask permission of the government to do anything, uh, is a bad thing. And that's to me, I mean, it really is a really, is uplifting to me. And the third thing, and this is why I wanted to talk about trump first, is that he has driven a truck into the structure of a corrupt, biased, intellectually poisonous media. And it was rotten. The structure was rotten. But he's the one who drove the truck into it. And I don't think anybody else had the charisma or the viciousness or, uh, or the UN or that understanding that comes from being a TV star to do what he has done.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       So I'm with Ya. Yeah. Especially on that one. I liked the regulations also. I, this is somewhere where I have shifted a little bit. Right. I get it now the government regulations that these nonsensical things and you know, as a small business owner, I so understand those types of things now. Um, but that last one to me is the one that's really resonating with people. Even the way you just said it. And that's the one that is catching fire with people and that's the one that I think really most people just, it just intuitively they understand. Do you think he truly truly got it right from the beginning? Do you think that really all came from him? Uh, that's the part, you know, I said before the action, I just don't know what his moral center is. I still don't know what like his real sort of the ethos of this man is.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       Do you think he really, really understood that? Like that was just from being an outsider and mocked at the old White House press correspondence things and being on reality TV in New York media and all that. I think he got it because he's, then he's one of them, you know, he's like, I mean me too. I was a reporter, I was in radio news and all this stuff and I would see what was going on and how people thought and how, you know when you're surrounded by people who agree with you, you become biased on, I think he's just, he's, he's got a talent for it. He's got a talent for, you know, I used to talk to Andrew Breitbart and I would sit there and go like, I've never heard somebody who understands the flow of information that is going to be here at this moment at 12 o'clock and it's to be here at two o'clock and it's going to hear three guns.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       This is the way it's gonna work trumps not like that. He has a natural genius for understanding the flow of information. Sometimes he will do, it'll send out a tweet and everybody would say, why did he distract everybody from, and he did. He realized that he was losing control of the narrative and you seized it back. And does he do that? Like sit up in his own, mount a white and say, Aha, now it 10, 12, 15. I kind of doubt it. I don't know him, so I don't know. But I think he has a natural feeling for the way this works and he understands, you know, he'd be a fool not to understand that he's under fire unfairly. Uh, and, and I think he knows how to fight back and it's a pleasure to watch. All right, so trump drives a truck through this thing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       I like what has happened there and we're going to get to that and seeing that in a moment, but let's talk about that 5%. Do you still fear that 5% or have those fears been allayed just because time has gone on and you haven't seen anything that observed, they have been a lead to almost almost entirely everything that I thought about trump, it turned out to be true in terms of my assessment of his personality, but none of it turned out to be its worst manifestation. So it, it really did bother me, for instance, that he would use violent language at rallies a punch. This guy, if you see that Guy Punch him in the face and all that stuff and he does have that side to his personality, but it didn't manifest itself in, in actual violence or act. You know, he's the opposite of an authoritarian.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       If you consider the fact that one of the most incompetent parts of his imagined of his administration is he has been unable to fill a lot of the positions in the, in the government, in the permanent government. He hasn't taken over the permanent government, which is what in the thor and actual authoritarian were. Do you know an actual Hitlerian figure would come in and make sure he made all the appointments and put his guys in there. He's too lazy to do that because that lazy though. Or is that just a function of heat? Cause there is some, some reason to believe he's just having trouble getting the right type of capital. I think that he probably is having trouble with is he, you know, he has this unfortunate habit. One of his really unfortunate habits of wrong footing his own people. So you'll go out and you'll say, well, president trump said this and he'll say, I didn't say that.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       And you get stabbed in the back by your own guy. And I think a lot of people don't want to sign on for that. He's, he's erratic and he is emotional. And I think that that's dangerous for the, you know, the best people that said, he has appointed a tremendous cabinet. I mean unbelievable cabinet and the cabinet of people who are at odds with the agencies that they are appointed to lead, which I think is part of my hatred of, of uh, regulation agency and regulation. So when you see things like, so something like that, the Paris climate accords, I suspect that you are fine with us getting thrilled. I think it's nonsense. Nonsense in that it was nonbinding. And so I think that we had to burden the load or I, yeah, I think the Paris accords were only going to get us into legal trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       There were only there so people could sue us. There was nothing binding about it. But it would give a lot of legal problems to the government. And I also believe that global warming as it's posed, I, you know, I'm not saying that the world isn't getting warmer, I'm just saying that global warming isn't hysterical. Environmental disaster. Uh, I, I'm almost positive it's a nonsense. Where, where do you go for information on, on global warming? Cause this is one of the ones where I find that when I'm talking to conservatives and where I know that there's so much ground to agree on some stuff that I do believe in climate change I would do, I wouldn't eat, we don't even have to call it global warming. Climate Change. Um, well the very fact they changed it to climate change from global warming tells her this argument.

Speaker 1:          00:38:54       Here's the thing. I mean, we're on a rock. The spiraling into an atomic explosion. It's not a steady state is not a, it's not a secure environment. We're not living. And we've gone from ice ages to, you know, a love of the world being basically molten, you know, as I mean, the climate changes. So we know the climate is changing and we know it's gotten more and more over the years. I mean, you know, you're going back in time. There were years when the Thames froze and that, you know, and people skated on the Thames and so like we know that there's, there's changes. There is no way to a know how much of this is human endeavor and, and be to know how much, how this goes into the future. When people say science, there is no science for predicting the future. There is no science for predicting the future.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       When people are telling you what's going to happen in the future, they are what's coming out of their mouth is nothing. Okay. When people say this is what's going to happen 10 years down the line, I have arguments like this about politics too. And somebody says, well if we do this then in four years and go like ass, stop sovereign right there I go, I'll give you until Thursday. And then you're right. You know, I mean, well I love that because every time they show anything that worked well the CBO said that in 10 years this is going to cost 20 million lives. They like, has that ever happened? They're always doing this. And by the way, you're the same people who got everything wrong before the election and now you suddenly can prognosticate. Perfect. And when you hear the phrase, if present trends continue, it's like everything after that is nonsense because that never happens either.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       You're right. So all right, so without, without getting too far into the climate change thing, do you think there's some role for government to play with dealing with other nations when it comes to climate and that I can't think of anything. I mean, except like, you know, I, I do believe in preserving our environment and taking care of things. Yeah. You know, this is the thing is the left always takes these rational issues where there's a true good to be gained and they turned them into hysteria. So give us all your power. I mean, look, I'm a religious guy. If a guy comes on TV and says Jesus is coming tomorrow unless you send me a check, I get suspicious. Right. But so when these guys say to me, if you don't give the government all power and essentially fulfill every socialist need, the world is going to be destroyed in a hail of fire.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       I feel the same way. It's like yeah, I'll turn on something else and see if there's an old Yogi Berra rerun on her, which there usually you go up into the really high channel. It's like around one 30 or so. Uh, okay. Let's talk about the media. Okay. Cause cause you can talk about, we can talk ourselves into a trump style. Yes. Fidget spinner and not going to get us anywhere. So uh, the media, he drove this truck through it. I do think it's great. I think it's helped voices like yours, like what we're doing here. Like many other people who are not promising all the answers but at least promising discussions and, and some, some lines of thought that maybe weren't getting out there in the mainstream. Do you think that there is a risk in that too? That we are just going to filter ourselves into oblivion to the point where instead of having three news channels, we're now going to have a good Gillian of them and we're all going to hate each other for a zillion new and reasons that we didn't even realize that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       Definitely there's a definite moral hazard here. I mean a free, you know, as, as, as, as these liars and our press keeps saying a free press is important to a free society. And you do want, I mean, another thing that's working well under trump is that everybody, that the pressers attacking the people in power instead of what they did during the Obama administration where they kept their hands over their eyes and said, oh look, he's scandal free. I would argue there's a little bit of an overcorrection happened and overcorrection no question about it. But that's because they're so corrupt. I mean, that's why. So I do believe in, uh, a, uh, I can't remember the word, but a press that basically stands up to power. I do believe in a free press. We don't have a free press. We have a press that has been corrupted beyond its purposes.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       And that doesn't mean they're no good reporters. That means that a good reporter on the New York Times is basically doing the wrong thing because he's giving credence and uh, he's given credence and credibility to a sophomore, Eric Left Wing College magazine, and with his, can you give an example of that? Because that's the type of thing. So I attack CNN all the time. I've seen some bad stuff lately out of the New York Times where the headline leads you one way and then when you read it, it really isn't what it said. They've been doing a lot of corrections lately, which usually no one reads the correction. So you never see any of that. But when I, when I do attack the New York Times, people would give me more shit. Like CNN. It's like everyone's in on the joke now, but New York Times it's a little bit different. So when you describe it as a, as a sophomore, oh, there, I mean if you read their op Ed page, which I now call knucklehead row, you know, if you read their op ed page, really is like a bunch of eight year old girls in a room where a mouse has gotten loose.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       And so they're all screaming and yelling, everybody running around in hysterics. And, and that's really unfair to eight year old girls. And if you read, I mean, just yesterday they ran a story of Donald Trump jr met with a Russian lawyer and all this. Who Cares? I mean, who cares? Donald Trump jr met with a Russian lawyer to get info because he thought she had information on the opposition and everybody, you know, faints and who cares? I saw celebrities, well known people think this is it. This is the collusion we've been looking for. It's a panic. It's called story. It's called opposition research. Everyone does this. Do you think Hillary didn't meet with people to see if they had information on trump and only in an organization where no one is sitting next to you who says, dude, that's not a story. That's a 30 page, 30 story.

Speaker 1:          00:44:14       Only in a place where everybody thinks we've found the smoking gun. Can you make a fool of yourself like that? You know? In other words, you want somebody to say to you, you know, like, I know you're a conservative, but there is some thing to not letting people starve to death in the streets and go, oh yeah, from out of it. You okay then the opposite is true, you know? Yeah. I know you were a left winger, but everybody does oppo research and you know, the fact that she was from Russia and makes it doesn't mean a thing. You know? And by the way, as far as I know, he didn't buy anything from you or take anything from her. It was a ruse to get them to talk about this ruling. You know, that limits the way they can use banks and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       I, you know, we'd been listening to this stupid story for six months, this Russian story. It is not a story. I mean, it's just not, and even, even the Russian meddling with the election, which I believe happened, is kind of like finding a spy. You know, we go, oh my goodness, there's a spy who would ever spy on a call, you know, uh, you know, can we bring our spies back for a couple of, you know, that that's what this is. Like, we do it to them and all this, and they do it to us. So the New York Times has become, it's dishonest and it, they use good reporters in good reporting to tell a dishonest story. And the fact that they think that they even can conceive of the idea that they're not a leftist rag shows you how far gone they are. I mean, that they cannot, you know, Eh, Eh, take it any day, pick up the Wall Street Journal and pick up the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       You're talking to an adult, the New York Times, you're talking to a child. Well, it's interesting that you made a point of saying the op Ed page, it's too, because obviously you expect opinion that's separate than the editorial side, but he, but their app aid page, the reaction to some of the things that they're doing has gotten insane. So they brought Bret Stevens from the Wall Street Journal. He writes that one piece basically just about skepticism. It didn't even really say he doesn't believe in climate change. Right. I think you may have even said the opposite. But then there were immediately people demanding he be fired and all of this craziness just for having an alternate opinion on their op Ed page. But the one that I thought was more interesting, do you see the one a couple of weeks ago, uh, about uh, Bret Weinstein from evergreen state and it was all about campus free speech.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       But basically the thrust of it at the end was we as liberal as better there are caring about this because it's coming for us. Right. And I thought, what an odd admission you, you are now admitting that you didn't care about free speech because it was coming about coming against the other [inaudible]. Right now it's finally turning on a guy who's left, left, left, super progressive. So now we better start caring. Like that was strange. Admitted it was a nice, it was refreshing. I suppose it is, but I mean I think the New York Times was just gone so far down this hole that uh, an article like that stands out. You know, when you read an article like that and the Times you go like, wow, even in the New York Times there now for free speech, you know, that's, that's not good. You know, like in the New York Times should be for free speech every day for everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       Every day. The New York Times should have conservatives on, on the desks where the news decisions are being made. You know, the, the Wall Street Journal is, is anti trump and its news pages sometimes unfairly, I think, but not crazily. You know, they have people obviously correcting their opinions. You know, that comes a level that comes a time when the level of corruption gets so bad that audacity becomes a kind of a brag. So you see this in governments all the time. You see it in Illinois, places like Chicago and things like this where remember the, the uh, uh, boss tweed and the little tin box and all this stuff, put the money in a little tin box. This corruption is, this is, this comes from a sense that we are so corrupt that no one can touch us. Okay? When you put George Stephanopoulos, a Clinton hack at the top of your news team, he is your news guy.

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       That's a sign that you have become corrupt. It's not that he's at ABC news that's ABC, has not, not that he's not a nice man or whatever he is. He's a guy who once said to Hillary, I love you hillary. He can have a role in your news department, but he should not be running in your news department, the guy at CBS. So who just looks like Ted Baxter to me. You remember from the buyer isn't Scott Pelley who may, who made decisions so bias during the Obama administration that his own reporters didn't want their stories going on his air because they didn't want to do what I was talking about with serve a biased report. This corruption has becomes so manifest and so absurd that to see it taken down is a beautiful thing. But you're right, we need to replace it with something of value.

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       We need to replace it with something that works. So is that why they're hitting back so hard? So the CNN thing that happened last week with this threat to docs, this person who did an perfectly legal thing, it is legal to make means, by the way, he didn't make it for trump. However, it got to trump, and it sounds like it was actually a slightly altered version, right? We don't know how it is, but there are millions of people making means on the Internet as we sit here. Right. The second, it wasn't just that they were threatening to dox this guy for doing something illegal. It was the line after that where they said, he's agreed not to do this offensive, blah, blah, blah. Again, as if they're the church or his parents or something. So it, to me that was, that was the scarier thing, not the threat of the docs, which of course is wrong, but the threat that they were tacitly saying or implicitly saying to everybody else, we're, we're watching you two and we're going to come for all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:49:28       Well, you know, the Internet turned on them in a beautiful fashion, right? And, but it was only the, the followup and the completion of the logic that went after joe the plumber. And of course the right mishandled that by elevating joe the plumber to some kind of commentator because he'd been attack. But remember Joe, the plumber went out and asked the question of a political candidate and he went after the Chi West. The question, I mean, this is what the, how corrupt they've become. And they are thuggish and this is all of them. This is, I mean, I'm talking about the networks. I'm talking about the times, I'm talking about Wapo and I'm talking about CNN, which is in some ways the least of them because it's just a small operation that would vanish like that. If people cut their cable cords, you know? Right, right. They say, what's that thing?

Speaker 1:          00:50:10       They say that if they would get cnn at airports, it would lose. Like they would lose all of his, all of his viewers do. You know, it's all of these guys and and they hate, it hasn't even occurred to one of them. Not one of them has said, well, you know, trump is being a jerk and trump is not, it's not fair what he does. It's really wrong when he attacks our reporter in terms of her face or whatever, you know, like, but he has a point, you know, we need to reform our industry. There's a reason that the people believe Donald Trump more than they believe us. There's a reason that people hate us so much. So it really is that they've just been drunk on power. Yeah. These last, whatever it is, 30 years, they'd been drunk on power for so long and now they finally have someone throwing it in their face.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       And now the people, the actual people that are rising up against them to that. And I saw, uh, you saw probably Chris Cuomo, who of course his brother is the mayor or the governor, he's a yard one. He said his father was the governor of New York. He's an idiot. He's like Fredo from the, he really, I mean, I, every time you see the guys, just another, just embarrassed, but he tweeted something about these hateful means and should we release the information because the guys tweeted some other races and stuff and all that. And then he ended up deleting it. But I, I retweeted him and I said, would you say that a meme or a Gif is worse than what then Linda Sarsour calling for a jihad? Now, we talked about it briefly before we started, but regardless of whether she meant her own personal jihad, but she's talking about the white supremacists and Islamophobia in the White House.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       And everyone knows if you're using that word, you're trying to gin up a certain something. And My tweak got way more retweets and everything then than any of his due. He has a million followers and almost no interaction, which also tells you a little something. Um, but I bring this up because it's like, of course he doesn't respond because they think they're beholden to nobody to where it's like we're, but we actually are beholden to our audience. You know, when I was a newspaper man was a newspaper man in a small town with a very powerful and somewhat corrupt sheriff. So it was like out of a movie, you know, and I would do, I would batch it again. And I remember saying to one, I had some sources in the department and I remember saying to one of them, look, we work for, we both worked for the people.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       And he turned around and he said, I work with are the people you work for a corporation? And I thought, my God, he's right. He said, that's true. That's true. They don't understand that. They're just mouthpieces for big corporations, which love big government because big government hurts the little guy, you know, that's all they're doing. They're just standing up for these powerful corporations in the name of all the leftist, you know, uh, by words and all this stuff. You know, they really have lost any real sense of themselves. And it's just, it's, it's pitiful to watch in some ways, but it is good to see it getting exposed. And what I would like to see on the right, I feel on the right, we have a lot of really good people like you and me and Ben and all these people expressing opinions. But we, I don't consider myself part of the right kind of moving into libertarian.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       I would say, you know, I'm, I'm still a liberal, which is a fine line between that and a libertarian. But yes, I, I, I hate to even pause you there to say that, but I know a certain amount of people start screaming. But I considered my, I'm more than happy to talk to all you guys, but I say it all the time that I'm a conservative because I'm alone. I'll just give it varies on that. Okay. Yeah. And I, I think that I would like to see us start to gather information and, and that's expensive and you need people to back you when you needed to somehow make it profitable. But we need to start sending people to the hotspots because for me to get the facts, I have to go to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and CNN and all these places cause they hire reporters and it's opinions are great and insights are great and there is now because the press is so corrupt, there is an actual need for people like us to say, they're telling you the facts mean this, but the facts actually might mean this, you know, that is an actual profession now as a real profession that needs to be done.

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       But I would like to see the right go after have people in Iraq have people in, uh, you know, in the hotspots of the world, have people in Washington DC, the best news program on television as Brett bears special report because they gather news and because they're fair, even though he's, you know, even though they tilt to the right, they're very fair about what they cover. Are you shocked by the breadth of it? Just sort of the amount of activists masquerading as journalists because that's what I think they are truly, these people are not, I mean, I've seen just some of the recent hit pieces on me. Yeah. And it's like, no matter how much I plead my case or defend myself or show them evidence to the contrary of what, uh, you know, some mother Jones calling me and extremist to the right of Breitbart.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       Wow. Real doozy. And it's like, you know, they, they don't correct anything. They don't care. They know their job is safe and it's like forgetting all that you are not a journalist. That's what I, I tweeted the guys something to that effect. Like, I just want you to admit, you're not a journalist, right? Right. What you want, even though I probably had a decent case for liable, right? What you want, but can you admit what you're doing? And it's like that sort of, that lack of self awareness. You know, I, I've been, I have now been saying this to the right for 10, 15 years about our loss of the culture. And that's what this is. This is the result of our loss of the universities, of our loss of TV stations. You know, uh, women's magazines. Every woman's magazine is left wing. Every comedian on television, every late night comedian, every single one is a left winger, not one, not one woman.

Speaker 1:          00:55:38       And when, and when one of them made a joke was nice to Donald Trump, he was basically pilloried, you know, he had to take Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Fallon. That was the one. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to tell the difference because they're all the same, you know, they're all, exactly, how do we, how did we let that happen? Then why don't we respond? And I always do. I always say to conservatives that telling them about the culture is like trying to explain to my wife when she buys something on sale, it's still costs money. Had you always looks at me and he goes and says, you know, you're a cute guy and I like you but I don't know what you're talking about. And that's the way conservatives look at me. You know, like how did we get to the point where we have people talking like a 100 year old men go on, I don't go to the movies anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       I just turn on, turn our clouddam Doris stays good enough, you know? I mean, that's insane. And how do we get to the point where we start making stuff that educates people not to be right wingers but simply to open their minds a little bit. So I don't know what your feelings are on Milo, but I suspect that after hearing you say that you must at least love much of the movement behind him because he isn't he that isn't that thing that you're now saying we got, we were winning the culture war back. I mean, he talked about that all the time right here. You know, that is such a great question. It really is. It's a great question because Milo gives me fits. Uh, I've only spoken to Milo once. We had a long conversation about video games. He was when he was on Gamergate and, um, and I liked the men, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:57:04       I got along with him. He has done some stuff that's so vicious, partly to my friend Ben Shapiro, which I resent because he's my friend, um, an antisemitic and, and he's given, given shelter to Antisemites, which I always feel the minute, dice minute, I see antisemitism. It is the canary in the coal mine. You know, that's where like evil dwells basically. I usually go for the, for it, go for the Jews first and like, so there's stuff that he's done that I just think it's great and I wish that he would, uh, you know, find himself in a somewhat better place because there is such a thing. Even though I believe everyone should be allowed to speak. There are some things that are, that when spoken or reprehensible, you know what I mean? So, well, there's, there's consequences for your speech. That's right. You know, and when I hear him, uh, you know, I don't know the June remarks and the, and the kind of, um, the, the kind of hateful, allowing hatefulness to be cute, allowing it to be ironic saying, you know, I've heard him say, for instance, I've heard him say when, when our generation is antisemitic, they're just being ironical.

Speaker 1:          00:58:11       I think like, yeah, that's a snake that's going to bite back. You know, I don't, I don't really buy into that. And, and so I like what he's doing. I don't always like the way that he's doing it or what he's doing it in service to. But certainly when he had what was called the dangerous faggot tour, yeah, I laughed out loud. I thought I wanted more of those guys. I mean, that was bright, bright. Bart and I used to have this conversation all the time. You know, when I first met Breitbart, he kind of enlisted me into the La, right as he did. Almost all of us. Uh, you know, I said to him, I want to tell you right upfront that I'm not going in for this gay stuff because of this anti gay stuff cause I think we're going to lose. I said, hey, we're going to lose, which has no shame but we're going to lose and be wrong. And that's a shame. That's really shameful. Breitbart said to me, what I want is more patriotic gay porn. I said, sign me up.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       Two straight guys demanding more patriotic that how much of the country we're going to watch it. But you know, and, and so I think that, uh, you know, I have this conversation with people about Milo all the time. I see a good that he is doing. I see dangers in the way he's doing it. And I think you can be too about too much because there is moral universe and you do not want to, you didn't want to blow yourself through it. Do you think that's kind of the fast and bargain that you have to play? You're getting what you want, what you've wanted here, and you as a guy that's been through the Hollywood machine too, so you're, you're getting the culture wins that really, if he had, let's say he had done, you know, been a little more careful with his language or not done some of the unnecessary over the top stuff or whatever that it might have.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       Uh, it might've shaved some of the good part that you want. Yeah. Maybe, maybe just wouldn't have broke through with his name. That's kind of what the trump, the trump, ian bargain. I was only a guy as uncaring about the niceties would have driven his truck into the media the way he did. And I think that, does it come with moral hazards? Yes. To people have to speak up about those moral hazards and take the flack from the right when they say, you know, oh you're a cock and you're all these things. Yes we have to take that flag but it has to be done because I think we had reached a tipping point. I hate to use a cliched phrase like that, but I think we had reached a tipping point where we were sounding very much like a communist country. Like there was things that you could say that made you persona non grata that there were opinions.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       You can have that, you know, the trap door, like the James Bond villain drop through the trap door. I think we were in a dangerous point. And if we end political correctness is a smothering toxic, uh, evil device for making the lines seemed like a virtue. And if Donald Trump destroys political correctness, he will have done a great thing. I mean, a great thing. And that, that has moral hazards come along with that. I think we shouldn't forget it. And you know, a good example of this was when they shut down Shakespeare on the park the other day. Now Shakespeare that was reprehensible to assassinate the president or onstage. I really think, you know, as a, as a Shakespeare Fan, I think that it was a, an awful, awful thing to do. But they would have done the same thing if it was Obama, right? Yeah. But to shut them down and to have my friends, you know, writing that this was a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       You know that that's a mistake. I completely agree because now what you're saying, it's okay to fight to say, well we've got to be as tough as the left, but to say we've got to be as tough as the left for things that the left would approve of like shutting down free speech. That doesn't make any sense to me. And that's why he both, and that's why again, these sides, the sides are just becoming meaningless and nonsense science. I think that that's a really good observation because I do think that I, and I, I, this is part of the problem I have with the right right now is I keep saying to them, you know, you're right there. They're disturbed because the conservative movement has essentially collapsed when trump swept all those guys off the stage, the way he did and the primaries, the conservative movement was done for.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       And my response to that is fix it. You know, put it back together differently. You know, get, it's a new world, make a new conservative conservatism. You don't have to get rid of your principles. You don't have to get rid of your big principles, but you might have to get rid of some of the ways those principles express themselves in the world. Yeah. So is that just, that's just real politic, right? I mean, it seems to be here, you're just viewing the world as it is, not as you want it to be. So if you, if you had a guy like, uh, like bill kristol where it's like he wants that conservative thing to exist again, I don't think you can make that happen or you certainly can't. It's going to go through several other iterations before it was ever to get back to something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       Yeah, no, I'm interested in guys like Henry Olsen who are basically saying, pointing out that Reagan was kind of an Fdr Democrat more than anything else and he invented the kind of modern conservatism I, I'm interested in guys who say, look, this is the field of play and this is where we want to get. See, this is, this is the thing that I know that I notice a lot of commentators don't. I know where I want to get. I want to get to more freedom. I have more freedom now six months after the election of Donald Trump, seven months after the election of Donald Trump than I did eight months ago. No question. In my mind, the fact that the EPA can't now rule my sink a waterway and declare that they can now tell me whether I can shave or not. You know, I think that that makes me more free.

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       I think judge [inaudible] that being said, trump may not be great on eminent domain, right? Because he might want this wall to cut through things. You know, who knows where that will the walls at now. But I assure you he would have no problem using eminent domain to make a cut through. Yeah, no, there, there are all these dangers involved and so I just want to see as the ball moving in the freedom direction all the time. And right now it is. And you know, I definitely see moral hazards. I definitely look at it. Got a Milo. I mean he's such a good example cause I look at him and they're things that he does that I make me laugh out loud and I just think it's wonderful. He's here and then suddenly he'll say something and I'll think, except we don't want it. You don't want to give credence to hatred and evil.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       You know, I mean it evil, evil is bigger than irony and evil will eat irony, you know? And so you want to be careful about that. I don't know. I feel that that could have been the ending, but I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you one other thing, which is do you fear perhaps that these forces which have grown so fat and it were so drunk on their own power and all that, now that it's starting to crumble, do you fear that they will hit back on people like you and people like me and whoever in a way that we made don't, we may not understand yet. In other words, that, that, that thing that they did with the Han asshole solo and the Gif, where are the meme was uh, a warning shot only of the way that they're going to try to treat the people who go against them.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       I think we've seen it with these leaks from the intelligence community about Donald Trump did this and they turned out some of those leaks turned out not to be true, but the press was perfectly happy to say sources within the intelligence community, former officials, and you think, well, what does a former official, no, it didn't matter. They were putting on a front page. That was the front page on the New York Times, The Washington Post. They were, that was the deep state striking back. There's no question about it. They're going to continue to fight. This is a genuine battle. This is a genuine battle for, uh, you know, I hate to say it, but it's a battle for the future. I mean, I think that this global world, which has many good things in it, I think free trade and global communication and all of this also allowed a small group of people to make decisions on unelected people to make decisions for, for people who had no way to redress their grievances.

Speaker 1:          01:05:42       And I think that that can't be, you know, if we're going to become a global world, then I want America to take it over that basically, I'm an imperialist in that regard. If we, if the world's gonna be global, fine, but everybody's living under the constitution, you know, that's the way it's going to be. If not, if everybody's not living under the constitution in Saudi Arabia, doesn't want to live under the constitution than I want Saudi Arabia to stay in Saudi Arabia and I want Saudi Arabians to stay in Saudi Arabia unless they want to come over here to live under the constitution. So those are the choices. You know what I mean? That's an interesting way to frame it. There's a global world run by the Constitution or America first. Well, Andrew, a anonymous source on Capitol Hill. He's telling me right now that this was an excellent interview. Oh, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. I hope we can continue the conversation. You know, I get my, my anonymous sources. I've got to the US from Gloria Borger. She's always quoting this anonymous, like you talking to the janitor, like source on capital. It's anybody. That's what I want people to understand. It's anybody. It's all made up. It's been a pleasure as always. And for more on Andrew, check him out on the Andrew Klavan show. Brilliant name, by the way, where you know, it was amazing. We worked for ages on it. The Andrew Klavan show. It's right here on the youtube.
