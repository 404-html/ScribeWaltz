Speaker 1:          00:00:01       All right, the big day is here. We're finally doing the Rubin report fan show. In case you missed it a couple of weeks back, I had asked you guys to let me know why I should interview you and I got to tell you guys, you did not disappoint me. We got almost 1200 responses within a week and ended up selecting 20 of you instead of the original five that we had intended. We're gonna release these over the course of a couple of weeks, each video with a few eight to 10 minute interviews. Many of you guys wrote incredible essays on what's going on in your life and in your corner of the world. I promise you that we read every single entry. It took us a long time and it was incredibly difficult to make the decision of who to choose. We did our best to pick an eclectic mix of people from all over the world.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       On a personal note, I just want to say how truly, truly honored and humbled I am by your submissions. The fact that you guys watched this show, share it with friends and family and are engaging in the battle of ideas yourself, really makes putting myself out there worthwhile. I'm honored really to have such an incredible fan base that not only is connecting with me but with each other as well. Clearly you guys all recognize that we're in this together and that talking about the important issues honestly, is the only way to move forward as part of the human race. All right. Then the first ever Rubin report fan show is here. Let's roll. All right. I'm on with Sophie in London. Sophie, has it gone?

Speaker 2:          00:01:29       I'm amazing. Thank you so much for having me tonight, Dave.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       Yeah, my pleasure. All right, so, uh, I saw on twitter. You're very excited to talk to me. I have a whole list of things that you had written in originally about, but I sensed that more than anything else you want to talk about feminism as am I right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       Yeah. My favorite topic. It's delicious. Delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       All right, well let's, let's dive right in. What are your feelings about feminism in 2016?

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       Well, the problem is feminism to 2016 isn't the feminism that once was, I think, I think we know from Milo Yiannopoulos and Christina Hoff sommers who promoted it amazingly well. This idea that modern feminism has become a kin to martin heating has, it, has. Um, and I myself having been brought up in a family of mostly females with my dad, of course, bless his heart. I know the value of being a strong independent woman, as Cliche as it sounds. And that doesn't involve safe spaces. That doesn't involve shying away from debate. You know, what it involves, it involves being equal to a man. It involves working to be equal. So you know, everything about this whole safe space concept is extremely dangerous because these people, these people, these students, universities like myself, they will be subject to mollycoddling to being told they have victims all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       And I imagine you're being constantly told her a victim. What is that going to change your mentality that extremely damaging. And that is what might've modernists, feminism is doing to women all the time. And it's depressing because we all meant to be for gender equality. So why are we telling these women, why are we telling females everywhere that you can't do this, that this mystical force, the patriarchy is supposedly oppression pressing us. And now I say this, obviously a patriarchy is a serious issue in countries such as Middle East and India for instance, in the West, you know, I can walk out my house without a male mind and it's. And it's fine. You know, I don't have this, I don't have this oppression or May.

Speaker 3:          00:03:31       Yeah. So you're telling me you're safe when you walk out of your house in London, you can make it to the store without a man and you can do that on your own.

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       You know what I mean? Sometimes I do get a bit of a panic attack coming up because I feel, I feel like sometimes a wolf football's gonna come at me and then I'm going to be triggered and then it's just going to be horrific. But I, you know, I just manage it. I just manage it, Dave. And this. The sad thing is is that this is extremely patronizing to women and you know what? We're for real quality. Why are we shying away? This takes is it takes three steps backwards. This is ridiculous. It is ridiculous and the thing is with modern day feminist feminism, like I said, it doesn't support men's needs as well. If we want gender rights, gender equality, we have to consider things that they aren't addressing now from what I previously stated, the patriarchy. Now feminist like to consider it an oppressive force on females and they like to paint it on western females as well, not just those that are generally oppressed.

Speaker 2:          00:04:27       No, I would say the Patriarchy is doing a bloody bad job at benefiting the oppresses. If we look at the end endemic of male suicides, for instance, if we look at the rates of male to female ratios are going to university, especially in the UK. It's atrocious and I can't help but feel that these modern day feminist fighting battles out already won in the, in the, in the West, you know, you know what a pet newspaper here in the UK, the Guardian, I'm sure you are a big fan of these and those, those lovely articles,

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       a little aggressive for me, but every now and again there's something. Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       exactly. There's always like a. I'm a fairly good discussion on an. It's like a diamond in the rough, but the most part has become sort of click bait. Guess what we're going to appropriate today. What sexist today? How can I be a victim today? And it's so disempowering. You know, I want to read articles about women making it in the world, which we do, which we do because we are equal to men and we should be so proud of it. So why are we shying away from that? Why are we teaching these students that, you know, men are horrible creatures, which is something that I detest because we are equal and when I say equal, we are not the same because we all biologically different. And again, we should be so proud of that. We should be proud that we fill each other's differences. We compliment each other. It's a wonderful thing.

Speaker 3:          00:05:47       Yeah. All right, so we got to pause there because you're giving me a lot. I love it. And you know, know I'm on board most of these ideas. And you know what, I promise you, I'm going to send this to Christina directly so she can, she can listen. Oh lovely. But, uh, so when you talk about these ideas, it's very obvious to me. You're not just telling me this, this is something you talk about in your, in your life as well. When you talk about this either at university or with your friends. Um, are you, Shawn, have you been fighting with people? What's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:06:14       I've been told to check my privilege because I'm apparently I'm not oppressed enough. I'm not oppressed enough as a woman. I'm, you know, and apparently there are other women out there in the West that has suffering from the patriarchy. I am yet to be aware of. I think they should also talk to the young working class x coal miner in Yorkshire who is currently suffering and can barely afford a council flat tax, you know, so these are just slight discrepancy in that little chick and they don't see this and I can totally, I can totally empathize with what they're trying to do that they're trying to find some good. They're trying to do something. I can see the intentions, but good intentions don't always mean good results, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       Hell is paved with good intentions.

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       Exactly. And like you say, I do get one a shot and I don't want to be victimizing myself. You, I'm so triggered by talking about it.

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       That was good to move there. You could have went that route but I got out was good.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       But in a sense there was a wall. I will give them videos and say Christina's talks or you know, I'll, I'll link them. I don't link them to Milo yet. I mean I adore him, but I feel like they won't get him quite yet. Baby steps, you know? Sure. I'm all linkedin. Say Peer reviewed studies suggesting perhaps like, you know, um, the pay wage gap has nothing to do with the mystical patriarchy but is nearly to do with job preferences as one of the factors. And they will just dismiss it as saying, oh, it's just a one off case, but how many one off cases can you use as an excuse for that? It's, it's, you know, Straw Manning, so to say the least. Um, and they're trying to fight a battle which has already been won as many as Christina has already said many, many times.

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       Yeah. So do you think that goes to the, you know, the feelings over facts, idea that seems to be what comes out of unfortunately, a lot of the left these days.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       It is sad and it's sad because as much as we used the aggressive black men trope, so to speak. And it's very true. It's very true. I, I trying not to think that it's most the left because you know, I'm very much a liberal and ideas. I believe I believe in equality. I believe in gay marriage. I believe all of that and I believe in freedom of expression, I believe in exchange of ideas and I truly believe with freedom, with free exchange of ideas. You can, you can, you can empathize with people, you can see why people think the way they think and there's, there's this hatred, there's this tension because you're able to understand one another, which is ultimately an amazing thing to do in such a globalized world. And it's hard to do that when you just focus solely on emotion, not logic and rationality, because then you can misinterpret something. You can say it's racist. You can say it's bigoted. When it's perfectly innocent statement. It's probably a statistic that is suddenly magically turned out to be racist.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       Man, you are

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       preaching you my logic or something. I just mangled that one. I think you could be my new cohost. Uh, I want, I want to shift to one more with you. Um, so you mentioned in your submission that there is a form of atheism, also a that you don't like. And now I've had a lot of atheists on here. I'm generally, I'm pro atheist and I'm pro logic and reason and all that stuff, but you think that there is that some of the movements so to speak has taken a turn that you don't like. Can you tell me about that? So of course I'm an atheist myself. Huge fan of the secular movement. I think we're very, very fortunate to be living, you know, mostly secular world with exceptions and I'm glad we are doing a lot of work towards fixing that. How about do you think there is a sinister smugness and the atheist movement and I do think it's connected to some, some of the fallout because um, it's very interesting how some of these people swope Sarah religion for their own ideology.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       Ideology based on the Patriarchy or based on imaginary things. And it's very religion like so in an, in an, in an essence suddenly swapping religion. And I'm not anti religion. I might be atheist, but I'm not anti religion at all. I think there's a lot to be said for some of the cultural things and the Anglican Church, the kingdom has given us culture. It's given us odd. It's given us an explosion of things we can't deny. Totally. Exactly. And so one must be careful when criticizing belief, which is totally fine and not the believer and the benefits of what that belief has given us. Um, but I do also think that some of these people go get a very Marxist route, so they do believe that religion is the opiate of the people say and they completely, um, exchange logic and reason for their own ideology. So it's not like they're, and I'm an atheist because an atheist because they've discovered science or they've, you know, read more Dawkins, they become an atheist sort of as a result of the ideology through the Cultural Marxism that is being perpetuated a lot of the academia nowadays. That's how I'm, that's why I'm worried about that route. But for the most part, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm perfectly, perfectly joyous park at a secular movement. So that's, that's fine with me.

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       Yeah. All right, well listen, this went by super fast. Clearly we couldn't, we could have talked a lot more. I'm curious what, what do you want to do with your life? Because obviously you have a lot to say and I do get that voice out there

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       that's very kind of you. Um, I have a lot of it. I want to start my own business. I'm quite ambitious actually and I'm just finishing up my final year university so I'll be free from the shackles soon enough, but I'm going to have a think about one going to do. Actually I'm gonna have to think that because this is actually, this has been a pleasure actually. Thank you so much for having me on the show.

Speaker 3:          00:11:28       All right. I'm on with John from Turkey that John, it's spelled c a n, but as I know that the C in Turkey is a J. is that, is that all I need to know about your alphabet? There's a couple of other things I could probably know, right?

Speaker 2:          00:11:42       Uh, pretty much easy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       All right. Well we have a lot to talk about because we've talked a bit about Turkey on the show and you sent us a great email with explaining some of your

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       frustrations with Turkey. Some of the good things with hurricane. We're hearing a lot about Turkey in the news right now for a series of reasons. Uh, so I'm gonna start it there. Give me just the general state of things in Turkey right now.

Speaker 4:          00:12:07       Well, I'm a little tall, but I can set it up. Was relatively easy then living in the region, but there are still tons on human rights violation, pressure on free, stress free and we also have a massive refugee crisis and is create sacred problems, economical and social problems. And also we have a really polarized country like the, there are many different social and cultural groups that have different lifestyles and values and expectations from the line. And finally we have within our sites, we have a internal conflict for done a lot on how to use the cards and terms and it blurs the line between the Islamic center, the center line lies, and some second Turks stand together against the careless.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       So I, I assume you. Are you totally secular or are you an atheist? Are you religious? Are you Muslim? Some combination thereof.

Speaker 4:          00:13:10       No, I made this and I'm, I'm, I'm totally values. Yeah, that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       Can you be openly atheist, openly secular there because it sounds like the prime minister has sort of been cracking down on or he's making the country more Islamist in a sense.

Speaker 4:          00:13:30       Why did he tried his best and he has a great support. His name bidding every single election that he was getting into, he had been getting into for 14 years. He has half the every time. And also we had another becomes a nationalist party and upon on like, well, uh, you know, say that we have roughly been pulled off the population that are sexually and so secular values that have second lifestyles sad that Turkey is 99 percent nine Muslim and that kind of stuff. But I think it's less than this and it's a monster. A atheist community is getting bigger and bigger and bigger every day and people are understanding that secular values are really important for us.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       Yeah. So that's really interesting because, you know, we hear from people in the West all the time, they always use Turkey as the example of sort of like, you know, a good Muslim country, you know, because you're okay, you can do this, you have no fear about being on this show, right? You can do this and you're not. I mean I know that Irwin is cracking down on the press, but. Oh, do you?

Speaker 4:          00:14:44       Yeah, I do. I can't find it if it's a okay to say it, but I don't know, like sometimes I feel like if I need some certain stuff I, my job a success, some stupid things can go badly and that kind of stuff. So, uh, once it entered the same time I want to, I want to speak out, I want to be open and I went on to share my ideas and values and I will not Stanford. And this family's for my country and for the entire university and especially.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       Well, I love that. That's exactly why I do the show. So let's talk a little bit about the immigration situation because obviously you guys, you share a border with Syria, it sounds like at some level a lot of the European fighters for Isis come through Turkey to get there. Then you guys get the refugees. Then as you said you, there's also this issue with the Kurds who are sort of caught in the middle and being fought on by, by both Isis and Turkey. So what's the general situation as far as like integrating the immigrants? Are they staying in Turkey? Are they just using Turkey to go to the rest of the Europe? What's going on?

Speaker 4:          00:15:50       Well, no integration because millions of people keep coming to Turkey and you cannot shut down to boulder. You cannot just say that you are not welcoming you. So we have to accept that. But then coming by millions and like data was three and there's a lot of ice I started seeing in different cities and are totally like beggars on the streets, like people living almost three years in refugee camps. And also, uh, I'm going to say that like people say to you about Turkey is a really big company. For example, Syria border is roughly thousand kilometer make from me. So, uh, I don't see that. I don't feel that effect of ics. And then kind of Baobab. Sydney is in the, on the border suffer the most. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       Yeah. So you also wanted to talk about the regressive left. Of course. I'd say out of our, out of our 1200, out of our 1200 emails, I'd say about a thousand of them did have the phrase a regressive left. So how has this regressive ideology affected your life in Turkey?

Speaker 4:          00:17:10       Talking on a TV show? Like A, I keep getting angry and angry because they, I'm telling blind telling countries, for example, that a hominid meant. They say Turkey is a harmony between palm tree. I mean whenever someone criticized Islam they say it's the perfect example and you say all Muslims, but here is 39 to align. So you're a bigot, you're understandable. But the reality is much different than that. I mean there is a struggle between the centers and the Islamists. And it's not just like, and whenever you see like something about it on the media, it's presented like he's holding those asshole stitches, like there's a data and he's doing whatever. He has a shooting hold from society. I mean 50 percent of people supposedly lost lumping. They just support and love him. So at the same time we have second that. So it's just a constant battle between us. So it's not just a, a, a harmonious coexistence. Yeah. This keeps telling lies about it. And you know, I want to say something wrong. For example, I always see someone speaking with confidence around to villages and that kind of stuff. But then I see people from the left in the western countries want cherishing the western values in malls and they stopped talking, reading, getting capable of defending university to be random. So I can't get it. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with these liberals in the West?

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       I wish I knew what was wrong with them because it would solve a lot of my personal problems. I mean, I don't know. So. But how big is that ideology? They're like, so you have, you have the Islamists, they, okay, we get what they're about. And then you have the secularists. How big is that, that piece that is this sort of regressive thing

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       you mean?

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       Well, how big is the regressive part? That's sort of trying to quiet the secularist because we know that the Islam Mr. trying to quiet the secularist, right?

Speaker 4:          00:19:31       Well, you know, uh, we don't have the, we don't have enough conflict to be regressing, right? We don't have any real aggressive in our country, but regressives cheap helping to Islam in the West and uh, to do not, I mean are guns in Bangladesh, Benin in Saudi Arabia, a mentalist and countries. They are getting to that by machetes and people keep talking about, I mean, over wearing a book, is it arrived or, or what does that or people keep talking about. But Mr and that kind of stuff. I mean, this really makes me angry because people are fighting for freedom here and people, uh, like the losing their lives. And then I see people living in comfort and a colon. People even people like me is I've been called by a Westerner, Islamophobia for bad times, even though I'm living in Turkey, I was pulled into.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       Right. Your living in it. They're living in the, in the comforts of the West and they're calling you in Islam. But listen man, we, we could, we could go on forever. We could go on forever here, but unfortunately we got to keep rolling, but it really, it was a pleasure talking to you

Speaker 4:          00:20:51       one.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       Thanks for submitting. All right, we'll talk again. Alright, I'm on with Bashir in Jordan. Bashir. Has It gone?

Speaker 5:          00:21:01       Doing well. Thank you. Thank you for having me.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       My pleasure. I'm doing great. Uh, all right. So you're the third one up. We're, we're dancing across the globe here. You know Jordan, one of the things when I saw your email, you're actually the only person from Jordan that emailed and we never really hear anything about Jordan. You hear about the Middle East constantly, everyday in the news. Something terrible is happening in the Middle East. But Jordan, you don't hear much. The king comes here and he has a nice suit and looks good and everything. That's pretty much all you hear about Jordan. So tell me a little bit what, what's going on in Jordan?

Speaker 5:          00:21:34       Well, yeah. Um, I think, uh, Jordan's like the eye of the storm and when do you have a storm? Nobody speaks about the eye of the storm because it doesn't do anything. So all the damage is happening all around us, but Jordan is pretty safe and nothing really happens. Um, except we keep taking in refugees from all over and the latest numbers. I've looked at almost a third of Jordan's populations, actually refugees, including my family. We came from Palestine, uh, after the, you know, the first, uh, issues with Israel after the Second World War. So yeah, my family is included in that number.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       Are you? Do you have full rights to Palestinians and Jordan have full rights? They can't, they can't vote in certain things or have certain jobs or something.

Speaker 5:          00:22:27       Well that's a tough one. There's so many regulations. So my family has been here from the start, so I'm kind of okay. But Palestinians who have come later do have some issues, especially with the, like you said, and the legal system, they're not fully protected, so to speak. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       How do you feel in terms of, so you, you emailed me, you're, you're doing this right now, like just in the general terms of being able to speak your mind and not worry about government coercion or anything like that. Like do you feel pretty comfortable?

Speaker 5:          00:23:03       Um, uh, I think I do. I stopped really bothering with it too much. It start, you know, it was really difficult to start speaking out and eventually you find your own circles and at some point there's a tipping point where you just don't care anymore about the consequences. You're, you just fight for what you think is right. And this is one of the reasons I love your show and I love you and I admire you for what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       Thanks. Um, all right. So you gave me a bunch of great stuff to talk about here. One of the things you want it to focus on was the western apologists for Islam. Now obviously, yeah, obviously I've spent a lot of time talking about it, right. And I always try to separate, you know, the, the Muslim people, uh, from the doctrine of Islam. It's very hard to do as we know. Uh, but yeah, go ahead. Do the Western apologist. You're in a Muslim majority country having to live under certain laws dictated by Islam. So what do you make of these people in the West that are apologizing for this?

Speaker 5:          00:24:07       Well, I'll just start out by saying like, even your distinction is sometimes a bit blurry, like even when you separate Muslim peoples and the doctrine of Islam. I think there's still some muddy areas in between. Sure. I mean, sure, all of us want to be nice and peaceful, but at the same time when you're in a conflict and you expect the other site to be as nice as you, that's I think a bit silly. You don't walk up to a lion with a flower expect there'll be friends forever. So yeah, that doesn't work. Um, so, uh, the, the western amount apologists is, my problem with them is by focusing on they miss direct the problems and the issues and as if it's like, no, it's not as bad, you know, I'm sure like people like Reza, Aslan and the young Turks, sorry from bringing data, but what they practically do is the, the, the effect on the good people like yourself and like the classical liberals or whoever is genuinely caring about what's happening in the Middle East and the Muslim majority countries, they take the conversation away and it alleviates this sense of urgency. They just kill it. Like if you want it to help and then you hear someone who claims to be a scholar and like he knows everything on the inside and they tell you that no, it's all fine then. Yeah, I don't feel the urge to help anymore. And for us on the inside, we see this almost on a daily basis. I mean female genital mutilation, homophobia and all the terrible things people just genuinely dislike in the west. These are real problems and we would appreciate the help from, you know, from everybody. We can help,

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       right? So in a way, so your, your in like a particularly, uh, I guess tenuous situation because you're, you're clearly, you're, I assume you identify as a classical liberal or a liberal or some or something you stand for basically Western values I sense, right. Uh, and, and you, you sort of need the help of the outsiders to, to make change there because it would be very hard to do on your own. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:26:28       Well, you know, of course to help would be much appreciated, but when there is, what's the opposite of helping, they're just not helping at all and they're actually making everyone else feel like there's no problem, there's no problem then well what are you going to do? The problem is going to keep on escalating until it just blows up. So I don't, I, it's, it's, it's a tough question I think because I mean sure that help would be needed but not ruining it for us would be also appreciated.

Speaker 3:          00:27:02       Right. So on a day to day basis, living in Jordan, like how much is religion affecting? Well, are you religious at all? Do you have any religious? I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. So how much religious religiosity, religiosity, what's the word there? How much of that are you? Yeah, I think I got something close. Um, how much of that is affecting your day to day life?

Speaker 5:          00:27:25       Well, my day to day life isn't really a problem for me, but uh, if you look at other segments of society like women or homosexuals or you know, any kind of a traditionally marginalized group because Jordan is still a very patriarchal society. I'm like, what? Feminists in the US,

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       right, right.

Speaker 5:          00:27:48       Yeah. So I mean, being a woman, if you walk down the street, you're expected to be dressed appropriately, which is pretty much covered up and it's not really strict like in Saudi Arabia where you have to wear the veil. It's not like that, but like don't show legs or, you know, so it's kind of moderate in that sense. Um, the religiosity is pretty much everywhere. Like um, you always see these verses from the Koran or somewhere in the streets. You always hear the call to prayer five times a day. Um, so, and it's part of our language. We always say like, you might've heard this phrase, inshallah, of course. So yeah, a lot of the profit always come into these traditional phrases. We don't probably mean it to be religious, but it's just ingrained in us and yeah, it's just an escapable really. But I mean it's not as bad as elsewhere, so that's some hope for us.

Speaker 3:          00:28:51       Yeah. Well this was quick weight. We're basically wearing the same shirt. I just realized it's pretty close. Oh, so we're in good company. Listen, I could go way, way longer with you, but we got to go your third out of, out of 20, but it was a pleasure talking to you and let's stay in the loop and I hope to get Jordan one day.

Speaker 5:          00:29:10       Well you're always welcome. Great. Thank you so much. Don't tell us you're gay though.

Speaker 3:          00:29:17       We'll keep it quiet. Keep it quiet door. Alright, I'm here with Felix in Germany. Felix, you dressed for the occasion. Finally. Somebody that's looking sharp. That's nice to see.

Speaker 6:          00:29:28       Thank you. I mean you always dressed very well, so I thought I dressed up for location as well.

Speaker 3:          00:29:33       Very nice. You went up. Me with the Thai next time maybe I'll see what I can do. All right. So we got a lot of responses from Germany, I'd say after probably the United States,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       UK, maybe Canada, and then India. I think Germany was right there in the top five. So you're, you're the one that we selected from Germany. Uh, so tell me what's going on in Germany these days.

Speaker 6:          00:29:54       I mean the biggest thing is obviously the refugee crisis and the whole political fear that is surrounding that. So kind of all it is in trouble because we have people who don't agree with established politicians and established politicians fighting each other. So it's really interesting times.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       Yeah. So we've talked about it a little bit. Basically you guys have let in about one point $3 million, uh, immigrants or migrants or refugees, whatever you want to call them. You guys give them some pretty great social services, right? It seems like they get a lot. So what, what is the problem? What is, is there an integration problem? Is it more from the German side? Is it from their side? Is it both? Is it economics? What's going on?

Speaker 6:          00:30:41       See Dave, I would say it's not a problem with either the Jamon locals on the migrants or refugees themselves. It's a problem or systems. The government lead in all these immigrants who are not necessarily all refugees because there's really no proper control who gets in and who doesn't and they sought out later and a process that takes months until the whole asylum application goes through and then we take and one point 3 million of them, but there's no system to give them shelter effectively to integrate them, to teach them about the German culture. So what we get a lot of people bunched up in a really small place who come from different cultures than our home culture and then found their own little subcultures and don't integrate very well because they have nobody to really talk to except for the old people.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       Yeah. So does Germany have a sort of a special place in this? Because of the history with Germany and obviously xenophobia and World War Two in Germany has done a tremendous amount to to repair that in. The culture has completely changed. I think that's very obvious, but that there's a certain amount of guilt that you want to do the right thing and then they come here and then the systems as you're saying or just not in place. So it's like the idea doesn't quite match up with the reality of what's going on.

Speaker 6:          00:32:06       That's exactly what's happening in Germany. We have a certain type of unique political correctness and that we really still have the shame or the guilt and wanted to redeem ourselves basically, even though we are homeless, two generations removed from the events, but most Germans stove feel the need to be proper to other people and to help others so that the good will of helping these people and naturally people who come from civil war, written areas, there is a feeling off. You have to help them out. But I think the way we are doing it now is really failing those people in need and have this also failing the people locally in Germany.

Speaker 1:          00:32:50       Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, what happened on New Year's day in Cologne because I thought that was sort of a perfect example of why this whole debate is so crazy. So there were these massive attacks that mostly it sounds like they were mostly done by migrants, uh, assaulting women that were raped and all this stuff. And I saw the reaction of the left here immediately was saying, God, this is Islamophobia and all of this stuff that we, we talk about endlessly. And really it didn't have anything to do with that. If a group, if any group had attacked a whole bunch of women, uh, I would have been against that group. How was the reaction in Germany to that? Because it sounded like it took a couple of days for it actually to catch on. Right? And then people didn't really want to talk about it.

Speaker 6:          00:33:33       Well, it almost took a few weeks because the fact that those groups who assaulted than women were mainly immigrants was hidden away from the public essentially by a political officials and police. And the reaction was quite interesting because people were really afraid. And really angry about the situation and some on the left that the same as leftists in America and try to put it away from Islam as a religion or culture. And then on the right, a lot of people blame Islam or Muslims in general for that, which is obviously also way too extreme, but kind of the center is missing where we acknowledged the problem that there are cultural differences and if you put young males who come from this culture, I've been growing up in this culture, put them in a place and just let them have their own communities without any integration that these problems can occur and we'll look you. And that's where we have no solution for it because we can't acknowledge the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       Yeah. So with everything you've said so far, do you guys have a particular sort of fear of the right wing parties growing because because of the history of your country that you don't want these, the Zena phobic people to actually take power. And then at the same time, as we talked about all the time, if the left doesn't deal with these issues, honestly, it almost seems like the average person, the person that's in the middle that you're talking about, well then they go to where the only answer is being spoken of, even if it's not something they agree with.

Speaker 6:          00:35:10       That's exactly right. And that's what we've been seeing. I mean, that's always a move from the established politicians to band, the few very right wing parties, um, that, that we'd still have in Germany, which are really extreme, at least some of them are. And they always try to bend them via the legal system. But now what the channel of for Germany, the afd in Germany, that's a new party, it sprung in. All this controversy in Dave become very, very big and a lot of people jump onto that opportunity. But at the same time, a lot of right wing extremist obviously jumped on that. And the established politicians all try to pay in this new party, which is more conservative, more right wing into the Nazi Kona to isolate them. But then of course said you get a lot of extremists who join that party and you don't find the real discourse.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       Yeah. So one of the things that you wrote that I thought it was really, really great. So first off, you're starting a podcast with a Hungarian friend. Is He, is he in Germany or is he in Hungary or somewhere else?

Speaker 6:          00:36:16       So we just in Hungary, we've impersonal. We've only met once when I was at a time where you connected through the Internet just by chance. I met him one day and we started talking and talking and talking and because we both felt the need to speak out about politics, about philosophy, about our societies and to discuss how we can make them better. Uh, we started having night long discussions literally through the night until the sun came back up and at some point we, through shows like yours where you really emphasized the need to make your voice heard. We decided we have to do something and we decided to basically start a podcast to get other people in to discuss that stuff with us and to develop our opinions openly and to kind of make a difference.

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       Yeah. Well listen, I love that. And if every single person that watched this show started their own show and I became completely irrelevant, but the idea is one I would be, I'll be happy to retire on a, on a farm in Wyoming or something. So one of the phrases that you used in your email to us was the difference between a global network and a local network. And I, I thought this concept was really cool because it's very much what we're doing here and it's why I wanted to do this fashion show and we have 20 people I think in 18 countries or so, or 15 countries. Uh, so can you describe what you meant by that concept?

Speaker 6:          00:37:37       So a lot of our local networks like universities, schools, but cities and even countries are very isolated. We, we have a consensus usually in those networks, in universities, in America for example, you have all the social justice warriors having a real consensus and a lot of power, so you can't, I think as a modern human, you can't rely on that to get a full picture. So these global networks that are enabled by the Internet, our really Ed, where you can get your ideas challenged, where you can get new ideas, where you can exchange ideas and that's where you develop the good stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       Yeah. Well I love that. It's very much a concept that I believe in and that I'm trying to put into action and uh, we got to go, but definitely let me know when the podcast is up. Just email us again. I'll be happy to send people over there and I'll be a guest if you want. How about that?

Speaker 6:          00:38:29       Oh, that would be amazing. It's actually up now. We're on episode four now. Nice. And you can that on a needlessly complicated.com on, on itunes and everything else. And if you want to be honest, I'm happy to. I guess I am happy to send you an email.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       You'd be the host. I'll be the guest. How about that? Alright, so I am with Monica in Paris, France and Monica, you know, I got a zillion people that emailed from Paris, but your bio, your bio, just where you've bounced around from a little bit of your family's history. There was so much there that you were the winner from Paris.

Speaker 7:          00:39:06       Oh cool. Thanks.

Speaker 3:          00:39:08       Alright. So first off just tell me, so you told me that you grew up with two atheist parents, but that, that was also colored with a Mexican tradition and a Jewish tradition. Can you just explain some of that? Yes.

Speaker 7:          00:39:21       So my mom is from Mexico. She's from a city to the north of Mexico City and she emigrated to the United States as a baby and my dad is of Russian Ashkenazi descent and they both met in university. They've always been atheist, both of them and they raised me and my sister not to be atheist, but religion has never played a part of our lives and yet we were raised between the two cultures, which was quite difficult growing up in Arizona and California. We were never Mexican enough to be Mexican, never white enough to be white. So it was an interesting experience. Right. I'm very grateful for it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       Yeah, that's really cool. So then you bounced around pretty much all over the world. So can you give me like a one minute synopsis of just where you've bounced around and then we'll dig into some of the things that you want to talk about?

Speaker 7:          00:40:08       Yeah, sure. So I lived in Argentina for about a year and 2012 after that. Um, I lived in Israel for awhile and now I live in France, so I lived in a few different countries.

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       Okay. So let's go to some of the reasons that you've bounced around. So you met an Israeli and you move to Israel and then you were there during the Gaza War of 2014, I think. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:40:35       During protective edge,

Speaker 3:          00:40:36       protective edge. So tell me a little bit about what it's like to be in a country that is at war.

Speaker 7:          00:40:42       Uh, it was really scary. So I still remember the very first time I heard a missile, I was watching a show on my laptop and I heard an explosion and I didn't really think anything of it. And then I heard more explosions and then there were sirens and I had no idea what to do. I was living in a small house that didn't have a bomb shelter. So, um, I ran outside, my neighbors told me to run into bomb shelter next door and I, I couldn't have known. But then after that for the following months, it just became the norm, like at least minimum seven times a day. I found myself in a bomb shelter and I was an English teacher at the time and um, a lot of our class time was spent learning in bomb shelters.

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       Yeah. So what, what's that like being around kids when this is happening? I mean, you're literally, I assume every school they're probably has a bomb shelter, right? Like so the middle, the day you're teaching

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       and then suddenly we all have to run downstairs.

Speaker 7:          00:41:36       Yeah. So the kids know the drill. The kids are a yearly desensitized to it. It's just the norm for them, you know, inside the bomb shelters we have teaching materials and it was like everything just kind of kept going like normal for them. It's just part of their everyday.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       Yeah. So then okay, so you were there for that and then you moved to Paris and you were in Paris during the Paris attacks, right?

Speaker 7:          00:42:01       Yeah, so Charlie Hebdo happened just months after me arriving and my initial reaction was disappointment because I left Israel to kind of get away from all that a danger. And then I found myself in the middle of it again. I was shocked. I was really, I felt really angry. And then the way people reacted to an attack like that in Paris was so different than the way Israelis would have reacted.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       So that's one of the things that I thought was really interesting. So you mentioned that, that basically a lot of people said, oh, we're defending Charlie Hebdo, but that really privately, that's not really what they were doing. Right?

Speaker 7:          00:42:42       Yeah. So there was like a protest where people went out in the street and they were like holding up pencils and I didn't want to participate in anything like that because I'm just thinking like the people who shot these cartoonists and shot these artists, we're not trying to take away their pencils, like they were trying to kill them. It has nothing to do with your ability to write or draw a cartoon like they want to murder people. So I just felt like the reaction was very soft and I'm just very different than the Israeli reaction would've been.

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       So what, what would the Israeli reaction be? I mean, they are dealing with pretty much every day.

Speaker 7:          00:43:17       Really? Yeah. I think we all know what the Israel, yeah, reaction would have been, would have been something. Um, that's probably most of the world wouldn't have been very happy with that. Most of the world would protest against, um, and something that I would have protested against before I lived in Israel. When I went to Israel I was, I wouldn't have described myself as pro Israel, but now I would because it's just very different when you have missiles flying over your head and if it wasn't for that, um, iron dome interception system, you know, they could just fall on your head and kill you and all your friends and family. So it changed my perspective completely.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       Yeah. Interesting. So, okay, so then you were there for Charlie Hebdo then, then the more recent attacks at the theater. How has that changed a society because it does seem like that attack and then Brussels. Uh, and then we had the thing here in San Bernardino that now there is some piecing this all together across the globe. And I think it really felt like it started with that one.

Speaker 7:          00:44:15       I'm from San Bernardino by the way, is all getting very close to home for me,

Speaker 1:          00:44:19       man. You really are.

Speaker 7:          00:44:22       Okay. So the most recent attack was a very unsettling same. My, I had the same feeling towards the French reaction that I did for Charlie Hebdo, kind of just disappointment in the, the lack of, um, I don't know, have like a strong reaction. It was more just like a soft reaction that we have to protect people who haven't even been insulted yet. Everybody was just worrying about hurting a certain group of people's feelings instead of actually trying to get to the root of the problem. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       How deep is that? How deep is that feeling in France that. Because that, I mean, that's what we talked about when we talked about this regressive ideology that we care more about feelings over facts. How much does that sort of seeped into society over there?

Speaker 7:          00:45:15       I would say probably even more so than in America. Um, people here are very concerned about being politically correct. I'm in a country that has a very high, a percentage of north Africans and Muslims. People are very careful to choose their words. The media, um, is very careful about what they say and how they say it, which is a good thing and a bad thing. But I would say that now things have kind of died down, honestly. People have kind of forgotten about it. Security is very lax everywhere. Um, they still have some like emergency procedures in place ever since Charlie Hebdo, so it's been almost two years that we've had these emergency procedures. They're supposed to be in place, but like private and public security and Francis just not where it should be.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       Yeah. So the other thing that I wanted to talk to you about or that you mentioned is that there's, there's two things happening in France right now. So one is, is the immigration situation, uh, so you have all these migrants coming in and then at the same time basically Jewish emigration from France. So Jews leaving France is at an all time high. I was actually in Israel in November and I heard a tremendous amount of French being spoken there. I couldn't believe it. I mean, there were signs in French. All the places that were selling houses were written in Hebrew and in French. Um, so what, what's going on there?

Speaker 7:          00:46:39       So I can't speak too much about, um, the immigration of refugees to France because honestly, when you hear about it on the news, but it doesn't affect me at all. I don't see them. It just doesn't play a role in my life. So I can't really speak on that. But, um, I have been very involved in the French Jewish community, so I know how they feel about the situation in France and in Israel. So there's kind of this feeling and the French Jewish community, I don't want to say I'm not a victim hood, but, uh, they're very closed a network of people like in the Paris area and um, they always feel targeted and they feel like Israel is kind of like this Eldorado. It's like this thing that they idolize and it's like this ideal utopia that they all want to, uh, strive to be a part of.

Speaker 7:          00:47:29       So every time there's an attack, it's like the percentage of French Jews that leave France just skyrockets. But then another interesting phenomenon is that when I was in Israel, I met so many people who leave Israel after intending to settle. They're just like I did. There's actually a word in Hebrew for that. It's called Marita. So Alia is when you immigrate to Israel to go live there supposedly forever. Then there's even a word to describe leaving there forever because you just can't handle the quality of life. So French people encounter that. They leave. I'm hoping to find this, a network of acceptance and like living amongst Jews just going to be amazing and then they get there and realize that they were kind of sold a dream and a lot come back.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       Yeah. So it's sorta like the grass is always greener. You have it one way then you think. Okay, it's going to be better over there. Um, all right, well you've given me a lot and we're, we're plowing through all these interviews, but it was a pleasure talking to you and uh, and good luck with the rest of your adventures. Thank you so much. All right, I'm on with Ferran in Canada. Aaron, how are you?

Speaker 8:          00:48:34       I'm good, thanks. How are you doing guy?

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       I'm doing well. I've been enjoying talking to all these great people. So, uh, what's going on up in Canada these days? How's Canada?

Speaker 8:          00:48:43       Oh, Canada's fine. Uh, not as libertarian leanings. I'd like to turn myself, but uh, I'm working on it. Uh, I, I'm uh, I work with a organization called students for liberty and I'm currently going through training to be kind of in charge of the, uh, Canada. A sect of students for liberty. So working towards liberty. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:12       Yeah. Well, as you know, I've kind of been into libertarianism lately. I think it's very close to classic liberalism, which is really where I consider myself a. But speaking of your political leanings, my producer told me just a minute before we connected that apparently you're in breitbart related to something about Milo.

Speaker 8:          00:49:30       Yes. I just read the article this morning.

Speaker 3:          00:49:34       Can you tell me what it is? He literally just screamed something in my ear and then ran off.

Speaker 8:          00:49:37       Sure. While the name of the articles, like a, it's called Chinese for trump and it's basically talking about trans woman who a, either like Donald Trump or support him fully. I don't fully support him, but I liked him in many ways and I think his presidency could in some ways actually be helpful.

Speaker 3:          00:49:59       Yeah. But that's a strange place to be for a libertarian, right? Because he seems to be a big government, more of a liberal guy. But I think you like the, you like the sort of trolling unpolitical, correct.

Speaker 8:          00:50:10       I don't, I don't agree with his trade policies. I think that their economic 10 letter at A. I don't have a particularly strong stance on his immigration policies. Uh, yeah. So I'm not, I don't really like that. And uh, I read an article just the other day that uh, if he comes with his president, if he becomes president, that things like taxes to be resent and minimum wage would. So not that much.

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       It's a strange place for a libertarian. I don't support him, but there are certain parts of him that I like. Um. All right. So you gave me a lot on your, on your email entry. So let's, let's dive right into it. So first of all, you're a men's rights activist, correct? Yes. So can you explain what that means because I think a certain set of people get that and then another set think that something crazy and then, but I think the bulk of people just don't even understand what that means.

Speaker 8:          00:51:05       So a lot of people don't necessarily realize that they're not informed about the fact that men are falling behind or are discriminated against in many ways in today's society, in, in Canada, in America, whether it's the high suicide rates, whether it's the high rates of homelessness, uh, whether it's um, you know, men kind of getting the short end of the stick legally nowadays with all these rape cases. Um, and uh, and, and then there's domestic violence, which is also a huge problem and men really don't get seen. And the statistics on the knowledge on, on, on the true, the reality of domestic violence isn't really, isn't really known to most people. So I, I'm, I'm not an, I'm more than just an advocate. I'm an activist. I lead a men's rights group on my campus at Simon Fraser University and uh, we host monthly events inviting different people with different perspectives on men's issues.

Speaker 8:          00:52:12       Uh, we had Karen Straughn and uh, uh, I listened to him and last month and they have this coming up month. We're having a panel discussion event on different perspectives of the masculinity from men going their own way to mythic poetic, which you probably don't know if you're not into the man's married Merryman, and then there's the feminist perspective. So we're going to hold up, have a whole panel discussion. So it's really about boots on the ground activism. I'm really engaging with people, so I'm kind of taking the online. I'm one of the people taking online's fail offline and trying to raise awareness one on one.

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       Yeah. So I think for the average person watching this that doesn't know much about these issues, they're probably looking at you and saying, wait a minute, here's a trans woman into men's rights issues. That kind of flips everything on its head. Does that give you a certain cache within the community?

Speaker 8:          00:53:05       Um, I think that, um, it gives me a lot of freedom to say what is churn without being labeled a misogynist or sexist or this or that. I said a lot of things that if some average white guy said it, he would be maligned a, I think my being trans has helped a lot for our club in the sense that we haven't been protested much. We have, while we haven't protested at all, we haven't got too much backlash and I think it's because in the kind of regressive mindsets, uh, attacking a group that's led by what is in their minds and oppressed minority would be oppressing the minority. Even thought that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       Yeah. So you're sort of like Kryptonite in a way to them because because they judge you not by your individual ideas. Right? But they're judging you as solely a trans person. They know the trans person is high on the oppression Olympics chart, so then they can't really figure out how to attack you versus you're able to protect your own ideas. I mean, it's, it's actually kind of genius and also bonkers.

Speaker 8:          00:54:16       Well, well it's genius on. Yes, bonkers. I kind of realized that very early on, I realized when I realized that the reality of men's issues and how there isn't much a lot of spokespeople for men and men who suffer a, I realized that if, if not me, who are and who better than a transwoman, I realized right away the position I'm in and how I would be squandering a really great opportunity. So I totally, I totally use my identity as a trans woman to further men's rights and I'm not really ashamed of it because I want to help men and I want to further their discretion.

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       Yeah. So obviously I get the part that you've sort of insulated yourself from some of the criticism, but when you do get the criticism, it, does it feel particularly personal to you because you're trans and that, uh, I talked to another trans person, uh, that sort of like the thing of the moment.

Speaker 9:          00:55:16       Um,

Speaker 8:          00:55:17       no, no, I, I don't know. I criticism I get from kind of the regressive side. Um, I don't know. They don't generally try to really steer away from the fact that I'm trans. A lot of them. The criticism that has been launched at our club haven't even recognized me as the president then kind of try that. It wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole. Um, I mean I get criticism for being a female men's rights activists in general. I mean, there are other people could take issue with that because it's just kind of perpetuating a, you know, everyone focusing on women.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       Are there other women in the group?

Speaker 8:          00:56:02       Yes. It's actually our, our executive team is a three women and one guy.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       I mean, that's really fascinating.

Speaker 8:          00:56:14       Yeah. Uh, I find women or are law, uh, it's a lot easier for them to approach, let's say we're titling at club does so much easier for them to approach our table and start discussing and they don't fear A. I find a lot of men are kind of a kind of weary, uh, they're very afraid that they're going to be judged as a certain, you know, as they're going to be judged as misogynistic or sexist or why are you, why are you associating with those people? So it's actually quite a bit easier to, um, to attract women. But then when I hear about the men who are, who do come talk to us, uh, the men who kind of stir up the bribery, I have quite horrible stories, uh, in our, from being horribly abused by their girlfriends or having narcissistic mothers and fathers. Then I'm just, I hear, I hear already that truth of what's going on. Uh, and yeah, I would encourage men to, um, to come to a protest more because we are in that sense, kind of a safe space, if you will.

Speaker 3:          00:57:25       I would say spaces, right?

Speaker 8:          00:57:28       Uh, I like, I, I'm, I don't like spices if that means that you can't talk about certain things, but that's not really what it means in all contexts and more means that we want malign you if you feel certain ways, if you feel angry because a lot of men are angry and I understand that anger. I'm not going to tell them that they're just misogynists and sexists. Um, they're not going to get judged. They're going to have at least an understanding. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:57:56       It's about it. It's not a safe space of ideas. It's just a, a safe space of judgment. Which are two different things.

Speaker 8:          00:58:03       It's an understanding, compassionate space. How about that?

Speaker 3:          00:58:06       Yeah. Um, so what's, what's next after this? So, you know, when you get out of school, is this something that you want to pursue it at a career level or are you interested in other things altogether?

Speaker 8:          00:58:18       Well, I'm currently finishing up my music composition degree, which is completely separate from what I'm doing, but I actually want to go into law and probably constitutional law. But um, I think in, in, in my past and law, I can, I'm definitely influenced some real, at least legal challenge, uh, where it helps men and, but also just defending constitutional rights and, and you know, our human rights on a very basic level and a kind of putting my effort into keeping the state

Speaker 3:          00:58:52       small. That's the libertarian part. There you go. Well listen, we could obviously do a lot more, but unfortunately we gotta we gotta cut it short, so I really enjoyed talking to you and uh, good luck with everything.

Speaker 8:          00:59:04       I enjoyed talking to you as well. Um, thank you so much for the opportunity Dave.

Speaker 3:          00:59:07       Alright, I'm on with Tomi from the UK. Tommy, has it gone? Very good. Thank you very much. How are you? I'm doing well. Uh, so your story, you know, everyone's sending me these great sort of life stories and what they want to talk about. There was something interesting

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       right at the beginning of yours. You're originally from Nigeria and you moved to the UK the day before nine slash 11. So you moved on September 10th, 2001. Can you describe a little bit of that?

Speaker 10:         00:59:36       Yeah. Um, when I first got the news about that I was a topical double decker, you know, the sort of British buses. Sure. What the, the two stage, the two level of bosses are the top of that and that's when we heard the news about that something has happened in New York and some explosion of something about abusers. And then we go home and then I sort of saw the peaches about all of what happened and you know, it didn't, I didn't really understand the gravity of what had happened. I mean, I understood it was, you know, horrible thing. Um, and uh, many people died book, it wasn't years, so he is elated. I sort of really understood, I, you know, the world has changed in any radical way. So that was sort of my, my earliest memory coming into the UK. Um, so in a sense of sort of a baptism of fire sorts. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       Talk about a crazy time to move to the west. So let's back up a little bit. Tell me a little bit about growing up in Nigeria. What, what kind of family you came from and what made you guys move to the UK or do or did you move by yourself? I'm actually on it.

Speaker 10:         01:00:42       No, I moving, I'm moving my father, my mother, my mother. My mother is a nurse. She wasn't as many as Nigeria. I'm going to say she because of you, you do know we have an nhs. Yeah. And there's a high demand for nurses in the UK. So she moved over to the UK about two years before we moved to join her on. My father was a journalist and used to be an editor in oil and gas magazine in Nigeria. So we moved together and myself, my younger brother would move together with him on and we moved basically, essentially to have the best education in the UK, um, antidote our mother. And so that was, you know, a little bit. It's my family. It's true.

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       Yeah. What, what was life like in Nigeria? People, you know, you hear about Nigeria but we don't know really. At least here in the West or in the US, we don't talk about Nigeria that much. Tell me a little bit about what it was like,

Speaker 10:         01:01:30       um, growing up in Nigeria, life was fun. Um, you know, you out there with your friends playing it was in a child, childhood was the best time, you know, you know, can the world. Although during the time when I was going in Nigeria growing up in Nigeria, we had the dictator, general sunny. I betcha. Um, and he, he was a very ruthless guy. Um, you know, destroyed the country to meet a lot of ways economically embezzled a lot of money. But Nigeria is a very resilient. They are probably the most resilient people in the world, you know, you put them in the middle of the Sahara desert, they start sending you sand say so Nigeria's a very resilient. So we, we, we, we got through, we survived, we did well, you know, went to school and things like that. Um, but towards me, towards the time I was coming to the UK, he passed away and there was massive parties in the streets and everything like that. So, uh, yeah, so that starts how much hated he was. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:02:29       and then did another dictator come in right after him. I don't even know the history

Speaker 10:         01:02:33       after that we had a civilian, um, um, uh, we had the office democracy after many years of, of going through, um, generals and dictates is basically. And so we had a passenger will become president and he ruled, boy, he was also corrupt in many ways. Um, and, and he's also from the same tribe that I am in Nigeria, but many from my partner and Andrea especially, my dad didn't like it because it was not a fan man. So, um, we had that, but now we were a country that's struggling a lot. We just had our, our president's going to the UK for some anticorruption socks and he's trying to give back some money because the country has been really hammered by, by previous regime is basically.

Speaker 3:          01:03:20       Yeah. All right. So let's flash forward to today. One of the things that you wanted to talk to me about, something that we've touched on the show I'll just a tiny bit, but brexit, it's obviously huge for you guys over there. Now. You Support Brexit, right?

Speaker 10:         01:03:32       Yes. I am a big supporter of brexit. I'm a big supporter of Brazil as an engineer and I'm a big supporter as a first generation immigrant out in support of breast as a British citizen. And it, it, it rests essentially on this principle. I asked myself this question if I was in Nigeria and I found that, that the, uh, the political system was controlled by another political system that was based in Cairo in Egypt, and they've made it past our laws. They told us what to do with our fishes and in our waters and all that kind of stuff. I'd give upset about that. I'll say, I'll say that's not fair. We can't. Nigeria's should have control over their own laws and over their own borders and everything. So I, I look at it from a point of view. He's Nigerian living in Nigeria and this happens in Nigeria. How would I feel and tickets to the UK now that is exactly what is happening to the UK. We have a situation whereby we have a European Commission that is not elected or passes a law that we have to abide to and we can vote them out of office. So it's essentially a sort of a dictatorial system of sorts.

Speaker 3:          01:04:41       Yeah. So how much of your feelings about that is fueled by just the border situation? Because one of the things, I think we've done about 12 interviews now and one of the things that almost everyone has wanted to talk to me about in Europe is the immigration stuff and the border stuff and the migrant stuff and all that. So how much of your feeling is just wrapped up just in that you want the UK to be able to control its own borders?

Speaker 10:         01:05:02       I, I think that's, I think that's an, I think that's a very essential part of the brexit argument. But the border, the border situation is tangential to the real issue. And I guess since I'm not an indigenous, um, the way I feel about integration might be slightly different, but I have a lot of sympathy to indigenous indigenous. We are seeing that in, if they feel the sense that the country's been overwhelmed and they have no control over. So I have an appreciation and I sympathize with that. My biggest problem is that if we do not give us control of over the borders, it will lead to a situation of social tensions. And as soon as he's an immigrant and you know, I'm black and I in you don't know. So, so, um, so as someone who is an immigrant, I feel like if you create so much social tension within the system, it will, there'll be a backlash. And so my, my, my biggest worry about this whole EU controller, neal, that the control the he puts on different nations is that it doesn't allow nations to act autonomously so it doesn't give them that sort of self will to, to, to do things and that leads to frustration and that's what we see the rise of the far right and the far left in Europe now.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       Yeah. So I'm curious. So as a first generation immigrant, it's really interesting. You're, you're framing this not only from your perspective, but you are looking at the people that live there before you and sick saying that they have some legitimate fears or maybe some of it's not fully legitimate, but you're acknowledging it. I'm curious, has some of the sort of regressive ideology has that affected you in that? I think most people would probably look at you and say that you're black and that you're an immigrant and that you should be for fully open borders or some something along those lines.

Speaker 10:         01:06:54       I, I like to see it. He's a fair minded person and I, I also like to deal with the realities of life. So back nine, Joanne, I'm from omb in the late eighties we had a massive immigration from Ghana, which is an under a west African nation into Nigeria because they had an economic downturn bought that, put a little pressure on, on jobs and services in Nigeria, and they became these chants, you know, this, this, this movement called gun on goat. No, that wasn't a, a sort of a racist movement, but in that I could see and appreciate that whenever you have a massive influx of immigration open, showed immigration, it's under the place. It leads to social tensions and you can look at it throughout history and throughout everywhere in the world. And so we have to do with this bear the image. I'm pro immigration. Immigration is good, but it has to be controlled. It has to be sensitive. But I mean it has to be at the behest and at the will of the people. If not, it's going to lead to trouble. And, and that's, that's where I think this discussion needs to be, to be hard.

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       Man. You're talking to a lot of sense. Why aren't you on TV?

Speaker 10:         01:08:05       You know, I, I don't speak a lot of pc stuff, so

Speaker 1:          01:08:10       on that, on that note, I'm going to let you go without saying anything, but I'm going to let you go without saying too crazy. It was really,

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       it was a pleasure talking to you. All right. I am on with Marcello who is in Maine in the United States via Brazil. Am I correct?

Speaker 11:         01:08:23       Yes, you're right. I'm from Brazil.

Speaker 3:          01:08:26       That is quite a move to go from Brazil. It's hot and now cold. What people are supposed to go the other way. What are you?

Speaker 11:         01:08:32       Thank you. Yeah. I actually lived before he, Connecticut initially when I moved to us. Then I lived one year in Miami, so I kind of experienced them warm back and now back in me and it was just mostly for my work. Right. What kind of work do you do? I'm a physician.

Speaker 3:          01:08:50       Right, right. Okay. We're going to get into a little bit of that. I knew that actually. Uh, but. So one of the things that you wanted to discuss with me was how regressive attitudes and this ideology had really infected Brazil and how you saw it, a change attitudes in Brazil. So can you tell me a little bit about that?

Speaker 11:         01:09:08       Yeah. Brazil overall is a pretty hardcore left leftist country. The culture in Brazil was taken over by hardcore socialist in the last about 30 years they took over the church is the, the press, the universities, and uh, they, they have this mindset of not wanting to debate ideas. So the way that they see things is that if you're not, if you don't not agree with them, then you should shut up. You should basically get out of the way. And this is quite concerning because you see people who had these a will to learn and getting to debate and, you know, and I think that's how country's progress, how that's how ideas, debating ideas. That's how we get to a Como status to a place for everyone. And when you can, my language, brother, there you go. Um, and, and that's actually what caught me to your show initially. Uh, this idea of fighting for free speech and in Brazil basically the more skilled and now in la in the last 10 years I would say there's a conservative movement surging so small as to not empower, but at least there is another way of thinking kind of surgery and people are interested, people are actually looking to it and an amazing, Whoa, Whoa, this exists, you know, like, oh, that makes sense. And that's very interesting. And it's very unfortunately that went in that direction.

Speaker 3:          01:10:41       So that's really fascinating. So you're saying basically in the last 10 years as a result of this regressive ideology taking root that now conservatism is bubbling up and that is what is defending free speech. It sounds a little backwards for the way America is, although right now I see that happening here because strangely it's conservatives that are defending free speech and the left that's trying to stifle it. So it's really everything's kind of upside down.

Speaker 11:         01:11:06       No, I totally agree with you. And uh, I'm not sure if there's a direct effect of that or if it's just, um, people really. When do you read about new ideas? They get interested even if they don't agree initially, when they have had the freedom to do it. Um, they, so there are some thinkers, some riders in Brazil that 10 years ago started writing some stuff and that's when actually I started reading more about conservatives, more about America, the free speech ideas, the individual rights and the dit of you're able to see whatever you want and you're fine if you don't like it, that's fine. That's fine. I like it. And there's not the way in Brazil before. And I saw for example, journalists actually, uh, having to move away from Brazil in order to be able to speak. And that's that for me. It's something unacceptable. It shouldn't happen.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       Yeah. I have to say that, uh, until I read your email, I really didn't realize how bad things had been in Brazil. Uh, so one of the things that you wrote that was interesting is that you started getting interested in conservative writers and that sort of helped your awakening. And now you're saying many years later these conservative ideas are becoming cool again down there. Who were some of the writers that you were interested in?

Speaker 11:         01:12:23       Well, initially I started reading proceeding on rikers and one of them was a philosopher called Paul offit, car carvana. He'd currently lives in Virginia. He's well known for, well known writer in Brazil who actually had to move away. He's one of them and he lives in Virginia. US. Um, he's a big fighter against communism, socialism in Brazil of free speech for free speech guy. I started reading his stuff. I then started reading American writers like almost soul, um, um, uh, uh, Henry House Lit, uh, and this other guys from other countries as well and from other Chicago schools freedom. And more recently I've been reading a lot of things that dinesh d'souza rights. Um, so there are few conservatives and they usually disguise, they defend free speech, they defend a free exchange of ideas and some of them were actually leftist before, like a David Horowitz as a hardcore left blackfoot cysts. Fomo Saul was a leftist and they, when he got in contact with the ideas of conservative, they kind of Linda the other direction.

Speaker 1:          01:13:32       Yeah. I've really been doing my best to get Thomas, so the show, I don't know how much public stuff he does anymore, but I'm working on it. So stay tuned on that one. Um, so okay, so you move up here and you've already seen the damage that these ideologies have done in your home country. So what do you make of what they're doing to America right now?

Speaker 11:         01:13:54       It's like seeing a movie again. Um, and, and it actually changed a lot. I feel like it changed a lot in the last, let's say eight years, seven years since I moved. I'm not sure why, but I see happening things that I never thought it would be possible here when I moved to America, saw, you know, the universities here are the best universities in the world. They probably have very free environment for new ideas, for speech, for debate. And then a window you see cases like Ms Dot Arvizu, uh, where the professor was saying that's the muscle here to shut off a student, a student. And then you see guys that just to stay with guys they're interviewed, they're Shapiro mile being like there was violence against them and, and they cannot even speak any morning campuses. And your see left is even leftists powers one of the journalists who wrote a book about the left shutting up,

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       Christina,

Speaker 11:         01:14:49       Christina bars. So even this guys, people are. Wait, what is, this is not cool. This is not, this is not good for anybody.

Speaker 3:          01:14:57       So what, what do you do in your own personal life to combat this stuff? I guess this is the example of the right here and you're talking to me so that. So that's pretty good. But really as someone that has seen the damage of this and you see this happening now, is there, I mean, do you post stuff on facebook, the uh, try to get stuff out there to combat some of this?

Speaker 11:         01:15:15       Yeah, I use my facebook a lot. I have a lot of American friends. I have friends. I'm very political on facebook and I'm glad that I'm still live in a country that is very free, that I'm not afraid. Like I was in Brazil. People in Brazil are afraid of speaking out things against the government. For example, I'm here. No, I'm, I'm, I, I feel comfortable. So I'm very, I'm very active in facebook and I usually try to use the experience that I have in Brazil and, you know, push my American friends so they can see the parallel, you know, to try to avoid. I wouldn't be poor, but just the American going directions.

Speaker 3:          01:15:49       Do you have American friends that are friending you yet and blocking you and all that kind of keep track of them I guess. I guess in some cases you wouldn't know. Right. Okay. So the other thing, let's move away from politics a little bit, although everything is political. So you mentioned that you're a physician and one of the things that you want us to talk about was the free market and healthcare. Uh, we don't have a ton of time left, but can you just go with that?

Speaker 11:         01:16:14       Um, yeah. Basically just a short thing. In Brazil we have free healthcare, meaning the government takes over everything and that's where exactly where I see people dying for lack of basic care. People waiting in lines for six months to get an Mri when they have cancer and a timeline that's very common. Um, and I believe that as anything else in life, when the free market he's able to share work, it works better than the government. So I think in that sense where you're going the wrong direction. We America has a very good healthcare. We have problems that can be solved. We have to sit down and see what the best policies to get. Um, but I think the fundamental idea is that we should go towards more free market because competition makes prices go down, makes things more available services more available. I wanted a system that gives us iphone, new TV, new cars for cheap. I don't want a system where she did my healthcare to bureaucrats who spend $1,000,000,000 should make a website that doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       Right. So for you in the, in the personal sense as a physician, how have you seen the healthcare economy changing the. I mean it's obviously changed hugely in the last three years alone. What have you seen firsthand?

Speaker 11:         01:17:29       Well, I, I work in a hospital, but I hear it, I think at the hospital up, haven't we hadn't had the, the, the hip from obamacare yet, but I see a lot of people who work as an office outside with, uh, outpatient, uh, retiring because they just couldn't handle it anymore. Um, I see a lot of regulations coming in, increasing the price is because every single regulation, every single pile of new rules costs. Uh, so when you, when you get more government in between patients and physicians you have, do you have a more cross? So prices go up and I've even seen this, uh, and we don't have the obamacare fully implemented yet. I think there are more things to come and then make maybe make things even worse.

Speaker 3:          01:18:17       Listen, if I ever need a full frontal lobotomy because of the regressives, is that something you can do?

Speaker 11:         01:18:23       I'm not a neurosurgeon, but I don't want her to have a lobotomy. I think are very good fighter for freedom. We need you.

Speaker 3:          01:18:29       All right, fair enough. Well listen, it was a pleasure talking to you. I wish we had more time, but we gotta keep going.

Speaker 11:         01:18:33       It was my pleasure. Thank you so much for letting me participate in a show.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       All right. I'm talking with you from Switzerland. Has It gone?

Speaker 12:         01:18:40       I'm pretty fine. Yeah, I'm fantastic. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       Good. That seems like the answer that someone from Switzerland would give. I'm pretty fantastic. People think everything's great over there, Huh?

Speaker 12:         01:18:51       Well, life is actually pretty great. So, um, yeah, everybody's happy around here and we need to show that.

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       Yeah, no, I like hearing that because, you know, we talk about a lot of heavy stuff on the show, but it's nice to know that things are working. But one of the things that you mentioned you wanted to talk about is the dreaded regressive left and how their ideology is changing society in Switzerland. So go ahead.

Speaker 12:         01:19:15       Well, um, the regressive left in Switzerland or the equivalent of them. Yeah. They're not really out there in your face like in other countries, but the actions speak volumes of course, you know, I mean, they've always been there, but um, yeah. And I keep on staring at the party now. I mean, we recently had a case like in the tabby that's just around the corner from reality in which you don't, two boys from a school from Syria with a very strong religious background refused to shake hands with a female teacher. Yeah, yeah. You heard about that? Yeah. That made news here. And uh, you know, the reason behind that was because they didn't want to suddenly her dignity's by touching her rights. And this of course all stemmed from the father who is the preaching of a local mosque. And yeah, this a stood quite controversy here and um, you know, and of course, you know, the reactions were huge, you know, I mean we had to write shouting, I'm all the way down that it's not acceptable.

Speaker 12:         01:20:17       And the Ivr and you had left. I'm playing everything down saying like, you know, it's, it's just a handshake, you know, if you want to go and do some handshakes, we can go to the streets and do that. It's not big of the asshole. Most of all. They all kept on saying it's against loads is fine. Right. But I think what noise people more and the reason why they're so passionate about the whole ot was because, um, the decision of the school by just tolerating that without actually any article to know, which is quite an aggressive thing to do now. And uh, you know, um, of course concerns were made by the people by seeing night and they wanted to start this discussion. Now it's not particularly about the handshake itself, which also refused the moderates in our country and they're, they're just asked themselves stuck.

Speaker 12:         01:21:07       They want to start a question though. Like what is an acceptable into of integration? What is acceptable in terms of religious freedom, you know, and this basic as has been washed out. But just saying like I'm saying like now it's not that big a deal, you know, it's, and it also interviewed them. I'm the head teacher for the school. And he also kept on saying it's not against the rules and that's about it. I just don't want to put ourselves out there too much. You know, and this annoyed quite lot of people because you know, the reason why they feel passionate about this whole ordeal was not because, you know, check itself is because the discussion which has never been actually made, you know, this was kind of, you know, a big deal here around. Yeah. So it's not about the actual handshake, nobody really cares about that, but it's just about the creeping idea behind it, which is that, that these boys will grow up and not necessarily respect women or treat women as equals and then that becomes an actual societal problems.

Speaker 12:         01:22:06       So it's not about a bunch of young boys whether they shake this one person's hand or not. Well I think it was more about like, you know, what are the ground rules integration here. We just want to talk about that and we don't actually want to talk too much into the future because we don't know what actually would happen. You know, it was just like let's just talk about it. And at some point it was just not possible edible and it didn't end at that point. Actually, I made the pots capitals 30 and instead of bringing out, and there was another recent case in another city Lucerne, which is quite a famous this nation in Switzerland, but it was actually a dentist, this dentist who fused to operate on patients. The patient happens to be a Muslim woman and she refused to give him a handshake because it's, it's just a thing she doesn't do.

Speaker 12:         01:22:55       He refused to operate on her because he, his argument was um, you know, I'm a patient doctor relationship is based on trust. If the trust is not, I cannot buy the best wheel and by the best capabilities of my conscious I cannot operate on her, you know, although of course that this has, you know, blowing up again, you know, like people asking like, haven't you made something like the hippocratic oath or something, you know when you said like, yes I did. But the only challenge with them with emergency status, you know, it's, it's, and, and she can choose whoever talked to she actually wants, you know, it's actually the same thing just in opposite positions, you know, I mean, it has closed. It has no feeling, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:23:38       Right. So this is like with us, you know, it's like these bakers that don't want to bake a cake for a gay wedding and it's like, what should the role of the government be and should we force people to do all this stuff? Um, so one of the other things that you wanted to talk about was the amount of Americans that are moving to Switzerland. So that's a different type of immigration that you have going on there. Tell me about.

Speaker 12:         01:23:59       Yeah, you can see the other side of the story too. Yeah. I mean, uh, of course the amount of Americans still pales in comparison to the EU, which the most people immigrated come from, but they are quite a lot of Americans coming here because Switzerland supplies about is home to many and major global companies. And of course eventually they get a chance to come my here and then themselves next steps program. So after someone else they can go back and most of my coworkers actually decided to stick around a little bit longer because they learned to appreciate the high wages on the security. And Nice infrastructure to before who I'm optimistic, positive. Of course there are some bad things here as well. And you know, like the depressive Sunday where everything is closed and the high cost of living, but usually they like the social security network here around and stick around here.

Speaker 12:         01:24:58       And uh, I think is. I have to tell you a little story, sorry about that. We're also, um, a household. We speak a couple of languages, right? And we speak also English and before my tall to enter the kingdom hall. And she actually, we had to fill out the form explaining how good the German was actually. So the oldest so she can keep up in school, you know, I was just actually, uh, yeah, it's, it's a sensible thing to do. And now after the signing of the letter I received from the Department of Education, I received a letter, an annual let's actually demanding for me to organize the German classes. And of course I was actually surprised I was calling up and asking what's the reasoning behind this? Because I do speak Swiss German pretty well actually. I'm not bidding cities in consumables. And she actually was very surprised.

Speaker 12:         01:25:44       He thought like, Oh yeah, you know, I'm, I'm sorry about that. I mistook it for someone else because you know, there are some people who have more issues and I've thought about that. Yeah, I my name, age. No, maybe she thought about Asian people will do actually have some difficulties learning switch because it's bad. And she told me, actually no, I thought your American, because I'm American American, she told me private, of course the American, a lot of those people have most difficulties willing to have most difficulties and to want students with German actually because I'm. One of the reasons is because they just spent just, they're just going to be here for five years and the oldest is just that reviews are because. And that's what she said, you know, it's like, um, yeah, that's actually no need for us to do because you can also speak English.

Speaker 12:         01:26:35       But it's actually true. Most people actually in the, in the area to speak English. It's actually no, the reverse thing of the whole thing know. I mean it's like, of course not all the Americans. I mean, I have many friends who were Americans this but as a found out and my surroundings and stuff quite sensitive because now this whole thing, interesting and after learning more about this, I really found out that there's really something, some with some Americans here and not willingness to assimilating based and after asking know, um, um, after coding and um, my uh, ex employee who happens to work with the office of statistics inside like, yes, because you know, now something like, I'm not all of them, but some of them have something like a special snowflake syndrome, you know, something like that. Yeah, we do it all. Well anyway, you can speak English, so why should I know.

Speaker 1:          01:27:33       Right. And that's, that's really fascinating because it also shows that this, all this integration stuff and immigration stuff and migrants stuff, it's not just about religion, it's culture because now you're telling me that Americans are coming there. It's not because of religion that they're not integrating, but it's partly language only going to be there for five years. There used to always speaking English listening. We could go on way longer and I didn't get to handle it. I didn't get to half the stuff I wanted to talk to you about, but we got to go so I thank you very much. All right. I'm on with Stefanos from Greece to Fido's. How's it going?

Speaker 13:         01:28:04       It was long. Like I said previously, as long as they have it still money in the bank just by the capital controls being implemented.

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       Yeah, I can still live. All right. So that seems like a sort of depressing but good place to start. So we don't hear much about Greece in the American media, but you guys are going through a massive financial crisis right now. So I know, I know you're not an expert in economics, but can you sort of lay it out just what the average person in Greece is going through right now?

Speaker 13:         01:28:40       So let's just say that the minimum wage here is a 500 euros. Okay. And show me one one coast cold that can live like that. Just so. So to me it's impossible. You can't do that. And I'm again, say fine, it's 500 euros but can't go until he stops me slightly less, but no thinks memo dot dms that we other being imposed by miracle and the rest of the EU officials and we have to pay like we have pretty much the taxation of Germany and the wages and benefits of Uganda.

Speaker 1:          01:29:29       Right. So basically you guys, because of the conditions that the EU helped grease out with, your taxes are very high and you have a lot of people that are getting a lot from the government. So there's not a lot to go around. Is that pretty much fair to say?

Speaker 13:         01:29:42       Yeah. And so it's only the useful to the number one, eh, eh, the ones responsible for this. It might be no, use my government, this, Theresa and the government that we have right now. And they're the ones before them. New Democracy for example, if I saw, etc. So they're responsible for this.

Speaker 1:          01:30:06       Yeah. So how do you feel, I mean, in general, look, democracy came from Greece. Modern philosophy came from Greece. Greece has given so much in terms of freedom and free thought to the world. How do you feel about what's happening in Greece at the moment?

Speaker 13:         01:30:22       Yeah. If only that existed here and it goes, it's a big my 16 extinct species by now here. And the problem here is that, uh, let's see the elections, the elections, you know, being killed by a gold, gold singular logic that works with the government to count all the votes, etc. So at the surface it's all fine and dandy until you get to realize that, uh, this company, it belongs to the old sites. No, the ones, the big bad bankers, which be honest, a Canada and there are, I think behind the scenes of all this nonsense.

Speaker 1:          01:31:11       Right? So You guys are sort of caught between the european union and the bankers that are kind of funding the election, sort of. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:31:17       They're the oneS benefiting from this crisis.

Speaker 1:          01:31:19       Yeah. All right, well let's, let's get away. Let's get away from politics for a minute because it obviously can be a pretty sobering. Uh, one of the things you wanted to talk to me about was gamergate, which a lot of people jumped on the gamer gate idea. Anything specific on gamer gate or how did you get involved in it? Were you in it from the beginning

Speaker 13:         01:31:37       and once you've moved in? The moment I heard about this story of having sex with one of the, the eh, the journalist in goto when he posted there, If you have a quest, if I'm right that game. So it is obvious that the, oh, this gaming journalism websites I got up and they all have these feminists. Dsa was in all these people defend this. Like why defend this? The, they don't care about gamers don't get up us.

Speaker 1:          01:32:20       So that, that's why I was so interested in gamer gate. Even before I, you know, I used to be a gamer like in the eighties and nineties and now like I love the culture around video games but I don't play that much. But I thought the whole thing was fascinating because you guys were dealing with so much of the stuff that we talk about now. The gamers, we're dealing with all the social justice warrior stuff, all the collusion between, you know, creators and the publishers and all of that and feminism and, and all of this stuff. And that sort of seeped up into society which is a good transition for you. Also wanted to talk about cultural marxism and I think that's very much related. So how has cultural marxism, the ideas of it taking root in Greece right now?

Speaker 13:         01:33:04       Good. Say that pretty much invented eh cultural marxism really throuGh the fact that we have like series a and next thing, those are the parties under a. Yeah, which is not doing parliament right now. They get like one percent of the vote or soMething and the radicals and there was also also known as the socialist which uh, was responsible for the grants that we live right now. Like they were promising to people things that on the surface are needed, like high wages, a pensions benefits and all that good stuff. But what they do, well they did, let's say during the eighties they tripled that way. So that's fine. But they did well not acknowledging that you to do that, you have to take some counter measures as well, like you have to decrease a taxation for the company so that they can pay their employees and they didn't do that.

Speaker 13:         01:34:18       And as a result, a lot of interest industries that we had back then, like, uh, uh, we used to have great bosses, for example, we had that car industry small but still relevant at the time. And as a result, they all closed down in the situation was Getting worse and worse. And now that wayne, we eh carbon to be in the eu and despite the things that were being told by the media that oh my god, the u is our home and if we live will turn into North Korea. It's fuckinG laughable. And how am I supposed to take you seriously after this? So basically the problems that we have, a pretty much, eh, eh, have gone plus 10 right at the moment. We joined the eu and the eurozone in 2001. I think.

Speaker 1:          01:35:13       So when, uh, uh, I guess it was about a year ago when the financial crisis seemed to be at its worst right before the eu came in and bailed out again. But you're saying this is a pretty crappy situation, but what was it like, like when you couldn't go to the atm and get money out, didn't they stop money coming up? Like what did that feel like for you and for your family when it feels like the system is collapsing?

Speaker 13:         01:35:36       It's difficult. They found the fact that you have to take only 60 euros per day. The atm and yeah, we kind of have to adjust that.

Speaker 1:          01:35:50       All right. Listen, we could talk about so much. We went, we went pretty heavy here. Listen, where's the best place for Slovakia in athens?

Speaker 13:         01:35:57       Uh, there are several restaurants we didn't get by gyros, know that, but uh, I can really tell it's entirely up to you. But one warning, if you see that kind of like a lot of olive oil avoided,

Speaker 1:          01:36:14       stay away from the gyros with a lot of olive oil. All right, well

Speaker 13:         01:36:18       no, they, they're not really that they said at least to me.

Speaker 1:          01:36:22       fair enough. Alright. It's about us. It was a pleasure talking to you. Thanks man. All right. I am on with joe from Egypt. Can I call you joe or should I call you the last pharaoh?

Speaker 14:         01:36:31       Yeah, fine. Joseph. Joe is fine. Let's try it. Wouldn't be like a bit awkward. So

Speaker 1:          01:36:37       yeah. All right. So for people that don't know you, you're the only person we selected out of the 20 people that I actually do know of because I follow you on twitter and you are a youtube or by the name of the last pharaoh and you do really some great videos talking about atheism and secularism and being an ex muslim and the regressive left. All of this stuff. Uh, but before we get into that, tell me your 31 in Egypt. how is life in Egypt these days?

Speaker 14:         01:37:06       Well, it's kind of okay. I mean by look out when I, when people ask me that question, I always like to think you'd like to give myself some hope to say at least I'm not living in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia. So you're not just, yeah, just be able to, you know, to function and actually like on a day to day basis, I really don't feel like that much of it, just like for other people, other people are getting like bad, but for me I maybe because I just have thick skin or something, I don't know, I'm not really feeling that affected. So yeaH.

Speaker 1:          01:37:42       So we don't have to go too much into the politics because I want to really focus on what you're doing. But you know, he was only, what, three, four years ago that the arab spring happened and you guys lived under mubarak who was basically a dictator for 30 something years. You then you had the muslim brotherhood by, by democratic elections for a year. Then they get overthrown by the military again. And that's where you're at now. Um, yeah. So two people there. What, how do they feel just about the whole system? Is there a feeling that democracy is ever going to come back? Do they want democracy to come back because it didn't really work for that year. Like what's the feelinG there? Well, yeah,

Speaker 14:         01:38:19       to like differentiate between like two, like glasses with people. So we have like that majority of egyptians, like their normal everyday, like dental people do. I would say they're like, I don't, I'm not happy right now as, as they should, but they're like kind of okay with it. Like what would look with the current government, they were not happy during the muslim brotherhood even more, even less happy than deal with under mubarak. So that, that was like, that was gonna work at all that the whole thing. So bonked the political class in Egypt, which I happen to just saying that like 90 percent of them are idiots, but uh, yeah, they're not happy with anything which I think is, do you have like this like kind of like aggressive his jaw kind of a thing happening like all the time and they're not focusing on what's important.

Speaker 14:         01:39:09       So they're just make big deals about nothing. While it will not talking about people going to jail for just saying like normal, like just stupid shit. The sick people are going to jail for making jokes about feeling like balloon balloon condoms with air and handed them out so they just send them to prison. Some people just went to prison because of the glue, like sketch comedy on youtube or something. They sent them to prison. So I think the most important thing that, that needs to change in Egypt, not another gene, not the economy economy, and they're just doing what they can. I mean the government, they, they, they have, uh, they have an interest to just do as bit as best as they can. What I really think is important is the whole free speech and like the blasphemy law, the, that

Speaker 1:          01:39:56       modesty laws, these kinds of loads need to go because the constitution actually doesn't allow it. Some people should just focus on that, uh, raising the money getting goes, like laws in front of the parliament or in front of even the constitutional court. Because the egyptian constitution, if you read it and forget it from Egypt, you really want to know that it's for me because it's like 99 point nine percent secular, like really freedom of speech like has its own article that's like totally guaranteed, no restrictions moment in invitations under any circumstances. So the fact that we have laws punishing people because the insulted this guy or the president or like some. I don't know anyone, it's unconstitutional. It's like 100 percent unconstitutional. Yeah. So with all that in mind, I mean, where do you get the balls to do what you do? You're showing me your face right now. I asked you before we started recording if it was okay if we wanted to do something different or whatever, wear a mask or whatever, but I mean you'd put your videos out there with your. You're, you're incredibly brave and clear and honest. I mean,

Speaker 14:         01:40:57       okay. Just I don't see. Oh okay. that's better. Yeah. I don't see it like that. I just see it. Like I said that before to a lot of people are not doing the videos anonymously to hide it. Just like my, you know, my privacy kind of that I don't like putting my face on camera all the time. Yeah. But I mean if I was living in America or something, I would still do the videos anonymously. People seem to miss that point. I said that all that I'm not hiding. I just don't like putting my face on camera. I just don't like seeing myself on camera. So that's it. I'm not. And to me it's like I dunno, it's like I'm tired. I'm like city one, but I feel like I'm 60. I'm thought I'm not going to hide it. I'm not going to censor myself anymore.

Speaker 14:         01:41:39       It's just like people seem to forget that on a day to day basis I have to pretend to be someone else, like everyone around me. Even when I'm getting ahead, god I have to like agree with the guy was cutting my hair that dealt with or we have like a particularly hot summer these days that the weather is like a last thing and, and you know, we have to be thankful because some people got it worse. So I have to agree with that. Like every single minute of every single day. So I'm not going to censor myself online. That's like,

Speaker 1:          01:42:10       was going to happen. So you have to, you have to thank all of that. It's really hot but not hot or that really hot.

Speaker 14:         01:42:16       Yeah. Yeah. So basically in every muslim country is you have to be thankful because you're not like the worst thing on earth. So as long as there's one guy that's worse than you, you have to be thankful. Oh, that guy. And that guy should like, have a problem with god. Seriously.

Speaker 1:          01:42:35       It can always, we can always get worse. I get it. Alright. So I want to talk a little bit about your personal stuff. So you are an atheist and you consider yourself an ex muslim, correct? Yeah. So you put these videos out there and you have, you have a real fan base. It's awesome. Uh, what about in your own personal life? They're like, are you, are you out to your friends and family? Like how much can you talk about that stuff?

Speaker 14:         01:42:57       Well, look, my friends and family, like they know I'm not like religious. That's what they know. And they know that I'm kind of like, you know, I, I just don't care about any annual that they know that, but they don't know that I'm like a hundred percent atheist. Actually, the idea wouldn't even enter their minds. Even if I told them they would be like, you know, there's not, the mind wouldn't be like cut because the option's not on the table. He didn't like Egypt during the muslim countries. It's not an option to be an atheist. No one knew that. No one told me that. So if someone would have told me that when I was six years old because I always wasn't compliant with religion. So if someone would've told me that, like when I was young, the idea I'm, I might've made the switch a long time ago, but the idea wasn't even there. So when did you make that switch? When did you wake up? Uh, I think it was about three years ago at some, like a, you know, like I had like a major event happened in my life. So I had to stop because I was just gone and I wasn't really paying attention. but I never really was a muslim if you really like

Speaker 14:         01:44:08       considered it a like what, what, how I was living. I never really was. I didn't even stop to think, you know what, maybe this is all bullshit. I never stopped to say that to myself, but when my life just stopped me, like forcefully stop. I hAd, I had some time to like reflect and think and just reach a conclusion that it was just like right there. But they never really even considered it. Yeah. And did you jump on youtube right after that? Because the stuff that you do there is really great. And we'll put a link below so everyone can find it. This is it though, isn't great. I don't think it. Yeah. But I, I think you're brave for having me. Actually. I'm brave. I think you're backwards. No, no, no. Because like my videos are not like advertiser friendly or something. They don't really follow like cold, like.

Speaker 14:         01:44:55       Yeah. So. So yeah, I know. What actually made me jump from unt was, I know it's like a cliche at this point, but actually it was the sam harris ben affleck. Think, I mean, it was like, that was my awakening too, so we're across the world. Yeah. It was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Someone needs like, someone needs to have this guy's back because he's like, he's like taking old heat, has seen something that's so obvious and it's like ridiculous where people. And actually not just the interview the next day when cnn and all that, that was like a shit show. It was like, can I say that? You can say it, go crazy. You can say more than that can shit show. So yeah. Uh, yeah, I had to like say something. I actually uploaded two videos and deleted them,

Speaker 14:         01:45:44       but then I uploaded the third one because I wasn't really sure about the other thing. I was like, okay, if I get like 100 years on that, okay, I'll do a second one a and it just kept going from there. Think how awesome that is really. I mean we live something like, I don't know, 8,000 miles away from each other and that moment, that same night, I mean that was my awakening. I had had a little, a little crack in my awakening before that and, and, but we had that together that, that is so cool. So I'm thrilled to be talking to you. Um, but I, I go ahead. No, no, go ahead. You're a good host to a so we only have, we only have like another minute but I'll do something else with you in the future. But uh, just talk to me a little bit about the regressives because you hate them as much as I do this, this regressive ideology.

Speaker 14:         01:46:32       So how does it affect you as a free thinker and a secularist and an atheist in Egypt? How does their ideology harm you? Your ability to live the way you want? Well, the basically shutting down any conversation that could bleed to anything because when you're talking about like that. Yeah, that, that, that, that there's no such thing that like, that islam is just like any other religion and like that they're ignoring like the, like the majority of muslims like believe outside of us that day, the United States or the uk or whatever, that we are like living in horrible conditions. Do look at me, I'm living like fantastically compared to other people. Even in Egypt, no one bothers me. I do whatever I want but some people can't. And when when you start seeing things like that's like racist to just say that we should like keep an eye on, on some issues that are very important and you should like, you liberal. That's the problem too. You should, you know, you should actually leave everything and just focus on that. There are people getting murdered to being gay or saying the wrong thing or for listening the wrong kind of music or you should do that. You should champion that cause not just for people living outside of year that's just living inside you this and, and the work travel because you know the internet and all of that and don't even get me started on this nonsense about like feminism and islam. Yeah. We need like a whole other app.

Speaker 1:          01:48:05       You know what? Here's what we do for real. I'm going to do an hour with you because this is just the beginning and I truly am a fan of yours, so we're going to do a full hour together, so I'm sorry we had to cut it short and you know what I was, I think I told you this, but I was in Egypt back in 1997. It feels like a lifetime ago. Uh, and I, I would love to go back at some point so maybe we can work that to.

Speaker 14:         01:48:26       But we liked your tour guide. I'm going to show you the pediments, all the cliches and other stuff too.

Speaker 1:          01:48:32       All right. I am on with khrushchev from India. Kusha. You are number one. You are first on the big rubin report fan show. How's it going in India today?

Speaker 15:         01:48:43       Now let's say I'm really happy that you have me over. Good. It's really hard right now actually.

Speaker 1:          01:48:50       Yeah. Through what's really hot for you guys.

Speaker 15:         01:48:53       Oh, celsius. Not fahrenheit. So it's actually right now it's 35 degrees celsius. And the humidity of 77 percent. That'S pretty hot.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       Oh man. Are you. Are you an air conditioning right now or you just have a series of fans? Air conditioning.

Speaker 15:         01:49:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:49:08       Very nice. Alright, well I'm super excited to talk to you now. I don't know. We've got a lot of responses. I don't know that all one point 2 billion with a b people in India responded. But we did get a ton of responses from India about 100 people. Uh, so. So you're the, you're the lucky one out of 100. So there was a lot of things that you sent me that I thought were really, really interesting. Uh, so first off, and a few people in India talked about this, you mentioned just the general state of freedom of expression in India right now. So can you tell me a little bit about your concerns about the state of freedom of expression?

Speaker 15:         01:49:44       So here's the thing, I don't want to paint a very dangerous scenario or something on that sort, but you know, as a skeptic, I'm a skeptic myself. So, I mean, in India we had some weird laws. So I'll give you an example of a couple of situations. So it all starts with a, a particular constitutional article or two 95 eight. So basically that article restricts any criticism of religion. So I'm not going to give the whole text of the article to you because that will just take away a lot of time. But the article says that you cannot hurt the sentiments of religious people and here's the funny part. So it's basically a blasphemy law anD India is a 80 percent hindu country and hinduism does not even have a concept of blessed with me. So I mean it's hilarious actually. But the history of the law is that in 1926, I think it was in 1926, we had this, a publisher who published a book called the gila soon. So it's award in hindi. So dragila resume means a prophet muhammad the casanova or the playboy. So it basically spoke about the marriages and the sex life of prophet moment. Now obviously muslims did not like her at that time and there was a lot of rioting. This is in 1986. So eventually the publisher was murdered and the villagers, because they didn't want to deal with it, they just came up with is blasphemy law and we're just stuck with it now to 2016.

Speaker 1:          01:51:13       Hold on. So if hindu hinduism has no blast for me. So it's really only being used one way. It really sort of has nothing to do with hinduism, right?

Speaker 15:         01:51:21       Yeah, it's not. But the tragedy is that even hindus or started using this law, that's the tragedy. See, see, I, I, I might be a skeptic, but I don't consider myself to be outside the hindu pantheon because you know, we don't have that abrahamic problem where, you know, 18 are considered outside. The abrahamic pantene. Hinduism had a very old tradition of atheism built in, in itself. It hurts me even more because I considered myself to be a hindu and we have this law and nobody talks about her. I'm in, there have been rationalists who had to live in the. I'll give you an example. There was a rationalist calls and allah, I don't know his second name, but I know his name so now. So he basically went around in 2012 when he was talking about how certain miracles claimed by christians were not real, so they use this law and they've been down on him and he had to leave India. He stays in Finland now. And that's really sad. Recently there was a comedian, kiko, the. He made fun of a guru. So the followers of that guru, they went after him again. He had to apologize and I can give you examples of various religions obviously. I mean the highest amount of offense is caused by a particular religion, which nobody talks about.

Speaker 1:          01:52:37       Right. I got it. I got a lot of emails about that. I think everyone knows which one you're talking about. So one of the things that you wrote that I thought was really interesting you said wanted to make the distinction between tolerance and mutual respect. And I really thought that was fascinating because here in America at least we talk about tolerance all the time. We have to tolerate everybody, but in a way that's not a very lofty thing. Mutual respect is. So can you explain that?

Speaker 15:         01:53:02       So basically, it's not something that I've come up, but it's a concept that was discussed and uh, you know, basically it's a concept introduced by indian american author called reggie mulatto. He wrote a book called being different in 2011. So what he basically talks about is every time we have an interfaith dialogue, right? So you have these interfaith dialogues where everybody around the table test, oh, we tolerate all religions, spoke about it in a very beautiful way. so the, you know, he went around asking people, so do you tolerate your spouse in your house? Do you tolerate someone when you're having dinner with them? So I have just basically taken this concept being a skeptic. Now I'm taking it to the next level and I'm saying, okay, here I am. I'm a skeptic. I may not agree with some use of hinduism. I may not agree with a lot of views of islam or christianity, but very mutual respect comes in is I don't need to tolerate you. I need to respect you and you need to give me that respect back in return. That's when you have a dialogue tolerances, you're saying you suck, but it's okay, I'll let you be

Speaker 1:          01:54:06       right, but I won't kill you. Pretty much that's,

Speaker 15:         01:54:10       and this is again, it stems from this exclusivist nature of abrahamic religions. See, hindus don't have this problem and I'm being very honest. I mean I've never faced a hindu saying, you know, I'm going to come across a hindu says, oh, I'll tolerate. You know, hindus would be like, okay, you don't believe in god, you do your own thing. I'll do my own thing. But you know, it's not like one god, one book, one religion. It's not that.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       So does that make the state of atheists in India much stronger? Actually, because I did get, I would say probably half of the people that emailed us from India said they were atheists and didn't make it sound like they were hiding per se. Obviously you're doing this right now, so if hinduism, which is 80 percent of the religion in India is sort of tolerant of atheism. That's pretty fantastiC, right?

Speaker 15:         01:54:57       Yeah, it is. See, I like to classify indian atheism in three parts, so there are the hindu atheist started the hindu dot skeptics. I, I call myself a skeptic, so we, we are not sure about some claims of hinduism, so I would say I'm skeptical to reincarnation. I'm skeptical to a few claims that the gurus make, but there are a lot of thIngs in hinduism that are beautiful. I mean I personally like the theory of karma as a action and reaction. I think a karma could be taken as an action and reaction, but then there are. There's this new atheism in India, I called them the marxist atheists. So basically you have to understand the political scenario, India and especially the media. You have the social sciences and the humanities departments. They keep churning out these marxist state tests. So when you got a lot of emails, I wouldn't be surprised that you must have gotten a lot of emails of those marks. The status will paint a very different picture about hinduism to you. And then I have the third category, which is the one, the ats. So that peRson has not read anything, so they just probably saw a video offer, richard dawkins on youtube and they must have gone, okay, I like this, you know, it's like that. So I have three categorizations of atheism in India that are mixed skeptic.

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       Yeah. Well listen, I feel like we just started and you're my first person at a 20, but our time is up already. But I really, I appreciate your support. I appreciate you coming on and sharing your thoughts and I have got to make it out to India. So when I do, I'm going to look you up.

Speaker 15:         01:56:36       Yeah. When you come to mumbai, dinner's on me.

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       Done and done. All right. I am here with hannah in Texas in the good old us of a had. How are you?

Speaker 16:         01:56:46       I am amazing. How are you?

Speaker 1:          01:56:48       I'm doing well. Uh, texaS. It feels like Texas is like a whole other country in a way. What's going on in Texas?

Speaker 16:         01:56:56       Well, honestly I think that we are better than North Carolina right now. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Yeah. I mean like we get, we get a lot of bad rap here. um, but at the same time when you actually live here, it really depends on where you live. Like Texas is bigger than like France or something, right? So I live close to dallas. I'm not super close but about an hour away from that. And the closer you are to these major cities, the better it is, but whenever you start getting out to the rural areas it gets kind of hickish but they're good people. It's always like, well intentioned, good old boys sort of thing going on.

Speaker 1:          01:57:39       Alright. Alright, I'll go with that. Well your submission was really great because you gave me, you gave me a lot to work with you. So first off you are trans big deal, but you are trans.

Speaker 16:         01:57:50       Um, yes. And I, I put a little asterisk on that. Um, I am somebody who is very anti labels and therE's a reason for this. I'm not again, special snowflakes stuff later, but I don't know what I'm agreeing to. Whenever I say yes, I'm trans. I mean like how far does that go? That's always the big question. Whenever you're saying, are you a trans man, trans woman, transsexual, transgender, across, where are the lines? You know what I to if I say yes, I am that, but in a colloquial general understanding at the very basic level me back just kind of stopped at the side.

Speaker 1:          01:58:31       I think that's really interesting and it's actUally kind of freeing because you as the person that identifies however you want to write it as if you're making the point of saying, well, sometimes these are a little confusing or don't quite get it right or all that. Meanwhile, meanwhile society is just obsessed with these labels, right?

Speaker 16:         01:58:49       Yeah. It's, I have been doing this for close to nine years now. The thing with the internet is that you don't really know who is typing what. So for the, for the most part, a lot of the trans stuff that comes out and people doing that, it's probably people just trying on a persona or trying on an identity or something like that. it's usually teenagers. Um, and I think that we kind of take them a little bit more seriously than we should on a, on a national hysteria type level. Um, but I don't necessarily see that there's much wrong with it, but it just let it be what it is instead of making a big deal out of it. If it's online, like in person stuff, like real tangible happenings, that gets a little bit more attention or should. But whenever people online typing or posting or whatever, it's like it could be anybody.

Speaker 1:          01:59:54       Are you telling me that tumbler is not real life? Is that what you're telling me? I know it'll blow your mind. Wow. You know, you can be anything on the internet like an attack helicopter. That one's really popular now. Is that a big one right now? Identifying as an attack helicopter. It's great. So all right, so let's, let's back up a little bit. So for someone that's watching this right now, wherever theY are, are in the world that has never heard from a trans person or the only trans person that they know of is caitlyn jenner. Can you jusT tell me a little bit about growing up? When did you realize you were trans, etc. This is always very difficult

Speaker 16:         02:00:33       because everybody's going to have like a similar overarching narrative, but it's going to have its different details. I knew something was off as a child, which is one of those common narratives, but um, I grew up southern baptist and being raised that way, it's very kind of closed off. Everybody that wasn't southern baptist was influenced by the devil, but we moved around a lot and all that sort of thing. And just, I don't know how to qualify myself. Like we are kind of the only people it seems nowadays where you have to explain yourself, rationalized to me why I should accept that you are who you say you are,

Speaker 1:          02:01:19       right? You guys are the ones at the moment, but you know what, that won't last forever for whatever that's worth. So it's one of those.

Speaker 16:         02:01:25       SeriouslY, I wish I could give a definitive answer like, this is exactly how I know I can point to these scientific studies. This is exActly what happened. I can't, we don't, we're not there yet when I can point is that trans people have existed throughout history and multiple cultures. This is not a new thing. It is only new to the american west. Um, and what I mean by that is the modern american west native tribes, different allowances for different genders and gender roles. Sure. So it's only new to the north american west and I think that kinda goes back to like a puritan european influence and whatnot, kind of scrounging all deviancy from, uh, the possibility of, of human experience and I'm sure that there were people back there and I'm white european colonials or whatever that were also trans but could not say anything or risk of being hung or killed or whatever. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       yeah, I'm curious, um, how much of your sort of just mental energy and an ability to be a functioning person is about just having to explain yourself because that seems more exhausting in a way than, than dealing with something personal.

Speaker 16:         02:02:47       It is exhausting and it was exhausting. I think a Lot of trans people go through very similar faces and their transition. When I first started, I was a helper. I was going to be there for my trans sisters who were just starting also, um, I spent a lot of night sleepless. I'm trying to keep people from killing themselves, um, but also trying to educate and explain and all this sort of thing. And uh, as time went on and I, I got more passing privilege as we call it, that I didn't have as many people stopping me and asking me, um, and I kind of developed sort of a, a passive routine of like, this is how I'm just going to interact with people and just be super kind, super sweet and all that sort of thing. And there's that pressure that you always have to be on your, a game as a transwoman and around the normal people or whatever.

Speaker 16:         02:03:44       Right? Um, and there's, there's two camps on this. There's the radical queers who are like, we should not be trying to fit in. We are unique in our own way and it's beautiful and all this sort of thing. And then there's the people who are like, well, no I don't. I kind of just want to fit in it. It's difficult trying to navigate this because it's very politicized. Uh, if you choose one side or the other or you try to not pick a side, nobody's going to like you and you end up in your room all alone all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:04:18       Well, is that, is that one of the. Is that one of the hardest things about sort of being a, not only being a minority in this regard, but like as I said, trans issue seemed to be the minority of the moment as you referenced before, this issue with the bathrooms in North Carolina. Everything trans is know, makes edge

Speaker 16:         02:04:38       and it makes all the news. So do you feel that you're under a microscope even in just your private life with everything that you do? He. Yes. And here's, here's the thing, I have been using the women's restroom for eight years without any issue. Now I'm scared because now, I mean that's interesting. Now people are looking, now people are scrutinizing and whenever governors or mayors or whoever it was in North Carolina says, women shouldn't spray people if they're scared in the bathroom. And a year, a year ago, I'm a girl with a n, I'm going to get in trouble for saying this genetic girl with the vagina actually got pulled out of a restroom by men because could you say, a genetic vagina? So, so a female regularly cis gendered female. Cisgender. So there's so many words on perform her femininity well enough. Got it. Right. Um, so that, that's a specific issue and it always makes me wonder whenever things like this happening, like what else is going on? Like what, what are the real issues that are going on right now whenever they put this panic out here, like we've been around all this time, but just for now, for some reason right now, now we talk about this, now we need to have this national discussion. What's the real issUe? Like what's, what's happening? I'm the new cycle is pretty quick. So I think this one, hopefully we're shifted out of this one. Yeah. Um, it's the process and everything, I'm just saying this is blowing my mind.

Speaker 16:         02:06:16       So that's more of a specific issue and in this like the trans experience is hugely diverse, as diverse as the queer experience and you're getting like who do you define as trans because if you go with the tumbler versions or whatnot, if you cross dress on halloween for rocky horror picture show, you qualify as trans now congratulations. Um, and you can't really say no, you don't qualify if you're in that community because suddenly you're removing somebody's identity and you're going to get in trouble for that and all that sort of thing. So I'm just kinda like, I need to accept the concept of [inaudible]. I don't know if you're familiar with that, but. No. Yeah, I quality as a term. I'm kind of like, I think so much that I'm an armchair philosopher, but quality was a, a word that was coined that was to, to describe the specific experience that we each have.

Speaker 16:         02:07:10       So whenever you look at like a blue wall, you will have a certain range of emotions and feelinGs and all that. And I will have a supposedly different one and that is quality so we can relate that we're looking at a blue wall, but whatever's invoked inside of us is going to be different. So that's kinda like the trans experience in this. The best I can do when it comes to rationalizing it was like I just know what I feel and I'm sorry that you can't relate. And again with the bathroom issue. Oh my gosh. Well listen, I appreciate it. Oh go ahead. well I mean like I, I appreciate people trying to relate to the trans issues and like whenever they think of the bathroom thing, they're like why would I go to the bathroom? Or, or why do I think people would go to the bathroom first thing that comes to mind while sexual assault or something. Right. And I'm like, come on, you should not get an address and go into the bathroom then like a year messed up.

Speaker 1:          02:08:05       There is one other thing that I wanted to talk about that you mentioned in your submission that I thought was really interesting. You brought up a phrase that I hadn't heard before called constructed illusion and you related this to having a male and female voice

Speaker 16:         02:08:18       when you may use each one. Can you tell me about that? Um, so this is what I'm. people will call performing gender. So I have developed this voice with years of training. It's still, my voice is just exercised, right? my arms aren't exercised, but um, so I have a wider range. So with this voice I get treated different whenever I interact with people because I'm not threatening with this voice. But if you're ready for this, if I drop my voice, I suddenly become a threats. RiGht? So I can switch between these two. But that was the voice that's affected by testosterone. And anybody who heard that I am immediately a different person. There is no going back, right? The illusion is broken, but how do they know that's just not another one of my develop voices. And this is kind of why I call it constructed illusion because if it's related to magic tricks, performance magic, you do mr [inaudible] and all that sort of thing.

Speaker 16:         02:09:27       And it is a performance in a sense, but in another sense it is me and it's really hard to really unpack that in a short amount of time. But it's inter subjectivity with my voice. It was for me at first, but eventually I kind of start feelinG trapped by it because even though I've exercised this place, I'm still not capable of a full ranGe of emotional expression using it. Makes sense. Right. But the, I assume that there's an evolution with that, right? Like you'll, you'll get there, so to speak eventually, but it takes a lot, a lot, a lot of practice. So this, this goes back into like passing privilege and all that sort of thing. So it was really nice talking to you and I probably talk talking to you. So ecstatic.

Speaker 1:          02:10:14       Alright, I'm on with jason and brussels. Jason, has it gone? Fantastic. A pleasure to be on. yeah. Well, uh, I'm excited to talk to you. So you are in brussels, but originally from cypress. So we're going to get this. We're going to get to Cyprus in a minute because nobody talks about Cyprus, but it's a really interesting tiny little country that very people know about a, but you're in brussels now, obviously the last few months in Belgium, but especially in brussels have been very tough. So can you just start with that?

Speaker 17:         02:10:43       Well, yeah, I have to say it hasn't affected people on a, on a conscious level. I mean you see people going about their daily routine, but it's definitely had a very malicious sort of subconscious undertone, particularly since the paris attacks. Uh, we've had a martial law on and off and it's very concerning when you see four armed soldiers outside mcdonalds and an armored car outside your workplace. Yeah. So, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's been very strange and the attacks actually happened at a metro station that I use quite frequently.

Speaker 1:          02:11:22       So when you see these changes, you see more soldiers out there, you see more security and all that kind of stuff. How does that change your general psyche like that you're walking to work and you're seeing this stuff? It changes just sort of the day to day right?

Speaker 17:         02:11:37       Well, no, you become accustomed to it actually, but uh, I mean it's, it's very disturbing to see the military deployed in a western capital, uh, I mean it's like the problem is truly have become a global,

Speaker 1:          02:11:52       so there were a lot of reports after the attacks in brussels that in parts of the community that one of the attackers was from, and I guess they found him a couple of weeks later that the community there was knowingly hiding him were people talking about that in Belgium. It's sort of trickled it's way into western media but not really. And then it was kind of hard to tell what was actually true.

Speaker 17:         02:12:14       Well, I don't think that he's just a problem that's isolated to Belgium. I think in general, um, we don't see a members of the local community where many of these suspects from turning them in, making a concerted effort with the authority and it is something that we have to try and deal with through better integration policies.

Speaker 1:          02:12:37       yeah. So how is the integration going, I guess? I guess to that point, it's probably not going that great.

Speaker 17:         02:12:43       No, no, no, it's terrible. I mean, you have different communities that live parallel lives, uh, which, uh, I mean, they, they exist occasionally in the physical space because, I mean, you opened the physical spaces overlap slightly, but they just live in a different reality.

Speaker 1:          02:13:00       Right? So how much of That, where do you place all the blame on that? Because this is one of the things that a lot of people emailed us about was, was this idea, especially people in europe were saying that a lot of the muslIm communities aren't integrating properly and they see some people were sort of blaming their own governments. Some people were blaming the, uh, the muslim communities. It's, my guess is that the truth is somewhere in between. What do you think?

Speaker 17:         02:13:24       Well, I like to go from more abstractly and say that the problem has been, uh, because of our social justice approach or rather aggressive approach giving, we've been giving rights to a communities rather than two individuals. And it's very arbitrary to, to define a community in a certain way. Uh, and um, and you know, because the premise of our individualized kind of rule of law has been, uh, the rights should be given to individuals and not to, um, you know, what social justice people, however, social justice people decide to classify people as.

Speaker 1:          02:14:06       So how much have those ideas? Clearly you're, you're speaking my language. It's about the individual, not the group. Let's get away from this oppression, olympics thing, all of that stuff which we've talked about so much here. How much of that ideology is, has taken hold in Belgium?

Speaker 17:         02:14:23       Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm more qualified to talk about specifically about how this is manifested in the uk because I've been doing a study on that.

Speaker 1:          02:14:35       So you've been, you've been studying this in the uk about a school system, right?

Speaker 17:         02:14:39       System, yeah. Because in the, uh, in the british school system, what you have is you have a third of schools which are regardless, which are faith schools that receive public money, uh, because, uh, they have designated a religious character. And what we see here is that I believe that the child's rights are being infringed upon because, uh, basically because the child is classified as, as belonging to a particular community, uh, they get labeled by very arbitrary criteria, um, and um, and attend a faith schools just to fulfill the aims of social justice. And I think that this is a, this is a very large structural problem.

Speaker 1:          02:15:32       It's a bizarrely backwards thing that we do in the west. I mean, we do this in America with several religions where the government funds sort of faith based schools even though we're totally secular society.

Speaker 17:         02:15:45       Well, yes. And um, and you know, shockingly, in the uk, the faith goals have a, have a, have an exemption from, from even the equality act. I mean it's written in the law that they have an exemption from treating people equally and employment and, and admission. And uh, the problem is although the schools are obliged to teach the national curriculum, they teach it through a religious lens. So you might learn about many secular subjects, but then about other religions and secularism and how to behave in a civic society. But if you also learned that the penalty for apostasy is death and that the law and that the law of god, uh, in the arEa above the, the law of the state, then you're less likely to want to integrate and be part of the cohesive society.

Speaker 3:          02:16:37       Yeah, I mean, to me that's, that gets to the heart of the social justice stuff because it seeps into the education system. Then you have a government that is subsidizing basically religious teachinG a suicide. Yeah. Alright. So let's move away from that for a little because I do want to talk about Cyprus with you. So nobody knows about cypress. It is a tiny little island country. You're from there. Just tell me a little bit about your history. You don't have to give me the whole history of cypress. Uh, but tell me a little bit. I'll give you the,

Speaker 17:         02:17:04       the recent history that most, uh, significant now. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Well, in 1974, the turkish army occupied half of cypress and the island has been divided since then. The turkish state installed a kind of fag republic that's only recognized by Turkey and Pakistan. And, uh, have been ongoing attempts to resolve the situation, uh, over the decades, but, um, I feel that I'm not very optimistic about the two sides coming through a settlement because of the physical power that Turkey is exerting. I think whether Turkey withdraws or not, it's mainly a subject of the trajectory of turkish foreign policy and whether it's in turkey's interest to leave. and my hope is that because turkish foreign policy has become increasingly islamophobia and it's shifting away from the foreign policy of the west, that the west might slowly, and I suppose there's a growing relationship between Cyprus and Israel and my hope is that the west eventually aligns its foreign policy closer to secularist entities throughout the region, like the kurds for example also. Um, and my hope is that that will will lead to a better. Um, we'll, we'll give cypress leverage in negotiations because it will have the backing from the west list. So

Speaker 3:          02:18:37       yeah. Well, I promise you that I will talk about it more because, you know, we've talked about the kurds here, but as you said, cypress is a sovereign nation, a united nations member country. And it's in full occupation since 1974. So there's a lot. Listen, there's a lot more that we could talk about unfortunately. We got to move on. I got a long day of interviews, but it's been a pleasure talking to you. All right. I'm on with gel up in Canada. Jill. How are you? I'm good, thanks. Well it's good to have you here now. First off, before we get into any of the issues you emailed me about, is it true that Canada is going to build a wall to keep americans out regardless of who wins our presidential election? I've heard rumors, yes. Okay. Rumors. All right, we're going to get that on the internet. Okay. So you sent me some really interesting stuff that sort of touched on some of the things that we talk about on the show, but then you really went in another with it, which

Speaker 1:          02:19:27       is why I wanted to have you on. So one of the things you mentioned a is that sort of the mental health anti stigma campaigns that we see these days are actually part of the regressive left ideology. Now I gave a lot of buzzwords there. So can you unpack that for me a little bit?

Speaker 18:         02:19:46       I think so. Not very many people, um, agree with me on it.

Speaker 1:          02:19:51       Well, let's see. Let's see.

Speaker 18:         02:19:53       Well, it's the same sort of victim mentality, um, except pretty much anyone can be a part of it. It seems almost like a club to be mentally ill these days and a lot of times it's, ignores the real issues. Like right now I'm in Canada, we have a huge crisis with the first nations communities, like lots of youth are committing suicide, but of course the anti stigma campaigns want to hijack this and make it about illness. But if you actually talk to these youth, they say, well, we have no hope because there is no hope here. We have no jobs, we have no library, things like that. Um, so I think just the campaigns tend to really stay away from the issues and tend to put people again in the victim role.

Speaker 1:          02:20:42       Yeah. So you're sort of talking about two things there. So on one hand there's the feeling if the economy is not good or their family life isn't good or whatever it is, it is sort of a reality in their life versus these campaigns that in a weird way because of this oppression olympics that we've talked about, kind of make it cool to say, well this is wrong with me or this is wrong with me or I have this or this or that. Correct.

Speaker 18:         02:21:05       Yeah. There seems to be a bit of a hierarchy. Like it's more cool to be like bipolar then to be depressed and, and they seem to be seeing except me because I'm not like you. Whereas we all know like the way towards acceptance is to be, well we're, we're all human, we're all the same. But um, they're really going for no because I'm different and it's not my fault. So sort of for people who don't have an illness, what does that mean? If they're struggling that they shouldn't be accepted. So.

Speaker 1:          02:21:41       Right. That's really kind of fascinating. So someone who doesn't have a, any, any known condition, so to speak in a weird way then then it feels worse for them because they're supposed to feel okay, right?

Speaker 18:         02:21:53       Yeah. Yeah. And there's a lot of research showing that the more we sort of give people these information about these elements to some more, uh, we create them in people, uh, because it's, it's very much cultural and uh, but they just have to get a brain scan and people pay attention because they think that science.

Speaker 1:          02:22:16       Yeah. Do you guys have the, all the crazy commercials that we have in the states, you know, you turn on the tv, especially any of the cable news shows and all the commercials are for one depression medicine or, and you know, there's

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       a cartoon cloud following somebody and take this medication with this medication and it makes everybody think that they're depressed or somehow defective.

Speaker 18:         02:22:35       Yeah. I don't watch tv, but uh, I'm sure we did have those. Your,

Speaker 3:          02:22:40       you're a wise woman. Um, so a lot of this though, from what you wrote to me is very personal for you because you're a recovering addict yourself, right? Yeah, so can you tell me a little bit about that, that either a, you know, what you were doing, how you got out, cetera. You don't have to give me every bit of personal stuff, but

Speaker 18:         02:22:58       yeah. Um, I would say heroin, I guess I still am a heroin addict. Um, man, I don't know, not much to say about that.

Speaker 3:          02:23:08       Yeah. And, and are you, you're in full recovery or I guess it's, it's a lifelong struggle I suppose. Right?

Speaker 18:         02:23:14       Yeah. Uh, almost two years.

Speaker 3:          02:23:16       Wow. So, uh, the other thing that you wanted to talk about, which of course is related to all this is the war on drugs and you know, this is something we talk about a lot in America. Um, I'm not that familiar with the, with the drug situation in Canada in general. Can you tell me a bit?

Speaker 18:         02:23:33       Um, I probably don't follow politics as much as they should. I get, I get too depressed, but uh, I have read a lot of bruce alexander's work and vancouver, which is where I'm from originally. I has the worst addiction problem in the world pretty much. So he talks a lot about how globalization has affected that and the war on drugs pretty much focuses on the drugs themselves as being evil. And it's really not about the drugs. I'm bruce alexander's work in the seventies. He pretty much disproved all other notions of addiction, but people are still held onto it. Basically it was called rat park. Um, he gave some rats morphine water and of course they used it up, which is pretty much identical almost to heroin, but then he puts another group of rats in like a bigger container where they could socialize and they could play and they had lots of room and those racks wouldn't drink the morphine water even when they had already forced them into physical dependency. Um, so that to me is evidence against this whole crazy notion that we should be fighting drugs. Canada is in probably in the same state as America, but we are certainly getting there.

Speaker 3:          02:25:11       Yeah. But you guys do have some places with vancouver, for example, where at least marijuana is legal, right?

Speaker 18:         02:25:18       Um, it's not legal. I don't think, uh, we do have the safe sites, but uh, our conservative government or previous conservative government tried really hard to get rid of that. Um hmm.

Speaker 3:          02:25:34       Interesting. Well, listen, it's a, it's fascinating to me because you took sort of a theme, uh, related to, you know, political correctness and this depression stuff and all that and applied it to something that we haven't talked about that much, so I really appreciate your thoughts on it. All right, I'm on with john. Marco in Switzerland. Has it going on in Switzerland right now?

Speaker 19:         02:25:54       Eight, eight a. It's good. It's evening and yeah, I just waiting for your call here.

Speaker 3:          02:26:01       Yeah, I got a guy with better hair than me. This is very upsetting, but we're gonna we're gonna do it anyway. All right. So one of the things you wanted to talk about was sort of coming out as an atheist, which I think is really interesting and it's one of the things we've talked about here that people feel this need to make this proclamation. So can you tell me a little bit about your journey?

Speaker 19:         02:26:22       Uh, yeah, sure. Um, well I was born and raised in Switzerland, so it's not a religious country, it's just like, yeah. Um, I had some, some religion classes in, in primary and stuff, but I wasn't ever really religious. I'm catholic. Was a catholic classes? No, it was evangelical. Okay. And um, yeah, then I went to sydney for exchange semester, um, when I was like 18, 19, and I stumbled upon this, this, uh, debates have ken hamm against, uh, um, yeah. So, and I would like to say the least. I thought it was ridiculous that, that some people would think that weight like ken hemi was.

Speaker 3:          02:27:21       So basically for people that don't know, he's the, he's the guy that runs the board at the biblical park somewhere in America and he debated bill nye about evolution versus creation. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 19:         02:27:33       yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I was like a bit confused and, and, um, yeah, told my brother and he was a little bit more into that and then she showed me christopher hitchens and richard dawkins and I felt it would be good english lesson to, to read those books. Like god is not great. And then, so yeah, I felt that I was, I was talking to some people there because I had connections to everywhere in the world because like I had some people from, from sheila, they're from Switzerland, from Belgium, from everywhere. So what does donald me the most was this guy from Switzerland actually who was like while I believe in creationism and I was like, just, it was a swiss guy like me. What's, what's thinking that, that like noah's ark really was just, it was just mind blowing for me. Um, so I started to, to watch debates on youtube and stuff and yeah, when I came home I was like full blown atheist.

Speaker 3:          02:28:49       It sounds to me that you deal with exactly what most atheists deal with, which is that it's not actually that big of a deal, but you feel like you have to sort of say it because otherwise the world just thinks you believe something that you don't.

Speaker 19:         02:29:03       Yeah. Right, right. It's like that. And like when I, when I discovered this, all of this, I was, I wasn't a little bit more militant. I don't know how to say like, sure. I thought people who believe this stuff will be lazy or stupid or not really stupid but like ignorant and kind of weird. So I got a little bit out of that. I let them have their beliefs and whatever. Um. Yeah. But I need, I feel need to tell that I don't believe that.

Speaker 3:          02:29:37       Yeah. Well, it's funny because I always say to me, I don't care what you believe as long as you're not trying to chop my head off or making me believe anything else, then you go ahead and believe whatever you want, you know? Um. All right. So one of the things that you wrote in that you want to talk about that I thought was really interesting was that you want to talk about the difference between the us constitution and the swiss constitution and that basically you think that we're a. Don't worry about the hair, that, that we, that we are sort of obsessed with never changing our constitution, but you guys actually change your constitution pretty frequently, right?

Speaker 19:         02:30:10       Yeah, it was. It wasn't like a debate about gun regulation under the second amendment United States, and I thought to myself lIke, why wouldn't they allow to change that like inside oldest lobbying and stuff from the nra, a gallup poll that like 55 percent of the american people are for, I'm more strict can regulation. So I looked into it a little bit more and what I found was, was pretty astonishing to me. I've always thought like, uh, the american constitution is kinda, it's kinda, um, static and, and just for 230 years it was almost a safe and swiss constitution as you may know, we have referendums like four times a year where people just sending some ideas and we vote on it. And thiS is like changing the constitution every time.

Speaker 3:          02:31:17       Wait, did you say you guys do that four times a year?

Speaker 19:         02:31:19       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       man, that's a lot. And people show up and vote four times a year and actually change the constitution that often.

Speaker 19:         02:31:27       Yeah. Yeah, it is. Well, we had like 50, 55 percent of the people at both. Um, the rest is just like, yeah, well do whatever you want. And uh, yeah, but we won't like for 12 or 12 to 15 different referendum each year in force steps.

Speaker 3:          02:31:51       Yeah. So. all right. So have you seen any gimme gimme like one good example of that, like something that you guys have changed for the better and one time that maybe it didn't work if you can think of something?

Speaker 19:         02:32:01       Yeah, sure. TwO thousand and 10. I think it was um, like the, the far right party of Switzerland, the svp proposed that we should ban minarets, like the towers on the mosques of the. Yeah. So, and it was accepted by the people. So now we have in our constitution our article like 72 that it's prohibited to build minerals like when we have like two little ends. So it was like no issue at all.

Speaker 3:          02:32:41       Right. So it wasn't really a problem but the far right grabbed it. Yeah.

Speaker 19:         02:32:44       Yeah, it was just like sinophobia, populistic and. Yeah. And the good thing we accepted, I really need to finish, but it's like most things are good that they're not accepted, that we have some, some, like all these proposals are, are either far right or far left like a. Yeah, like minimum wages and I mean that's kind of okay. But minimum wages were like set to $22 per hour and that's just ridiculous high. I mean, who would pay that?

Speaker 3:          02:33:25       right? So does that ultimately hurt the swiss economy? I mean the businesses then leave Switzerland because it sounds like Switzerland and we always think of it as, oh, they have so much money. Everybody's so happy. It's so great.

Speaker 19:         02:33:36       Yeah. No, I, I think so. Yeah. what I'm, I'm not an economist, but from what I've heard and what I've read, I think it will really hurt the country as, as a, as a financial spot and, and yeah. And also, yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:33:53       So the other thIng that you wanted to talk about, which is one of the things that almost everyone in europe, especially his wanted to talk to me about is the refugee situation and political correctness. Uh, so I'll let you go from there.

Speaker 19:         02:34:06       Yeah. So um, refugee crisis in, in, in Switzerland itself. I mean I'm not that I'm on top of like, like the whole situation. I know where you stand on the balcony

Speaker 3:          02:34:21       stuff. Don't worry. I'm not going to quiz you on everything. We're just, we're just getting your opinion.

Speaker 19:         02:34:25       Okay. Okay. So yeah, I'm, I'm basically for a like letting refugees in like, I mean we're all humans. We should, we should get along with each other and help each other. That's like human humanitarian aspect of it. But like the left is, is pushing like these, these ideas or these reasons to let them in a like for example, when when someone says just like something a little bit, I don't know, let's say a controversial about refugees and, and, and yeah, and what they're doing. It's just like it Down and then you cannot talk probably about, about what the issue is with the refugees that come in. I mean I'm all for letting them in but we have to talk about the issues that are coming through us with this and yeah, they're just saying that or. Yeah, saying no, there are no problems at all with this or like maybe a little bit financial but nothing really cultural or. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:35:42       listen, that's exactly why I'm talking about on the show because we got to have these conversations. Listen, that was quick, but it was a pleasure talking to you and thank you. All right. I'm on with adam in Sweden. Adam, has it gone?

Speaker 20:         02:35:55       It's going just fine. Actually a great reporter to this.

Speaker 3:          02:35:59       Cool. Well me too. Uh, so, you know, I've mentioned a lot about Sweden and just recently I had a tino sign and dodgy on the show who's an economist from Sweden and one of the few people that will talk about the political correct situation and sort of this regressive ideology that seems to have taken hold in Sweden. And I got a Lot of messages from Sweden talking about that. Uh, and you were the one we went with. So we expect you to represent your, your whole country.

Speaker 20:         02:36:25       Here we go. Oh boy. I'm the most honest swedish. We could find a good representation there.

Speaker 3:          02:36:33       Well, as you know, I believe that it's about the individual, not about the, the bigger group. So let's start with that. So one of the things you wanted to talk about was that the political correct, this seeping ideology and what it's doing to society in Sweden. So let's start with that.

Speaker 20:         02:36:50       Well, uh, I've been doing explain this because it's, it's fairly hard really, since you need so much context for it and we have so little time for it. Yes,

Speaker 3:          02:37:02       we'll do the best you can.

Speaker 20:         02:37:05       I'll just save it. It goes back at least a hundred years. Started with the socialism and everything like that in Sweden. I'm, but in the modern era at least since the seventies. Um, Sweden was a hotbed for very radical leftism in the seventies. Um, we even had, um, left this terrorist and everything like that in the Sweden that occupied and the east and the west german and Scott West, german embassy. And so it has a long tradition, but the biggest things I actually want to explain what this, that explains how Sweden works today is two terms and I think I've translated them reasonably. One is called the opinion corridor and I think that's kind of self explanatory, but I'll give an explanation that it's, um, that is in Sweden. There's a very narrow corridor of opinions. We're allowed to have it arrest. Well, if you have only opinion outside of that, like me, you're a nazi, you're a racist, you're big attend, you know, you're all of that

Speaker 1:          02:38:14       nazi or racist or bigoted. Let's just get that out.

Speaker 20:         02:38:18       I'm neither of those. I may be very arian, but I'm not a nazi. And, and events opinion corridor for my entire lifetime has just been narrowing and, and I would definitely say that it narrowed its most when obama became a president. Really? Yeah. I would say in Sweden, The last I'd say two decades I guess has tried to emulate America and all its worst parts. And so we always had this opinion corridor, but then we saw how you guys started going with the political correctness part and then it just went worse. So,

Speaker 21:         02:39:03       and

Speaker 20:         02:39:05       yeah, I think that explains that part. Then we also have another term that we didn't advance, but a swedish political commentator in the seventies put two coin very well is called veal hellman move battery. And I would recommend reading up about him because he will give a lot of contexts that are bullshit that's going on today. Um, and I think I'll try to pronounce this demo creatorship he called it, um, combination of the word democracy and dictatorship right now that works essentially in that we have a formal democracy, um, but on the best of the, of the cultural force that our government represents, um, we haven't enforced dictatorship of sorts in the form of the cultural on the, in Sweden that know has its expression in the, uh, in the opinion corridor,

Speaker 1:          02:39:59       right? So what you're talking about basically is as we, we've used this phrase, the oppression olympics, you guys are really big on this, that depending on who you are and where you're from and your religion and your skin color, we really put you in this pecking order, right?

Speaker 20:         02:40:13       Absolutely.

Speaker 1:          02:40:13       And you were baSically, you were very much a home, a home homogenous society. And now that's really changing, so the pecking order starts getting you back.

Speaker 20:         02:40:21       We were a very homogenous society on film until at least the nineties. That's when the balkan wars erupted on the other genocide. And I'm doing that and we got a lot of refugees from that. Um, they've Integrated mostly. well, we didn't really get the problems until we have the very large immigration from the middle east. Uh, it's easier to integrate a european culture than a completely foreign culture from an entire different parts of the world with different cultural context and all of that. Um,

Speaker 1:          02:40:50       but I'm sayinG that would label you are racist, right? Absolutely right.

Speaker 20:         02:40:54       I'm definitely a racist for sayinG that. Um, so, so the problem is because that's outside of the opinion courtyard, we can talk openly about it and that's cost all a lot of issues. And

Speaker 1:          02:41:10       yEah. So that leads, that leads directly to the other thing that you want to talk about,

Speaker 20:         02:41:13       especially at. Exactly. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:41:16       it leads to the other thing you want to talk about, which is the rise of the right in Sweden, which is a new phenomenon. So can you lay that out?

Speaker 20:         02:41:22       Um, yeah, it's, it's a new phenomenon because in Sweden the left has essentially ruled as post world war two, uh, for 60 years we had one party dominant in our, what's it called? And parliament for 60 years we had the social democrats completely dominant in the parliament. Uh, only one the interruption for four years. And that's kind of when I look about it, I'm a student of history so I can see the negative side of it is absolutely insane. Does he just have one party that they did achieve some pretty good things. The things we called full kemeten to Sweden or welfare states, they did achieve that, but they also dismantled it and so, but the right has risen because we can't speak about these things and they are the only ones that had the balls to speak about it because, well, the extreme part world or the nazis, the less extreme but didn't really care to be compared that they were compared with the nazis. So they just talked about it. And now the only way to talk about this is to dedicate yourself to being on the far right, essentIally.

Speaker 1:          02:42:29       Yeah. So we see this happening in America right now and that's why I've been talking about it because I see all of you guys, not just in Sweden but all over europe. I see this happening and I'm trying to help that not happen here. So what does that do for a person? Like you have a person that is not a nazi and is not a racist and yet you see a problem with society and only one group talking about it. where does, where does that leave you?

Speaker 20:         02:42:52       Completely alone, essentIally. um, because the left. Well they think I'm the great satan there. Right? Well I'm also the great satan for them because, well, you know, I kind of think that brown people or people to and jobs are done like people and that's not right according to the four, right? Yeah, I mean I consider myself an ideological ideologically independent because I consider ideologies to be secular religions. Um, so I, I shy away from those things. So it's very hard. And being of my camp in Sweden, which is, you know, liberal essentially,

Speaker 3:          02:43:31       that's the whole purpose of this show and I almost everyone that I'm talking today talking with today over all over the world, I mean this is what it's all about. So just to end this real quick though, because we got to go, you're starting your own youtube channel, right? To get these ideas across. So where can we send people?

Speaker 20:         02:43:45       Uh, the youtube channel has been slow. I ended up taking because I've been busy. I'm a college student so. Um, but look for the thought criminals channel in the near future.

Speaker 3:          02:43:56       Alright, I'm on with michael in Colorado. Michael, how are you? Hi dave. I'm good. Good to see you. Yeah, good to see you. So I have to tell you, we picked 20 people at a 1200 and I hope you take thIs the right way. You are the elder statesmen of the group. Oh boy. Not to add any extra pressure. Okay, well that'll give me a beer at the local bar. So that's good. Absolutely. So first off, you had a really interesting history. That's one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you. Uh, and you were in the navy, so first off, tell me when you served, where you served.

Speaker 22:         02:44:28       Um, I was in the navy. I joined and when I was 18 out of high school, uh, went in, in 1961. Uh, put that in context. Let's see. President kennedy announced the apollo program. A west side story came out and our president, barack obama was born when he was in diapers. I was in bootcamp and I served eight years, got out In 1969 to go to college. Uh, san diego. I was on a guided missile destroyer of all over the pacific for awhile, came back, got involved and the polaris submarine program and I was stationed in Spain for a couple years and then at charleston for a couple of years working on some high tech, you know, secret stuff and uh, said adios to that. And uh, went to school on the gi bill, took a degree in anthropology and pretty much minored in history. And then life going on.

Speaker 3:          02:45:23       Then life went on. When you look back at that part of your life to serve as part of your life, do you think of it fondly? Do you, uh, do you miss it? Anything like that?

Speaker 22:         02:45:33       I do think of it finally, you know, distance, you know, mate does make the mind grow a little bit more accommodating I think. But all, it was really good for me. How it had no idea what I wanted to do when I was 18 years old. My friends, many of them are going off to college, but I knew I wasn't really ready for that somehow. Um, it was good for me in a lot of ways. It helped me to grow up, uh, gave me some responsibility now that I can handle that gave me the equivalent of a masters degree in electrical engineering, which was a big help. But, uh, when I got out I abandoned engineering and went directly into anthropology because eight years of engineering is pretty, uh, is enough.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       But I'm pretty sure if my notes serve me correct that in 1964 before you went to anthropologie, you built a computer.

Speaker 22:         02:46:18       Well, uh, Built and more, more to the poInt I programmed my first digital computer because when I got into the polaris program that all the systems on the boats, these are intercontinental ballistic missile systems are run by computers, uh, in 1964, those computers, we're probably not quite as powerful as the iphone, but I was very fascinated by computers still still am. Uh, and as part of my training, we put together a little block system of computers, have a digital computer and learn how to do the basic programming. It was all what we call machine language. It was all ones and zeros. And then we went to the lab and we started programming where you're going on the big guys. Nineteen 64. So that was my introduction to digital computer.

Speaker 1:          02:47:03       Yeah. So that's so cool. So 1964, you're working on the very beginnings of a, of digital computers. And he said, oh, the zeroes and ones. Did you ever. Do you remember ever having the glimpse of what that could become? Did you ever think you could be walking around with this thing in your pocket that would be exponentially more powerful than everything you were working on at the moment?

Speaker 22:         02:47:23       I don't. I don't think anybody did at the time because it was the beginning of solid state to solid state years. These things are really big. Uh, they, they work, they were in cabinets, did, was open to et cetera. uh, I remember when the personal computer, they all chair those dose came out, you know, it was pretty neat. You can have one at home, but hell, you know, digital or ellie lcd watches were the big thing back then. And, and Texas instruments calculators. Nobody really thought that we'd be able to have an iphone and communicate face to face dick tracy, like things when I was growing up, the copies we, you know, we thought that would be pretty cool, but whoever thought that the, the advances will be that fast.

Speaker 1:          02:48:06       Yeah. I remember being at a friend's house. He's probably when I was six on a Texas instruments computer playing a. They had their own version of pac man. It was like they're ripped off version of pac man. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

Speaker 22:         02:48:17       Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there was a book called future shock. You're probably familiar with years ago in which alvin toffler predicted at progress would be so fast that by the time you began to get a little bit comfortable, the next thing will come along and you'd be a little bit in shock and you're dealing with that. The next thing will come to. The next thing would come and I think that's pretty much where we're at right now.

Speaker 1:          02:48:38       It does seem like that, that the second we get okay with a little bit of the technology or just some another app comes out the second year. Okay, with one and then now this one does something else and you forget that. IT's really. It's fascinating.

Speaker 22:         02:48:51       It is in the. You know, what I find kind of disheartening is a lot of people. One of the things I do here is I have on the library board or if I helped some of the older retirees here and try to deal with their ipad and their iphones and god help them, their windows, computers, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          02:49:05       That must be a trial

Speaker 22:         02:49:08       in patients. It's tough. Can you deal, can I give you. Can I give my mom your number? You can. Okay, good. Not a problem. Um, but you know, I liked a lot of the older people are now understanding that this is actually a device that can be used for things like we're doing here and for making contact with other people and spreading ideas and getting your ideas out so and so you become easier to use. You know, the human sense. People are going to look past the technology now. I have a neighbor who's, she's 20 years older than me. Alright. So she's 93 years old. She has an ipad, she has her, your email and little google things and all of that with her ipad. And she's quite quite familiar with it. It's sort of magic to her, but she knows how to use it so it puts her in touch.

Speaker 22:         02:49:55       That's really. That's pretty cool. All right. Let's shift topics altogether because you gave me a blind submission. You, you are an atheist. Were you always an atheist? When did you decide you are an atheist? You were an atheist before. It was cool. Now it's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a template that is still not cool. I can point it to. We have five churches and for real estate offices in a town of 800. So think about that for a bit. So you're, you're a real minority. You're a minority and a minority right there. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Especially here. I remember I was thinking about that and I remember when I was probably five or six and we were living with my grandmother going to church sunday mornings, sunday night, wednesday night methodist church, little north Texas town, sitting in sunday school looking out the window at the tree and the swing.

Speaker 22:         02:50:45       And so I'm thinking, god, I'd rather be eating place. Um, I think probably realistically about the time I figured out santa wasn't real. I had the same kind of questions are about the stories I'd been, I'd been taught. So for about as long as I can remember, I guess. Yeah. So one of the other things you mentioned is that you're, you're sort of fascinated by how a christians and and just religious people in general are often deceived by their sources. So it's not even necessarily the source itself, right? It's not necessarily the book itself, but it's sort of the messengers that are the deceivers am I getting what you said correctly? I think it's both those things, um, you know, if you look at abrahamic religions today, they don't have what we consider to be basic hardcore evidence for their claims. The only thing they have a for a source or books that stem out of oral traditions that stem out in ancient manuscripts that had been copied and recopied and copied and changed and different.

Speaker 22:         02:51:48       So I think there's a problem because the people who are there pastors and who are their priest and go to divinity school, they understand the history of their religion, they know the questions involved, they know the contradictions, they know that a lot of this is really false, but they don't tell that to their congregations. So the people who hear this really have no independent way of judging whether this is real or not. So if I have a book, somebody giving me a book and says, look, this is reality. I have some questions. well where it come from, what does it say? How do we know? What it says is true, etc. So digging back into those sources and being able to come up with what we think are historically realistic stories about all of this helps people to be a little bit more critical and judge the things that they just take on faith.

Speaker 1:          02:52:42       Yeah. So one of the things when I've talked to other atheists, and when I talk about atheism in general, one of the questions I get is people say, well, how do you have a moral center? Then? How were you able to have a code that you live by without religion? I think you're laughing already. sorta gave away your answer, but tell me how have you. How have, what have you based your moral center on?

Speaker 22:         02:53:05       What do I base my moral center on? Well, like I tell you know, we have two adopted kids there. They're adults these days and they're doing quite well and one of the reasons that they're doing well is because they know what's right and what's not right. You have this. I think humans have this inherent ability to to understand that the right way to act, for example, is the way you act when nobody is watching you. You come out of this feeling of compassion for other people. You come out of this feeling of being able to help other people and to be basically a good person. I mean sociopath's aside are normally constructed human being, you know, I feel that you understand this. I mean the greeks, I understood it, the romans understood it. The plains indians understood it, right? They, they are all allied to different religious system, so it's not an. It's not something out of a religious tradition or a book that says follow these rules. I mean, you know, it's wrong if you kill somebody in murder, for example, that's just human basic wrong. And I don't think it takes an ancient book and dictates from when the guy in the sky to say no, do this and you're in trouble.

Speaker 1:          02:54:20       Yeah. And if it does, there's probably a bigger problem. There's a bigger problem, a bigger problem. All right? So, uh, unfortunately have to wrap it up but let people know. Uh, so you're working on a book. Correct. And you have a website. So where, where can we send people?

Speaker 22:         02:54:32       You can send people. I have a book. It's already I self published it on amazon. The key fragments and it's about the sex. It's About basically what we've been talking about. Great. It's digging back into the sources and to finding out what we're going to segue into secular situation. What happened is a novel characters and action. You can go to the queue fragments.com. Uh, it's out there. Links are out there. I podcasted every chapter is a podcast that I read, so I just like people to read it, enjoy the tail and think about the message that underlies this, right, that all of these myths and everything may have come from some particular historical actors and people, but they're not necessarily what people are trying to get us to believe today.

Speaker 3:          02:55:18       Yeah. Well I love that message and I love chatting with you, so thank you so much. Appreciate it. Alright, thank you. Have a great night and thank you for your program. All right, I'm on with brandon and Ireland. Brendan, how's it going? I'm doing well. I feel like you could be my irish cousin. We are dressed exactly the same apparently. Actually my brother in law is half irish and his name is brendan. So there you go.

Speaker 23:         02:55:45       Okay, cool.

Speaker 3:          02:55:48       Oh god, um, I probably should know that I'm going to have to get back to you on that one. Oh no. Oh, you already got me in trouble. I think he's from near the local pub. The pub to pub everybody at. Alright. So what, what's going on these days in Ireland? We don't hear much about Ireland in the news. How's it going over there?

Speaker 23:         02:56:11       You won't heAr much about us, but we just had a new government forms 10 weeks after her election. Miraculously. No fan does. There's a lot of discussion kind of. And we have, we have water charges were brought in and that's been discussed a lot. Um, the, the fire life doesn't end the socialist parties. They're not very happy with it. Neither any really apart from the parties and governments. And there's discussion over repeating our eighth amendment, which is basically stipulates stopped. Abortion is legal and artists and obviously in the google phones we, um, last year we legalized marriage for homosexuals, which is fantastic. Uh, I wasn't in the country, I was, I was actually abroad in China for the year, um, you know, if you're irish abroad, which I was, I wasn't too happy and I couldn't go was, that was brilliant.

Speaker 3:          02:57:07       Wait, let's pause there for a second. So that's really interesting. So you guys voted for legalizing gay marriage, which is obviously very great and a very liberal, progressive concept. And then at the same time, you're telling me that they're voting on possibly repealing a law that would, uh, that allows abortion.

Speaker 23:         02:57:24       No, no.

Speaker 3:          02:57:27       Oh, so abortion is abortion coMpletely illegal?

Speaker 23:         02:57:31       Yeah, it's illegal.

Speaker 3:          02:57:32       Wow. So, um, I need to do prp. I assume people are having illegal abortions because people have them, whether it's legal or not. Right.

Speaker 23:         02:57:41       Generally heading over to england.

Speaker 3:          02:57:43       Wow. So you. So do you think the law is going to pass?

Speaker 23:         02:57:47       Uh, I would say there was a savior died last year. There was unsafe. And when opposition from perhaps with charities and stuff against, um, against gay marriage, no one really cares

Speaker 3:          02:58:05       are the churches. I mean, are they losing their power quickly? How, how much power do they actually hold over politics these days?

Speaker 23:         02:58:18       You don't get too many people's onto my house and they don't take it seriously. And most of our is very, you know, with regards to say homosexuality or whatever. Generally as a country we're generally quite alright with it would require that our country basically like, as long as you don't annoy me, I don't really care what you do. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:58:39       That's my personal ideology to

Speaker 23:         02:58:42       perfect.

Speaker 3:          02:58:43       Yeah. I need to get entirely the obviously. So you're studying politics, right?

Speaker 23:         02:58:47       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:58:48       What got you interested in politics?

Speaker 23:         02:58:51       Uh, I can't really remember. I think I just really wanted a, I don't know, maybe maybe it was probably the elevation with that new understanding african children and stuff. And you want to be like, oh, I'd love to help someone like that. I'm just kind of grill and grill was very interested in wars and I did, I did a module last semester which was ethnic conflict was that little of monsters in the conflict doesn't matter. So it's a lot of work in the united nation to my thought and a conflict resolution. I've actually my team final exam for the whole, my whole undergraduate artS began, so I'll be doing on saturday.

Speaker 3:          02:59:31       Nice. Nice. Well thanks for taking some time then. So how. No problem. So one of the things that you wanted to talk to me about is one of the things that pretty much everybody wanted to talk about, which is political correctness and how it's, how it's seeping into society. So what's going on on that front in Ireland?

Speaker 23:         02:59:48       um, I think, I think a lot of the stuff you see, ideas of racism and stuff are imported from America. We all think, oh, he probleMs with race in America is a very specific problem with racing. You know what I mean? And we think, oh my god, you're racist towards black people. Got, we never had that because, you know, we don't even our own country for nike, nike for years, you know, 25 years, right. Um, we'll get, we'll get people is generally higher lefty for people in the, on the social spectrum. I'm not saying you, you don't have to social stuff seat to be ridiculous, you know, as, as, um, as marginal as to saying, you know, regressive left and off and you get that. We had that. She was dealing with the german group together to heat up. They had a protest here. It was like a hundred people, 300 people. So

Speaker 3:          03:00:40       yeah. So it's not really picking up steam there.

Speaker 23:         03:00:43       Well, this particular incident, they were chased down the street by, by a counter protestors to which we were like, I, I totally disagree with that reads. They're racist, they're fascist, whatever, but up behind themselves. But I think in art and we're doing okay and when you look, we see stuff or having an american law walking by it

Speaker 1:          03:01:05       for everything that's going on here. I'm wondering, wondering about some of it myself. Don't worry.

Speaker 23:         03:01:09       I, I think we're okay, but I mean when it comes to, when it comes to terrorist attacks, I'm criticizing islam. You do get some really known. Is onsite is the use of islam in a violent way? Use of anything. What? I mentioned the underclass and hoodie when he looks.

Speaker 1:          03:01:28       Yeah, that's been one of the through lines here because we're just talking about ideas and you mentioned an idea and you get some funny looks in class.

Speaker 23:         03:01:36       Yeah. But no, no one is known as shutting me down. Naming this safe space, which is progress.

Speaker 1:          03:01:43       So you don't have. You guys don't have safe spaces and trigger warnings?

Speaker 23:         03:01:46       No. If he smiled or university and they're too small, I've been. Oh, it hasn't caught on yet.

Speaker 1:          03:01:53       I think it's a combo. Maybe have small universities and a lot of beer. Would that be fair to say?

Speaker 23:         03:01:59       No, I think it's not showing up the class because of the period before.

Speaker 1:          03:02:05       There you go. Well listen, it was, it was a pleasure talking to you and if you have any other fashion recommendations, let me know. All right. I am on with brianna in Japan. Brianna, how are ya?

Speaker 24:         03:02:16       Good, how are you?

Speaker 1:          03:02:17       I'm doing well. So according to my notes here, you are in Japan via Tennessee. How many people can say that?

Speaker 24:         03:02:25       Uh, not very many. So from personal experience they probably don't even know to see is here 99 percent of the time. So yeah. So tell me, imagine,

Speaker 1:          03:02:36       tell me a little bit about that. So do you grew up in Tennessee and when did you move to Japan? What are you doing there? What's going on?

Speaker 24:         03:02:42       Yeah, so I grew up in Tennessee. I was there for 18 years of my life until I moved to philadelphia for college and I've been in Japan for the past six months now, or study abroad. I'll be here a bit longer and let's see, in Japan they know what the Tennessee waltz is and that's about it. I don't even know what that song is. I figured out about it when I was here. It's an oldie, I think their knowledGe of the states.

Speaker 1:          03:03:11       Yeah. So what, so, so six months in Japan, how have you been having major culture shock? What do you like? What don't you like? Has it gone?

Speaker 21:         03:03:21       Hm.

Speaker 24:         03:03:22       It has been pretty good so far. The culture shock isn't as bad as I thought it would be. No, it's pretty globalized world at this point. So you know what Japan is like difference wise. So it's been pretty good so far the biggest difference has been the academic system. So it's pretty fundamentally different from american conceptions of education. Yeah. So that's one of the things.

Speaker 1:          03:03:50       Yeah. And that's one of the things that you had written in that you wanted to talk about a little bit about academia and the difference between America and Japan. So let's,

Speaker 3:          03:03:58       uh, let's do that.

Speaker 24:         03:04:00       Right? So it's essentially been really refreshinG being here because a lot of them more and knowing aspects of american academia are not present here at the moment. They might be later on in the future. Right. So like what for example, so like the big issue with academia right now, as you can imagine is the ideological like constraints placed on lots of students there. But college in Japan is not a very ideological place. Like the classroom is a sacred environment. You do not talk about ideological things there. So it's pretty much not an issue which has been really good for me because that's one of the reasons I wanted to come to Japan to avoid that because my college is very stereotypical, very liberal and very free speech sensor should be in lots of ways.

Speaker 3:          03:05:02       Sure. And a lot of the people that I've been talking to today are mentioning things like that and we, we know about all this stuff. So in Japan, is there a drawback to having sorta of no ideology in the classroom? Like is there any kind of drawbacks to just sort of straight information?

Speaker 24:         03:05:18       There is a bit of a drawback. Japan's academic structure has its own issues that I could complain about all day. We only have eight minutes. I know compared to the issues with America right now. I could deal with theM way more because that's essentially just me saying why do I have to respect the teacher all the time? I'm american, I don't respect people. So that's really the main issue. But like information being presented here just so straightforwardly really does seem to help like nip the ideological issues in the bud there because that's not something teachers are supposed to be doing.

Speaker 3:          03:06:00       Yeah. So how has it for you, you said you'd been there for six months, uh, being uh, an outsider in a pretty homogeneous society. Have you had any challenges on that front?

Speaker 24:         03:06:12       Um, I actually have nights. It's pretty interesting like people stare at you, but people stare at anyone who isn't japanese here. It's, I think 99 point seven percent of the people here at japanese. And the points three people who are left are mostly korean and chinese. But you're an oddity no matter what you look like if you're from the west. Do you speak japanese? I speak japanese. Aired quote gary, don't worry. I'm not going to test you. Don't worry. I started studying in college, so I am in no way fluid. Yeah, that's nice. Speak enough to prize people greatly.

Speaker 3:          03:06:51       Yeah. So one of the things that you had written in that you wanted to talk about that I thought was really interesting

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       was about content creators being unfairly criticized. Um, and I think what you were referring to is generally just sort of these youtubers that put their thoughts out there that ended up getting trolled endlessly. That's the sense that I got. Am I, am I right on that? And if not,

Speaker 24:         03:07:11       please correct me. Yeah, there's that. And then there's the broader sense of content creation where it's like there are people who are writing books or making comics or movies that are being endlessly criticized with a very ideological bents at this point to the point where not meeting certain very leftist standards is considered a drawback in a fault when it probably shouldn't inherently be. Yeah. So give me, give me an example of that. so it's like, it's not like I am mad when women show up in comic books, but I don't think it's all that fair when you get comic books polled because they don't have women in them, but that's not a drawback. Yeah. So that is the kind of see many years ago now, because I'm old with the joker comic book cover where the joker was abusing bat girl because the joker, the joker, but they had that comment but cover poles and the artists essentially blacklisted because they said it encouraged violence against women and that should not have happened. The joker was a bad guy. That's what bad guys do. Yeah. A lot of people seem to really mix up what characters do versus what the author dies. So it's the George Lucas argument where it's just like he put layer in a skimpy outfits like jabba the hutt, but later in a skimpy outfit, his job in a hives is a bad guy and you're supposed to think he's creepy. Yeah. Do you find that fascinating?

Speaker 1:          03:08:47       Yeah, I mean I, I find that totally fascinating that people seem incapable of certain amount of people are incapable of separating the artists, the creator, George Lucas, who draws, you know, comes up with the idea of java and then he had it, he had a slave and he put her in a sexy outfit and people think that's him imposing his view on what he thinks women should be. It's kinda crazy.

Speaker 24:         03:09:12       Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I don't wAnt to send George Lucas. He's done verY objectionable things on other things. Jar jar is that a jar jar knock. It's a knock against many, many aspects of the star wars universe, but not the slightly a thing. It is fine.

Speaker 1:          03:09:33       Yeah. You know that star wars is like everything to me. I mean, I don't know what to say right now.

Speaker 24:         03:09:39       I'm sure you would agree with me on many of my complaints.
