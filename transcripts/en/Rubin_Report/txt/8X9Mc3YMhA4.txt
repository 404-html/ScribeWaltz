Speaker 1:          00:00:05       We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty this week and joining me today as a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, as well as a professor of economics at George Mason. Don Boudreaux, welcome to the Rubin report. Happy to be here. I am glad you are here. I saw you speak about a year ago in Dallas. I want to get the exact title of the speech right. Uh, it was called, can we bring sound economic thinking to Washington? That's a tough task. That was a year ago and uh, I don't think there's much sound economic thinking or sound thinking and Washington, forget economics for a second. These things don't seem to go together these days. Uh, Washington seems to repel something. It attracts unsound thinking. Yeah. Well, you think it was always that way, or are we in unique times? What? We're definitely a unique talent and unique time. So I was born in 1958, so I came of age right when Ronald Reagan, right at the end of the Carter administration, when even Carter's pushing for direct, at least accepting deregulation taxes were being cut airline to being deregulated surface transportation is being deregulated.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       Reagan gets elected in 1980. Milton Friedman has this popular show on pbs called free to choose a Thomas. I learned about Thomas Soul. Everything seems great. And there was, this world is fine. And uh, so in my life in my life, there was a period in the past when the thinking was more sound quibble with it, but compared to today it was, it was outstanding because it's definitely, it's definitely declined. Yeah, it's hard to imagine even that around the time of Jimmy Carter that deregulation, I mean that, that Democrats could have had anything to do with that. And yet the Ted Kennedy was a major force behind airline deregulation. So it was, it was something, I'm not sure what it was exactly. It was something in the air, uh, starting in the late seventies. And so, you know, I was a young man then I just took it for granted, this is fine, you know, we were winning and then it culminates in 1989 with the collapse of the, of the, of the Iron Curtain in 1991, the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       And then here we are 2018 and a lot of nonsense is back on the front burner. Nonsense is back. So let's jump back though to the seventies for a second because I watched an interview with you this morning. Something happened to you I believe in 1977 that, that woke you up. And I think it sort of is a nice entry into everything else that, you know, I know what you said. Yeah. I said is most important to what happened to you in 1977? You can come up with a couple of options. They don't know. The date was, was, was January 24th, 1977. I remember it was a um, I, I was in college. I went to police. My mother, my plan was to drink beer, chase girls. I did a lot of the former, I wasn't successful with the ladder, but I was then I was going to drop out of college and work at the shipyard where my parents worked, so I needed a class to fit my schedule and needed the Monday, Wednesday, Friday class.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       So take this class called economics, didn't know what it was, took it and uh, I had a great teacher and so she drew supply and demand curves on the board and she said, look what happens when the government prevents the price of something from rising to its market level, it creates a shortage. She says, you remember the gasoline shortages of 1973. So yeah, I was in those and I just thought the beauty of this economic explanation for the gasoline shortage was so spectacular. I wanted to learn more about the subject. And so in very short order, I just fell in love with economics. I'm still in love with it to this day. Yeah. So tell me what happened after that. So now you have your spar and what, what sort of, what academic procedures did you have that got you to where you are? Was very lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       Again, she was a really good teacher and it wasn't a famous economist at all. She was a very good teacher. She took a great interest in her students. She taught economics as if it was something relevant to the real world rather than just a mathematical puzzle. Uh, and there was another guy at my I went to puts called Nicholls State University and Tibideau Louisiana and it says it's a very small school, but I had another professor there who was into Milton Friedman into high Eq, into Ludwig von mises into James Buchanan, who later became my colleague at George Mason. So I would go to his office, his name is bill field, and he would give me these books. And so I remember just really just tearing through these books and it just made so much sense to me. I realized in reading these books that all my life, I didn't give much thought to politics.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       Not much conscious thought, but all my life, uh, I think somewhere deep inside of me was a classical liberal or libertarian, someone who believed that is basically impolite to button to other people's business. Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and not only impolite, I mean it's, it's downright, it's downright offensive to do so. Yeah. You just said to him, my buzz phrases, so classical, liberal and Libertarian. Now, one of the questions I get most because I define, I say that I am a classical liberal if I need, if I need a label on it, that's what I am. And people will always say to me because I talk about many of the things that you teach about, about free markets and all that stuff, and I believe that freedom is the best way for humans to flourish. People say, Dave, you're really a libertarian. You're just holding onto this definition of liberalism from 18, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       Do you see a meaningful. How would you define each one and do you see a meaningful distinction? I don't see much of a distinction. Depends on who you talk to. Some people see, see distinctions. I think what they both have in common, maybe distinctions that the margin libertarians maybe tend to be a little bit more radical, uh, uh, but uh, uh, a, what distinguishes classical liberals and Libertarians as broadly from almost any other political group, a, is the consistent, uh, uh, believe that any exercise of power by the state must meet a huge burden of proof. Uh, the, the, the, the burden of proof is not upon the individual to make the case his or her freedom. It's upon the state to make the case, to Intro to, to override that freedom. And I believe in libertarian or classical liberals as I think of them, believed that that burden is a real one and it's a heavy one.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       Sometimes it can be met, but too often the reverse is in place. People believe that you have to, that the burden is on those of us who, who defend freedom to make the case for freedom. And I think it's backwards. So basically you view it as sort of a bottom up way of looking at things. It's about the individual first and the government is not giving you your freedom. It can take it away, however, by instituting all sorts of policies. Yeah, I, I'm in this case, I am A. I think John Locke was right in John Locke, wasn't the only person he put John Lott most famously in a, made the argument in this, in the secondary of some government that, um, uh, you know, human beings have rights and human beings delegate to the government, uh, powers that you, that, that, those who do the delegation believe are appropriate for the government to defend those rights.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       Um, you can quibble about how historically accurate that is, but I like, I think that perspective is philosophically correct. Uh, no government gives me or you rights governments are excellent at offending rights and taking them away. Uh, but, but just because government is to protect your rights doesn't mean he gives us rights just because farmers, because we couldn't live without farmers, if no one grew food and, and, and did ranching, we would all starve. That doesn't mean that we owe our lives to farmers. Uh, one of the great things about the society that we live in is that it's a, it was called the great society to be distinguished from when the Johnson's great society and that is, it is a society of many, many individuals each specialized in doing various things. We're all coordinated by the price system in, by the rule of law.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       Uh, and so each of us makes a contribution to the welfare of others, but no one of us is utterly essential. And that's a really good system, I believe. Yeah. So I want to talk more about hiking a little bit because you do run the cafe high Eq blog. Uh, you mentioned the burden of proof that the government has to meet to say when it's right to actually infringe on some of your rights or basically do things. Yeah. So this is where I would say the classical liberal and Libertarian positions that are a little bit different. I see some utility for the state, although I'd usually want it done at the, at the state level, not the federal level and libertarians. It's sort of hard to pin on when it's enough. And you alluded to that when you talk to libertarians, how do you get to a place where, where it's not, you know, I always make the joke, it's like eventually you'll just be in mad max or the true anarcho capitalists, which I enjoy talking to, but I view it as more of an intellectual exercise than a practical.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       Yeah, I mean, I, I'm very sympathetic anarcho and philosophically I'm, yeah, but I'm not a, I'm not a, a, a, a blow things up kind of guy and I'm way too much of a hierarchy. And to understand that you just can't replace social institutions. Wholesale Society has to evolve to wherever it's going to be from March, from being a realist. I mean, you couldn't blow it up. I say, Oh, well, yes you could. But history has a lot of really telling examples about attempts to blow up societies wholesale in those examples have never turned out well in practice. Uh, let me say among the people who will call themselves classical liberals, right? None of them are ever at a w, whatever, express any sympathy for animal capitalism among Libertarians. Some of them will say, oh no, I, I believe there's a role for the government, but you do it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       People who classify themselves as Libertarians who say, at least, at least in principle, I believe that the society could exist without any formal institution have monopolized coercion and I, I am in that latter latter. Yeah. I might be the one classical liberal who will do it, or maybe that. Maybe by that definition I'm a little more libertarian, but again, these things. Oh yeah. Yeah. We're, you know, it's really sort of the narcissism of small differences in exactly in this little place. All right, so what are some of the basic principles? You're a professor, what are the basic principles that people should know about economics? I know I'm giving you a wide one there, but for someone watching this, that that's waiting for their 19, 77 moment. So in no particular order, right? Number one, scarcity is unavoidable. We live in a world of scarce resources, which means that if you use some resources to do this good thing, you take resources away from the ability to do other good things.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       They both good things, but we have to choose do we want to do this good thing or do we want to do that? Good thing. Second thing to note in order to make that decision, uh, we want the people involved who are going to be affected both by the loss of that which is not done and by the benefit of that which is done to express their opinions honestly, how, how valuable is this thing that we propose to do and how valuable is this thing that we propose to give up in order to do this first thing? And, and to do that, we, you, you need people on the ground who are actually affected by these decisions to have a, a meaningful say. You don't want a third party looking down making declarations. Oh, I think you should have that. And I think you should not have had that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       So any social mechanism that gives each of us as much of a say as possible in how we use resources and, and, and make the evaluations about what will, what will happen if we use resources in this way and what will give up if we use resources in this way that that's important. Unintended consequences is another important concept. Uh, you know, Adam Smith in the wealth of nations which is rightly considered to be the start starting point of modern scientific economics. He, he famously talked about the invisible hand and this is, is this the sort of an unintended consequences kind of explanations, not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer there, Baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interests, they don't dislike you. They value as a customer, but they are doing their jobs, not primarily to help you.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       They're doing their jobs to help themselves and you are buying from them, not primarily to help them, but primarily to help you and your family. And in that way, everyone's either. So this is a good unintended consequence, but you have, you have bad unintended consequences as well as one of my favorite examples of a bad unintended consequences. The minimum wage raise the minimum wage. It looks like you helping low skill workers if you might help some of them, but in fact you putting other low skilled workers out of jobs and you're keeping them out of the job market for longer. And so economists think what makes a good economist, which distinguishes a good economist from a bad economist or non economist is, is a consistency and asking questions always asking as compared to what? As compared to what, where did that come from? How are we going to pay for that?

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       What did this cost, uh, uh, what will be the longterm consequences down the road beyond the immediate ones that, that everyone can see. So it's just a, it's just a consistency and asking those questions. You know, it's funny, as you're answering the question, it keeps making me think, well, this shows you why politics is so screwed up because they get up, they're all politicians on either side and they either say $15 minimum wage, Bernie or trump, I'm going to cut taxes on you. Or they, you know, they loved their bumper sticker stuff, but nobody's ever said unintended consequences in a presidential debate. So how frustrating less that be as an economist, listening to people who are not economists who really aren't experts in much of anything, I don't know that Bernie has ever created a business or made anyone make a dollar off and I'm not aware of it overnight.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       But that must be incredibly frustrating to hear non pros talk about the things that you're a pro at. It is Dave and you know, it's especially frustrating about it. It's not rocket science. I mean, I love economics. I love my profession and I really admire the best among my professional colleagues, Milton Friedman and high Eq. But it's not rocket science. It's just this consistency of always understanding that there are consequences beyond the immediate, uh, that, that there's always a cost to something, uh, that no matter how beneficial something is, it has to be weighed against that cost. So these simple, a simple understanding and the consistency and applying that understanding, it's not difficult, but so few people do it. So it is, it is frustrating. You. Years ago I stopped. I, I joke that I stopped watching the evening. People my age used to watch the evening news, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       I remember it. I have some recollection, hey man, I had to stop watching the news. I was always threatened to throw my shoes through the, through the screen because the reporters, they would very much like the politicians, they would report on the immediate effect, Oh, the minimum wage is going to rise. That that means that workers will get a raise of whatever the amount is as well. What it does it, it means that for some workers, but it means also other workers are gonna lose their jobs. Some jobs, the nature of those jobs are going to change. Employers aren't just going to sit back and say, oh, well we've got to pay higher minimum wages, so let's just be higher minimum wage. Where's that money coming from? Where are those resources coming from? They have to come from somewhere. Yeah. So basically your argument would be that the government's only role in the economy is to make sure we're not killing each other pretty much.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       Right? Like it really it's a total laissez faire at. Yes. I am a very laissez faire guy if, if property rights are well defined and secure, and there's a strong case of government plays a role of Ken play, a role in helping to define and certainly helping to secure property rights. So that's where your contract rights. So that's where you're not in Oracle capitalists, right? Well, I'm, I'm, I'm close to being right. I mean, I, I'm, I'm willing. I'm willing to admit that we're gradually giving that to Devon. I'm willing. I'm willing to admit that anarcho capitalism might not be a, uh, uh, ultimately a defensible position. I am not willing to admit that free markets are an indefensible position. However, property rights come to be. However, they are defined, however they are enforced when you have secure private property rights and freedom of contract, which includes importantly the freedom to say, no, I have the freedom to not contract.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       Uh, then people are led to pursue their people in pursuing their own interest, are obliged to help others out. And that's how this great society that we live in and it is great, uh, continues to grow and become more prosperous. Yeah. So I mentioned to you right before we started that, you know, I've had a political awakening of sorts and I always say to people, I didn't really move, but the left went so bananas. I ended up being friends with all these Libertarians and conservatives and whatever, whatever it is, even for the differences we may have, but one place I have shifted is that I am much more aware you are economically now and partly that's because I now run my own business and have employees and have to deal with that. And I just wrote to obscene lehigh checks for taxes for the year.

Speaker 1:          00:17:17       I mean, we are in California. You don't want to know him like that one was in the federal loans even worse, and it's like you're more successful. I get the harder I work, the more they want to take from you. And I tweeted something about that on tax day and a lot of people were angry at me and said, well, it's, it's, this is the price to pay for success. Would you rather be poor? And I didn't want to go on a major tweet storm and you wisely or not on twitter, but could you, could you give me something that, if I ever get in that fight again, I can say to people why that's not the right way to think. So let me start off with just asking you. Have you heard the story about George Mcgovern when he retired from politics? He a big sale, please say, so George Mcgovern, he retired from politics.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       I think I have the details right. He certainly had the major part of it. He started the BNB, uh, you know, in, in, in his home state already. Like where this is going. Yeah. And, uh, then he encounters all these regulations, you know, labor regulations, safety regulations, uh, and he admits, I can't remember now to whom he admitted as a long time ago. He didn't, he, he admits, he said, you know, I've spent all my, I'm not quoting him, I'm going from memory. So I spent all my life pushing for these things. I was sufficiently attentive to the downside of, of, of, of these taxes and these regulations. And so it's easy to, you know, to sit in Sacramento to sit in Washington dc to sit in some, you know, local government, a office building and tell other people how to live and to tell other people how much money they have to give to you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       And you can be well intentioned in the best sense of the term, but you are not those other people and those other people are bearing consequences and they know of things that you don't understand. And so on, on the, on the, on the, on the tax thing, I like what, uh, my friend Ed Crane said about, uh, the famous quotation that is above the door of the IRS building in Washington. It's a quotation from justice Oliver, Wendell Holmes who said, I think this exact quotation, taxation is the price you pay for civilization. And Crane says, no, that's wrong. Taxation is the price we pay for being insufficiently civil law. Civilization is, is when we cooperate peacefully to help each other. And so even if we grant that there is some role for government and once you granted some role for government, it's very difficult to not see that there's some appropriate level of taxation to fund that role for government.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       Uh, how much that may be true that we need, that it represents a failure of us as a society to become fully civilized. We've somehow not managed to figure out how to cooperate peacefully and voluntarily in those matters in ways that we have managed to discover how to cooperate peacefully and voluntarily and doing what we're doing here today and going to the supermarket and the supermarket dealing with the various suppliers that, that it has. None of that is, is funded with taxation, so all funded with voluntary voluntary payments. That is civilization. So I liked the notion that the taxation is a, it's, it's sort of a measure of how little we are civilized or how far we have to go to be completely civilized to make sure we're not killing each other. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So. All right. I want to get back to a couple things you said there. So first. Okay. I know that I know that the minimum wage is, is a big one for you. And even just this morning I write another story about how Bernie wants this $15 minimum wage. The anecdote that I keep using or anecdote that I keep using is that I keep traveling, traveling all over the country right now, and in almost every airport you go to fast food places and they don't have

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       people anymore. They have ipads. Yes. Now perhaps if you could pay people less, people would have jobs. It wouldn't be the greatest job in the world, but it would be the way it's always worked. Now we are literally replacing people with robots that may be inevitable no matter what, but to say that you have to pay people again, even from my own business here, I get people offering to work for me for free all the time. I want to pay people appropriately and we do pay all our people. Um, but the idea that the government would force me to pay someone x amount, it seems completely bananas. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       the minimum wage, uh, puts low many low skill workers, auto jobs. If, if, uh, a teenager is not worth $7 and twenty five cents per hour, employers who are not in the charity business are not going to hire that teenager at that price, that teenager will go without a job or go without a job in the, in the above ground economy, make find a job paying more in the underground economy, which is a different set of problems. Uh, and so that is the major unintended consequence of the minimum wage there. There are others, but that, that's the big one. Um, and if, uh, you know, what people like Bernie Sanders, I mean, because I speak to proponents of the minimum wage all the time with most of them do, they just stopped the analysis at the surface. Oh, wouldn't it be better to be paid $15 an hour and said, of course.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       So this is, they don't want to get to the unintended consequences, but I think because I think because most of them believe that they just had this image of employers as being a really rich, a highly profitable operations. And so if you raise the minimum wage, oh sure, it has a cost, but the cost that's going to be born exclusively by employers, but it's a fact. Most low skilled workers work in highly competitive industries. They work in food retail, you know, they work at lawn care, they, they, they work in, in, in, in supermarkets, restaurants. These are highly competitive industries. So there's no big profit margin. They are. So when you raise the minimum wage is not coming out of the profits of the employers. It has to come out of some change in the way the employers do their business. There's nothing wrong with automation, of course.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       Yeah. But there's a, there's a proper amount of automation and if you raise the minimum wage, you get too much automation, uh, because you put and too few human workers. And here's, I just want to make this clear, here's another unintended consequence of the minimum wage. And not only does it deny income to those workers who lose their jobs worse in most cases, it denies those workers would what's even more valuable, namely the opportunity to get that first piece of job experience. And so the 16 year old who otherwise would have gotten the job without the minimum wage becomes a 17 year old or 18 year old who's still a never employed person. Whereas otherwise they would have had job experience. And so it, it, it swells, officially swells the ranks of, of, of unskilled workers. Would there be a direct correlation then once you have this whole set of people at this imaginary $15 minimum wage, they are also going to raise prices on basic things, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       I mean, is there a direct correlation? Price prices may rise a little bit because you get, you know, the economy's a little bit less efficient and so you get a little bit less output, but the price increases aren't, aren't the major problem. The major problem is employers will find ways to satisfy their customers, uh, at slightly higher cost to the employers, but at huge cost to those workers who, who lose their jobs. So when you've talked to kind of miss on the left that disagree with you on this, and I get what you're saying, that they're not taking that next step. I'm sure there's someone out there that has made a sound argument that you just disagree with you. So there is one sound argument, one sound theoretically, one theoretically coherent argument for the minimum wage. And that is if employers have what's called monopsony power vent, then I'm going need you to find that one.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       Yes, monopsony power. It's like monopoly power. Except so monopolist is the only seller. A monopsony says the only buyer. Okay? So if you're the only buyer of low skill workers in the market, but you as an employer, you then can be easily shown. You can keep wages lower than they would otherwise be too low. And given that you, it can be then shown that if the government comes in and sets a minimum wage right, then, uh, the employer will in fact pay the higher minimum wage and no employees will be harmed. But it's a very, very strict criteria are very, very strict. And the idea that that Walmart and Mcdonald's and Burger King and KFC and all the mom and pop restaurants and and made services and lawn care services that we have throughout the United States, the idea that any one of these is a man alone monopoly buyer of low skill workers is just absurd.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       All right, so one of the things that you write about a lot is that the idea of middle class stagnation is actually wrong. Yes. We hear this all the time from politicians for I think my whole life that I was ever caring about politics. It's always that the middle class is shrinking and the extremes are getting bigger, et Cetera, et cetera. But you actually take a different position on it. Yeah. This middle class stagnation thesis is stated as if it's an established fact with no arguments against it. It's just, it's just wrong. I think you were born in the mid seventies, right? Seventy six. Okay. So according to this thesis, it was. It was right around that time, mid seventies when. Apologize. That's okay. It was your fault. So the American middle class had been chugging along, upward hits the mid seventies, and then it's been stagnant ever since.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       So ordinary Americans today, so goes the thesis lived no better than ordinary Americans lived when Gerald Ford was in the Oval Office. I think this is crazy. I mean, I have, I'm, I'm, uh, unfortunate old enough to remember the 19 seventies and although one zone personal experiences shouldn't be a basis for scientific conclusions, they're not irrelevant thing. I know I come from a working class US family. I remember how we lived in the seventies. I remember what cars were like. I remember when television was like, or what healthcare was like, things are a lot better today for ordinary Americans. And so a number of years ago just started looking into this, this thesis, uh, the, our data that you can find that the people who propose this thesis a point to, uh, that, that lends some superficial credence to the thesis. But here's just some of the problems with these data.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       Uh, they adjust for inflation in ways that vastly overestimate the amount of inflation that we've had since the mid seventies. So mean vastly under counting the growth in real incomes since the seventies. A lot of these data, we'll look at household incomes, uh, well, the, the typical population of the American household has fallen since the mid 19 seventies. Today it didn't sound like much, but today it's about 11 percent lower than it was in 1975 a. But that's actually a pretty significant. So the same amount of income and a household and it was spread over fewer people. And so the individual individual people are, are, are, are richer, meaning we're just not having as many kids that we're not having as many kids. We were becoming wealthier so that now, well maybe not in the last 10 years or so, but for much of this period, uh, younger people I've been able to move out of their family, their parents homes at a younger age and start the households younger, uh, older people are able to continue to live by themselves rather than moving with their, with their children.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       The quality of goods and the variety of goods and services that Americans, ordinary Americans have access to today is astonishing compared to what it was just 40 years ago. I actually spent a lot of time looking at catalogs from the mid 19 seventies, you know, sears roebuck catalogs, and then you can look@sears.com today and you can look at the prices that we charge back that course. Nominally they will lower, but then you just take those prices and you divide them by the wage that the average American earned back then and do the same thing for the prices today and divided by the wage of the average American owns today. And what you find in almost all cases is that the amount of time it takes to work in order to earn enough income to buy a pair of jeans, a shirt, a washer and dryer, and an airplane ticket is dramatically less.

Speaker 1:          00:29:26       Today. American. We don't have to work as much today as we did back then in order to get the things that make our standard of living as high as it is. So did they. Just the people that believe in this, that they just do a great sell job. I mean, how did this meme, how did this idea get out there? Because you hear this all the time. This is one of the few things that you hear on both sides of the aisle. Yes. Yeah. And in fact, I, I, uh, yes, I think the Paul Krugman says it all says it all the time and I think in a way kind of backfire when people in the left because they keep saying it. And I believe that's one thing that helped the drum ups popular support for Donald Trump. You know, middle class Americans have been stagnating. So let's do something about it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:02       Let's electronic. There's an interesting psychological thing there because I think maybe most people think they're in the middle, like they probably think it no matter what. Like they, if they're not destitute and if they're not worth $20, million bucks, you probably think basically you're in the middle. Yeah. So it's a way of making it, about you, even if it's actually not the case. Your question, if I'm not sure exactly exactly why it caught by, this myth caught on and it has held on with such tenacity. This myth has been going, has been around now for 20 years. It started in the mid 19 nineties and it was actually an economist. He's now at southern, at Smu in Dallas. He was at the time at an economist at the Dallas Fed guy named Mike Cox, and he's the first one who really started looking into this. I said, well, let's, let's, let's, let's look at various measures of living standard.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       Let's look at how much ordinary people are consuming today compared to in the mid seventies. This will kind of, let's let, let's, let's look at what happens when we adjust for income using better inflation. Adjusters come, uh, Mike Cox Found that my work is derivative of my cox is that once you start doing this, this whole middle class stagnation thing just crumbled into dust. It's just not true. It's not to say that there are no problems. It's not to say that the middleclass wouldn't be even wealthier, had not had, they'd been better policies in place. Whatever you think those policies might be, but it is to say that it's just crazy to believe that an ordinary American or an ordinary American family in 2018 has a standard of living that is indistinguishable from that of an ordinary American family in 1975. Yeah. Do you know what basically the economics look like if you're considered in the middle class right now, like the economics there really like numbers that you look at on both sides and go, all right, that's what middle class is because I think that's part of the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       It is this sort of a morphis term. Yes. Yeah. Uh, I, I don't believe that they are the, the Census Bureau. Among others, they will divide household income into quintiles. Uh, I don't recall what those numbers are at the moment, but a common definition should take the three middle quintile. So you'd get rid of the top 20 percent. You were at the bottom 20 percent. You have the middle 60 percent. That's the middle class and upper middle, middle, middle, lower, middle. Uh, but the Census Bureau does something interesting from time to time it out. So it divides household income and two different categories, less than 15,000, 15,000 to 25,000 on it and on up to like I think 250,000 and above and attracts adjusting for inflation. It tracks household incomes over time and you can in a perverse way finding these data that the middle class in America is disappearing.

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       Right? But it's disappearing into the upper classes. If you look at the percentage of households in America who are earning a in the lowest percentages, right? They're shrinking the only, the only categories in which the percentage of households in the US are increasing or in the upper income levels. And so actually I think the very lowest it might have ticked up a little bit like the blessed in $15,000. But in the great middle they have fewer households percentagewise earning in those categories today, but more earning $100,000 annually and above. And so in one sense, yes, it's tricky, but it's getting Richard, there is no evidence that we're getting poor. There's no evidence that it

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       meeting. Yeah. So we talked a little bit in an ancillary way about taxes earlier, so I'm not an economist, but I'm going to lay out what I think is sort of a fair tax system that's consistent with all the ideals that we've talked about here. And I want you to probably get. Have I had my ideas either I'm going to be either I'm going to blow your mind or you're going to tell me that I'm way off. So something like this, this is what I've said a couple times, is that I'm basically four attacks a flat tax. You don't get rid of exemptions. Let's say it's about 15 percent, but we can. We can fiddle with the numbers, but it's about 15 percent. I would exempt everyone making let's say less than like 40 grand, maybe even 50 grand so that they have a little more disposable income that they can do things which, which I think is good for them and good for the economy.

Speaker 2:          00:34:12       And then just because I'm still, I still have a little bit of a guilty liberal in me. I would even be willing to do some sort of progressive tax if you're over say 10 million a year or something like that, even though I know it's not right, and I'm sure you can get rid of that by the end of this conversation, but there's still a piece of me that says that, but basically saying that for the huge, vast majority of the country, 15 percent lidl exemptions may be a little trickery on the high end. I think that's consistent with the sort of classical liberal idea of minimal involvement and, and equality of opportunity and what you're all paying in. And hopefully we'd call it a slimmer trimmer government, you know, so. So some glimmering in your eye.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       Yeah. Yeah. So, so as I said earlier, I think one of the distinguishing features of an economist has always yes. Compared to what? Right. As compared to what we have now. I mean, that's, that's, that's close to. Perfect. All right. I'll take it as compared to what my actual ideal would be, given that we're going to have taxes, it's not quite my ideal. I would indeed get rid of the, the, the, the progression at. That's just the guilty part of me. I think that still exists. So the way I look at the way I look at people who earn those kinds of incomes, assuming they earn, and most of them do, they earn these incomes in the market. That means that these people are especially good at making life better for ordinary Americans. They're especially good at creating jobs. They're especially good at increasing the value of my 401k.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       But what would you say when people say, but they don't need eight yachts and helicopters and all that? Uh, I would say they earned. It's theirs. It's not up to me to say what they are. It's their money. I can make an argument against that. I know is there's a lot. Again, your system is better than what we have now, but definitely if we're going to have income, taxation of flat tax and I'm willing to have the exemption for the lower lower incomes, flat taxes, the way to go. Uh, uh, not only does it prevent a lot of political chicanery messing with brackets and, uh, but it, it is economically a better system when you tax all income earning activities at the same rate than the relative prices of different types of labor services stays the same. When you have progressive taxation, you create greater distortions in the economy and that, that makes us as an, as, as a, as residents of this economy.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       It makes us all a little bit less wealthy than we otherwise we'd be because the economy has to deal with these distortions. So what do we do about spending? Because at the end of the day, that seems, at least when we're talking about this from a government perspective, it's really all about spending that you can tax out the Wazoo and regardless of whether that tanks the economy or, or fixes it or whatever, that that's almost irrelevant. If you just keep spending, especially because of the amount of debt we have and we're, we know we're never going to pay it back. Which is why it's probably good that we have a lot of bombs, but that's a whole other. That's a whole other discussion, um, you know, because one day if China calls him the debt lateral, but, but how do you reign in spending, because this seems to be the thing that all the trump people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       They all thought he was going to reign in spending this on quite the opposite pack. And, and it's, it's, I think it's more than ever before. It is. It is. So I think the big question, I don't know how to do it. We can speculate about changing the constitution, put in constitutional balanced budget amendments, constitutional caps on spending. I'm skeptical of all of those things. Government has many ways to get around these, these paper tiger provisions. Uh, the problem is the problem is Americans today look to government and they, and they, they basically, you're spending other people's money and so if you're spending other people's money, it's easy to spend. My, my former colleague, Russ Roberts had a piece in the Wall Street Journal many years ago entitled something like if you were paying, I'm having steak. So imagine, you know, imagine that we all go to a restaurant and you know, the different menu items, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       Well, you can go to a restaurant and you and you're picking up your part of the tab, right, you, you, you may order a steak, but that's because it's worthwhile to and you will have to pay for it. Uh, but you might, if you have to pay for you might not already sick, it might order a, a less expensive dish, but if it's going to be even, it's just to be shared, then based then the bulk of your extra expenditure is shared with the people you're going to dinner with. And that's true for every person that, that dinner. Right? And so you wind up with this bizarre circumstance where every person acting rationally winds up ordering too much winds up asking of the restaurant too much. We wind up asking if our too much, but we have to pay for it. The resources do not fall out of the sky free.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       They're coming from somewhere. And, and because we're spending too much, we're taking resources from where they would be better used and putting them were really, none of us want them to be used, but we all wind up using them there. I know you said before that an anecdotal story is not proof of a bigger theory, but as you're saying that, it reminded, I don't think I've ever said this publicly publicly before at my brother's Bachelor Party when I was a struggling comic and I had no money. You know, I had maybe 50 bucks in my pocket. I don't know. I was the best man. All his friends were in banking and lawyers and they all had money. Big rollers were at a fancy one. The one fancy plays the Borgata in Atlantic City, the one fancy nice place in Atlantic city. And we're sitting around this huge table at a really super fancy restaurant and um, and all the entrees are 80, 9,000 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       And I'm looking at him like, you know, what am I going to do here? I was going to get the chicken for maybe 50 bucks or something. And I was sitting with my, my brother's one friend who also was kind of struggling like I was. We're both saying, all right, we're going to get the chicken for 50 bucks. We go around, everyone's getting steak, lobster, steak, lobster, steak, lobster, steak, lobster. It gets to my friend Josh. He, he's the whole time he's gone. I'm getting the chicken. The waitress says, what do you want? He goes, lobster. And then I just said steak like that, like, and it's exactly what you're talking about. You suddenly lose concept of what's in your pocket somehow. It's gonna Happen, right? It gets the bill's going to be shared. Then the, the, the, the additional cost to you of ordering states adopt a tiny fraction of the actual additional cost to the steak.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       And that's the problem with, with government today. We have people in Washington spending other people's money for the benefit of yet other people. And when you do that, you just get too much, too much spending. Uh, we, we've, I don't know a better way to say it, it doesn't sound very economic understand, but we've lost the ethic of respecting other people's property once government gets money, once government officials figure out something that they fancy is, is, is good, and it may or may not really be good. Uh, which doesn't mean necessarily it's worthwhile, but maybe a good project that doesn't mean that therefore we should go ahead and spend money on it. Uh, there's an insufficient connection between the spending and the, and the, and the experience of the cost of the resources that go into the spending. How much of this do you think is not an economic problem but a political problem so that if a politician was to get this right, let's say there's some magical politician out there who really understands economics, but he knows if he goes to the Senate.

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       So I suspect rand Paul's kind of like this. I think he basically gets this and he does fight the best fight generally that I think he can, but that they, these guys want to get reelected and saying to people, we're going to spend less on you even though you know it's. It's the best thing we can do for you. Actually, it's going to free you up one day and it's not going to tank the economy and make us slaves to a foreign nation and all that. It just doesn't work politically because it's not the easy answer of people more. I think it's exactly right. Let's face it. Each politician has a timeframe that extends to the next election. Right? So in the case of members of the house, that's the only two years case of the president. That's four senators, six, that's not a long time frame.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       Anything beyond that timeframe is irrelevant to that person politically today or to make it relevant. That person has to have an ethic that is very rare and unusual among politicians and people with that ethic tend not to be, not to succeed in politics. Handful do manage to get in, but very few. So you have people without that ethic and they're just looking towards the next election, which is at most, again, only two years away for house member and so if the bill is coming due two and a half years from now, if the, if whatever other costs are going to happen, two and a half years from now, uh, or, or alternatively, if, if taking some action that's only going to, it's going to have costs today, but, but huge benefits, no matter how huge two years from now, four years from now, I'm not going to take it because it's, that will do nothing to get them past that next hurdle which is getting elected reelected.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       So in a very depressing sense or in a sort of dystopian future sentence, are we in a certain way? Are we on a pathway to destruction no matter what? If you think about it, I mean if you take that line of thinking long enough, right? So we have a sort of weak political crew dealing in ways that are the reverse of how economically we can be successful. Pretty, pretty much always going off the off the cliff. So despite all that upset, I remain optimistic and I'm not, I'm not sure why I feel the same way. I remain optimistic. Um, we, we still have a respect for private property in the United States. We were still a very entrepreneurial culture. Uh, uh, we still hold politicians to. Some of this is less now, but to some level of, of responsibility, I say that, um, my libertarian friends are going to get.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       We're saying I think there's something, there's something there, a look with the political problem has always been there. I think the US Constitution in the past up until about eight years ago maybe did serve more as a constraint that has largely been shoved away. But by and large, we've still prospered over the past 80 years, uh, almost in spite of ourselves. So this something is something in the American mindset that something in our gumption, and I don't want to sound like a mobile Rah Rah, but there's something about this society of ours that remains, remains relatively open, remains relatively free property. Private property rights remain relatively secure. I think we still have something of a of a rule of law in in place and what I've learned in the 40 or so years that I've been pondering these issues is that a free society is far more robust than I once believed it to be, which is not to excuse or justify any of the abuses that it takes, but it's really robust and I have no good sense of where the point is. I don't believe it's indestructable. Yeah, but I have no good sense of where the point is where you hit that point and suddenly things are destined to go into the, into the gutter. We may be moving there now. I have a 21 year old son for his sake. I certainly hope we're not close to that, but my gosh, if you look back to the 19 thirties, I think things will even worse than idealize governed. You know, the, the, the trend of government wise than they are today and yet we did pretty well.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       I'm glad that you just said idealize because one of the things that I focus on here is talking about ideas for matter. That's, that's the whole purpose of what I do. Do you think that these ideas related to freedom and the individual and laissez faire capitalism and all of the things that we've discussed here are taking root again, because that's how I started. You mentioned my interview with Thomas Soul right before we started and I sense it, and again, this is. I can only tell you what I'm personally feeling and what, what I. The feedback I get and all that, but I said to Thomas or to Dr Saul, I said, do you realize that the renaissance of your work is having and I think he's Kinda, he's Kinda just over it personally. I think he's proud of his work, but I, they shouldn't be. Yeah. And of course they shouldn't be, but I think just on a personal note, he's kind of like, yeah, I've been doing this for a long time and that's great, but I really sense these things are taking root again, even though the mainstream media won't let you really believe that and they still will always elevate the people that are pushing a lot of the more socialist stuff instead of some people with some.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       So getting, getting back to something we said earlier, I think it took a lot of people by surprise in the late 19 seventies when the ideas for cutting marginal tax rates directly deregulation, uh, uh, took hold. And I think that's because people like Milton Friedman, uh, my, my late colleague James Buchanan had been working years earlier in helping to hire years early attempt to make these ideas sound and, and accepted. And they were in place. And when the crisis of the seventies hit those ideas had an effect. A No one knows the future. The future is not destined to repeat itself in the way that it did then. But there are a lot of really good people are you, you're doing great work. Uh, there are a lot of really creative young people today push refining these ideas, polishing ideas, presenting them to the general public in new and more interesting ways and uh, maybe it's a hope over experience.

Speaker 1:          00:47:14       Maybe that hope over, I hope over reality. But I actually believe that these ideas are strong. I think they are appealing and there they are out there and well today in our made 19, May, 2018, we can't see when they'll take root, but I think that they will in fact protect us. That's a. So that is the optimist in you and I have that too because otherwise, how could we do what we do? Right? I mean if, if the answer, if you would look to me 10 minutes ago and said, yeah, pretty much. We got to go off the edge there then one, then I would have had some of the booze you have about behind Mr. let's just so drinking right now. Just wait for Armageddon. Yeah. No, I, I, I, look, I believe. Here's something that I did not fully appreciate 20 years ago that I do appreciate it now.

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       Twenty years ago I was a more hard nosed economist. Now ideas are really irrelevant. They don't matter that much. It's, it's, you know, you know the institutional constraints. I do think institutional constraints matter. They're important, but I've come to see ideas as by far the single most important constraint and fuel for a society largely affected by the work of Deirdre mccloskey. For. Thank you, pat on. It was one of my favorite shots that met you. Interviewed deirdre's work has influenced me greatly and her work. She's not the only one, but she's done more than any other modern economists to make the case for the role of ideas and I think she's correct. She's correct in that. So in that you must be incredibly helpful then because I mean, I feel the idea revolution. I'm on tour with Jordan Peterson now and I keep going up there and saying there's an, there's the right kind of revolution happening.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       We're not killing each other in streets yet. And how does that get stopped by an idea revolution? Yeah. And so at the beginning I mentioned that I came to economics because I was impressed how economics explained they'll gasoline shortages in the 19 seventies. So I know if you remember a few years ago, you know, gasoline, Obama was in office, gasoline prices are rising, people are complaining. Here's the importance of idea ideas. There were, there were no serious calls, even the in the Obama administration to go back to 1970 style price caps on an energy. I took that as a, as a, as a good sign that's saying it won't happen in the future, but I believe the reason that was the case is because the economists who ics, Milton Friedman and among the others who explain the devastating roles of price ceilings on energy, those ideas was still around.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       They was still out there, still out there and they prevented anyone who would propose such policies seriously from being taken seriously. And so that, that notion of returning to the seventies style price caps just never got a hearing a few years ago when gasoline prices were high. So that, that, that, that that's one, a data point that supports our optimism. Yeah, that, that's great. I mean, I, you know, it's a long game, right? I mean that, that's the point. It is a long game. I want to talk a little bit around regulation before, before we wrap up, I had a, you may know him, the biology professor, Bret Weinstein, who's been on the show and he said he's a friend of mine. Uh, he made an interesting comment to me the other day. I think maybe he tweeted it out and then we discussed it a little bit

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       about, well, if you're, if you're taking the true libertarian approach and you're against all regulation, will, are you saying that you want no regulation over the airlines for example? They have any safety regulations or anything like that and what? We didn't have a ton of time to get into the conversation. I said, I said Brett, very quickly, what I would say is I think airlines are in the business of getting people from one place to another and they do all their due diligence and if the idea of a government bureaucrat coming in to make sure that this little thing is this way as if they have more knowledge about it than the airline people, I find that to be pretty faulty, but, but we sort of left the conversation there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       What do you, what is the right amount of regulation as a, as a Libertarian, oh, I'm in favor of huge amounts of regulation and I'm not being facetious. I love regulation. I believe the best regulator really given this is the market. It's a competitive market, is consumers being able to spend their money, uh, as they choose and, or not to spend it as they choose. It's the freedom of different, uh, producers and entrepreneurs to enter markets or leave markets as they choose. It's the competition among producers. That's where real regulation comes from. The market regulates activities. You're, you're right about the incidence of airlines. For example. Uh, no one has a stronger incentive to make sure that a multimillion dollar piece of machinery doesn't just willy nilly fall out of the sky, then the owner of that multimillion dollar piece of machinery, namely the airlines or the company that they're, they're renting it from.

Speaker 1:          00:51:49       And so the competition among the airlines, the, the, the need for them to protect their investments, that is a tremendous source of regulation and it's a very nuanced source of regulation. It gets it right and it's not subject to political control or political manipulation. So a government. So government regulation is too often, uh, actually deregulation in the worst sense. It's government relieving businesses have the need to be as responsive to consumers as they would otherwise need to be. So we, we, we, we call for example, uh, uh, uh, occupational licensing. And that's a form of regulation. Well, no, it's a form of deregulation, deregulation. It deregulates the, uh, existing producers in the market from having to be as responsive as they otherwise would to consumers. So for example, this would be like you have to have a license to cut hair, California. Yeah. And so if, if, if I, if I'm a hair braider or a barber a or, or an electrician, and if this, if the government prevents people from entering in competition with me, that makes my life easier. I don't have to be as responsive to consumers. I can charge higher prices, I could supply a less high quality services. And so I am deregulated in fact by that. So called regulation.

Speaker 2:          00:53:10       Basically you would say it's the risk you have to take to be free, right? So that in other words, that if you're an electrician and I have somebody come into my kitchen, we had a little light thing the other day now. Yes. The guy who was licensed, I guess because it's got to be licensed, but you're saying it's just the risk that you have to take. He

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       doesn't want to come in here and burn my house down, nor do you want him to do it. Right. This is another unintended consequence of so, so called government regulation in that if people come to depend on it too much, they just assume whoever you call up, call up and say, you know, I, I need some electrical work done in my house. Well, we live in a state where electricians are regulated, so this guy must be okay. Um, uh, maybe, maybe not, but if you knew that was up to you to check, first of all the market supplies, all these wonderful ways of verifying a quality. So if, if anyone was free to practice being an electrician, a, you would have easy access. You as a consumer, we have easy access to various mechanisms to, to, to, to, to rank various electricians by how, especially in a video and all the apps.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's, it's a total myth to think that the government is more concerned about our welfare and our property. Then we are who's more concerned about your house than you are, who's more concerned about your personal safety and health? Then you are a. The government might pretend that it's more concerned or that it's somehow has deeper insight to what is best for you, but I don't buy it. Uh, I think, I think young children, uh, they are, they don't know their interest as well as their parents do, but once you become an adult, the presumption must be that each of us is an adult cares for and knows our best interests much better than any third party does reminded of something else right now. I think maybe I got too many of my old economic theories from the simpsons because do you remember that episode knew very early on with Mr Burns at the power plant and he's leaking, you know, nuclear waste into the river and they get a three eyed fish and the whole idea being, if you just let business do what it wants, it's going to pollute the river and you're going to be eating three eyed fish.

Speaker 1:          00:55:19       But that's completely the reverse of everything you've said. So. So, so what, what an economist would say to that as well, you know, there are some areas where, uh, your actions as a private citizen spill over onto a innocent third party so they have no input. So reasonable people can disagree about the proper role of government in preventing pollution or, or preventing third party effects. But so much regulation has nothing to do with third party effects. It's simply to say, you know, if you want to get your hair braided a, you have to go to one of these people that we approve, you're not allowed to go to that person over there, uh, who, who does not yet have our approval. Well, there's no third party effect here. And a surprising amount of regulation is of that sort. Yeah. I mean, I remember when I bought this house and you have to have all the people come by and the inspectors and everything and they're looking for these little absurd things that I'm talking with the builder about it, well, this has to be an inch this way over here and blah blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       And it's like, there was no answer for it. I mean, a couple of times I say, well, why is that regulation to regulate? That's how it is. Someone in Sacramento's said this is how it should be, and then that's how it is and everybody, everybody. So another problem with government regulation is that it's one size fits all and I don't care how smart you are or, uh, how, how much experience you have in the past, particularly in our highly dynamic, in our highly dynamic economy. Things are always changing. Different people have different risk tolerances. Um, so one of my least favorite regulators is the FDA. Uh, there are very few third party effects with the FDA. The FDA is a, a drug regulation affects you and it prevents you in consultation. If you choose with your doctor. And most sensible people would consult with a physician from choosing what level of risks you are able to subject yourself to in order to relieve yourself of pain or to, to, to fend off imminent death.

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       I don't believe that any bureaucrats business but yours. You may make a decision different than differently than I do, but so what we all have different tastes. We all have different preferences, preferences, we all have different tolerances. I don't believe that it's the government's position to say, no, no, no. Your preference for risk is too great. We're not going to let you take this experimental drug because we think it might hurt you. I don't see that's the government's business at all at your business. Right. And you better get as educated as possible. I mean, this is where I would say it comes down to education and, and, and, but, but who has a better incentive to become informed and educated on the matter then you, it's your life. Yeah. Right. And, uh, uh, uh, yes, you can tell stories. Well, you know, maybe you won't, but I can tell stories too.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       Well, how do you know that this bureaucrat over here is going to do as good a job? I'm willing to bet that you are much less likely to, to be, uh, uh, a less careful. Yeah. With your life than this guy or gal is with your life. Yeah. All right. So since you said it was a long game, and I know how much high Eq has influenced you and you right at cafe [inaudible] dot com. Let's do what are the ideas of how got, I know we've actually explored a lot of them here, but if there was something that, uh, I told you before that a lot of my audience, they go out and they, they get books after and they start reading on all of this. What are some of the ideas of high that you'd like to impart?

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       That society is vastly more complex than we understand it to be particularly a, a market oriented global society? You know, we talk about it in vague terms about the labor market, the amount of trade, you know, the, the GDP numbers, all these terms and numbers mask, enormous underlying complexities. All the action that makes our society work is done at the local level. Uh, and that, that's a core hierarchy and insight. And if you start acting at this, at the higher level, the risk is that, that you will stamp out, you'll, you'll see a stomp out, you'll smother these individual adjustments. At the local level that actually bob, whose consequences bubble up to the top to make it all work. There's a great hire he, he's not the most quotable of, of guys, but there's a great hire quotation. I'm not going to get it exactly right, but it goes something like the curious task of the economist is to, uh, uh, remind me again of how little they know about what they imagine they can create.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       Right? So, you know, we can imagine Bernie Sanders imagines he can create a world of everywhere. Everybody gets paid at least $15 an hour. The other people imagine they can create a world in which in which no one is dies because of a drug overdose. Well, well, you can create that world. It's far too complex and that's the, that's the critical hierarchy. And inside the world's really complex. And therefore for truly complex, we want to devolve decision making authority down to the lowest possible level and not have people who are slathered in Hubris, uh, uh, making decisions for those of us on the ground. On that note, I think you're an excellent communicator of those ideas. That's what it's all about, right, and it's reciprocated that very much. And for more on Don Checkout, Cafe High Eq Com.
