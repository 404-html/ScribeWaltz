Speaker 1:          00:02          Years

Speaker 2:          00:03          is upon us, so we're going to be doing a little progress report here. I hope you guys had a chance to check out my interview from last week with Peter Boghossian. For those of you that might have missed it. My intention with Peter was to focus on atheism as well as critical thinking. These are ideas that Peter wrote his book about, spends most of his time talking about and are obviously topics that I'm interested in. I think at about 13 questions prepared for Peter, but like many of my interviews, the conversation pretty much just took a life of its own and last week's case though, something particularly interesting happened no matter how far I tried to steer the conversation away from the regressive left and I tried many times. All roads kept leading back to them. I've mentioned to you guys a couple times now how I want to talk about all kinds of things on this show from science to politics to spirituality and much more.

Speaker 2:          00:50          I've also mentioned to you guys how I don't want to solely focus on the regressive left primarily because it doesn't necessarily solve anything. Still. I find myself incredibly torn about this topic on one hand until the last couple months, we hadn't even diagnosed the problem of the regressive left, right? Clearly huge numbers of those of you on the left were upset about how your team was being hijacked, but there wasn't a place to come together and talk about it, much less a whole group of likeminded people willing to share their experiences and tell their stories. For that reason, I've wanted to keep this conversation going. It's important to realize how many of us are actually out there. There are a lot we want to fix the left, but I don't think we can without getting to critical mass on the issue. On the other hand, I don't sense that we can actually change these regressives.

Speaker 2:          01:38          As I've also mentioned before, since we've started doing the show, I've seen these guys continue to lie and smear opponents only to be caught and then doubled down or even more. Some people are fighting back against these lies with facts and logic. Fortunately, I've had several of these people on the show, like my new eyes, Sarah Hater, and God said, others I know only from the online space such as my guest this week, Ali Rizvi Ali's, an atheist Muslim who's constantly writing about and fighting against regressive ideology growing up mainly in Saudi Arabia and ultimately leaving religion for secularism. He should be a natural hero of the left. Sadly, he's not a. that's one of the many things that we're going to talk about. I go back and forth between thinking that fighting the regressives by putting time and energy into discussing them is what will ultimately do the most to change the landscape of the left and then just thinking that if we ignore them, maybe they'll go away.

Speaker 2:          02:32          I tend to think that most of you will tell me that we have to keep amplifying real liberal voices and that by ignoring them will only let their influence grow. That's pretty much what I think too. I must say that I'm incredibly inspired by the fact that half the time when I see anything that they write, tweet or whatever, there's an army of people ready to combat their bullshit. A few people have mentioned to me that they believe that this whole regressive situation and the fuel it gives to the right is only gonna get worse before it gets better. Unfortunately, I think these people are probably correct until the real, legitimate, true voices of liberalism can come back to the forefront. This conversation is always going to be stuck between the regressives and the trumps. It looks like we've got our work cut out for us for 2016. My guest this week is Ali Rizvi. Allie writes for the Huffington Post and his first book, the atheist Muslim losing my religion, but not my identity is being published in 2016. He's a strong advocate for the advancement of secularism and science, particularly in the Muslim world. Allie, welcome to the show.

Speaker 3:          03:39          Uh, Dave, glad to be on.

Speaker 2:          03:41          So we've been doing this as I start almost all my shows by saying that the guests, we've been doing this on twitter for a while and you are another one of these anti regressive warriors. So I'm happy that you're joining me this week.

Speaker 3:          03:54          Yeah, you can, you can't help but be. I mean it's just uh, doing anything like this. It's almost synonymous.

Speaker 2:          04:00          Yeah, it, it absolutely is. So. All right, we're gonna. We're gonna. Talk a little bit about the regressives of course, but let's, let's talk about you first. I want people to understand sort of who you are, where you come from a, you spent most of your youth up until your early teens in Saudi Arabia. Is that right?

Speaker 3:          04:16          Right. I did. So I pretty much grew up there. I was born and then after that we moved to Tripoli in Libya. Lived there for several years and then I went to Saudi Arabia where I was actually until high school. And then after that I went back to Boston again for a university and then came to Canada. So why were you bouncing around so much? My parents are professors and they liked going in different places and they, they, you know, they got really good job. Offers are both very, very competent and uh, so they've traveled all over the place. Yeah. So those are just the countries we lived in and you know, we used to visit all over the place. So just generally when it comes to North Africa and the Middle East and South Asia seen a lot of places growing up.

Speaker 2:          05:00          Well interestingly, all three of those, particularly Pakistan and Libya are probably extremely different now than they were when you were there.

Speaker 3:          05:10          Olivia. I don't have too many. I mean that's when we lived there when I was a kid, so I don't have, I do have strong memories of it, but uh, they're probably not representative at all by the way it is right now. And in Pakistan is also very different than it used to be and I haven't been there for a while now. I can't go there. So.

Speaker 2:          05:30          Right. So, uh, we'll talk about why you can't go there in a little bit, but let's talk about Saudi Arabia for a bit because it's such an important player in world politics and its relationship to the United States. And I feel like people actually know very little about Saudi Arabia, the nature of our relationship. What was it like growing up there? Your parents as professors obviously came from the, I'm assuming that was middle class, sort of educated middle class. Well, how did that relate to

Speaker 3:          05:58          religion and secularism and all that? It was, um, it was, it was complicated. So the way I describe it as my own nuclear family, like my parents and my siblings are sort of a liberal, progressive type of Shia Muslim family. And so we had that. And then outside that I was in the private American school, the American International School in Riyadh, the time. So the school was obviously, it was American, so we had an American textbooks. We listen to American music and uh, you know, I mean it wasn't, it was an American school but had people from about 80 different nationalities that. So it was a truly international school, um, and then the, um, outside of that, when we stepped out of that, it was, you know, cover your hair. Women can't drive, you know, five times prayer and if you're outside during the prayer, you know, you'll get caught by one of the baton was they call them, which is the religious police.

Speaker 3:          06:55          So it was strange seeing all of these three things. But when, you know, when you're growing up with something as a kid that is normal for you, that's what you think everything's like. So I actually think that it was a good thing to be exposed to all of those worlds at the same time. So I was uh, you know, when, for instance, when nine slash 11 happened, uh, I could, you know, the Saudis coming in from there. And I remember the mentality that there was, there was one thing I described in my book is a, when I was in fifth grade at the American school, we'd made paper snowflakes out of you fold up a piece of paper, you cut snowflakes and we decorated them with glue and glitter and our names. And we were happy, I was about 10 years old and uh, it was, even though it was an American school, the Saudi Ministry of Education used to send an inspector once in a while to make sure everything's okay, everything's going according to the rules.

Speaker 3:          07:57          And he came in and he actually cut the tips off of each of the snowflakes, was very angry and cut them off and we asked our teacher what was going on so I can know what is this. And then she told us about the Star of David and why we can everything that has six points that sort of symbolizes that. And that was our whole class of 10 year olds. That was our introduction, at least my introduction to the Jews. Right. So, um, and this was just a spot check from an inspector, but their kids, it's hard to will go to the Saudi schools. They have the stuff in their textbooks. The guy who did that spot check for us was actually, he actually writes the curriculum for the rest of them. So when nine slash 11 happened and I saw that kind of culture, those people coming in from there and then the people in my school, like the Americans, they're the ones being attacked over here. It was, it was really strange seeing it because I've kind of grown up with both sides in parallel, you know, the, and all my teachers were American and a lot of my friends were from the US and Canada. On the other hand, the company I was living in was a place while the hijackers came from.

Speaker 2:          09:05          So at fifth grade. So you're probably, I guess that's about 11 years old or so. Um, was that sort of, were your secular awakening? Was, was happening, is that the time of that or how religious was your family? Were you, were you guys away from it already or break that down for me?

Speaker 3:          09:25          Well, my family was, my family was sort of liberal, religious. I mean, there were Muslim, they were believing Muslims. We used to go through the, you know, we did the Ramadan thing. We used to go where she, we to do tomorrow morning. Uh, my parents used to prey on and off, but usually they made it to like two or three times a day on average. Um, so, you know, they were,

Speaker 2:          09:45          there must be an interesting diagram of people praying and then the sort of dropoff as it gets later in the day. Right.

Speaker 3:          09:51          There is, I, I don't know, a lot of them Muslims, you actually believe pray five times a day. Every time I watch TV and uh, it's, you know, this is a slight tangent, but every time you know, you google, North American, Muslim or American Muslim, you'll get a whole picture of people with head scarves and you know, people in mosques and so on. But they're just, as a representative of us Muslims is, as you know, any modes and group care and Islam or not,

Speaker 2:          10:19          what is exactly why we should all be talking to people like you more because I have no faith that the media is giving us examples of any, forget religion, ethnicity, whatever it is. The media gives us such bad examples of everybody that that's why we have to talk to the outliers. Right.

Speaker 3:          10:34          And you understand it in a way, and I'm sorry we're going away from your original question. That's fine. That's fine. Yeah, I understand it in a way because you know, for instance, if there's something, some story relating to Christianity, you're not exactly going to call it pastor or you know, somebody who's a was a, a priest or something like that is an expert in Christianity. But um, the thing with Muslims as it's different when you think Jerry Seinfeld with David Letterman, you don't think jus right? But with right,

Speaker 2:          11:02          well I don't think letterman's Jewish, but I think either way

Speaker 3:          11:05          I thought he was a comedian so it's close enough. Comedian is a whole different. That's a separate. I think that's another thing. But um, you know, when you, when, when it comes to Muslims, I mean Dave Chappelle, Dr Oz, Shaq o'neal, like all of these guys. I mean these are people who are Muslim, but that's not who you say that, that's not the representation. Even though they're right here in front of our faces. So when, when you see it on tv, it's always the one with the headscarf. Every, almost every non Muslim I know who works with the Muslim of work has gone for a beer with them afterwards. You know, a lot of people have dated Muslim girls and they've very few of them actually wear the headscarf. But

Speaker 2:          11:44          I'm pretty sure if, uh, if Shaq was the main representative for Muslim, things would be extremely different right now. You wouldn't, they probably probably for the better. Um, so, so tell me a little more. So your family. So you guys were sort of religious but not that religious. You were getting some of this at school, but that was obviously Americanized a right.

Speaker 3:          12:05          Keep going. I mean, my, my main, the first time is truly skeptical of that religion. And God was when I was five years old and I actually had a cousin and she was three and this is said that she lived in London and she had childhood leukemia. So, you know, she was close to my age. I was five. She was three, you know, we were playmates and uh, when she was dying, everybody who came into the room, so this was like an art in the culture, you know, last moments every once in those kids where they're there and it's a, if you know what a child's death, especially from cancer, it's absolutely horrific. So cancer doesn't discriminate. Same amount of pain and adult fields is what a three year old child would feel. So print at that time there wasn't really any good cure for childhood, acute lymphoblastic leukemia either.

Speaker 3:          12:54          So at that point my mother and my aunt were praying and crying and I was standing there with my father and I asked my father, I'm like, you know, what's going on? And I was watching her in pain and he said that God's taking her back, you know, God's taking her to a better place and keeping her with him. So I'm thinking, okay, that's not such a bad thing. So why are they crying and why they praying so hard and they're like, they're, they're begging God not to take her away. They want him to, you know, like stop the pain or not take away and to me like in my mind we used to play tug of war at school, so I was thinking of the tug of war game where there's this God who's all powerful apparently and we're on the other end and we're pulling it. It just seemed like a very sadistic thing to do.

Speaker 2:          13:41          It also, it also sounds like such a losing proposition if you're the believer, so if in this case your, your, your father, assuming he was a believer or or that maybe he was just playing the role as a father, but it's a losing proposition if you pretty much know medically that the child is not going to make it and yet you have these people praying and you know the outcome is pretty much in front. What are you actually saying about prayer is also an interesting angle.

Speaker 3:          14:07          I mean that's the other thing. I think that if the of God is all powerful and there's a three year old kid in pain, you don't find. I understand, you know, you have to take the kid back then don't like don't draw it out, don't drop the agony cause of cancer deaths are terrible. We, you know, at that point that the clarity of a five year old mind, I obviously that I remember this very clearly. It's one of my earliest strongest memories just because of the intensity of it. And after that I thought it was like, okay, nobody's really going to be happy with this God character anymore, but the next week or every ritual, everything got was a hero. You know, everyone who's continued praying to him. So it didn't make a lot of sense to me. And then after that I thought I was like maybe, well all these guys, you know, all the adults grown ups think it makes sense.

Speaker 3:          14:50          Or maybe I'm the WHO's crazy, but then I'd see I'd watched TV and there'd be a disaster, natural disaster, a tornado or a flood or something, and the lone survivor or two would say, no, I'm God bless. God saved me. I'm so thankful to God knows. I'd always think know what did the other people do, so as a kid it was always there and then I dabbled in and out of being religious to some extent, like whenever had exams final. Is that. Well, that's where the prayer would kick in. Yeah. So it was, it was like my cousin used to call the bing God reviving God. He was a very religious guy.

Speaker 2:          15:29          God probably took your brides. I'm guessing you were pretty good student.

Speaker 3:          15:32          Yeah. It turned out that I was fairly. Yeah, I did well in school. Like I did, turned out whether I prayed or not. God somehow was okay with me. But all those kids with HIV in Africa somehow. Yeah, just somehow my grades were okay. But HIV for the kids in Africa, not so much.

Speaker 2:          15:53          Alright. So you, you have this awakening and it, and it's happening now where, where was the full, sort of more adult version of your awakening? Were you still in Saudi Arabia or was that, uh, when you had left already?

Speaker 3:          16:04          I had, I had, I had left. I had gone, gone to medical school at that point in Pakistan. I finished, I'd completed it, and towards the end of it I had a actually really started reading. Um, the, uh, well I'd started reading the Scripture and everything, the Koran when I was much younger, but I think when the internet came around and I wanted to do more research, I was able to find more things. So this was around 99 or something. I was already in my twenties. I'm a, I'm a little up there. So yeah. So I started, uh, you know, when I actually started reading it, then when people got more and more defensive about it, the more I talked to, especially in practice, then when you talk to people, they give you all of these responses. Like, you know, those aren't true, Muslims are, you know, this is sort of a bit of peace or that thing that you're recording from the crime that's mistranslated or misinterpreted or it's a metaphor or whatever the excuse was gonna. Eventually it started seeing through it and then I think it was actually one day when it hit me. I'm like, this, I shouldn't have given considering this. I mean, this is a guy lived inside a fish. You know, there's, it says it says in its. I'd hear that in the Koran. For me it was a karate for a lot of people. It's a bible and everything, but

Speaker 2:          17:23          by the way, we should note that they're all equally crazy. There's plenty of evil stuff and all of them we want, you know, we want to be good liberals here, so let's not pile on one right. There is plenty of awful stuff in the Old Testament. Sure.

Speaker 3:          17:36          They always say that if Moses hadn't hallucinated up the Old Testament, then you know, Muhammad couldn't have plagiarized it. It is an and there's a lot of similarities as a no pork. There's no for, for miles,

Speaker 4:          17:50          there's a Shalom and Salaam and then both of their nicknames are mow it in a way. There's a, you know, there are a lot of similarities between, especially between Judaism and Islam and the violence and the books. It's absolutely. I mean that's a, that's an obvious thing, but I used to think of like, what are you doing when people would quote a 4:34 which says that you can beat your wife if your disobedience as a last resort and they justify it now like, well no, it actually means this or it's only as a last resort. And I used to think, I'm like, if I had written this in my book and the book came out last week, you guys would be killing me for this. I mean there's the word you wouldn't be looking for context. You wouldn't be looking at alternative interpretations. That's a luxury that we only afford two holy books and we don't read Alice in wonderland that way.

Speaker 4:          18:39          So you know, the and the, you know, people like, for example, Reza and so on will be like, no, this is, we should not read this. Literally like the worst thing is that people will read it. Literally. I was actually on a, on a show. I was on the agenda with Steve here in Toronto and I was sitting next to Shabbir Ali, who who's an Islamic scholar, and at one point he actually said, he's like, look, people misquote the Koran by quoting it. Literally. I was just thinking that that was one of the most amazing sentences, if that's a great quote right there. He's a great guy. But he said it and I used to think, I'm like, I understand why they're so terrified of people quoting it. Literally any script, because it's terrifying. If you could, if you quote those words exactly the way that they're written are exactly the way they were said by God, apparently a, then it's a terrifying thing, you know. So they say, well, you have to look at the interpreters and the scholars and then you listen to the scholars and they're saying these human beings, their explanations of what's God, when God's word is actually means more than what God's word is itself, which again doesn't make any sense, and Isis and al Qaeda and the Taliban, um, these are these people. They're not quoting scholars. I mean they're, they're quoting scripture. And recording the deed.

Speaker 2:          19:57          Yeah. You know, after the Paris attacks, I got into it on twitter with one of my, one of my friends on the left who were immediately was, you know, with within wild the thing I think while the event was still happening, so literally they hadn't caught anybody yet. I mean there were bodies still on the floor at the theater. He immediately went to the American foreign policy stuff and then a few minutes after that they released the guys who did it. Isis actually released the statement and there was a ton of scripture in there. And I said, well, what do you think about this? And then the conversation sort of dwindled off into nothing and I. and I think that's part of what this whole schism here on the left that we've been talking so much about is related to, you know, like it's scripture, it's written word that somebody is believing and taking into action. And then also there's a lot of messed up foreign policy stuff by every country in the world.

Speaker 4:          20:47          Yeah. I

Speaker 2:          20:48          always find it. I find it interesting that whenever I'm, I'm debating or I'm having a discussion with anybody, usually if it's someone who is moderate or someone or an academic or someone else in Islamic studies for instance, they don't want to talk about the scripture and they're like, well, come on, let's just not talk about the scripture as if it's sort of beneath them. It's like, you know, we're going to talk about the social logical implications with this. You know, how does religion workout is ideal identity formation and all of these other things, economics and so on. But whenever I talked to a guy with a beard, you know, someone who's more of a fundamentalist and I like at times I'll sit and I said this on the show to Shabbir Ali too. I was like, well, let's not get into the whole scripture thing, but they almost always turned around and say, no, that's what's important.

Speaker 2:          21:28          That's what religion is. So the people who are actually believing it and going along with the tenants of it and actually following the example of the prophet and so on. These are people who actually take scripture very, very seriously at the rest of the people don't and I think it's because there is an element of rationality and then they just can't believe. They're like, okay, this is a book, but nobody really believes this. Yeah. So last week my guest is Peter Boghossian, who you're probably familiar with and he wrote a book called a manual for creating atheists and one of the things that I thought was most interesting about it was that he basically said, you know, because these beliefs are not based in critical thinking or rationality and that people have to take this leap of faith that actually if you can really sit someone down and you do it sort of with the right intent and, and a clear mind, you can start pulling the, the underpinnings away in an effective way and you can actually convert people into free thinkers. Uh, I'm gonna Guess that you've done quite a bit of that yourself.

Speaker 4:          22:33          The only reason I do what I do, Dave, is because of that. Anytime somebody tells me, it's like another way that you talk to people. It's not going to work, people aren't going to change their mind. That is absolutely not true. And I've got, um, you know, if, if you look at my inbox, my email inbox, like almost on a daily basis, you know, I get messages. I mean the most recent one was not, I don't know if you read that post at one fire arrows by a friend of mine see me Ramond and she wrote about the dead telling the difference between a moderate and radical. She lives in California. She's a pediatrician. Um, I'll, I'll, I'll send it to you. Yeah, please do. Yeah. And she, um, so it went viral, got thousands and thousands of shares and so on. And she got a message just a few days ago and there was this a woman who actually wore than the cop.

Speaker 4:          23:22          It was a very conservative family and she'd read it. And um, she has now she's seriously thinking about taking it off. Like he was completely shaken the way that she's thinking about things, the way that she grew up. And these are stories that I hear everyday and I hear them more than ever in Muslim majority countries. And, and this is what's so interesting is that in North America generally lead to the Muslims because they're, they're used to, uh, the free speech and the open discourse and everything. Uh, they are, they like to have a respectful approach. So like, okay, criticize religion to be respectful of us. They don't like the tone that somebody like, for example, like Richard Dawkins or Bill Maher takes. However, in the Muslim, in these Muslim majority countries where they're living under these sorts of a theocratic dictatorships, even though they're not officially a theocratic dictatorships, almost all of them are, um, for them, they, that really resonates for them with them to eat with a more aggressive tone because they're oppressed by it. They can't speak. So they're angry. They're frustrated. The last person that they heard who spoke went out and he got hacked to death and in Daca. And um, so you know, they, they are, they're angry and they're frustrated and they, they want that kind of talent. They, they feel like the respectful discourse is the luxury of the privileged people who are able to have values like freedom of speech, and then we can take that who take that for granted.

Speaker 2:          24:49          That's really fascinating because, you know, I've talked a lot about how people, you know, especially it's Dawkins and Mara are the two that have sort of become, you know, the most outspoken on atheism really. And, and talking about the doctrine of Islam, I think they're pretty both pretty clear

Speaker 4:          25:06          that's out there in the Muslim majority countries. So.

Speaker 2:          25:08          Yeah. But what I think, what I think is interesting here is that I hear from atheists will say, well, Dawkins, Mr they're there to offense, you know, it's too offensive there'd be, you know, they're putting out too much and they're not speaking in a friendly way. So atheist or angry at them for being atheist. But interestingly you're saying that in foreign places in foreign countries, they need to hear it in that light. And that's incredible.

Speaker 4:          25:34          Yeah. Because they actually want to say it that way. I mean, if you, the most, um, sort of aggressive sounding atheists that you'll meet from the Muslim world are the ones who actually grew up. They're the ones with the accents are the ones who made it here after living there who think that all Americans kind of take freedom of speech and polite discourse and so on for granted. So they, they are angry. They want a more angry sort of, uh, um, expression of it. But there, I mean, there is a point, I do understand why people, different things work on different people. I always give the example of the civil rights movement, how, you know, Rosa parks acted in silence, you know, she was sitting on the, on the bus and she said, I'm not going to move back. On the other hand, Martin Luther King was the diplomat know, so he was, um, he was sort of more political.

Speaker 4:          26:21          He was conciliatory, used to try to make a reasoned arguments and talk to the other side. On the other hand, you had malcolm x who was a more militant and all of those approaches had had a role that a very key role in and they work on different people. Um, my approach is probably more sort of, uh, I, I tried to be reasonable. I reasonable arguments. I try to do that at least. Um, but um, I do appreciate people who do the kind of thing that Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins soon because I know that it resonates. I know that it's a, um, it's a very satisfying to a lot of people growing up there. And I remember when I was growing up there, whenever I would hear people say things like that. And it was George Carlin at the time, you know, I, um, I remember seeing little things that George Carlin had done and the way that he talked about religion, it was just so in your face. And so like nakedly open some of it that it was extremely satisfying to watch. But that's something that you could not see and, and you'd, you'd show it to your friends is on a vhs tape and show to your friends and then you know, little clip where you said it and you see the shock on their faces and it was, it was something really satisfying about it.

Speaker 2:          27:35          Yeah. Well, I, I tell my friend, Kelly Carlin, who has been on the show, who is George's daughter. I tell Kelly literally once a week I'll call her or text her and say, God, God, ironically, I'll say, gosh, you know, I really wish that your dad was around now because we're so trapped and I think this will get us to the next portion of this conversation, but we're so trapped in this pc world right now and we're so afraid of language and we're so afraid of offending everybody. And already, as you've said, sometimes you have to offend people to actually break through. It's not your style clearly. Right? Like you're not looking to offend everybody,

Speaker 4:          28:11          but ended up doing it anyway. I think that the nature of the. But you know, the thing is, I'm like, I hear this a lot, I hear a lot of people say that, especially a lot of my Muslim friends in here living in the US and in Canada, is that the free freedom of speech does not mean the freedom of to offend. And I always say to them, I'm like, there's no such thing as freedom of speech without the freedom and offend every. There is absolutely no major revolutionary change that has ever happened in history that did not piss off a lot of people.

Speaker 2:          28:44          So let's talk a little bit about our friends on the left because, uh, I think they've, they failed us, but particularly you and your friends and family probably in, in this regard, they have somehow align themselves with forces that don't want you to speak up against doctrine. And I, and that's really incredible. It's the reverse of liberalism and I'll let you take it from there.

Speaker 4:          29:09          Well, I mean, that's what I think. I think if you're against bad ideas, bad ideas anywhere, if you oppose homophobia, homophobia is a terrible thing. It should be a bad thing. And, you know, you pointed out every time it's someone caused the Bible or every time it's in a donald trump's speech, um, you know, or to Ted Cruz speech or whatever it is, then that's team idea is also a bad idea when it's in the Koran and if it's being said by Muslims, including a lot of liberal Muslims, I mean, that is something that even a lot of liberal Muslims in North America haven't warmed up to yet. So these, um, I understand like there's the, I think there's a certain instinct to try and protect the minority, uh, but the ideology that the minority here subscribes to just coincidentally, and I'm not saying that they follow it the same way that they do in other more violent parts of the world, but that same ideology, the same book is being used to kill people, right?

Speaker 4:          30:06          And to throw gay people off rooftops in other parts of the world. So I think it's, it is very confusing for everybody because you know, the way that it happens is people see here, especially non Muslims, they see on tv, they see a group called the Islamic state quoting the Koran accurately and actually seeing quoting verses that say fight the disbelievers and charge them, you know, at the Non Muslim tax and you know, God will destroy them and so on. So they're quoting these verses, they're saying a lot whopper, right? So they're, they're obviously professing their faith and then they're chopping someone's heads off or throwing somebody off a rooftop. And the reaction over here often when they see that is that they immediately jumped in defending the faith that this is the real faith. And the moment they say that, you know, do bring the scripture to them.

Speaker 4:          30:59          You're like, well what about this verse? They quote just like you did with your friend, you know, what about this versus that? They quoted this to says exactly the words that they said here, match the action, and then they start defending the verses and the book a misinterpretation out of context. And so on. All the, you know that sort of the excuses that you're here and so now what you have is you have moderate Muslims here. I'm defending the same book that the fundamentalists over there are quoting and citing to kill non Muslims over there that the non Muslims are looking at this side of the world and that is toxic because it actually makes. That gives the impression the moderate Muslims over here are pretty much that they subscribed to the same ideology. They're just not acting on it, which is not true, but that's impression of gifts.

Speaker 2:          31:51          Not only is it not true, but it seems to me that people like you, people like my new eyes, Sarah Haider, great people in my estimation, who I think are fighting for the right things, who are applying the same principles across the board. They're not looking at your faith or your race or your nationality. They're saying, here are humanistic principles, right? That I want to apply to everyone. The left is the one attacking them. Did you ever expect that that was going to be the push back for you?

Speaker 4:          32:23          For me, I know I didn't honestly. Well, I mean, I knew that there were a lot of sort of moderate Muslims that wouldn't have problems with it. I just didn't think that, uh, uh, the, uh, the sort of these cj wellman's and the, you know, I guess whatever we call the regressive left. Um, Dave, I can't keep track of all of them. So this is just the one for most recent memory,

Speaker 2:          32:50          but the list on the side of your bed, I have a chalkboard and I've just always adding to the list. You don't have that.

Speaker 4:          32:54          I can't, I have, I have better things to do. I don't have enough time or crayons, students, lots of bumps.

Speaker 2:          33:01          I am spending a fortune in shock. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          33:05          No, but the thing with the regressive left on a serious note is there they're reacting to, you know, the pushback that we're getting is a reaction. And for them I, I just look at that entire thing is a very, very reactionary thing. Their only argument, the only argument they have to anything as big an Islamophobe House, Muslim or uh, you know, the Brown skinned white, I don't know what it was. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          33:30          So there's that, that's the only argument that they have. And I, I, I'm actually encouraged, I'm optimistic about it. I mean, if you looked at in the past, every time one of these attacks happened and there was some conversation to be taking place on tv about it on CNN or msnbc or Fox or anything, it would always be Reza Aslan who would come on or they'd call, you know, the comedian guy, uh, on CNN deemed so him. And so they would, you know, they'd, that that's what they would do. But now I'm not seeing that. So, you know, since, um, these new attacks and now that everything is getting even more serious, you know, I'm seeing more of Majid on TV. I'm seeing more of US trying to Monte on TV. Um, you know, I'm seeing voices like this. I'm seeing Ayaan Hirsi Ali being called on to talk about things. So I, I think that most of the, even the so called mainstream media is seeing through it. A Bill Maher actually said on the last show that he was on or the one with us when he interviewed her. He actually said that he's more and more liberals are coming up to an agreement with them. They used to get a lot of crap from him before, but he doesn't anymore. And I think that that's changing and I think that this whole, what we call the regressive left is simply responding to them.

Speaker 2:          34:54          Well, I got to tell you, I mean that sounds incredibly uplifting because, you know, I'm, I'm so in this and having these conversations and as I said at the top of the show, I find a lot of it exhausting and I battled sort of between back and forth of like, can I move on from this topic? And every time I move on I feel like I get sucked back in and you know, I'll, I'll put it away and then I'll suddenly see your, your twitter fight with someone or I'll see, you know, Greenwald attacking Sam or whatever it is. But I think you gave me a little something to go with there because the idea that they are acting out more. It's getting more like a, a child having a tantrum. And maybe it's just because they realize this is the last vestige of an ideology that's just not gonna work because

Speaker 4:          35:38          we've woke up, right? Yeah. I think that there are there prodding basically for a response and we give it to them, you know, in all honesty. A lot of times I'll ignore it for awhile. And I, and I, I, uh, you know, like with, um, I'll ignore it for very long time, but if I do decide to respond to decide response strong and it usually the response is not for the person making it. It's for the rest of the audience, for everybody else who's watching the conversation. I mean, I, I'm under no illusions that I can, I can change the minds of a lot of these sort of hacks on, uh, that, that a lot of the trolls that actually tried to dissuade us and trying to deflect everything. But, um, I think that for the wider audience who seen the conversations, it's good for them to see what they're, what they're dealing with, to see both sides of it.

Speaker 4:          36:26          And to see that play out, you know, on whether on social media or in books or in articles and so on. So I, I think that, you know, the, you know, I'll give you, I think that they're reacting to, for instance, with Sam Harris. Sam Harris has a lot of great ideas. He started a lot of really good conversations, in fact, everything that we're seeing right now with the rise of Donald Trump. And so the hijacking of this conversation by the sort of Xeno phobic paranoid side and now them gaining ground and capitalizing on the, on the fear and the concern and the confusion that everybody's feeling, um, something that the left should have done, but they didn't do right. And they should have done it from a sort of a moral, a honest, a position. And, and now it's being done by the right from a Suunto phobic bigoted position.

Speaker 4:          37:16          I'm at. This is something that Sam predicted a long time ago that he wrote about it. Um, and now, uh, I, I think, you know, what's happening is that, you know, this, all of these spots back and forth with the green walls and the world and you know, all of these other sort of characters and they're deflecting from what was initially that the actual thing that was causing this response in the first place. Can you go ahead, sorry. Oh No, I was just saying we should continue what exactly what we were doing before is what we should be doing. We should just be talking about the ideas. I'm sticking to the big picture. I mean, I came from when I, when I came here to Canada and to the US after living for 24 years and enlisted majority countries. I wanted to bring, I want to talk about big ideas, you know, I wasn't really concerned about microaggressions or progressive left or you know, all of these other issues. I actually wanted to talk about the big ideas and, and uh, I've noticed that the more, a lot of us over here are, you know, there are people who try to pull us into these more sort of petty Jerry Springer like conversations and I think it would serve us best. Just ignore it.

Speaker 2:          38:37          Yeah. Well listen, I'm doing my best to

Speaker 4:          38:39          do that and I know I'm saying that it's especially after what happened last week, so I'm with me as well once in a while or what,

Speaker 2:          38:49          once in a while I think you have to do it and you have to look had all this terrible stuff and all of the slandering and all this stuff not happened. Then I think the awakening, it'll, let's say you were awake probably before I was. I mean my real awakening to this literally was that that night watching real time with that athletic thing. So had it not happened, I may have been slumbering through, you know, the left going further and further to the left. So in a weird way, it is actually very empowering, but I, that's actually a perfect segue to talk about next, which you're touching upon, which is that by not dealing with this in an honest fashion, by not really allowing the people to speak about it, the liberals, to speak about it in a fair way. You're handing this to trump and we're seeing this, we're seeing this right now in America. We're seeing this in Europe where for the first time ever in places like Sweden and Denmark far right parties are running on anti immigration because it's all wrapped up in. Well, we're afraid to be called racist. So it's crazy, right?

Speaker 4:          39:53          Yeah. They're, they're all, everybody's Islamophobia, phobic fear of being called a song phobic. And um, yeah, I think, I think you're absolutely right. I did. We did in a way hand this to trump. The problem over here is that there's. Trump is not actually responsible for all of this anti Muslim hate and all this kind of time with some sentiment that's happening. So let's be clear on that, that the party that's responsible for that is the attackers, the isis, that people who would talk to Paris of people who are making all these videos of beheadings, of journalists and so on. I mean these are the people, a debt the Americans and Westerners in general are reacting to.

Speaker 2:          40:38          Right? But wait, let me stop you there because what would you say to my friends on the left who would say, well, it's America that created isis.

Speaker 4:          40:44          Well, America, there, it's obviously a complicated thing, you know, US foreign policy or there's US foreign policy. There's nationalism, there's greed, there's power, there's corporate corporatocracy and all these other characters that people talk about racism and misogyny. And you were telling me that like, why do you always pick on religion when you have all of these factors? And I, I always turned around and I tell them, I'm like, I agree with you. It didn't belong them right up there in the same category with racism and greed and misogyny and uh, you know, the terrible things that everybody else is doing. So I do think that US foreign policy is a factor and the argument has never been that a religion is the only caused a religious sentiments. He only caused the. We're not asking people to recognize or to think that it's not everything else that's religion.

Speaker 4:          41:29          We're just saying that the only thing that we're going against the idea that it's everything but religion to ignore the religious aspect of it or the fact that beliefs actually have consequences because we want to respect it. So, you know, what I was saying earlier is that what Donald trump is doing is that there is a lot of confusion. There's a lot of fear that a lot of people have right now, legitimately the way that you channel that, the way that leaders channel that is what makes all the difference. You know. So Donald trump has basically fed off of it. He's drummed it up more for his own opportunities, this opportunistic purposes and these turn into let's ban all Muslims. Um, if there was another reasonable voice, you know, on, on the left, and they had channeled that and they had kind of responsibly dealt with it in an honest way, then we may see a different outcome when, when people are confused, that's when leadership matters. And that's where the liberals I think failed.

Speaker 2:          42:33          So that, that's interesting. That naturally I, I agree with that premise, but I think you could really take it to the candidates themselves. So for example, Bernie Sanders, who I like a lot, obviously, and Hillary, uh, when you take the candidates that are on the left, that are the Democrats, when they won't say Islamic extremism or they won't say violent Jihad or whatever, whatever the term you want to, you know, everyone gets so caught up in terms that I hate even using words at this point, but when they won't even say the terms and they'll just say religious extremism or something, I think that, that they also then hand it to trump because trump's just given you. He's just given you the, the wide, wide net to go with and they're. And they're still playing the games of political correctness.

Speaker 4:          43:16          That's exactly that. I completely agree that, that is kind of what I was trying to say is that they do it. So there, there are two things that have to be done right now. One is that the rights of Muslims have to be protected, and number two, Islamic doctrine has to be challenged and criticized. Both of those things have to be done. What the, what the Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, uh, a site is doing is they're trying to protect all the rights of Muslims without actually challenging the ideology. And what the Donald Trump on the right of these people are doing is that they're challenging the ideology without protecting the rights of the people. And, and it's not an undead. People think that that's contradictory. It's not contradictory at all. This is what I think it was voltaire who said, right? Like, I, I will, I may despise what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it's the same principle.

Speaker 4:          44:05          Um, and it's not that difficult to do if we have a responsible leader who actually does that. I think that that is something that a lot of people would relate to and they would understand that, okay, we will challenge doctrine and a lot of Muslims they'll get her like, you know, you're challenging my religion and this is my identity because people incorporate their beliefs into their identity and the dialogue would be, well, yes, you're a person. We respect your right to believe what you. But you know, these are ideas. Ideas are different. We're talking about the ideas. We're not talking about you as a person.

Speaker 2:          44:38          Right? So that if the, if there was a political party that was running a, you know, that said we're gonna throw gays off roofs and we're going to stone women and kill apostates, you'd probably be against that political party. But as a religion, as a religious doctrine, it gets a little extra credit or something.

Speaker 4:          44:55          That's it. That's the thing. Like there's a lot of it completely. It would be completely strange things that we do, for example, of neonatal circumcision, like infant circumcision is one of those things where, you know, we, I mean, my parents did it, you know, my siblings have done it to their nephews and so on. It's a very dense, illegal. You're not everybody does it, but when you really think about it, if there was, if there was no religion behind it or as I like to save Abraham didn't, wasn't so fond of dickheads you would do this would be child abuse. You'd have pediatricians getting sued for this.

Speaker 2:          45:29          All right, so I, I, so I want to circle back a little bit to the beginning of the conversation and your history and your story for a second because you identify as an atheist Muslim. Is that correct?

Speaker 4:          45:39          Well, if he is Muslim, was the title of my book doctrinally. It can't be an atheist Muslim, but the whole point of the book is to talk about the incorporation of religion into identity. Uh, so there are a lot of. I mean what, so I'll explain it this way. When I first came here, two years after I permanently moved to permanently move to Canada is when the nine slash 11 attacks happened. And when that happened, I, you know, I had this whole conversation in my head, you know, was part of a Muslim family. I grew up with Muslim people. I, it, I was in all the Muslim traditions. They at that Ramadan, the, a lot of things are cultural. They're reasonably cultural, but there's some sort of Muslim things like Ramadan. So in doing so that was all a part of me, but at the same time I wasn't a huge fan of the ideology.

Speaker 4:          46:31          Um, so when I, when I came here, the 9:11 attacks happened. This whole conversation that had been going on in my head for a very long time suddenly exploded and it was all going on on TV. It was on the radio is everywhere. And there were two sides to it. There was sort of the, the, the liberal side. And they said that, you know, Muslims must be protected as a minority. So any criticism of Islam is bigotry. And on the right it was that. And this is the sort of the Fox News narrative was that Islam is a sort of an, it's a, it's a, it's a violent religion, so Muslims, you know, we need to profile everybody, you know, we need to clamp down on immigration, you know, all of those things. And there was one mistake both of them were doing is they were conflating the ideology with the people putting the ideology with the identity and this and this is where I wish actually a middle ground and I think what we're seeing, we're seeing the same thing with the regressive left on one side. And you know, the, the Donald trump phenomenon on the other is the same thing as the completion of this, uh, sort of ideology and people invite by people, I mean people who are a Muslim Muslim just because it's as a birth identity because most people are Muslim because it's just a birth. That identity.

Speaker 2:          47:49          Right. So for you personally, while you're obviously an atheist, so you're a nonbeliever, do you, are you culturally Muslim? Like what does that actually mean to you at this point? Like, I assume your family probably does some holiday stuff, maybe you don't believe in it, but do you culturally identify the way for me, for example, I am an atheist, I am not a believer, but there are Jewish traditions that my family that my grandparents did that their grandparents did, their grandparents did that my family does, so I can do that and I, and it doesn't have a religious connotation. It has a cultural connotation to me.

Speaker 4:          48:22          That's it. That's exactly what it is. I mean, I enjoy not enjoy the FISA. Ramadan Ramadan's a great time. You people fasting. I don't necessarily fast but I'm there for them. It's a bit much and I like to eat celebration so I like, you know, I have little nieces and nephews and they all dress up and you know, I get them gifts and so I enjoy that as much as anybody I'm on, I, I'm very close to my family, my nuclear family and my extended family and a lot of them are believing Muslims so I do take part in that. Um, but there was also another place where it affects you. For instance, I read a story about this kid who was called was beat up at school and because, uh, and they said that she was an isis baby or nicest kid and neither one of my niece and um, I don't want my niece to go through that and I did like this whole thing that's happening in the US right now, you know, I don't, I don't want my.

Speaker 4:          49:18          And I've got, I've got nieces and nephews in the U. S too. And you got. So I don't want them to go through that. It would be completely heartbreak. I'd be devastated if I heard that, uh, my own niece went through something like that just because she has a Muslim name, you know, a Muslim sounding name. She looks a certain way. So it affects you at that level too. So when things like that happen or you know, I, I recently, I recently posted about this. I have a friend who's a physician. Uh, he's, and he actually, he's in California and he went to a party recently and there was a woman who came up to him and said, you know, you, uh, she called him a Taliban terrorists and so on, and she was a little drunk and fortunately the people that he was around, uh, jumped in and, you know, they defended him and they called her out on it.

Speaker 4:          50:06          But, uh, these are things that are happening and he's also an atheist by the way. So he's from a Muslim background and you know, so when things like this happened, and this is something that could happen to me as well that happened in my own family. So on that level, I do identify with, uh, the sort of, you know, what a lot of Muslims are going through. On the other hand, I also got a prejudice. I mean, I guess apostates get it from not only the people who target Muslims, but the Muslims who target a oscillates. Uh, so it's a bit of a double whammy there, but yeah, so you do relate to it. And this, it's a very complicated thing when you have that mixture of ideology and identity is, it's a very complicated thing to navigate and it's not as binary as simple as you know, what you hear when you hear someone like Glenn Greenwald talk about, or someone like Donald trump talk about her do I think are sort of very similar. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          51:04          Yeah. Well that's why I phrased the question the way I did because I don't see an inherent contradiction there. I think that everything that you've described sounds completely feasible to me in it. And if anything, it's not just feasible. It sounds preferable to me because you're taking the logical and the uh, and the secular side of your, of your existence and fully acknowledging that and then also acknowledging your, your history and your family and all that. So that, to me, that to me makes full sense and more people should be trying to do that.

Speaker 4:          51:34          Yeah, I think there is a Phillips Zuckerman. Is this, he's a writer who wrote a book called, I think it's called living the secular life. Um, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what it's called and that he actually talks about secularizing religion. He also did an interview with Sam Harris. Sam Harris interviewed him for his blog and he talks about that as a very sort of seminal step in moving towards secularism is that, you know, you take, you take the holidays and take the rituals you take that, the community aspect of it, how they have Sunday assemblies and everything. Um, so those are examples of things that people can do and how, you know, religious actually move towards secularism when you talked about reform Judaism, which was, which is interesting because, you know, Judaism and Islam, again, very similar, you know, how God revealed the Chron directly to Muhammad in the same way God supposedly revealed the Torah to um, uh, to Moses at the Tabernacle and Mount Sinai and so on.

Speaker 4:          52:35          And it was considered the literal word of God. It was actually considered the blueprint for creation in genesis at one point. So it was meant to even predate creation. And that's how it was thought of at a time. And then in the late, late 18th, I think it was the, it was the 19th century, early 19th century when the reform Judaism movement really took hold in it, it got demoted from literal word of God to divinely inspired, suddenly something that was written by the hands of human beings. And, um, revelation became a progressive thing, you know, so it was a quality. They adopted a lot of secular values and so on and, and it changed. So when people say, well, the Koran is infallible, you know, how are you going to change it? And I always think thinking good, the Koran, there's precedent for that. There's actually precedent for that. Would Judaism, uh, with the Catholicism for instance, I mean, there's a lot of Catholics who approach choice. A lot of them practice birth control. Many of them, they fornicated to their heart's content, but you know, you still go and they observe lent and they celebrate Christmas and Easter. Nobody kicks them out of the church saying, you know, you're not a catholic.

Speaker 2:          53:45          Yeah. Well, for the record, I told this to Peter last week, but I actually went to Mount Sinai in 1997. I went to Egypt, I went to Sinai, I hiked the mountain and literally nothing happened. I asked. I mean, I really did. I was at that place in life, uh, you know, 20 or 21 or so, or 19 and I, I went there trying to have some thing and talk to somebody and, and nobody, nobody talked back.

Speaker 4:          54:08          Bad experience the first time. You don't want to repeat it again.

Speaker 2:          54:11          You don't. Alright. So I want to end with this because you have brought up a phrase that I think you hashtagged and I want to make sure that when this thing takes off that you're fully credited for it and hopefully I'll have a little something to do with it. But you've talked about the new center and I think it's the right phrase for what we've been looking for. I think it fits, it fits because we have this left right paradigm, but it also fits the center of this liberal split between, you know, the regressives and the say classic liberals. So can you just tell me a little bit more about what you think the new center is and what we can all do to, to get people there?

Speaker 4:          54:48          Well, it's basically what I described here when it comes to purely this aspect of Islam, Islam and jihadism and sort of religious extremism of, even though that's a misnomer, um, it's, it's about separating ideology from identity. It's about being able to stand up for the rights of people, but at the same time challenge ideas when you attack and challenge ideas. That's how society has moved forward. A few attack and Dbas people. That's what splits people out. That's what actually rips us apart. So being able to do, to make that distinction is very important. I don't think either side is doing it here. I think that the center is more rational and on a, on a, on a broader level too. I've always found it bizarre that, you know, if you're fiscally conservative and then you know, you suddenly you have to be prolife why does all of that go together? I think it's absolutely ridiculous. People should be able to have different, uh, you know, I should be able to think that, okay, I believe in these fiscally conservative principles, time I'm socially liberal or I could have libertarian presented, but there's no rational. I don't think you can be a rational thinking person and be aligned with one side or the other.

Speaker 2:          56:02          Well, that's a whole other topic. Figuring out how the politicians figured out to make everything a wedge issue. So somehow gay rights if you were for gay rights, you are also for, you know, low taxes, like it just doesn't make any sense. Um, do you think there's any chance for a political movement with that? Because when you, I saw it, you did Hashtag new center and I thought maybe there's politics. They're not just not just this sort of internal, a discussion that will all have and hopefully get it out there more. But actually this could maybe be a political movement.

Speaker 4:          56:33          I would like that. And that's why I brought up the whole fiscally conservative socially liberal thing is because, um, when, when I grew up on tv, you had the 6:00 news and the 11:00 news and you know, you saw everybody watched that, whether you're liberal or Conservative, I mean 1984 and Ronald Reagan won. I mean, he won California. He won 49 states out of 50. I'm not endorsing Ronald Reagan or seeing anything against him either, but I, what I'm saying is that things weren't as polarized. You're going to later on, you had 24 hour cable news, so you had Fox News on one side and Msnbc on the other and everybody just watched what their own echo chamber was. I mean, it'll be every channel had its own echo chamber with the blogosphere and with the Internet that became even more pronounced. So there's a lot of polarization and I think it's getting to a point and we're seeing this with the regressive less than I left on the trompe and right. Um, uh, you know, I think that there is that kind of polarization is something that a lot of reasonable rational, uh, people are not feeling. It's not working for them, they're actually frustrated by it and I really hope that they do. They're okay to let go of the traditional left and right labels because I practically meaningless right now. I don't think they mean anything.

Speaker 2:          57:51          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          57:52          just be human beings thinking human beings.

Speaker 2:          57:56          I love that. Perfect ending and I love the fact that we've connected and you'll always have an ally over here. So next time, hopefully we can do this in person when you make it out to Los Angeles. So I want to thank Ali Rizvi. His book comes out next year, but in the meantime, you can follow his regressive smack downs on twitter. Thank you guys for watching and we'll see you next time.
