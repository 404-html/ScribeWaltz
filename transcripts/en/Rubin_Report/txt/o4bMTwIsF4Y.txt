Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Joining me today as a biologist, a former professor at evergreen state who is now a professor in exile, Bret Weinstein. Welcome back to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me back on. Professor in exile a friend. That's what it says on your twitter bio, which means it's your most defining characteristic right now. That has become the tenor of my life. All right, so I went into the Rubin report archives. They're very much like the Jedi archives. I went into the Rubin Report Archives this morning that you were on this show originally on May 30th, 2017. So that's about a year and a half ago. It was just as the Evergreen Brouhaha was beginning you, you still were employed at the time, uh, which probably seems like a lifetime ago. Um, so I think first maybe we should just play a little catch up from that and I just to be clear, you had been on the show one since then. You were on with your brother Eric, and we did a little bit about evergreen in your life, but I saw, I thought first let's do to catch up on what happened, where you're at, where you're going, and then we're going to do sort of new territory and we're going to cover a lot of biology and all that. Great.

Speaker 2:          00:01:15       So May 30th of 2017 would be exactly one week into the riots. The protests that my classroom that became relatively famous happened on May 23rd, so one weekend and I was sitting in this chair

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       and that feels like a lifetime ago doesn't. I mean it feels like it for me and I think less has happened to me, although it's been a pretty busy year and a half.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       The transformation of my life and heather's life in that period has been so dramatic that it's hard to even relate. I've never had so much happen in a year.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       Yeah. So. Okay. So for people that don't know anything about the story, and I suspect there's very few watching this at the moment, can you give me like the 92nd recap of what happened? So can that be done in 90 seconds? Let's see.

Speaker 2:          00:02:02       It can be done with with carnage. I must say I feared this question more than any other because there's so much detail in the story. It can't be covered properly. All right, give, give a cliff notes version that basically, and an explainer, equity and inclusion movement got started on my campus as it is on virtually every campus and the new president of Evergreen threw fuel on the fire. He used the division over that issue to accomplish things he could not have accomplished otherwise. I tried to block his moves to dismantle the excellent part of Evergreen's teaching model, which heather and I were using the full effect. And I became effectively enemy number one of this equity and inclusion movement. They arranged a protest at my classroom, very dramatic. 50 students showed up demanding my resignation. Not a single one of them was a student I had ever encountered.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Um, but in any case, they made a terrible error. They filmed their confrontation with me, they uploaded it, I now know to facebook somebody else in the public, uh, picked those videos up and broadcast them and the world watched me try to reason with them and, uh, that set things in motion where evergreen started using me as an excuse for its problems. It blamed me for what happened there for the dropoff in enrollment for all sorts of things. And uh, I started engaging with the public about what was taking place at Evergreen about issues of freedom of expression and free inquiry on college campuses and increasingly a evolutionary biology, which, you know, people did not initially really understand that. That was the focus that I had, not a freedom of speech issues. Now increasingly that's what people want to talk to me about, although we're going to get to plenty of that because I know that's what you're, your real focus and passion is.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       And it's sort of funny that now you've been thrust into this. Um, but in effect you were protesting putting racist policies on campus. Is that fair to say? Yes. And this is one of the, I think, hardest lessons for people to learn. People good people get the idea that you can spot the right side by certain heuristics and you know there's been a historical fact of oppressed people tending to be people of color, et Cetera, and so people have gotten lazy about recognizing who's in the right. If you follow a principal to its logical conclusions. In other words, if you're against segregation, for example, as I am, then when the segregationists are telling white people to leave campus or asking them to leave campus, then you are committed to standing against segregation. And when you do stand against segregation, the world goes crazy because people who are being lazy about recognizing which side is defending the principle that they, they subscribe to a, they fall out in the wrong place.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       And so anyway, yes it is your principles and adherence to them that gets you in trouble. Yeah. Okay. So you then show up in this studio a week after this whole thing goes down. It was your first public interview about any of this. What did you think at the time was going to happen by talking about this publicly or, or what was your hope at least by talking about this publicly? Well, you know, initially my hope was to expose the foolishness at evergreen and save the college from its own worst instincts because your audience may not care terribly deeply about this, but for a small number of people, for 4,000 students at a time, Evergreen was actually a wonderful experiment in which it was possible for people who hadn't had tremendous, uh, educational advantages before they got to college to have an experience that couldn't be reproduced anywhere else. Evergreens model was so unique that if you ended up in the right classrooms with professors who really cared, it was, it was like no other place and, and you were given incredible

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       a freedom as a professor to do what you want it with these kids. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:06:33       I believe that the position that heather and I had was the freest academic position in the country and maybe on earth. Well, I mean really more freedom than a tenured professor at Harvard has. And that was, let's be honest, it was both a blessing and a curse if you decided to use that freedom for good, if you decided to figure out how to innovate structures that didn't exist anywhere else, you could do it and nobody could tell you not to. On the other hand, if you decided to take the rest of your career off and you know, teach with one hand while you, you know, dealt with your hobbies, you could also get away with murder. And so that happened as well. And you know, there was attention every, every good professor at evergreen grumbles about the fact that there are a large number of people who, uh, are holding positions there that they don't really value.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       And you know, the, the phrase that we, that we typically used in private on the faculty was that Evergreen paid in freedom, which meant that it didn't pay well. It wasn't a good paying job, but the ability to have a blank canvas and decide how you were, what you wanted to teach and in what way, and to innovate new mechanisms and take students off campus for a week or two or 10, that freedom was a very valuable commodity that evergreen, undervalued the whole time it should have, it should have leveled with people that it was hiring and it should have said, look, this job is not going to make you wealthy, but it can make you very happy if you have the temperament that really wants to figure out what's possible.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       So as this was unfolding and now you went public and you also did Rogan and you were on Tucker Carlson, where you said, I'm deeply progressive because suddenly you were sort of getting crap from your side, so to speak, and you were getting embraced by perhaps a different side. And I do want to get a little more into that now because it shows what a sort of crazy realignment politically we've had these days. Um, were you shocked how deep it went? So you went public, you were, you were giving the facts, you were exposing sort of the corruption and how it went all the way up to the administration and all that. I think from that first interview we did, I think you thought that there would be a course correction in here, or at least there was a chance for a course correction and at least the way I read the last year, at no point was there even a slow down or any reflection from the administration and the rest of it, they just went in on this.

Speaker 2:          00:09:01       I am completely shocked by the fact that the world's recognition of just how awful things were at evergreen did not force an acknowledgement that something was wrong. So I would not have been surprised if evergreen had backed off cynically if they had privately said, actually we were on the right track. We were misportrayed and. But we nonetheless have to acknowledge what the world is saying to us. The fact that that did not happen at all still shocks me and I can't explain it because you have a president who is widely understood to be a. is there a polite word for bond?

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       He's bonkers. He is one of my favorite words like bananas too, but bonkers, you know, wackadoodle too young. But in any case, we have a president who was,

Speaker 2:          00:09:54       I mean, look, he's the mad king, right? He's the mad king and you've got a whole bunch of people standing around. I'm accepting his authority when in fact he's an outsider, is understanding of the college, uh, or his plans for the college are completely inconsistent with the values that the college was founded on. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       And were they really accepting his authority actually, because there are moments in the chaos of this that these videos are posted where he can't even leave to go to the bathroom. And he was also a hostage in this, in his own, maybe his own, like perverted a dream or something. You know what I mean? He was, um, both puppet and puppeteer. Okay. Um, and so the thing is yes, he is held hostage in those things, but I believe he's a willing hostage in the sense that he's trying to accomplish something and you know, look, it tells the whole tail. Once you say what we are doing is about equity, there is a whole swath of people that cannot figure out how they would object no matter what it is that you say next, no matter what your plan is. If you've said that it is for the purpose of racial equity, then a whole section of the population will just fall in lockstep. What is that? What is that psychologically do you think? Oh, I know because I think we're seeing this everywhere now. This is not just something that's happening at universities anymore. This is happening all over society. I wish I could

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       say that it is an error in cognition that people are seeing it incorrectly. What I know for sure now as well as anybody on earth is that the part of people's minds that drives them in the direction of silence, of self editing, of all of these things is actually accurately perceiving a threat that it cannot manage. Now I'm not looking for sympathy. I do not have my job anymore and I miss it. It was a great. However, I've landed on my feet. I'm. I wouldn't trade my position for any other. I like where I am. However, first of all, there's not an infinite number of those positions in the world, so most people who are looking at some sort of an equity and inclusion juggernaut who are thinking, should I stand up actually have to ask themselves what happens if I do? Do I have an economic plan B for my family, right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:22       Anybody who doesn't have an economic plan, B for their family and I have to say as much as I would like evergreen to be a place in which all the faculty had enough skills that they could go do something else. If they have to, they don't write. They can't easily move to another college because the way they teach at Evergreen doesn't, uh, create a CV that will get you hired elsewhere easily. Um, and so I think lots of people are looking ahead and saying, if I stand up and I say the right thing now, what, what will, what will become of me and the problem, the place where I, you know, I have sympathy for anybody who sees that and so I don't have a plan B, I don't know what to do, where I lose sympathy with them is when they then having made that calculation rationalize what they are saying and they join, not reluctantly, but they become enthusiastic

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       allies of this movement in order to, uh, basically they sell the rest of us out. Right? And in a weird way, they almost have to do that psychologically to live with themselves. Right? I mean, otherwise you realize that then you are a sellout in the, you know, it, it, it's harsh, but it's true. But what I'm so fat, why? The reason I'm so fascinated with this is because as you know, I've been on tour with Peterson for the last couple months and I think this is the number one question that we get asked. People want to speak up and they are afraid of losing their jobs and, and I think that's why your story resonated with so many people because people were looking at you and going, well, it's pretty freaking obvious. This guy is not a racist. He's not a hater. He's a self identified left knee and a progressive and all of these things. And somehow he stood up to the monster and I think the fact that you're still here and you're, you're, you're not employed at the moment. And now I do want to discuss that a little bit too. But the fact that you're still here, you're alive. You're still willing to talk about these things. I think that's the type of courage that people are looking for at the moment. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       you know, I do. So I have to say for a year now, uh, I have had these interactions, you know, a couple times a day somebody will come up to me on the street and unless I'm in Olympia, it's always nice. People have people,

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       even sons, beard, they're still coming up to. Actually that has reduced it. I think we're not quite sure there. Is that who I think it is or is that Eric or is it presented? I don't know. But you go buzz cut and then your scottfree then. Oh Man, I'd be, yeah, I could go on the Lam. They've never find me. Um, but

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       the thing is the, it raises questions. The stuff that people say to me about what they see on the outside, you know, I get to compare that to what the experience was on the inside. And so I've done a lot of thinking about what it is, is, you know, is there some reason that, that I stood up when others didn't. And I think, you know, it comes down to something simple, which, you know, I'll just, I'll just put it out there. I think people are rationalizing their acceptance of this nonsense movement in order to sleep and for some reason that particular switch works the opposite way for me. If I heard myself rationalizing that I would not be able to sleep. So in order to sleep I had to stand up and, you know, I'm lucky I have really good friends. I have a wonderful brother who was friends with you and that put us in contact and uh, I have something else to talk about. You know, evolutionary biology is fascinating to people. They don't know how to think about it and they're, you know, just as my students where they're very interested to hear what I have to say on the subject. So that means somehow, even though I couldn't see it exactly on May 23rd of 2017, there was a path forward for me, which, you know, it could come crashing down tomorrow, but so far it looks good. And I, I, I regret nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       Is there an evolutionary explanation to that type of person that either can sleep or cannot sleep? Because you know, people come up to all of us all the time now and they say, I wish I could speak up. I don't want to lose my job. My wife's pissed at me. I mean all of these things. And they're literally, sometimes I'm talking to people one on one and they're whispering. I mean, this, this, this layer of fear is seriously real and it is sitting on top of people. So is there an evolutionary explanation why at the moment it seemed like a very small amount of people are doing it. Absolutely. And for me, just quickly, I would just say for me it's like, I don't know if it's about sleeping, I just, I just feel like I'm doing what's right. That's it. It's actually not more,

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       it's not more a confusing or needs more of an explanation

Speaker 2:          00:17:14       that that's just what I'm doing. Um, yeah. There are two things to say on this front. One. So I know we're going to talk more about evolutionary theory later on, but yeah, there is a way in which evolutionary theory stalled 30 years ago and I don't believe that the explanation that you're looking for is on the table in the way that you know. Any evolutionists that you asked would say, Oh yeah, the explanation is over here, but I do believe we can see what it is. There are a lot of adaptations that do not map well onto the individual. If you look at the individual and you say, well, why would the person behave this way? It seems paradoxical sometimes if you look at something larger than the individual and it's not the group. This is the thing. We've been caught in this argument about group selection since the sixties and are actually even earlier, but that's where it began to come to a head.

Speaker 2:          00:18:12       If you look at the lineage that is to say a population of people who are related now talking about ancestral ancestral population, there are many characteristics that have value for the lineage moving forward, that are hard to understand from the point of view of the individual and many of the things that we have a really hard time explaining, including things like homosexuality and religion. Um, many of these things are adaptations that exist at that slightly higher level. And so what I would say is an individual who can't sleep if they're not doing the right thing or if they hear themselves rationalizing that individual is not well suited to certain jobs, um, but they're very well suited to other jobs. And the idea that a population has an emergent nature and that, you know, a division of labor between, you know, I'm not telling you that not rationalizing is the way we should all be.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       It may well be that we need certain people who are very good at carefully rationalizing certain things in order to get jobs done. I mean, I would imagine if you are in the military, if you are in a position of command in the military, that there are certain things that you have to rationalize in order to win the war. Now, I'm not saying I don't like war. I'm not saying that every word should be one. You know you shouldn't enter into a war that isn't justified, but once you've entered into it, the goal is justified. Maybe you have to rationalize certain things. You know, you move troops over here in order to protect something over there. Well, what are you doing to these people? You may be sending them to their deaths so you know, even talking about it makes makes me uncomfortable because it's not something I would be good at, but the point is when you look at the population and the fact is the populations that we have a live on earth today are all winners, right?

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       These are the winners. Irrespective of how you got here, irrespective of how oppressed your population looks in relation to other. Somehow you made it to the president. You're a winner. Those winning populations had many characteristics within them and they knew how to call upon these people and you know, sideline those people and then switch it up at the point you arrive somewhere else where different skills are necessary. So I'm in essence, yeah, I think there's a very simple evolutionary explanation and some of us have certain skills, other people have other skills. And the real trick is can you figure out the switching mechanism that decides what to call on? At what moment?

Speaker 1:          00:20:58       That seems to be the key part of this, right? I mean that's it. It's like some people are going to do it. Some people, some people know they should do it and won't do it. Some people probably shouldn't do it and do, do it and everything in between. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:21:11       you know, you probably have this experience too, but when I, when people come up to me and they talked to me, there's just a couple of different styles of conversation that unfold. Um, you know, and there's lots of people who want to apologize for what happened to me, which I always find odd, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       unless they were there in the room, right? Unless it was them, but I'm guessing those people that have never contacted me, but, you know, some people want to apologize, some people,

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       you know, I want to thank me and some people, there's this one thread which is I'm facing something like this too. Can you give me some advice? And, you know, I always say the same sort of thing to them and it throws them, you know, I always say, look, it's not safe. You have to think very carefully about what you're doing and don't kid yourself about what you're signing up for and you know, you can, you just watch in their eyes as they, um, grapple with the fact that they didn't get what they wanted from me, what they want it to be told. They wanted somebody to egg them on and say, do it. It's the right thing. It'll work out. And you tell them, oh, it may not work out. And, you know, there's a moment of heartbreak, but my hope is that the people who should do it have to go through that little heartbreak in order to get to the other side. And so among my various, uh, jobs at the moment is to show people the abyss. Just say, look, is this the abyss you want to jump? If it is, nobody can tell you that, but you, I certainly can't. It would be irresponsible of me to tell people to do something like what I did. Because you could get, you could get maimed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       Yeah. And in a way it's sort of the shows that I'm most proud of. Here are the ones where I was able to facilitate a little bit of that. So it's sitting down with you. It's sitting down with Lindsay Shepherd who went through something very similar in sitting down with James Damore, these people who did not ask to be heroes who even if I say the word hero, I can see you're uncomfortable. You know what I mean? Like the people that didn't want this. But somehow it got thrust upon them and then and then they got there and then hopefully I was able to amplify that a little bit, which then spreads that out to all sorts of other people, which is pretty cool. So let's, let's, I know I don't want to do this for obviously the entire interview. So let's just catch up on a couple of things. We'll do a bit more. So there's one, one

Speaker 2:          00:23:37       thing that is, and I believe there's a little caveat to it. If you do it and you'd do it for the right reasons, in other words could do it cynically. You could stand up against one of these things in order to see if you couldn't get famous or something. People will see through that, right? Especially the people who've gone ahead down this road because they know something about it. But if you do it for the right reasons, if you're really trying to advance the ball to challenge a bad narrative, the people who have gone through this recognize it and you know, it won't feed you, but it is very reassuring to discover other people who see a, the corrupt narrative who understand what happens when you challenge it. Um, so anyway, if, if you're hungry to meet other people like that, uh, standing up, you know, you got to figure out what you're going to do to feed yourself. But it does put you in contact with lots of people who, uh, are very worthwhile.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       Yeah. It's so interesting because again, after being with Peterson, it's like people will say to him, you know, I want to get a new job. Should I just quit my job tomorrow? And it's like you have to seriously think about what your options are. You may hate your job. It doesn't mean you can leave tomorrow, right? You got to think about all of this seriously. And I think that that is the key here. So I'm curious how much of this has shifted what you think politically because you do talk about politics now and I know when I had you in there for the first time, I think I said to you, we'll revisit this question because I thought here's a guy that's, that I come from a very similar political places, him as a progressive and all of these things and now I see, you know, as you know, I consider myself a classical liberal and I, and I love libertarian ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       Obviously we just did stand up together last night and Bray California, you and your brother joined me on stage for the, for the second half. And it was mostly a conservative crowd. There were some trump people, there were some lefties and some liberals, but you know, mostly conservatives and they, they love you guys and yet you both still identify as lefties and the whole thing. And I wonder now a year and a half later, are you shocked at that? That you are now really liked by people that perhaps you thought were your ideology decal opponents and now you're sort of on the outs with the people that you used to be allies with. Okay. That's a good question. I get one every episode. I am

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       heartened and flabbergasted by what I encounter on the center. Right. You know, this is not the Republican party that I remember from my youth. This is a very different entity and I think it has a lot of refugees who've been driven out of other places and they've grouped there because I don't because because something over there is making sense to them.

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       Well, as you said to me the first time we met Dave, you have ptsd from political, from the compressions. Yeah. And I must say we should, we should return to this, but I, uh, was very

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       heartened to hear you bring that up during your episode with a, with Ben Shapiro and Eric and Jordan. You, uh, you went through a cool exercise which I think deserves a place. I'm with steel manning. And your exercise I think was something like where is someplace that you suspect your own thinking might be incorrect and you brought up political ptsd as a place to pay attention to, but let's just say I am shocked that, uh, the center right seems to be, you know, it has protective custody of liberty and free speech and science of all things. I mean, how the heck did the center right ended up end up having custody of these things which are traditionally things that the right is uneasy about and the left, uh, has, has defended. But nonetheless, the people who value them are where they are. I think they do have something wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       You have your initial question was, has this changed my political view? And I think one of the everybody said it would. And I, you know, I, I believe I am being honest with myself when I say really hasn't changed my view of what is true politically much if at all. I think because what I believe is true isn't predicated on anything social. Right? In other words, these are the conclusions that I reached through game theory and evolutionary thinking. And observation of the political landscape, they're not things, you know, it wasn't that I went to a dinner party and had a good time and fell in with their political ideas. So it's not, you know, the fact that I am not, I'm welcomed in certain quadrants of the left. It doesn't change anything about what's true at all. Right. It can't.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       So I, I understand that. But at the same time, I mean, you can go to. I've done public events with you that are usually. We're usually invited by libertarian organizations. We've done some Iran things together and, and a couple other things. And I think everything that we've done publicly and when you joined me for standing up, the crowds all basically seem to be on the right as you're saying this sort of new, this new center, right? That maybe needs a better phrase than that because center rights or it needs something sexier than that per se. Um, but I mean, have you been invited anywhere by progressives to, to tell your story or to get some comradery or empathy or sympathy or Kudos or anything other than Gfe? Occasionally,

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       and only slightly, I mean, the, the asymmetry is amazing and I must say one of the most interesting things to me about the early phase of this public part of my life is that initially there was just this overwhelming, uh, a message that came back at me. You are a conservative or to conservatism or something like that. And welcome to the dark side I think is what they usually do. Say that. And then at the point that a, the phrase idw showed up on the landscape. Then there was this point about, oh, the idw is a right wing movement or something like that. And so there's a trajectory there. There's something we track immediate effects pretty well as people we can observe them and detect them. There's often a slower pattern that is harder for us to see. And so just by analogy, I find this is true with healing, physical healing.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       If you do damage to your knee, for example, there's a one month healing trajectory, but there's also a one year and a five year trajectory and they're much harder to spot. Um, so anyway, the, the interesting thing is the challenge of you're on the right or now surely you will be moving to the right, you know, that was just an overwhelming message that came back. Um, but the ability to talk back to that message and say, actually no, still on the left, actually part of a left you don't even remember exists. And one of my fears is that all of the stuff that the left was correct about is not getting properly credited now. So to the extent, I don't know if people have seen this hidden tribes, a report that came out maybe a month ago now that says that there's this vast Osass, 80 percent in the middle do agree on, you know, the desirability of a fair society that doesn't burden one population in order to enrich one another. And uh, you know, that we basically share

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       that basically it's only eight percent actually that buy into this hyper political correctness and the, and the rest of it is a tiny fringe. The authoritarian

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       left and it's a tiny fringe on the, you know, the white nationalist, right? And the rest of us in the middle, you know, we're not in perfect agreement, we don't agree on the order of the priorities, but we do agree basically on what a good society would function like and that a lot of the gains, I mean, you know, the ability to be gay and out and function in society without that being a tremendous obstacle that that's something that, you know, the left deserves credit for a racial equality, you know, equity is a different beast by virtue of the new, uh, I hesitate to even call it that definition because it's not a definition in the standard sense, but equality, these are traditional left values and we were right about. And so the fact that these things are now no longer controversial that belongs in the discussion to the left has been right about some stuff. It's also been wrong about some stuff. And the right has been right about some stuff and it's been wrong about some stuff. And it is time for that conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:32:28       Absolutely. And that's why I don't denigrate what it was. I am upset with what it is. And perhaps guys like you and your brother and Sam, some people that still identify as left, these will be able to do a reclamation project that I just don't see anymore. I see sort of more that this thing needs to burn. So out of the ashes of Phoenix can rise. That's just maybe a little bit of a tactical thing, but let's just jump back to an evolutionary explanation for some of this. So I asked you about why some people can do this from an evolution, evolutionary perspective, why some people are able to step up and some people aren't. What about, what's the evolutionary explanation for why this, let's say eight percent, very loud, but small group of people feel the need to purge everyone. Is there. Is there an evolutionary because that seems it would be almost counter to evolution. You'd want to have more commonalities with people and bring in a big tent. But what I see them consistently doing is just getting rid of everybody who dare you. Talk back to the, to the God. Well, you know, I, I wish I had known this was going to come up because I would have looked it up, but there was a, uh, there was, uh, put me on the spot.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       Say I'm a report that emerged, maybe it was six or eight months ago that I don't know. I haven't looked into it and it's not my area of specialty, but, uh, it sounded right to me. And what it said was that there is a particular, um, there's a particular personality trait, authoritarianism that isn't ideological. It doesn't really care whether it's a, you know, defending fascism or communism, what it wants to do, his boss, people around. And that essentially what's confusing to people is that at the moment these dyed in the wool authoritarians are concentrated over on the left and they're saying stuff that sounds nominally like leftist stuff, but that, you know, we're the winds to shift. And the authoritarians have the moment to be over on the right. They be there. And so, uh, that, that makes sense to me. And what I would like people yourself included to consider is that there is almost no point in engaging those people, right? This question of the importance of liberty is settled, right? The 80 percent of us in the middle all get

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       the fringe on the far left and the far right are, I don't want to say safe to ignore because they can always rise up and become important as the one on the left is doing. Um, however, that's not where the game is. The game is all of the people who can't figure out how to escape from the stigma and all that is driving civilization. So all of the people who are falling in line with what's going on on the authoritarian left, those are the people to reach. And what you raised about, you know, let's say the audience last night at the comedy club and you know, this is reliable. This was the second one I with you. It was exactly the same the first time. The thing that is so heartening is, you know, I can come into a room and you're right, that room last night must have been 95 percent right of center and first thing you tell them is, here's a, uh, a progressive.

Speaker 2:          00:36:00       I'm, I tell them I'm a radical, right? Yeah. It doesn't dampen their enthusiasm one bit. In fact, it, they're thrilled to discover that things are not so bleak and that there is somebody on the other side of this thing who's still talking reasonably and can hear them and can see them and doesn't think that they're racist and out of control. And so anyway, you know, I know I take a lot of flack for interacting with the right and I'm not listening to that flag because it is the best thing we can do is to engage and uh, you know, when you spot the humanity of the people on the other side, then to the extent that we differ over something, we can talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       All right, well we could keep going down this Pandora's box of, of lunacy related to everything that you've been through. But let's do, let's just catch it up to where we are now and we can start looking at the future a little bit. So you and your wife had there who you referenced. Heather. Hi. Who's been on the show? Uh, who's a brilliant professor as well. And, and, and has that, that brave evolutionary tick that you have to have you end up marrying a woman that was going to have the same evolutionary tickets. You, that's pretty good.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       You really want to know the answer. Yeah, I'm heather and I, we were not going out but we were friends in high school and I don't know that others will understand the phrase, but the one that runs in my head is somebody goes to high school with the girl you should marry and it might be you. Right? So anyway, in my case, you know, I don't know how because you know, I was, I was a confused kid. Like every other kid that age, there was something about her that seemed so very right. And I have to say I was right about that best decision I ever made.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       Was she ever pissed at you during this because you sort of thrust her in the spotlight to, and the fact is both of you left your jobs, you got a $500,000 settlement for two tenured positions, which to some people that's $500,000. I was like, it sounds like a lot of money, but, but this is your life's work. You and your wife, you've since relocated your family and your two kids. Um, so this is, this is massive. 500 grand in the scheme of that is not a lot, but was she ever never

Speaker 2:          00:38:12       bothered or, or hesitant by what you doing? Because she didn't go public about this until a bit after. Um, she was never pissed. Not for a minute. She and I were in complete agreement. We saw the same thing unfolded evergreen. The, uh, the nature of our teaching at Evergreen was kind of interesting in the sense we had like a little undeclared graduate program and evolutionary biology where we couldn't award you a master's degree, but if you were interested in evolutionary biology and many people didn't know they were, but they would take my program and uh, then I would sort of nudge them over towards Harrisburg. I'm. So we had students bouncing back and forth and we had a community of people that were in our circle. So the basic point is that creates a, a, an opportunity for every night at dinner, either an, I would compare notes, what we were seeing at the college and all of these things talk about, you know, students, you know, what the students blind spot is, what they do particularly well.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       And as this unfolded, heather and I saw the identical, a picture or maybe the way to say it is the picture of what was happening emerged between us as we discussed it. And she was, let's put it this way. What put me in the bullseye was the emails that I wrote. And the thing is, I said in faculty meetings, I never wrote an email that heather didn't look at first and tell me it's ready and frankly there were a lot of emails that I didn't send and if I made one error, I believe I should have sent everyone right, because what they do is they leave a, a historical record of what is taking place. So the descent was in retrospect, very clear as you went back through the emails. Um, but anyway, yeah, heather, heather was in complete agreement the whole time and I think, uh, the confrontation was less in keeping with her personality traits than mine, but in terms of her commitment and her belief in what we were doing, it was a team effort.

Speaker 1:          00:40:26       There's a lesson in marriage right there. And there's probably many lessons in marriage. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So let's just get to where you are now. You guys have left Washington. Neither one of you are teaching at the moment. You're trying to figure out what your future is. I assume the same with heather. What is that like, number one and number two? I think a lot of people would be surprised to know that schools have not thrown offers at you. I mean, you, you have a seriously great public profile now you are respected by so many people. You have, you have fans and not just students. Now you have former students, but you have fans that would love to sign up for courses that you would be teaching and all sorts of things where I think most people would look at this on their face and think, wow, what an asset this would. This guy would be not only intellectually but pr wise and all that.

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       That's not where we're at. It's absolutely not. And it, uh, it does say something and I'm, I'm an outsider to whatever discussions it is that result in nothing of that sort coming our way, but it is conspicuous. Um, so you asked what it's, what it's like, um, you know, I'm having a, a, a very unusual experience in life. And you know, my, my life was great before any of this happened. It's great now. Um, the lack of security is frightening when I stare at it, you know, heather and I have two kids and if we didn't, we would be in a different position. We could take risks and we could afford to go through, you know, years of austerity. But as it is, we have responsibilities and you know, our kids didn't sign up for this.

Speaker 1:          00:42:07       Um, so I mean they would have said, are you saying they didn't get that gene? What are you telling me? Oh no, they're bored, but it's our responsibility to protect them. And so, you know, the whole thing has been a

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       frightening from the point of view of what it means for the future because literally, I don't know, it seems like things are headed along a path in which, you know, the settlement that you mentioned is a tiny fraction of what we would have earned over the rest of our careers. And a huge amount of it was burned up paying lawyers and uh, taxes, you know, you get all that money in one chunk. So we got about two years of buffer money from that, but it wasn't, it wasn't like we got bought out. We, uh, we could have in a state that had punitive damages, we likely could have won a, something much more like 4 million bucks for the amount of income that we would have earned over the rest of our careers.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       How and why did you guys not go that route? Because I think a lot of people, when they saw the number, I remember when I saw the number, I think I just saw an article or something and I was like,

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, why so low? Because Washington is one of 11 states without punitive damages. It's that sense.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       Oh, I thought you said that Washington didn't have punitive damages. Oh, I just misheard you. Okay. So that, that, uh, that caused us

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       to, uh, effectively cut our losses and decide that it, there was nothing to be done. We did the best we could with evergreen in cutting our ties with them at the point that they made it clear. I mean, they, they behaved atrociously in negotiations for one thing. They dragged their heels, they wouldn't sit down with us until we were already back on contract for the next year, fully assuming that we would be going back into a classroom, but what would it be like to walk onto a campus that is, you know, paying a pr firm to demonize you. Right. What would that be like? And we would have done it, but they, uh, they insulted us in negotiations. They offered us panic buttons. Right. As if. So panic buttons in the room literally. Yeah. Like,

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       as if the problem was that we were panicking, you know, rather than that they had, you know, they could've at least they offered you a counter baseball bat. Wouldn't that have been nice? Right. Something, um, but they didn't to end, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       hobbling the police. The whole thing was a fiasco. So we cut our losses. We've, we've moved, he moved to Portland, which is wonderful. I know that's

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       in some ways, not interpretation, but it is a marvelous place. You went to the only more progressive place. Uh, it does seem that we have here a glutton for punishment onto that

Speaker 2:          00:44:50       belly of the beast. But I, you know, the, the beauty of Portland, you know, there's a beauty and there's a tragedy there is this a equity and inclusion thing and it seems to go up to the mayor's office who happens to also frighteningly and a parallel to evergreen be the police commissioner so he can stand down the police and, and has done so in some sort of

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       from that video from a couple of weeks ago with antifa basically running traffic in the middle of Portland. I mean, it's, it's unfathomable that that's happening in the streets of the United States city. Right, right. It is. They are flirting with the same. I mean, it is the same story as evergreen except,

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       um, this is a major American city, you know, to have a college, a play games with literal anarchy is dangerous enough to have a city doing it. Uh, I shutter to them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       Thank you. Didn't want to think about Texas. I really on this tour. I got to tell you to San Antonio, I think you'd have a field day over there. Well, but here's the thing,

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       other part of liberalism is also true. Important. So I never encounter a, the antifa madness and the mayor and his confusion, you know, it's like the mayor of your town, you never, never run into it. What I do run into is a clean, a functional city. People as far as I can tell, are very decent to each other. Um, you know, to make provisions for cyclists to commute around the place. So I think in some sense Portland is, it shows exactly the conflict between the left better instincts in its worst instincts. And uh, I hope that it will come around to the kind of enlightened progressivism that used to exist rather than the naive progressivism that seems to have taken over. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       let's shift all together. Let's do it. Let's talk about the step. You really know. How about that. Okay. Biology, evolutionary biology. I thought this would be an interesting place to start. You just recently did a talk with Richard Dawkins just in the last couple of weeks. Uh, as I understand the video of it should be up online somewhat soon. It will be up within a couple of weeks. Okay. So hopefully people will be able to actually watch this conversation. I'm very quickly, this event was put together by Pangbourne philosophy. There's been a little tumbled around that and I know you just wanted to quickly address what's going on there. So pangbourne philosophy is obviously imploded and that has

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       left people speculating about what happened and why some of us like myself continued to participate with Pangbourne just very quickly for people that have no idea. They were putting together a lot of the public events that included a, well the one that you moderated with Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris in Vancouver. Also the one that Douglas Murray moderated, which I think was that in the UK or was that Australia is one in Dublin and one in London. Um, and then a series of other events like the one that you did with Dawkins and this this day of reflection that was supposed to happen on November 17th that we all pulled out of which now I think you can take it from there. Sure. So, um, let me just say that I know that there is a lot of speculation about what took place. Why people pulled out of the New York event, why some of us like myself stayed in and I was in at the point that it was canceled a couple of days ago and I do hope people will recognize that there was a predicament for those of us like, uh, like myself and like Eric who were looking at the, uh, the Pangbourne situation and trying to figure out what to do, which was at the point that Pangbourne canceled the Auckland event, something new emerged.

Speaker 2:          00:48:44       So other events had been canceled, but there had always been refunds for people who had bought tickets at the point he canceled the Oakland event. There was a lack of refund money, which called our attention to the fact that something was off money that should have been kept separately for that event. So that if it was canceled, it could've all been refunded somehow wasn't with. We didn't know. And, and to be clear, you guys, and I think not just, you guys hadn't been paid for some previous things too. So it wasn't just about the people that were buying the tickets. Just, Oh, it wasn't Auckland, it was Sydney, Sydney is where speakers, as far as I know, that's where speakers didn't get paid for the first time and I'm certainly one of the people who didn't get paid and still haven't been. Anyway. Yeah. And also as a sidebar, that's.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       So that is why I pulled out of the day of reflection thing in New York. I was supposed to host the whole day, but then when I realized that people hadn't been paid for previous things and I had heard through the grapevine that there was some shady stuff going on and I just said, you know what, let me just not get involved in this mess in that. Which makes perfect sense. Yeah. So I think what I did also makes perfect sense, uh, which is, I looked at the situation and I said, well, you've got people who haven't been refunded their money for Auckland. You've got speakers from Sydney who haven't been paid and if the New York event comes apart, then it's going to compound that. It's going to create new, a ticket holders who haven't been paid. Um, and so my thought was let's have an event that gives people what they paid for so that we don't make the damage worse and I certainly didn't sign up for anything new after the Oakland event was canceled and there was a failure to repay patrons.

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       But my thought was from the point of view of protecting the fan base from whatever was going on behind the scenes at Pangbourne, the better part of valor was to make the event happen and be successful rather than create another auckland situation. So in any case that, you know, and I should also point out that up until so Pangbourne gave us a, a little bit of warning just a couple of days before he canceled it. He said he was about to cancel it. And Eric and I tried to save it. In fact, Eric, who had pulled out of the event quietly so as not to cripple it, uh, and he and I got on the phone with Travis and we tried to get travis to agree to hold the event and to let us rescue that. We offered to work for free and we would have liked to have held the event so that it wouldn't cause further harm to people and I don't know why Travis refused, but he did. So anyway, it got canceled and I, uh, I just, I do want people to understand that it was not that anybody was unaware that something was going on. The question was what's best for the fan base, the movement to the extent that there is a movement, is it better to have another event canceled and have more harm? I didn't think so.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       Yeah. And I know this is all a little insider baseball for people, so I know you just want it to get that out. So I'm glad that it is a few of us. Also, we had discussed possibly doing a free thing and who knows, maybe there will be something in the future if people end up getting stiffed on ticket prices because obviously we want people to get something and if we can all figure it out, we will. Okay. So that being said, you did do an event with Richard Dawkins as we said, the video should be up soon enough. Chicago, what should we expect from this? And, uh, I think on its face, I think a lot of people would say, wait a minute. Well, we've got Weinstein and Dawkins,

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       these guys should agree on everything she didn't they. Well, this goes back to the question of what happened to evolutionary biology 30 years ago and um, darkens and I do agree on a tremendous amount, but the place at which we start disagreeing I think is a branching point where you have the way evolutionary theory went 30 years ago and the way it should have gone, and you know, that's not an indictment in and of itself. Fields take wrong turns all the time. But what should happen is you should detect that you're on the wrong path because suddenly progress ceases. And that didn't happen. So, so what actually happened 30 years ago that got us? Ironically, I would argue that the last piece of progress that we all really agree now, there's been lots of empirical work, but the last piece of theoretical progress actually involves a Dawkins' selfish gene, which is essentially encapsulates a synthesis that does lots of things, including brings a proper theory of cultural evolution online.

Speaker 2:          00:53:41       Which cultural evolution is a non issue for almost all creatures. But for birds and mammals, it's a big deal. And for human beings it is the big deal. So to the extent that we did not have a way of discussing cultural evolution prior to the selfish gene doctrines, introduction of the concept of memes which have now been trivialized by, you know, people putting funny captions on pictures, but the concept of, I think you could argue they've become the most relevant way of communication in a bizarre way this. But they'd be. They've become, you know, little tidbits become little bites and the fact is almost everything about human beings that is interesting and special, at least touches cultural evolution if not is entirely housed there. So in order to understand ourselves, we have to get this cultural revolution things straight and document set us, I believe, on the right path.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       Chapter Eleven, he introduces the word meme, he introduces the concept, he sets us in motion, but he makes an error in that chapter. No big deal. We all make errors, but it hasn't been corrected in 30 years. And so so. So what does that error? The error is in a, a misportrayed will of the relationship between culture and its evolutionary units and genes and the way that they evolve. So what Dawkins says and that chapter is that means the units of cultural evolution exists in a new primeval soup, right? He says, this is a new kind of evolution. It begins at the point that culture begins to happen and it is independent of the genes that cannot be the case cannot be the case because the only reason that you are able to pick up units of cultural evolution is because you have a brain that your genes created which is hospitable to those things.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       Which means that to the extent that your a culture starts wasting the time. And the energy and the resources of your genes, the genes are in a perfect position to shut it down. Right? So my point to Dawkins on stage in Chicago was, that can't be right, and if you make an adjustment to the theory that you darkens presented in 1976, if you adjust it correctly, you discover that, um, many things that are paradoxical about cultural evolution are no longer paradoxical and many things about human beings are suddenly tractable. So can you give me an example of that? I can give you the ultimate example. I will accept that. And so the ultimate example has to do with a religion and things that function like it. So if you think about, um, you know, this is the antithesis of some little picture with a caption on it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:56:34       You Imagine Catholicism, for example, Catholicism is a set of beliefs that has profound implications on the way that believers deploy their efforts, their resources to things that they elevate, the things that they, uh, issue all of that. So the question is why? Right? So dawkins and I would agree there is no supernatural explanation necessary to, uh, interpret what is taking place on earth or anywhere else in the universe. You don't need a supernatural explanation if you were trying to explain phenomena. So why is it that people who hold a belief that supernatural forces are at the heart of a human affairs? Why are those people so successful? Historically? That's the question. And Dawkins, and I disagree with it, I would disagree over it, uh, because a, he has this view of what cultural evolution is that it's independent of genes. I say it is actually much more flexible than jeans, but it is subordinate to the will of the genes.

Speaker 2:          00:57:44       Um, and he also does not subscribe. Actually, he came around a bit on this on stage I thought, um, but he also does not subscribe to a, uh, a lineage level interpretation of selection. He is a traditional Ken selectionist who believes effectively that the individual, that the gene and the individual are the places that we must interpret a evolution. And if you do that, then lots of things are paradoxical, hard to explain. Maybe intractable, if you accept that lineages evolve, um, that adaptation can apply to the lineage, then you can begin to understand phenomena like a religious traditions as adaptive properties of a population. And uh, there is tremendous progress to be made. So what happened on stage with Dawkins was at dinner prior to the event, we more or less agreed that I would lead the discussion because I had a sense of where we disagreed and he would react to it and I put together a list of points on which I was certain that we agreed points on, which I was pretty sure we disagreed and points on which I wasn't sure which way to call it, which we didn't get to.

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       But anyway, I started out by pointing out the vast agreement between the two of us and asked them about each one and more or less I had been right about where we agreed. And then I started to go through the list of places that we disagree. And I thought it was a fascinating conversation. It was definitely a closer to the conversation I hoped we would have won. I feared we might have, um, there was a lot of progress. Could you, could you sense which way, not that this matters in the grand scheme of things, but at, at some level it does, which way the audience was going, not that it, not that it is about who gets more cheers or anything, but what I do find fascinating about these things and although I didn't attend any of the live events with Sam and Jordan, um, you know, I've watched some of them and just sort of noting a little bit of crowd applause and jeers and pauses and things I think gives you some extra taste that may be for you guys on stage.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       You can't quite quantify. Well, I mean, first of all, I'm a believer in that and it was one of the most important tools that I used to use in the classroom. You know, figuring out what people heard, how it landed, what they don't yet have. So anyway, I'm very cognizant of what people are hearing and I was listening carefully to the audience and um, you know, the thing was set in motion, you know, as another new atheist event. And so in some sense I was, I was battling uphill because my basic point was new atheism is, is a Culdesac, it's, it's a problem in and of itself. It's a problem because at the end, at the end of it, there isn't enough. Is that like the most simplistic way that I could present it? No. I mean, let me just put it in stark terms. Atheism is defensible, but new atheism is wrong and new atheism is wrong because it portrays religious belief as a defect of mine rather than an adaptation and non literal adaptation.

Speaker 2:          01:01:12       And so in a room full of people who, you know, Dawkins is a very famous person, most people presumably showed up to hear a Dawkins. Almost all of those people have at least deep sympathies with the ideas of new atheism. And so somebody setting out to say actually new atheism is an incorrect instantiation of atheism because it is effectively ideological and it accuses people who have religious faith of being mentally defective. And in fact Dawkins and I tangled over this, you know, I said, look, you're, you've called religion a mind virus. That's an incorrect interpretation. And at first he said, well, I don't really mean anything deep by virus. He said it's, you know, you could argue that every gene in the genome is like a virus, right? And I said, well, but what people hear when you say that is that, that they're mentally ill for believing this.

Speaker 2:          01:02:09       And he said, well, they are mentally ill, right? And so, you know, you could see the division in his own thinking, right? Because they're at that point, he's then saying both things at the same time saying both things. And I, you, I understand his position about you could interpret each gene as independent, you know, I could defend that position too, but in order for there to be an honorable atheism, we have to own up to what all that religious belief was about. And then, I mean, and this is the place that I get into an easier pickle, a pickle with Peterson as well, is the question of if we acknowledge that religious belief is adaptive, then all of the things that are true of adaptive phenomena kick in and the most important one is that adaptive phenomena are not timeless. They are adaptive relative to a historical time and place.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       And it may be a very long standing time and place. But the point is there is nothing. It is purely magical thinking to imagine that religious traditions that are thousands of years old are the core of the toolkit for moving forward. Our, our existence in 2018 is so novel that if there's one thing we can be sure of, it's that are adaptive nature is a poor match for it. So then can anything be truly timeless? Is that the right question? Well, yeah, but the way you do it is this, the longer standing, some truth of some kind is the closer it gets to being timeless. In other words, if we look at things that are, um, very evolutionarily longstanding, well those things have persisted through environments that were very different from each other. So what that means is that thread still functions irrespective to an extent of the context.

Speaker 2:          01:04:07       The longer it lasts, the more likely it is to speak to truths that continue to be relevant, but the, the bitter pill for modern people with respect to understanding the degree to which evolution is the key to seeing ourselves properly is that we live in circumstances that are more novel than almost any creature has ever faced. Now, you know, a creature can fished and flop into a boat and it's suddenly a novel circumstances and it's dead within minutes. Right? Don't tell that to the dinosaurs in the media was going well there. Yeah, there you go. That was so novel that you know, I mean dinosaurs didn't survive that one group. The birds are still with us and they're doing great, but we are creatures living in circumstances that are not only novel at an unprecedented level, but are changing so rapidly that even to the extent that we can figure out what to do, the world changes out from under us. We have to stop that right? That is going to kill us. That if you want to know what the greatest existential threat to humanity is, it is the rate of change that we have set in motion which makes it impossible for us to adapt fast enough to it. It has to be slowed down to a point that we can catch up.

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       Is that impossible though, because we already have that power because I'm with you on this. Just from my limited knowledge of this, just from what I do, you know from doing these shows and that people can watch more. You know the amount of information that you can intake on a given day. The amount of things that you can share. You can speed things up and listened to them two times as fast. You can clip everything and that we can take all of this information. Things can be live streamed, all of this, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. It's happening faster. We're learning more. We know there's a great

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       thirst for this. Um, but can it be slowed down? I mean, what, what force could slow down progress really wisdom. Um, and that, that's the, that's the problem is that. Thank you. We are children in this landscape and children grow up, right? I mean, the key to raising children properly is to, is to back off the things that protect them enough that they actually get burned without being burned so severely that they're crippled. In other words, you have to experience the places that your notions are naive in order to become less night. We are now in a situation in which we are behaving in a childlike fashion in, you know, in a very, in a foundry or something like that. Right? We're like children running around in the foundry. There's molten metal that we need to figure out how to recognize it, how not to.

Speaker 1:          01:06:57       We were just pressing every button. Buttons are cool.

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       Our. Yeah, we got to stop doing that. I don't think, you know, if I'm to be candid about it, I don't think we are in an unrecoverable situation. I can see the path forward and it's all still plausible as far as I know, but I'm worried that we won't get there and the reason we won't get there is that there are lots of things that have been true that just aren't true anymore. In other words, the people who are in love with, you know, a limitless market in which you can do anything that you can manage and it's all cool. And then at the point we find out that it isn't cool. We might have to take some action, but in the meantime, you know, you're, you're free to explore. I'm very sympathetic to this view, as you know. Well, I would be sympathetic to this view if I didn't recognize that there was a problem in which, for example, if you look at the way our economic system is hooked up to our political system, there is a problem where anytime you set a new force in motion in the market, if that force pays at a high rate in the short term, but it costs at a high rate in the longterm, by the time you get around to discovering the costs in the long term, it has found its way into the political system so that it cannot be reversed.

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       And you can't have a system in which you can't reverse them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       So this, the simplest way to frame this would be some sort of crony capitalism kind of thing, right? Well, you know, we're not, we're not truly free market because we've politicized competition basically. Well, you know, I tried to look at everything, um,

Speaker 2:          01:08:33       through an evolutionary lens. And to me, politics and economics are just one more landscape. And they're interesting because it's humans and humans are especially capable in this regard. But the, um, the natural tendency for a creature that has found its way into a niche is to protect its access to that niche. And the way creatures do that is they freeze other creatures out. So there is this natural pattern. I mean, I can't not see it now that I now that I understood that it exists. There's this natural pattern where the upstarts who succeed, the stories that we know we don't know about the upstarts that failed mostly, but you have startups that succeed end up tremendously powerful. And then they go through this process in which they become hostile to upstart newness and they become hostile to upstart and us for the most natural of reasons which is that their wellbeing depends on shutting down the process through which they became successful.

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       So this could be like facebook buying all their competitors and things of that nature.

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       It's the, let's put it this way, there are obvious versions and then there are innumerable versions that are cryptic and we were never going to understand the whole landscape of ways in which those who have reached this level of power that you and I will only dream about, that they will then shut down the access to others. It's like there's a, I don't even want to call it a conspiracy because it doesn't have to have any consciousness to it at all, but there is a tendency for, um, for those who have succeeded to shut down the, the mechanism through which they see. I mean, you can see this with a people frequently remarking on the fact that immigrants are often not that wildly enthusiastic about further immigration. Why is that? For obvious reasons, you know, you're talking about do people who've just entered at the bottom of the economic ladder want more competition? Well, they're actually, and there's a tension between what people should want, but you shouldn't imagine that there's some immigrant ness that necessarily has you favorable to anybody else who has that label.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       Does this also sort of explain a little bit of what's happening in the tech world right now in terms of it seems that these companies, twitter, facebook, youtube, are potentially at least using algorithms against their own audience, a shadow banning people. I mean that they are basically now turning against their own people because of their, whatever they perceive to be their own, uh, protection or longterm health. Even though I would argue in most cases, that's not really what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:11:16       Oh, without question. This is what's going on and let's put it this way. If you're at the top, if you're in that strata, you have a lot to lose through anything you can't predict. And so there is a way in which we expect the upstart who got there through some sort of radical transformation to be favorable to route a radical transformation. But the way we should understand it is that once you've gotten there, radical transformation becomes threatening and you start to conservatizing evolutionary force and you know, we can look at what twitter is playing with these days with the potentially eliminating like some follower counts. You know, at a breathtaking act of paternalism, you know, at best and are doing it for us, for us, right? Because we shouldn't be so concerned about who's paying attention. But really the truth is, as much as we all recognize that there's a problem with, you know, tweeting to get trivial likes, on the other hand, understanding what your audience hears, what they find favorable, what doesn't ring true to them is the way you learn, it's the way you steer. And so effectively twitter is playing with blinding us so that we can say whatever we want into the void, but we have no idea how it, there's no ping back to you basically. And so, you know, I mean, I don't need to tell you, you're a comic, you're standing in front of the room and you get

Speaker 1:          01:12:50       a lot better when they laugh. It's better, it's better when they laugh. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um, what should we be thinking? You know what? Before I get to that. So as you know, I was just in a, in Europe and I did a bunch of the Scandinavian and Nordic countries and Sweden was a particularly interesting case because I know that our fifth most viewed country for this show is Sweden, which is sort of fascinating considering how tiny Sweden is. Uh, so I, I sort of circled that we did two shows in Sweden. I kind of circled them on the calendar because I was like, something's going on in Sweden. I want to figure out what it is now. I thought if you would have asked me before I did the show that first night, I thought it was gonna have a lot to do with immigration.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       What I realized, although there were a lot of questions about immigration at the end, uh, it had much more to do with gender and what is happening to their highly egalitarian society that have done most of the things related to gender and true equality correctly for many, many years. And all of our friends on the left always point to Sweden and Norway and Finland. These countries that I was just at as the examples of their perfect societies and they're really struggling with certain things that you know, that the government is forcing them to have genderless kindergartens and that the, the emasculation of men and the removal of the father and that they have supposedly Europe's first feminist government and all of these. So I thought as long as I have you here and since gender seems to be such an endlessly a provocative and also misunderstood topic,

Speaker 2:          01:14:23       um, what should we do on gender right now?

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       Yeah. Um, well beyond you go to Sweden and figuring out what's going on here because something. Well, what it struck me as is that they've done everything right in effect in terms of egalitarianism and they've done it for, for decades now. They've done it right. And when they got to the end, which is now, and they got to the current day, they realized that despite all of this equality, men and women are still different. That women still care more about people and men still care more about things. So even though they've been given the exact same opportunity, women are still becoming nurses and men are still becoming engineers and it's like the social justice warriors or whatever you want to call that crew, they still don't like the results of true equality. So I think that's why Sweden's in such a weird place, the average person's like, what? We've done it right when we did it right. Everyone's equal, you can do whatever we want, but then the result isn't being allowed to be accepted. Does that, does that make some sense? Oh, it makes perfect sense. I think

Speaker 2:          01:15:24       the, uh, the naive left finds the failure of its hypothesis absolutely galling. And so they're effectively trying to erase that failure by hard coding the solution into government.

Speaker 1:          01:15:41       So I think that's exactly what's happening happening

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       in Sweden right now. And it's tragic and with respect to sex and gender, it is so needless, right? The fact is the truth of sex and gender is, there are parts of it we don't fully understand yet, but in general, actually we do. We pretty much understand how we got here. And the truth is it is asymmetrical. It is a complimentary, the truth of male and female is a complimentary truth. It may be largely irrelevant in the present. In other words, technology has eliminated most of the basis on which the division of labor between men and women initially evolved, so I think we have actually an opportunity here to become, to behave in an enlightened fashion that the the easiest place to solve this problem is sex and gender. What we should do is pretty clear and it is not hard to ground and evolutionary theory because unlike other places like a race for example, we do know what to think with respect to sex and gender and the.

Speaker 2:          01:16:52       The basic outline is this. Men and women are different for historical reasons. The basis for that difference and the utility of that difference has largely been neutralized by the modern world. We don't need to retain those distinctions, but some of those distinctions are built in at a deeper level than others. So meaning you could potentially be a stay at home dad and that could be perfectly fine, but that probably for evolutionary reasons is not going to be the thing that usually happens, right? But here's my point. We can democratize access to almost everything with respect to sex and gender. There are very few places where we actually need to have, um, some asymmetry in access, but probably, you know, the firefighter who comes into the burning building through the roof to pull you out when you're panicking and you don't know what to do because you've never been in a fire before.

Speaker 2:          01:17:55       Um, on average, that should probably be a guy. They're just better built for it. If there's a woman who is well enough able to do it, should you be picky about the firefighter who plucks you out of the burning building? Absolutely not. I mean, I personally am thrilled to see it every time it runs against the narrative that we expect. Right? You know, I, uh, I'm very fond of Stacey Brown, the, the police chief at Evergreen who was driven out along with heather and me. I thought it was great that she was female and that she was a, an excellent cop. So I'm, I'm up for the narrative being broken by, by, uh, by reality as often as possible, but you democratize the access, but you don't force people to do what they otherwise would for one thing, you wouldn't even want to force it because for every job that you would, you know, force women into it some higher rate, let's say engineering jobs because it sounds like a good thing to do.

Speaker 2:          01:18:53       There's some awful job that men are disproportionately represented in that you would also have to force them into to be fair. So you democratize the access. You recognize that the division of Labor that we have, that we have inherited is largely outdated. Um, but you don't a override people's, uh, show me, you know, if, if women, if you democratize access to engineering perfectly and women go into it at equal rates, great. If they don't, that's cool too. Um, so in any case, it's, it's a question of allowing liberty to decide where people go after you've done away with not barrier. Well, it's so interesting because I think then you hit it right on the head that, well, Sweden's now politicizing it. They're making a point of making this political because they will not accept the science of what they've done correctly. And I think that that is what is, what is lead this sort of average person there to go this, this is just not right.

Speaker 2:          01:19:55       So it's, I don't know what the way out is and I sense that most of the people there didn't know at the way I was. Well, I mean the way out really is to recognize that the, the ire of the authoritarian left on this point is actually indicative of the whole problem. In other words, because sex and gender is more or less clear, the desire to erase it, irrespective of the collateral damage is an indicator of just how wrong this path is. So, you know, I find this all the time where people have, if you're not focused on biology and you're focused on the world that you find in your galled by, uh, by inequality, then you think, well, let's just solve the inequality. Which is hard code the solution, but then you hard code the solution and it says men and women of the same to the extent that there's any difference in what they choose to do, that's the result of a either cryptic barriers or internalized misogyny or whatever, and then the problem is you're now interfering with my biology class.

Speaker 2:          01:21:06       You're now telling me that we that the received wisdom is that men and women are the same thing. When I know damn well that can't be right, so you don't want to build a solution that forces you to confront your biologists, physicists, your statisticians, right? You want all of these stories to the extent that they're true, have to reconcile all true stories, records to the extent that you've got a naive notion over here and you want to just write it in because it seems very important to you and you're willing to tolerate all of the cascading effects elsewhere. You don't belong in a position of power.

Speaker 1:          01:21:41       Unfortunately though, a lot of those people are in a position to power and I think we're seeing more of them get into positions of power and I think it's also now having a counter effect in Europe, which is why we're seeing the rise of more far right parties because people are just like, screw this, this is so wrong. I'm going to take my chances over here. People who inherently are not say far right or certainly not racist, are now playing with people that perhaps they wouldn't have played with before because they're so sick of this. And I. and I'm worried where that leads us.

Speaker 2:          01:22:09       Oh, I think, I think this is exact, and I've, I've heard you say this, is that you were afraid that the, the lunacy over on the authoritarian left is actually going to collapse. It's going to leave people who otherwise wouldn't play ball with the far right.

Speaker 1:          01:22:23       Yeah. Over there. Um, and not because they're racist. That's the key to this. It's not that they'll suddenly become wake up and be racist or hate women or hate gays, but it will be such a disgust of, of reality. And, and a, and a rejection of what's provable, that they'll be like, at least there's something over here. I mean, it's, it's an awful bargain, but I think it is. I think, I just think it is. I see this,

Speaker 2:          01:22:47       uh, frequently where people, you know, because they detect that there's something wrong with communism and socialism are often driven, right pretty far into the let's not regulate anything camp and the answer is actually have to regulate stuff just out of a desire to continue as a species. So, you know, I don't want to see people driven because there's something wrong over here. I don't want people to be driven into, into a reactionary position that is not justified. The thing on sex and gender though is maybe this is the key question. Every reasonable person who just simply observes the world knows that men and women are not the same thing. They know that, uh, those differences have an implication for the way we view all sorts of things like mating and dating, what careers we want to have, how we view risk. And all of these things for historical reasons.

Speaker 2:          01:23:46       All reasonable people can infer that from their own observations of the world. You are now confronted with people who insist that you not acknowledge what you can see. Those people are crazy, right? They're dangerously out of control. They're dangerously out of control on other topics where it's harder to know what's true, but you wouldn't want people who were so naive as to argue that men and women are effectively identical, but for depression, in charge of any policy, you don't want them in charge of economic policy, in charge of, uh, you know, a prisons, anything. Um, so having seen just how far their confusion goes, can we all agree to shut them out of the discussion about how power is to be wielded and the rest of us can have a discussion about what our values are, what we think we know, what we don't yet know, and what its implications are. That that's the place we should go.

Speaker 1:          01:24:45       That seems like an effective ending here. Unless you want to throw in one more. Did we not hit something that's been rattling around in your brain? Actually, he's a know I covered a lot of territory here. Yeah. All right, well it's always a pleasure sitting down India and you joined me last night for standup in Bray California. This'll be up already, but you're joining me tonight in Oxnard. I'm turning you into a standup comic, which is a biologist. Worst nightmare. I don't know. It's a, it's not quite the, uh, the thing where you're, the lead singer of your favorite band has laryngitis state, but it's about as close as I could hope to go. Yeah. All right. Well we're going to do this. I will do. Well, we did it about a year ago after the original one, but we'll do this more than once a year because you're, you're right in the center of all the things that I think are, are right at the moment and for more on Brett, follow him on twitter as long as they can track how many followers he has at Bret Weinstein.
