Speaker 1:          00:05          Joining me today is the Democratic nominee for Senate from the Great State of Utah. Jenny Wilson. Welcome to the Rubin report. Well, thank you. It's great to be here. I am glad to have you here. I was reading your bio and it said that you were a fifth generation, Utah u t a h n. There you go. I didn't know it was spelled that way. I wasn't sure it was even pronounced that way, but I did it right.

Speaker 2:          00:30          You did write down. Don't throw the Aan. What would that even though you're not a Utah? Well that's why I thought

Speaker 1:          00:38          Utah or something. But you are a fifth generation use. I said to you right before we started, I've actually never been to Utah, so I only know the things of Utah that sort of get out there

Speaker 2:          00:51          like John Stockton, Karl Malone, the jazz, the aren't doing well right now, but that's a moment of this. Yeah, but you know, for all the world's best skiing, incredible snow, beautiful mountains. I leave my front door and in eight minutes I'm in remote wilderness on a run or hike or with my dog. It's really great. Great State.

Speaker 1:          01:15          So tell me, we're going to talk a little bit about Utah generally, but tell me just a little bit about your family and upbringing. FIFTH-GENERATION UTAH.

Speaker 2:          01:22          Yeah. Well, I, my ancestors go back to the first person to even make it into the valley ahead of Brigham Young. He was a scout for Brigham young snakes at Orson Pratt and he was head of the pioneer trail and I looked into the valley and said, this is the place even before officially Brigham Young said this is the place. So he had actually started planting and irrigating before Brigham young and the rest of them came in.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Yeah. And tell me just a little bit about your upbringing and family and that's it.

Speaker 2:          01:52          Yeah. So I, uh, kind of fell into politics, not by choice. My Dad was the mayor of Salt Lake City in the seventies and eighties and I was a kid of the mayor that would go with them around town and to visit the banker and you know, the local religious leader, whomever. And I guess I have the five kids. I ended up being the one that stuck with this affliction affliction,

Speaker 1:          02:15          so like for a kid, I mean I know it's just as you as a kid, it's just your life, but as a child of a,

Speaker 2:          02:21          well my dad was a people person still is and I think that helped a bed. It's a busy life to have a parent who's running and on the ballot and I think my kids are now living that with me and there's a little bit of, I think stress with that because it's not a typical life, but it's a good one. I feel really lucky to have had that experience and got to know the community. My Mom's a small business owner and artists and gallery owner, so I was able to kind of go to her business too as a kid growing up and was really a great life.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Yeah. And we were, we were talking right before, you've had a bunch of jobs, also politics that have sort of led you to this. Can you give me, give me a couple of those that you've, you've bounced around, you've done some stuff.

Speaker 2:          03:05          Yeah. So, uh, you know, back to the day that my dad was running was always thrown into the campaign and then in 1988 he ran for governor and that was my first real job and they actually paid me. I was the press secretary. So I thought, wow, I can make a living doing this. And it sort of helped in 1988 a define my politics a little, I think some of the relationships I had on that campaign. And then I ended up

Speaker 1:          03:28          a little bit about that. Like what were some of the four major formative?

Speaker 2:          03:30          Yeah, I think, um, well Utah's a very homogenous state. So I think we were the Democrats, right? So we were sort of the calendar to what was out there. And so I think, uh, environmental preservation, a balancing government is important I think. And that was one of the principles of that campaign. And uh, so anyway, I just kind of fell into it. Ended up on Capitol Hill. I worked initially for a congressman from Oregon, less a coin and 90. And then in [inaudible] 92, he was running for the US Senate. I joined that race in Oregon. He was defeated and I ended up working after that for Congressman from Utah, uh, initially as press secretary and then I became his chief of staff. His name is Bill Orton and unfortunately he was a blue dog, Democrat, Democrat, democrat. Yeah. What does happen

Speaker 1:          04:22          been to the old school of Democrats because obviously we're going to talk about your politics and I did a little digging here and I think there, there's some stuff. There's some points of agreement that we have for sure. What I wish out of the Democrats is that the old school Democrats still existed. What I've seen consistently is that as the progressives have gone further left, and I would say it's really out there now. They've sort of taken the whole party in any of the moderates are the blue dogs or whatever you want to call that wing. I don't know. They're either silent or they're gone altogether. Do you think that's a fair estimation or, or how would you even define some of these things? Like a blue dog, Democrat versus progressive?

Speaker 2:          05:01          Wow. What a. In the nineties, my memories of Bill Orton and unfortunately he passed away a few years ago, but I'm used to pretty young a congressman in the day and I worked with him for about four years and he was on the budget committee and the Banking Committee and very concerned about the deficit. So that had a great impression on me. I learned a lot about title might reform about discretionary spending, about our choices and I do think that as we see the deficit and the debt go up an APP, um, and it, you know, their deficit as you know, is tied to economic prosperity. When we do well, our deficits are not as high. Our overall debt keeps increasing. So I really feel that we need to get back to some discipline and I think that that has been missed, uh, in recent years. And I work on a Salt Lake County Council. I'm an elected now and we do balance the budget every year and it's much tougher in years where we have economic decline and those are the years we can't, um, do maybe some of the nice to haves. So I think we need to get back to more of a fluid budget process where congress recognize, recognizes, hey, this isn't such a good year, can we find a different way of budgeting so that we don't always give away things that we can afford? Is that possible

Speaker 1:          06:27          perhaps at the local level, state level, city level, etc. And just not possible anymore on the federal level because when you sit, talk about fiscal responsibility, that sounds so foreign to me as a democrat, but by the way, the republicans are horrible attitude and you know, look at the, the, the, uh, the omni bus that was just passed and all that. So I'm not even defending Any of them. They have some of the principles that should make sense. And so in a way they deserve more criticism because it's part of their package where it's a little less. So for democrat,

Speaker 2:          06:56          well I think the division in Washington is forced budget reconciliation rather than true budgets. And how can you reprioritize when you are just on the fly saying, hey, another two weeks, let's go two more days. So let's come back next week and fix this. So that's my concern is that we're at the point with so much division that we're not having real conversations and I do think there's a baseline budget if we were to go maybe even to a two year budget cycle, we're really find a way to force congress into actually true debate about what are our priorities because we all are frustrated with the federal government. It's not serving us, it's not serving us at the local level. And you know, I'm not someone who wouldn't say that we need to spend. I think we do need to invest in our communities and there's so many things that the federal government can do to support us at the local level and should. but when it's just rubber stamping what was done the year before, I'm at last minute. It's chaotic and it's not efficient.

Speaker 1:          07:52          Yeah. What do you think is the right amount of power for the federal government to have over the states? A lot of my audience that leans a little more libertarian or classical liberal or conservative, whatever it is. This is one of the key issues for them that we have to get this stuff back to the local municipalities and I'm pretty much,

Speaker 2:          08:10          yeah, I mean I feel really good about the role that, uh, I have at the local level. I do think that there are certain things that I'm really matter to us as a nation that we have to have in place. One, of course being defense, our interstate system and our highways and our connectivity and commerce. There's so many things that if we were to be isolationists state to state really jeopardize our, our ability to act as a super power, the one that we are to be really. I think I'm the best of our nation, but there are a lot of things that we should do locally. I mean, I worry a little about too much, um, diversion when you look at education. Um, I don't want there to be a decision that we would go four days a week in one state and not have basic standards.

Speaker 2:          08:58          So I think a basic level of standards. But then let states decide. I mean, we've got California here being very different than Utah, very different than, you know, a southern state or New York. So I'm basically there on that. To me, I always say, no, I would want to kick all of education back to the states. But then people ask have totally legit question, which I think is what you're saying. Well, what if states start really doing very drastically different things? What I would say is that maximum freedom, the ability to leave a state you don't like if you don't like what they're doing. I think that that's the better answer. But I guess getting some, some baseline I think is a is a sound or. Absolutely. And I do think though, we look at the unique character of each of our states and we need to foster that and find a way to, you know, really enable a state to do well on its own.

Speaker 2:          09:47          Uh, and you know, we could start over would do it differently, wouldn't we? But we have to understand that in 2018 there are certain things that are in place that, um, you know, the conversation needs to be, how do we reform, maybe not dismantle. I don't know if we would do it differently if we starteD over. I wish we would get back to some of that stuff. I would do many things differently if we start over here. Like what Virginia. Well, like I think there is a better way to fund medicaid and medicare and some of our big programs. I do believe as a democrat and I believe strongly and fairness and compassion and the government being a tool that we can and should invest. It's just, I think we've ended up building year after year after year on something that was created maybe for a good purpose at one point in time, but is not as efficient as it needs to be.

Speaker 2:          10:37          And I'm, I consider myself a reformer. that's one of the reasons I like what I do is I have the opportunity to step in and look at how to make something better and try and figure out a way to enact change. View worry as someone that you're saying you're pretty content with the work that you're doing now and you've been able to say, no, we can't do this if we can't budget it and it all kind of make sense and you let the chips fall wheRe they may that you could end up going to the swamp where it seems like nothing changes and that it doesn't sell that fun to me to be. There might be, you know, it's nice to maybe be on the national stage and play with more high rollers and that kind of thing, but that you lose the real sort of ability to, to govern the way you would want it.

Speaker 2:          11:17          It's a good point. I really believed the senate can change, can change and that change will make a big difference. I'd like to get back to the days where orrin hatch for my state and ted kennedy work together and solve problems and we were seeing too much polarization. We don't have enough conversation on my council. We have five republicans, four democrats and we worked together and I know that I have to go find that first vote right. I'm not a mathematician, it's, yeah, the collegiality matters and listening and trying and compromise. What's the tenor of politics in Utah right now is what's going on nationally with just this endless craziness. Is that happening to you guys at the local level? We tend to be a to five to 10 points. Uh, the, the president's numbers and profile and polling tends to be about 10 percent higher in favor in Utah.

Speaker 2:          12:13          So we still have a lot of people who were pro trump. I'm the core downtown salt lake, which is our kind of more progressive area. you're going to say the reverse of that and our urban areas, probably 50 slash 50, so we're like a lot of states where you have a very progressive kind of core city and suburban area 50 slash 50, and then you get to very conservative area. So as a state that generally runs red, um, and that leans more conservative for sure. As someone that's running as a democrat, what's, what's the primary process like first as a democrat? Like what kind of people are you reading? Where are you wearing? Well, interestingly, um, two years ago there was a very much a strong bernie sanders presence in our state because, you know, the lds church has a lot of dominance. there are a lot of people who speak out forcefully against the one party system, which is generally what we have in the state.

Speaker 2:          13:07          And so you get some pretty progressive people. And we were an 80 slash 20. I'm bernie sanders state to hillary clinton. Yeah. Which is kind of surprising. But um, things have sort of calmed down. I would expect that just because of the nature of a democrat at that point because the state liens so far. The other way that if you're going to say you're a democrat, you may as well go all in on that. Generally, I think so. And we alsO, like every state, we have our own nomination process and the republicans have a closed a republican system, so you have to affiliate with the republican with an r on the voter file. And so therefore there are actually are a lot of independence who are actually filing as republicans because they want to vote that way. And with that party, what's your policy on that?

Speaker 2:          13:52          For the open or closed prison? Yeah, I mean, I don't know. We've debated it on the democratic side and because the democrats are few and far between in my state we register at 20, 25 percent, but we do pull independence as I mentioned. Um, you know, we're not in the driver's seat and some of those policies, so we just sort of work with whatever makes sense because we're not in the one able to do anything. But that always strikes me as one of those things where it's like the closed primary does make sense to me because that's to nominate who you want out of that party. And if you just have an open primary, well you could get all sorts of people who will never vote for any of those candidates purposely getting into help candidates that they think are going to be more handicapped ultimately.

Speaker 2:          14:33          So I don't have. I know a lot of people think that the closed primary thing is somehow a conspiracy or anti democratic or something. But I don't have a problem with. The problem is what do you do with independence because most people tend to affiliate independent. I mean people I know, I mean there are people like you and me and, and elected or in meeting or whatever that tend to be the insiders who obviously follow this and get very deeply entrenched and every step of the way. And uh, I think most utahns are sort of in the middle and uh, so I don't know, that gets a little confusing because if we close, both them weren't as an independent government. IndependenT does nothing. Or you can see the independents can vote in either, but then why wouldn't anyone voted register as a, as an independent, right.

Speaker 2:          15:15          I guess there's no easy answer on that one. Yeah. Our big battle in the republican party right now is whether or not we're going to do away with the caucus system and go to the conventions rather and go to a direct primary. So that's our battle right now. We have a two tiered system you can pick either now and that's under review. What are some of the other issues? Is there anything else in Utah that you just see as like, just like the technical stuff, the technical problems related to voting or districting gerrymandering, that sort of thing, but someone that's on the other side, gerrymander, it's a very big problem. And then we have wacky maps like a lot of states. Um, there's a ballot initiative, so share one is a, um, redistricting commission ballot initiative that should likely passed. They got the required signatures to get on.

Speaker 2:          16:01          It seemed so, um, that would require that the legislature listened to a redistricting commission that makes the recommendation, but the decision does lie in the hands of the legislature in our state. Right. So whAt are some of the other democratic principles, layout, some democratic good old democratic principles in you nash? I mean, just personally for me, some of the things that you believe in. I've affiliated with the democratic party because I think that the party has been the party. The one has battled for fairness and compassion over the years. I mean, I have been pro lgbtq rights from day one. I was the first time I council to move forward, um, local policies we did even before my election to the county council years ago, four years ago, um, housing nondiscrimination, but we didn't have medical fairness in terms of our, um, health care plans at salt lake county.

Speaker 2:          16:54          So when I was first elected in 2004, I moved that and I couldn't get a republican vote. so it took several takes trying to redefine the benefits and ultimately we ended up passing it six three with a republican supporting us. So, uh, I think issues like that have been key. I think we have a very. One of the reasons I think I'm so active in politics in my state is that we don't have balance, uh, back in my dad's era in the seventies, we did have a republican governor. We had a democratic governor rather. Uh, it's been since the seventies since we had a democrat in the us senate from the state of Utah. And that's the person that orrin hatch defeated. So I really believe that good government is a balanced government and we live it and see it on my county council again with that, can I have five, four?

Speaker 2:          17:43          We have a democratic county executive, we call it a mayor and so we're, I feel like we're in a really good position in my day job now to bring about fairness and balance, but we're 80 slash 20 and our legislature, we are republican governor and so on down. So part of what I fight for is balance. I think it makes sense for good government. It's interesting too to stake out positions that, you know are not the popular ones there too, just so that the system doesn't become too corroded or, or too stiff. But what about. So it sounds sort of like you're, you're socially liberal and fiscally conservative. BaSic. I would agree with that. I think. So. Where were you at on abortion? I'm pro choice. Um, I believe that that women should have that right to choose. One of the reasons I really, the more I've learneD about younger women, um, you know, my own years with friends growing up, I see at times women who don't have the security that I've had my entire life with good parents and support are often, um, pray to being victimized.

Speaker 2:          18:55          And so I think that a woman's right to choose is very much critical because of that. And I know that, um, you know, in a very conservative state, I've had situations to support my sister who carried her child, I've been friends with. People have made different decisions and I just fundamentally believe that women need to be in the driver's seat on that decision and we can't go back to the days of real, real tragedies. Um, prior to roe versus wade. Do you see a cutoff point on it or were you on that? Um, well, I think that that's a decision for science and I think the courts have landed through roe versus Wade. And so I, that's the best I can do, but follow what we have in place now. And I just don't think in 2018 we can go back in time. It's interesting because that's one of the ones where I've heard, you know, obviously there's a lot of mormons in Utah, but I hear a lot of people that talk about the flyover states and they say that, you know, a lot of the christian conservatives are just voting on that no matter what.

Speaker 2:          20:00          So again, it's, it's a position where you as someone not telling the conservative line on that, that that's a serious uphill battle. Yeah, I think so. But I think the lds church is fundamentally a very compassionate religion and I think that, um, it is compassion I think kind of can mitigate that a little bit. And it has actually the lds church, its position, rape, incest, life of the mother is actually a little more progressive than some religions. What do you make of, uh, how involved they've been in with gay marriage? It's not really talked about anymore. It's the law of the land. I get it. It's sort of a boring topic for me at some level. Uh, but they did have certain influence in the whole national debate about over the years. it's interesting. I think the lds church has come along way in terms of basic rights, but marriage is obviously a death, a, you know, a defining line. Um, and in this era, given we have marriage equality nationally, we'll see how they step up and you'll, it's interesting, there tend to be very, uh, open right now to more um, lgbtq people involved in church services and really sending a message of love thy neighbor. And I appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          21:22          Yeah. Well, it's interesting to me because it's like people, it's so easy to bash mormons and you see it in comedy all the time. And look, broadway had the book of mormon. I didn't even see the book of mormon actually. I heard it was great. I would love to see it, but it's like you can make that show very easily. There are certain books you're not allowed to talk about that we'd never make it on broadway. So I always find like this need to bash mormons all the time where it's like the easy joke all the time. It's like maybe they're actually not the intolerant people because you have a very easy time. A joking. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:51          Well you can. I'm baptized lds and um, I have a great relationship with my friends who were still going to church regularly and my family members who are. And I think it's a, I love any religion that lifts people up and there are times where I disagree with churches, politics. I would very much defend separation of church and state and there are times where I might raise an eyebrow and go, wait a minute. This seems like it's overstepping a little bit, but I do appreciate the lds churches, incredible force for good in the youtube community by um, services and by creating a lot of support within our salt lake city area with, um, you know, there's a food bank for members and they make it open to people who are in general need. And I think there's a, again, at times I would have some differences certainly, but I support the role in that and the commitment and anybody who chooses to practice religion and it lives up their lives. That's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          22:56          Yeah. So would you, so because you're talking about all the good things that the church does, would you kick some of those social services back to churches and synagogues and mosques and everything else if, if you had the power to do so? Because to me I, again, as a small government guy, that's what I would see at it sounds like some of that's happened.

Speaker 2:          23:14          Well, I think we do that. I mean, I worry about the tax bill now because we're not going to get a ride off anymore. We're going to see how charitable people really are, you know, who knows? But we do that now. I think we always, I mean, I love, um, the work that I'm able to do on the salt lake county council when we have, um, a business leader step up and support something a little bit of county dollars as well. And we have a public private partnership. So I think we see a lot of that now. Could we take it further perhaps, but I think we get that then get into, you know, incentives and benefits and what I want to see in the community and what drives me is problem solving and I don't think the government is always the best vehicle for solving those problems. I mean, we do have businesses, individuals, government, the web of all of that to solve a problem and do it creatively. Um, I enjoy doing that at the local level and I think the federal level we can do that better and do more.

Speaker 1:          24:11          What kind of support or not support are you getting out of the dnc? They got a whole slew of problems, right?

Speaker 2:          24:16          Yeah. Well, so I just got the nomination

Speaker 1:          24:21          by the way, just for the record a little bit after when we're taping it, so.

Speaker 2:          24:24          Okay. Yeah. So I just recently received the nomination so I have not had anybody. The doorbell rang and a big check from the dance see by any means. But um, I've had conversations with the dscc. I've been invited to tour the city here in la and san francisco and seattle with some of the us senators, women. Uh, and that was a very educational for me and a great benefit to have some time with our three or four or five of our us senators on the democratic side of the aisle. And so I think just the conversations that connection, I mean fundamentally I think the democrats are trying to take back the senate and we'll see how things play out over the next six months or so in my race. And I'm hopeful that we'll get some significant national support. I think, um, I feel though my, uh, support should come from Utah and it is and uh, I just get up every day and see what I can do to bring a check in and get low dollar contributors to, to get what they can and day to day and we'll see what happens.

Speaker 1:          25:32          Yeah. It's interesting to me because it seems like you're really in a unique position where you're, you really seem to be fighting both sides. Maybe you don't want me to totally presented that way, but you're obviously fighting. You're fighting the republican side as a democrat in a, in a, in a red state, but also what I mentioned earlier about the, it seems to me that the dnc and the entire leadership from, you know, bernie and Elizabeth Warren and Keith Ellison and tom perez, like those guys seem way more left. Some of the things you've talked about here. So I don't. It's almost like why would they want to support you? Like your sort of against the stuff that they're kind of.

Speaker 2:          26:08          No, actually tom perez has visited a couple of times. He's pretty committed to playing in every zip code and I think he's building towards that. I mean the republican party and the democratic party have different influences within its governance structure. So I haven't given up on the dnc paying attention to you. I think they've done a good job in the past year and really engaging and listening. What's most important to me is that we get to the point where I'm both parties actually recognize that there cities and there are communities and they're all small small towns aside from, you know, los angeles, New York city, big cities in Florida, etc. Chicago were, I mean, there are people on the ground in my state in need with, you know, the, the need government to lift them up or need some support in some way from, um, community based networks.

Speaker 2:          27:07          And I think that we have become both not as, and this isn't just the parties, Washington and how we govern, um, you know, a little too focused I think on urban centers. Do you think we're just too reliant on government in general that the answer always seemed for both parties at this point? I mean, there's a couple outliers. I think rand paul, I always bring it up. He's trying either you obviously have disagreements with him on the, on the amount of government, but I see him as someone that's earnestly trying to fight for what he believes in and usually falls short because the system doesn't allow it that much. Um, but, but that argument of how much government, we always, the answer seems to always be more unfortunately. Well, I think that we have to get back to some pretty major changes back to reinventing things because what I do when I look at government and what's possible, let's look at what we have on the table.

Speaker 2:          28:01          Unfortunately, I learned in the nineties when I worked for a congressman that things don't happen quickly and I wish we could, you know, get out the etch a sketch and shake it and start over. Right. But, you know, I, and I think sometimes around paul and others, it's, it's, we have to accept that, um, we do have challenges with a lot of people in need. We do have income inequality and we have to address those issues. It would be nice, I think to, to Simply, you know, um, have a smaller federal government, but on the other hand, what are we to do? I think we would take a step back in terms of progress for us all. I think we all want the same thing. So we want people to do well. We want them to get up every day, um, have a, have a step towards self sufficiency or get out, make a living, not commit crime, be happy.

Speaker 2:          28:55          I mean, we all want the same thing. The question is how do we get there? Right? So that is the question because the latter part of that, of course, I believe all of those things and I don't, I really try not to impugn the motives of the people that I disagree with in general. Not talking about you but just in general. But to me the answer to, to solve those problems would be just the government keeps scaling back, keep scaling back, keeps coming back. Hopefully private enterprise comes in and you give people more self reliance as opposed to creating a system that they kinda can't move out of because I think there's a lot of evidence for that. And that's the great debate and that's the great. Should we just have to look at, you know, I've worked for a little while at a hospital that did an incredible amount of ophthalmology research and I learned a lot about research and development and how the federal government works through basic science and supports researchers and I look at our innovation and our nation and what we've done because we've invested in that.

Speaker 2:          29:57          So when you talk about smaller government and you have to say, okay, where and what is the next step by the pure funding of science by the, for the record, either got a lot of books of scientists who had been on the street. We have to. And then there's a lot of businesses that receive benefits and support small businesses on up. Um, you know, we just allowed for a one point $5,000,000,000,000 corporate tax cut without any requirement that people return it to wages and to growing companies. And I see a lot of federal policies that have overly supported business. And I think especially now in this era with that, I mean I looked at and did a back of the napkin on our own taxes. I did quite a bit of assessment when the tax bill came out at the end of the year to see what it would do for a family of four, a family of six, a larger Utah family and they're not. Many of uS are. We're going to get a big benefit from that and now the mitt romney's and a few others will and I think why in this era we've got to find a way to, if we are going to do tax reform, tax simplification. That was a principal we talked about with her. I'm like, ah, you know, call her, you know, call your tax accountant because he or she is gonna. Make double now. is there any

Speaker 1:          31:12          reason to believe that the government can do these things? Like, like if you take just the general stagnation we talked about in Washington and most of the congressmen who do nothing in the senators who've been there forever and accomplish nothing or it's just endless fighting or all that. The idea that these people who often have never created any jobs and it never really made anything happen. I mean, I conclude bernie in this for sure. The idea that they, that they are the ones that are gonna, figure out how to get the economy going when it really comes from the people that comes from the local businesses, the small businesses, etc.

Speaker 2:          31:46          Well, congress should be listening to its constituents and to it specialists and that's why there's nothing that offended me more than what happened with the healthcare bill and the tax bill last time with no debate. I mean there were some efforts for to have a bipartisan discussion around both and one of the offenders was orrin hatch who was trying to take and up down now get outta here. We gotta get home and that that's the worst. Oh, government to me, because we should have that. We should have specialists in. We should have a debate. We shouldn't have lobbyists lined up and we should actually have methods and systems to do what I do on the county council, work with my colleagues, bring specialists in, listen to information and make good decisions. Yeah. I

Speaker 1:          32:28          think you could probably draw a line from the obamacare debate and how insane that guide to everything that has led us to where we are at now. Even during that. Yeah, the wouldn't sit down and we're goIng crazy the whole time and obama kept saying in the reelection campaign, we're going to do it on cspan. It's going to be open door cspan and it's like just the odd amount of congressmen and senators that were retiring in the middle of it after they would make a decision or we need something. Just seemed

Speaker 2:          32:57          about the whole thing and let's go fix it. Let's go fix it and let's get back to our real conversation and I, I guess I feel maybe from going back maybe a full circle now to talking about my father again. I think in the seventies, in the eighties, those things were more likely to happen. The collegiality, the discussion, and one of the things that led to my interest in this race was it like, I am a reformer. I, I like you want to fix things. So I want to go back and have a voice in the system wherever I can find an ally in, in doing some of the things you're suggesting that we get down. We worked through these things. Um, but I actually think that, uh, if that's too big a deal initially, at least that I can serve my state. And that was my major interest in running is I think that um, we need a democrat from our delegation. We have six ours. Um, we have six zero votes on everything and there are a lot of people in my community and in my state that are being served by that.

Speaker 1:          34:01          Yeah. I just quickly to reverse back to say, we talked about before about, and you were saying about being able to sit down with people have crossed the iron ore that you mentioned right before we sat down that we have a mutual friend in rick grinnell who I think as we're taping this today, we think he just left for Germany. He was finally confirmed after over a year of waiting to be the ambassador of Germany. So we're both thrilled. You guys were were old roommates, but he's a republican. He's a trump supporting republican or a democrat from Utah. And guess what? you guys are friends. It's all good. It's all good. Yeah. That does seem to be the thing that is last. These.

Speaker 2:          34:35          Yeah. And I, I just don't get that and I, I have enough sense of my own convictions that I'm not threatened by going to dinner with republicans. So are working with them on a county council and I'll tell you, there are times when the four democrats look over at the other side of the aisle and we're like, we're done. We're out. But we have those conversations. We work through our budget together. We have some votes that are crossed party lines and others that are, they typically are, you know, some are some days. Um, and you know, I think that's the reason that local people or people who've worked at the local level like myself, need to get to congress. We need to get more and more people who get government to have worked in government who solve problems and come in with that commitment to, to, you know, putting the time, effort, energy, and to moving things forward.

Speaker 1:          35:29          Alright. So let's talk about the race you were involved. Fair to say this is an uphill battle.

Speaker 2:          35:34          I think so a little bit. Yeah. Just say

Speaker 1:          35:36          just numbers. It's, it's a tough

Speaker 2:          35:38          one. Okay. So at the republican convention, everyone thought, I think, or at least at the national level and thought mitt romney was going to walk in and clean this thing up. Right. The guy was the republican nominee for president not too long ago and has all the media behind him and all the money and all that. uh, but my kennedy one, I don't know much about Mike Kennedy. So could you just briefly tell me a little bit about him and then we'll focus more on the romney. Fascinating. He's a legislator. He is kind of himself as conservative, more conservative than romney. Romney sort of been all over the place. So I don't know. I really, truly do not know mitt romney's politics. So my kennedy ran to the right of romney and did pretty well at the convention. Romney came in second, so the two of them will go to a late june primary.

Speaker 1:          36:25          Right. So it was pretty close. I think it was 51 slash 49. So they will do a primary soon enough. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          36:31          You would, you'd have to claire, 60 percent at your convention to avoid the primary, which I did. And so I, yeah, I've cleared my with 81 percent and then there I've got it. The primary now you worked for romney a dead? Yeah. Tell me about that. Um, I worked for him. He just said you don't know his politics. Well, I thought I did at the time. So I worked for the olympic games of 2002. We had three or four of us who ran the volunteer program, recruitment retention training, a 26,000 employees and volunteers on those games. That made it a success and a. Yeah. So he was our chief executive and I was senior staff and I saw quite a bit of him and I was always a little bit nervous when we had the quarterly budget review with mitt romney was a big day. What was that like a businessman right as a now we went end with our budgets and how to defend our programs and he'd give us a up or down and I will say mit did a good job of stabilizing the budget and fundraising and that was, he was good at. That is a good, good person to work for.

Speaker 1:          37:39          But when you say you don't know what his politics are like, what, what does that mean?

Speaker 2:          37:43          Well, he laughed right after the olympic games, um, to Massachusetts to run for governor, uh, he had run against ted kennedy in Massachusetts for the senate years before. So thIs was his, um, jump into political life again and he won that race and I started to watch and was interested because I knew him and it seemed, you know, he was going in as a progressive governor, republican governor, uh, he signed an assault weapon ban. He was pro choice and uh, he got ruined in Massachusetts and then not long after he ran for president was defeated and then president and again, and he ended up moving more and more and more. I'm going to the left, but it was actually to the right,

Speaker 1:          38:27          right, exactly what people would say. People would say, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Didn't he kind of start obamacare with romney carried Massachusetts then was. And then it

Speaker 2:          38:35          was also running. Yeah, it. Yeah. And then we have the history with trump where he was, um, I think delivered all wooded would agree the most scathing, um, speech against trump, talking about his lack of values, his inability to govern and was very much in the amt. Anybody but trump camp. And then, you know, we saw the sit down when there was some talk of secretary. Yeah. He did not look happy and then it seems he's back with trump or. Yeah. So that's what we're left with right now to kind of work through that in the state. Do you think when he had that moment, I remember when he gave that press conference, it was late. It looked like trump was gonna win no matter what, but he gave that press conference. I read it more as and I think perhaps the electorate did to that.

Speaker 2:          39:22          It was kinda like, have you lost this thing? So why would we listen to you? Like the whole thing with trump was about winning. So it was like anyone that liked trump wasn't going to be like, oh, he is making a couple of good points. It's like, no, you were the loser. They're trotting out the loser. We tried it with mccain, we tried it with romney, we tried it with more centrist people. Even though I actually think trump is sort of interesting, his own bizarre way, but that's a whole other topic. I'm like, the idea of that just doesn't work anymore. It doesn't fly anymore. Right, exactly. So I don't know. I mean I look at romney and I feel like I'm. My biggest concern about a romney in the senate is I think we just need somebody from Utah fighting for Utah and I think he's a national figure and I don't want, I mean, if romney does, when the senate race, people will notice now that many have said, well, romney is going to get a chairmanship, or what is that realistic?

Speaker 2:          40:18          I don't think so. I meAn, I can't imagine a republican senator stepping aside for romney to come and take, you know, It also gets to the heart of what you think the problem is. It's like you're trying to get a guy to get in there for Utah and it's like, oh, congratulations. He, yes, it's nice to get those powerful positions, but that's not the position now to help your state the most. Yeah. So I'm from your tie. I know you tie work in the state. Uh, I, I love it. I've lived there except for my time in graduate school and my time working on the hill and the nineties. I've lived there my entire life. I'm raising two children there. I'm first generation your time, uh, and I recreate there. I enjoy it. I love the state. Do, do you think that feeling was what caused him not to win the, uh, the convention?

Speaker 2:          41:03          Well, it um, because carpet bagging it kinda, you know, hillary was, if we're going to use it was a guard beggar. She was from Arkansas and you know, when he got in I did. I didn't actually thought warren hatch would run again because he loves the senate and he doesn't know anything else, so I thought he might run again and um, when he didn't, it just didn't make sense to me knowing that I'm at the sunset of his career, he's had, you know, a very successful career financially and got kids and grandkids and I figured, hey, at that point in my life I'd be like looking to relax a little bit. So it didn't seem to make sense. And I think people when I worried a little as a candidate like, oh my goodness, it was mitt romney, am I even going to keep the lights on in the campaign headquarters?

Speaker 2:          41:51          And what I found is that people are asking that question. Yeah. How, how long has he lived here? People are even saying, does he meet residency, which he does. He's been in Utah long enough now again. Um, but I, I do think that there are people wondering, you know, what is, why, why the mitt romney candidacy and that may have been part of the reason that this division occurred within the republican party. It's an interesting place as a democrat because he's so successful as a businessman and generally democrats want attacks businessman more, which is something you've already alluded to here. And yet at the same time you're also saying that he ran the olympic thing and the budget's pretty well. So it's like there's some piece that makes that a ton more. I just don't want to give away more. I mean, going back to this tax bill, if we had the one chance to reform, I wanted it done differently, but I do think that, um, you know, it's, we'll just see if the public, if you tie aligns with mitt romney candidacy.

Speaker 2:          43:01          I fundamentally believe in balance in my state and that's what I've been fighting for and I, you know, in my day life as a county elected, I'll work on canyon protection or you know, advancing a development or protecting our water and our air. I'll do all of those things, but I fundamentally am really fighting as a democrat for balance and it because I think it's really critical to, um, a less corrupt system, a more even playing field. All voices heard in the system. We don't have a lot of women in politics in Utah, um, when a lot of women in politics anywhere including the us senate. So I think getting more diversity, more diverse voices in is really important. Those are the things I care quite a bit about and we'll see if the, my vision for the state resonates with people versus romneys. And I'm glad you mentioned that because one of my biggest issues right now with the democrats and with the left and especially with the progressive than my whole audience know this because I beat this thing endlessly is identity politics.

Speaker 2:          44:02          That you shouldn't be voting for a woman just because she's a woman. You shouldn't be voting for a black person just because they're black or white prison because they're white or any of those ridiculous things. When you talk about that sort of diversity, I think you sort of said it both ways. They're like, you want some more women, which ended up itself. Of course it's not a Bad thing, but that one I think always gets lost in that is diversity of thought and that's what I'm more concerned about and I don't see anyone talking about that on a, on the left anymore. Well, I don't know that I'm put jenny wilson, democrat in x county council seat. Take my colleague, jim bradley. I don't know that jim's better edison elected than. I wouldn't say he. He or I are better because of our gender, but I do judge you on your ideas.

Speaker 2:          44:45          I mean that's the point, right? But I do think what is preventing when women make up 50 percent of the population, women from being in the pipeline, that's what we have to get out and we have to figure out why we don't have that. I mean, because ideally in a given body we would see 50 slash 50. now we are seeing a lot more women step up in this era and we saw it in Utah and they weren't all progressive. Um, we have a new mayor, female of provo, Utah, which is the heart of a very, very conservative conservative area. The hummer, brigham young university. We have a woman at a small town not far from salt lake city where I'm from, to wIlla, Utah. And I think that's great, but you hadn't seen that as often in the state of Utah, which is um, mainly caucasian, caucasian men typically over 60. Right? So I think that the voice of our community is beyond that one segment. So that's where I want to see people say, hey, what is it that would get me to step up to be considered within the system?

Speaker 1:          45:53          Do you think some of that is not just that it's just like old crusty white men doing it because I just think that's a, I just think it's too sort, sorta too easy to lay it on that, that perhaps also that women are interested in other things at some level, like the idea that we'd ever get it to 50 slash 50 or that it should be 50 slash 50. That seems lIke very strange engineering of things like if, if these women are qualified and have the right ideas and all that and it ends up being 70 percent women, 30 percent men. I think that's it. I just don't care what it is other than the ideas. But there's something that when you, when people talk about what we should, you know, it's like we should have this represent. They represent this amount of the population. If you're talking about an ethnicity, they should have this amount of representation in politics that seems incredibly dangerous and actually prejudice to me.

Speaker 2:          46:38          Well, I just think that you have to look at, um, barriers for participation. I mean, the good news is we're seeing a lot of women have graduated from college now for the first time, so maybe that will change over time. Right? We're, but I do think there's something to be said for reform and change and um, I think maybe we just disagree on this point, but I love to see more people reflecting the percentages of our community serving in government because I think I'm having more voices for people who have lived a certain way or have, have some understanding of the, um, you know, individual or kind of collective need within a given community.

Speaker 1:          47:17          Yeah. So that, that part I think We probably have to disagree. Agree to disagree on. I'm the sort of collective need,

Speaker 2:          47:23          hey, like I want it to be very clear that I don't, not every woman in the state of Utah needs to want to run for the us senate for goodness sakes. Right. I value women who choose to raise her children at home and have that option within their family and that, you know, I, my kids kind of tease me because I missed sort of half a cook. I'm not a very good and I looked at this woman who I had are making like their home and, and, and their, their environment for their family, just incredibly rich and interesting through the commitment they make and that way and I don't for a minute take anything away from that because I haven't taken a different path and I try my best and we have an abandoned my children by any means. But yeah. Yeah, I mean I, I,

Speaker 1:          48:13          I understand that for sure. I mean my mom, I have two siblings so we have three kids in my family and my parents were married over 40 years. My mom worked before she had kids, but then in all of our formative years she didn't and my dad was the sole breadwinner, but then after my sister who's the youngest got to a certain age, my mom went back to work. I look back on those years of my mom being around and cook. We know we always had dinner at 6:00 and all that stuff. Like I look at that as great and yet there's a certain segment of society that kind of looks down on that and I think that's so,

Speaker 2:          48:43          yeah, and I think it's impressive and wonderful if stats, but I think that the point is that every child, he or she should grow up being whatever they want to be and have, you know, have a right to the american dream. And if in the american dream is staying home and raising your kids and you're able to do that financially, then that's amazing. If it's like me, you know, I want to make a difference in politics. I've had that advantage in my life to be given, um, you know, a platform to get there. And I think that's great. So I would hope that for a young woman who, uh, is high school or getting into college, who aspires to do that, that there won't be barriers in her way, that she will be able to sit here with you and a few years and you'll be able to say, I remember that jenny wilson, she, she was written for you cracking.

Speaker 1:          49:32          That's what it's all about. Believing in equality of opportunity that everyone has the exact same opportunities. I am completely on board with you. Um, anything else we should know about Utah? We briefly tAlked about just the sort of demographic

Speaker 2:          49:47          we have to come visit. I told him, I know I've never been to. I can, I can't believe that. Like most people that I meet to have been there a good skier to ski. We have five national parks. you can access our national parks through vegas or Arizona or salt lake city, four or five hour drive south. Um, we have amazing national parks. We have an agricultural area north up by the Idaho border, which is pretty amazing. A lot of um, somewhat barren land around the great salt lake area. Um, you need to fly over the lake because it's like, you think you're on mars and there's some water. It looks very, very different.

Speaker 1:          50:28          The landscape. Yeah. Cool. Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you. I wish you luck. As we said, you've got an uphill battle here in a state that is not the color that you are because everyone's obsessed with this silly, a blue and red stuff. But, uh, I'll be back on as a us senator. That's what I'm talking about. For more jenny's campaign, check out wilson for senate backup.
