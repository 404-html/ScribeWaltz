Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Paul Joseph watson is an author and the editor at large of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Paul, welcome to the Rubin report.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Hi Dave. Good to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       I'm glad you are here. When we were talking before we started, you were saying that I'm going to get. I'm going to get some hate for this. Are you warning me of pre hate?

Speaker 2:          00:00:21       I think you've probably already got some hate just for announcing that I'm going to be on. I mean there's a lot of people who have some kind of pull her over for wars and Alex Jones I think is, you know, conspiracy central, but most people don't realize that, you know, Alex is not this big main controlling force like dictating what everybody says. He pretty much gives me free reign to talk about whatever I want and that's what's good about info wars. It's a very broad church. So you've got, you know, numerous reits as commentators who worked with him for wars and they can basically talk about and write about whatever they want. So as far as I'm concerned, that's the best job imaginable. So I think people need to get over it and move on because the sun is that we're talking about supersede any perception about what info wars is about, what people think it's about. So you know, I just want people to listen to what I've got to say and concentrate on the sun rather than, you know, what website is hosted on that's irrelevant at the end of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       Right. And that's exactly what happened. I mean I just sent one tweet out this morning saying that you were coming on the show and immediate conspiracy theorist, he works with Alex Jones and it's like you guys are having conspiracy theories about the conspiracy theory. So I was like, you know, let's just talk it out and we'll see what happens. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       No, it's not as bad as it used to be. I mean I know there's this perception out there that, you know, Info wars is discredited or whatever, but I mean when breaking stuff every day. Well linked on the drudge report, you know, we've got 20 million listeners a week now for the radio show. So whether you like cars or not, wherever a presence and you know, that's why some people have a problem with it, but as I said, just concentrate on the issues of what I'm saying and in fact my youtube channel explores these kinds of issues off on a tangent from the normal content that info was, would cover. So I've kind of attracted a new satellite audience outside of Info wars, so it's all about bringing new people in and that's why I've attempted to do, that's where I think I've been successful recently.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       Yeah. And it's your youtube channel that actually got me familiar with what you were doing because you did a phenomenal video on the regressive left, which everyone knows. I'm not a fan of them. You've done some really interesting stuff about the European immigration crisis. So yeah, we're going to get into all the issues stuff. Uh, but just to wrap up the info wars part of this, how did you get involved with Info wars? What's your relationship like with Alex? Let's go down that route for a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:02:48       Well, I mean I started my own political website when I was about 18 years old, so you know, I would go home and host a radio show on dial up internet to three people, two listeners, you know, back in the early two thousands. So that was the very genesis of Alex liked what he was doing. He liked the content I was covering, so he basically headhunted me and said, you know, coming in and edit info was coming right for us. And that's, that's what happened. So now I'm based in London. They're based in Austin, Texas, so I'm a, you know, six hours ahead of time so I can get a jump on the news that's always beneficial with a news organization. So that's why it kind of works and he lets me write and say what I want. He's not this controlling presence and you know, a lot of people think that Alex Jones is a kind of act that it's put on this radio personality that he has. But if you meet him and you hang around with him, what you see is what you get. That's how I like joke. He's like that all the time. It's not an act. He's not putting it on, you know, in, in private, in, in person. He's kind of more jovial and fun than his rants on the radio would suggest, but that's him. That's his personality. It's not an act.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Yeah. I'm curious, were you trepidatious to, to join forces with him because obviously it was a good opportunity. It's saying that it's worked for you. Uh, but because of what I said before about I just send one tweet out and people start yelling at me. You must have had some level of concern. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:04:15       Well that was, that was a long time ago, back in the day. So really Alex was only a few years into his operation. I built up a good deal of traffic with my own website. So there was no trepidation. It was just about reaching a wider audience. So obviously I jumped at the opportunity.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       Yeah. So where do you actually consider yourself politically? I think I have a good sense and one of the things we've been talking about here is sort of this new growing center. People who really want to stand up for free speech and civil liberties, but also understand that we have real threats and that this immigration issue in Europe is a big problem. They want to be able to honestly talk about Islam. Islam. So the old dynamic of right, left Democrat, conservative for us in the states. It all seems to be crumbling. So I'm curious, what do you even consider yourself if, if you had to go with a label?

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       Um, well, I grew up, obviously when I was a teenager I was a progressive and I think it was Winston Churchill that said, if you're not a liberal when you're young, you have no heart if you're not a conservative when you get older, you have no brain. So a moment in my thirties I would consider myself mainly a limited area and maybe you could call me a conservative area, but it's somewhere within that gap between the two. So that's basically where I'm at right now.

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       Yeah. Do you find that movement growing, uh, where you are? Because I do sense it's growing here. You know, our politics have gotten so crazy, uh, between a democratic socialist who's the hot guy on the left and trump who is sort of off the rails but confused, you know, is he really a Republican? Does he stand for conservative values or is he truly a centrist? None of it makes sense anymore. Are you guys getting some of that feeling too?

Speaker 2:          00:05:56       So some, some extent. Yeah, but I mean in the UK it's still extremely left wing. I mean even, even the Tory party isn't classically conservative. They're somewhat left on a lot of Su, so most people don't even know what a libertarian is in the UK, to be honest, the only people who are really politically active will know what that actually means. So I think America is streets ahead in the sense of actually understanding that there is a political alternative outside of progressivism, which is still what dominates the entire discourse in the UK. I mean people will think you're a racist or a bigger if you're not a progressive, especially as a young person. So the circles in which I move, there's very little understanding about what these labels mean, which is why I try to concentrate on the issues without, you know, coming at it from a left or right persuasion.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Yeah. And that's very much what I've tried to do and I've tried to define a lot of these terms and you know, the whole Libertarian ideology really fits with me, you know what I mean? Like do with your body what you want, let the government stay out of your life for the most part and, and build a life that works for you. But you're saying that that the idea of that is really gone in the UK now.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       I don't really. I don't think it was ever here really. I don't think people came to grips with it. Yeah. I mean there's still, there's still some debate within libertarian circles about certain issues like abortion or like open borders. I mean some Libertarians think that to be truly classically libertarian you have to advocate open borders. Other people say, well, no, that's the government foisting open borders upon the people, you know, taking their tax money to pay for it, but I mean within the UK, as far as I'm concerned, in my experience, these, these labels aren't even known, they're not even defined. So when you describe yourself as a libertarian, people have no frame of reference, so they think if you're not a liberal, then you must be on some obscure fringe of the political spectrum. But you know, I guess the, the understanding is growing, especially with the backlash against social justice warriors, which has really accelerated in the past 18 months. So now these issues are, uh, beginning to be brought to the fore. Now people are beginning to understand that libertarianism is a backlash against authoritarianism, which of course is embodied by this feminist third wave feminist social justice warrior movement.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       Yeah, you're, you're hitting all the buzzwords there. So do you think it's really just a branding issue for Libertarians? Because there's sort of no unifying principle that's bringing us together other than do what you'd like and don't harm someone. So they just need sort of better. There are a good reps basically, or at least from what I see in the United States, we have a couple of Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico, had on the show and he's running for president, but it's hard to gain traction when you're one of the outsiders.

Speaker 2:          00:08:50       Yeah. I was thinking the problem with libertarianism is they're not on the frontier of political discourse. So when you get major issues that crop up in the news media, obviously as somebody who's politically active, you have to seize upon them and tell your story and try and control change that narrative as best you see fit. But Libertarians tend to get stuck in the weeds, you know, they're always arguing with each other about these new issues and they're not really on the frontier of the cultural discourse, which is more, you know, now the domain of, of conservative areas and people who oppose social justice warriors. So I think in America the libertarian movement is still so stuck in the weeds and arguing, you know, my new shit between themselves that they're not really, um, a robust forces they could be. I think that's one region in which they could improve by hijacking these key issues, these core issues like the migrant crisis and they're not doing that, that they're debating with each other over what minute ism is and whether we should have no government or limited government and they have speeches and three our youtube conversations about that and they're not really reaching anyone outside their inner circle.

Speaker 2:          00:10:08       So I think that's how, you know, libertarianism needs to improve in that way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       So I guess the silver lining to all of this is that because of the social justice warrior thing and now we can get into some of these issues is they're starting to push people into this idea of libertarianism, which is nice. So let's, let's go to the social justice warrior stuff. You are not a fan of the social justice warrior movement to put it mildly. Uh, when, when did you wake up to it? When did you really see it as, as a threat to free speech?

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       I think it was probably made 2014. I mean, I was, I was mainly covering geopolitical issues back in 2012, 2013. I was mainly on the Syrian civil war, the buildup, the arms race that the confrontation with Russia over the course of 2013 to 2014 and then I became more active on twitter and it's only when you become active on twitter and you have to actually put some time into it and follow the discourse that's taking place on twitter that you realize that these issues are important because it's no longer just, you know, demented 14 year olds on tumbler expressing that bizarre arcane grievances. These people are in the universities. They are our future thought leaders that are being cuddled. They're being protected by professors at these major universities. So it was that connection between realizing that this is not just idiots within opinion on twitter, which is completely obscure. This is now a really robust driving narrative, uh, with, uh, amongst millennials. And that's, once you realize that once you realize how it's, how it's infested the core of the education system in America and now in Britain as well, that to me really symbolized how important it was to oppose these people because they oppose everything I stand for. You know, within the tenets of libertarianism itself.

Speaker 1:          00:12:09       Yeah. You know, it's interesting because I had very similar, probably around the same time a awakening about this because it was a lot on twitter, right? Because you're seeing this stuff on twitter and you see the stuff from tumbler that makes its way over and all these people fighting about this stuff that we hear about the trigger warnings and safe spaces and all of this stuff. But I could never really figure out how much of this just existed for people behind computers. But basically what you're saying is that there's been. This has been a long time coming and that's what sorta has seeped into the university space. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Right. And now it's becoming really physical. I mean, you've seen the Bernie Sanders people and we're going to get into the whole trump thing lights, uh, but we've sent. Our reporters are to Wisconsin this past week, for example. And you know, it's not just Bernie Sanders supporters, it's leftist in general than other ones. Vial, hateful people you could ever wish to meet. I mean, the Shia hatred that they give you like radiates from their eyes when you so much as disagree with them is palpable and now they're out there. They're shutting down these private functions, these Donald Trump events, which, whether you agree with trump or not, that's not your free speech First Amendment right to shut down a private function. You're impinging on other people's First Amendment by doing that. And these people wave signs saying, you know, oppose hatred or bigotry that have the most hateful people you could imagine. So that's what I see now, the translation from twitter, now they're getting out on the streets of girls. We've seen that with black lives matter that metastasized into a similar, hateful, violent movement. And we might get into that later. But yeah, it's, it's, it's manifesting physically now. And it's why people are worried about civil unrest and riots quite frankly because these people are prone to violence and they're very hateful people.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       So. Okay, so we're gonna get into all of that. So. But you hit on a lot of things there. So one of the things that I've been saying is I can't believe we're at a place in 2016 in America where I fear that it will be us ourselves, the citizens who will take away our right to free speech more than the government. So in other words, it's not a first amendment issue in these people protest because it's not the government doing it, but we do have a certain social contract that you have to let people speak and then you can use your speech to counteract it. But basically you're saying by blocking roads and by stopping people from speaking that that's where it becomes a free speech issue, not necessarily a first amendment issue. Right. You see that distinction?

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       No, I've got no problem with people being out on the streets protesting. I mean that's the riots when they actually go Donald Trump events in private buildings where they've paid to hire this building and they got the event in Chicago canceled, for example, that's impinging on other, on other people's rights to peaceably assemble exercise their first amendment and just listen to somebody's speech. But I mean, as you touched on before, it's this whole idea of, you know, before the, the power was in the media and we're going to talk about in the media later, now it's, it's kind of invested back into the hands of people. It's people power, but it's people power gone mad. So now you have organized groups of people who go out to publicly shame others to get them fired, to censor content from the Internet. And that's how twitter in one sense empowered the people. But it gave that power to these perpetually outraged mobs. And that's what woke me up to the social justice warrior Su, because as you said it, the concern for me for a few years ago was the states, the government impinging on our free speech rights. Now it's perpetually professionally outraged mobs impinging on our free speech rights. I think that's the biggest danger right now in 2016 in comparison to anything that the state's going to do.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       I completely agree. It's so ironic. I can't even think of an example right now in America where the state is holding the first amendment hostage. I can't find one instance where you can't say whatever you want about the government or about government officials or anything like that, but I can see many instances where the mob and the online mob and they'll try to stop your patrion funding if you're a youtuber or they'll try to figure out other ways to have you fired or shamed or whatever else. Do you think that these people, like for example, when trump was doing the rally in Arizona and they blocked the road in Arizona, do you think that they thought that they were helping their cause because I get it, but not all of these people are thinking all their moves through properly and they know they're going out. We're going to stop them from showing up and that's all good, but to me all they really do is strengthened trump because then look, nobody that didn't get there is suddenly not gonna vote for trump. It makes them want to vote for trump more than everyone watching it on the news is going, wow, who's being oppressed here? It's actually trump, so it's really. It's fascinating, right?

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       No, I don't know if they've got any idea of how ridiculous they look, but they've got this media narrative backing them up, which is that trump is inciting violence and this is something that I've been hot on. Again, I don't agree with trump on everything. I'm not a vehement trump supporter, but if you go on twitter on any single day and search for assassinate trump or kill trump, you will find hundreds and hundreds of examples. Obviously most people don't mean it. They're not going to do anything, but they're threatening to assassinate trump and yet the whole media narrative is about how trump supports as a violent about how trump himself is inciting violence. There's a video on youtube right now and we complain about, you know, to a TSA censoring conservatives for having the wrong political opinion. There's a guy who's still on twitter. His account hasn't been touched by the trust and safety council.

Speaker 2:          00:18:02       Yeah. He's got a youtube video which calls for caving. Trump's head in with a shovel, shooting him with an AK 47. Filling him full of bullets is not even age restricted on Youtube. I mean, I've had videos age restricted for swear words and the media came out afterwards. This is a rap video out of a Baltimore unbuildable dot. Come celebrate today as a powerful protest song. This is a group of young men in a rap video threatening to kill Donald Trump. Imagine if you know the Oregon militia or whoever had come out with a video threatening to assassinate Hillary Clinton. Do you think the media would be celebrating it as a powerful protest song? So it's that double standard they're given left media cover because we've got this narrative that trump's inciting violence when again, they're the most hateful violent people out there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       Well, it's so fascinating because as you've repeated several times, now, you're not even a huge trump supporter, and yet you're, you are put in a position where you have to defend some of these ideals. I'm not a trump supporter and I, I feel the same way. If I want to stand up for the ideals that I stand for, I have to call this nonsense out because apparently no one in the media do it. You know, there's another great example of that. Did you see a couple of weeks ago when that guy tried to bum rush trump on stage and then the next night he was on cnn and all the news channels and they were treating him as if he was some legit voice of counter protests, but meanwhile he was trying to attack a presidential candidate whether you like trump or not. Right? So this is. This is fully the fault of the media here, right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Well, exactly. I mean you flip it around if, if a right winger tried to attack Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, that he wouldn't be on CNN the next day being given a complimentary welcoming platform. Yet we see this again and again and you know, trump is a creation of social justice warriors at the end of the day have reaction as an equal and opposite reaction and people are just tired. That tired of being lectured about how racist they are. They're tired about being lectured to check their privilege and whether you agree with trump or not, and I don't agree with them on things like torture or surveillance, but this is the backlash. You know, these people who support trump, uh, so condescended towards by the mainstream media, but they had to work for everything they had. These are mainly quite poor blue collar workers, the supporting trump, but they're sick of being made to feel guilty about who they are, but the establishment still doesn't recognize that fact and just labels them racists and bigots. They still don't get it. They still don't get what's driving this phenomenon. And it might end up, you know, slapping them in the face.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Yeah. Well I think it, it slapping them in the face right now. So how much of this do you think his establishment politicians and just the establishment on both the Democrats and the Republicans in bed with the media, that they've all gotten so fat for so long that they've all just asked terrible questions and no good follow ups and they've all just been in this game for so long that they. Their fear of trump is that he's going to leave a lot of these guys without a job. A lot of these pundits on TV and all these people who have professionally gotten everything wrong for years, but they've had a gig and a lot of these people I think think, Whoa, I'm not going to have a gig if trump gets in. So they're. They're protecting their own assets more than anything else.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       Well, that's definitely part of it. I mean, the other department is, you know, trump is self funded. He's a maverick. He might be a rich, bigoted buffoon, but he's unpredictable and the elite, the establishment of the political establishment is used to having not one but two candidates and every single presidential race that they control. I mean, you go back to 2004 Bush and Kerry, both skull and bones members. That's, you know, that's business as usual for the political elite. Somebody like trump comes along, he's a, he's a loose cannon. He's unpredictable. They don't know what he's going to do. I think if he got in power, he would immediately start moderating his rhetoric or whatever. They're scared stiff because it's simply an unknown quantity. And as you said, a lot of people in the establishment who have relied on this status quo for so long, for decades, an hour petrified because you know, he's, he's come along and up the apple applecart people are scared.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       Yeah. So do you view this all is just a big negotiating ploy with him because you know, I was seeing this week he made this comment that, you know, maybe Japan should have nukes and everyone is saying, well then he's going to start a nuclear arms race. But what he really was saying was either Japan should be able to defend itself with nukes because North Korea is there and China and everything else. Or they should pay us to defend them, meaning pay the United States because we basically have agreements that we defend them militarily. So it's not that crazy of a proposal that we should be paid. You know, if you're a celebrity, you pay your body guard. Right? So do you think a lot of this is that he just throws this stuff out there, then gets misquoted. You know what I mean? The media runs with a tie. He really wants to start a nuclear arms race and then people. It even strengthens him more because then people go, wait a minute. That wasn't that crazy of a proposal.

Speaker 2:          00:23:22       No, they just run with the banner headline that suits their agenda and as you said, if you actually drill down into what he's saying, sometimes it makes a lot of sense. Sometimes he just missed, speaks and tylee back a few months ago and he advocated bringing in Syrian refugees and within 24 hours completely reversed his position. So it's partly that, but geo politically from a geopolitical standpoint is better than anyone else. And definitely Hilary Clinton. I mean they call it trump is laminate phobic. He's not the one who voted for a wall that killed a million Muslims. You know, he's not the one that supported regime change in Syria and Libya that led to this migrant crisis in the first place. Hillary Clinton did. He's not the one who's amping up for world war three with Russia as every other single gop candidate has during the debates. So if you want to talk, I mean there's all this rhetoric about, you know, trump, the world's going to explode the day trump gets into office because he's so crazy and out of control. If you actually look at his prior record and what he's advocating in terms of America's military role in the world, it's the most peaceful, definitely out of all the gop candidates and definitely over and above Hillary Clinton who voted for the Iraq war.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       You know, it's funny, I was at a very liberal progressive la party this weekend and people were freaking out over trump and I kept trying to say to them, guys, if you fear trump, if you're a liberal or a progressive or anyone on the left, you should fear Ted Cruz far more than you fear Donald trump. But I couldn't get people to quite understand why. And I'm, I'm sort of amazed by that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       Well, it's because they don't read. I mean not.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       Hi Guys.

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       They don't read beyond headlines. And if you actually listened to trump speeches, which he rambles on for an hour or so, but if you actually listened to most of them, most of his speeches, a devoted to things like trade deals, I mean this is why people are voting for him. It's the reaction to the lost jobs, to the ruined towns in middle America because of Nafta, because of these trade deals that have screwed them over. If you map his supporters, it correlates almost directly with the industrial, the industrialization and despair. These areas of America that have been completely abandoned, completely left to rot by these trade deals that have resulted in the great sucking sound of these jobs leaving America. So watch his speeches. They are liberal. A progressive will never watch his speeches. It's not mainly about building a wall. It's not mainly about banning Muslims. It's mainly about trade. And that's why he has a lot of support amongst blue collar workers because people's jobs have been shipped abroad and they're furious about it. And that's mainly a left wing position to be complaining about. Life has been in the past. So That's interesting that most liberals just aren't aware of the main body of his actual speech and why people are attracted to his campaign.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       Well that's like when you know, they'll tweet out, they'll say, oh look, trump ties are made in Mexico. And they say, oh, what a hypocrite he is. But that doesn't improve. He's a hypocrite. That shows he's a good businessman. He's used are shitty trade deals that our politicians have signed to make money here and he's saying I will change those deals. So people like me won't have to do that somehow. That's lost on all my liberal friends. No matter how many times I bring that up.

Speaker 2:          00:26:55       Exactly. And also what's lost, if you look at the lines of people going into these trump events, which again, we've had reports in Wisconsin this week, you know, a lot of Asian Americans, quite a few black people in fight back when Rubio was in the rice, trump had more than double the support for Muslim Americans than every other gop candidate combined. He set to break records for black votes to support for a Republican candidate. So again, this narrative that it's just about bigotry and racism is just surface crap. You delve a little bit below and you have to understand the wider phenomenon, why he has this support. This is our complete political revolution. This is about an overthrow of the status quo. Americans are sick of it. And now finally that putting that vote behind it, whether it be for trump or sanders.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       Yeah. So let's move away from trump a little bit. I want to back up to something you said about Hillary. So Hillary in your eyes, uh, because of obviously all the connections between her husband and the establishment connections that she's been involved in this forever from being a first lady to a senator and secretary of state and all that. She's absolutely who the establishment wants. Right? Do you see any wiggle room on that?

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Oh No. Why the establishment behind Hillary? 100 percent. I mean, I went to build a Burg in a, it was Denmark in 2014, Austria. Two thousand and 50. And even back then we got the inside leak from the Bilderberg group meeting, which is this conference at 120 influential bankers, politicians, academics, and even back then they had come together and said, Hillary's, I pick for 2016, we're going to try and defund all her competition. So years back, Hillary was there, pick, I mean, in 2008, she took the fall for Obama and that was decided. It's a meeting in chantilly, coincidentally, the same location where the Bilderberg meeting was taking place back in 2018. So yeah, Hillary's been a shoe in for a long time now for the elite.

Speaker 1:          00:28:58       So where does this put sanders in your mind? Because look, he wants a lot of the changes, you know, ironically, sanders and trump are talking about a lot of the same stuff, right? They both want to severely changed the power structure, changed the system, yet their supporters seemed to absolutely hate each other. Um, so I suspect you agree with some of the heart of sanders, just not the policy.

Speaker 2:          00:29:22       I can't bring myself to agree with somebody who says that bread lines aren't necessarily a bad thing. I mean, this idea that Bernie Sanders supporters, if he loses to Hillary, which looks like it's almost certainly going to happen and then going to go and vote for trump because he's the other antiestablishment option, I just don't buy that because for the very reason you just said they absolutely hated each other. I don't think many of Bernie Sanders supporters a rarely jive with his antiestablishment credit. I think they jive more with this extreme left wing social justice warrior, pro socialist pro, massive welfare state position, which I can't bring myself to agree with, but just from the behavior of his supporters over the past couple of months has really turned me off to anything that Bernie Sanders stands for. Unfortunately.

Speaker 1:          00:30:15       You know, it's really interesting. I don't know that I've ever felt this way about a candidate and I don't even know that I could have made this up, but I like him more than I liked the reasons that people are supporting him. I think, and this is what I was telling Milo Yiannopoulos a couple of weeks ago, I think he himself is a decent guy, whether I disagree with him or not, but the underpinnings of what he's bringing I think are really dangerous and that's what I fear and that's a strange place to feel about a candidate when you like them, but you don't like what they're sort of bringing along with them. I don't know that I've ever felt that way before about somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       Well, no, and it's the same reason that the trump phenomenon has happened. I mean, he's not, you can't control it. He's a maverick. He's unpredictable. They wouldn't be able to buy him off. So whatever his policies, which I fundamentally disagree with, you still represents a threats of the establishment because he's an unknown quantity. So I mean that's, that's why sanders has paralleled the trump phenomenon, but you know, as the way it looks now, he's basically no chance. So it remains to be seen what's going to happen to his voters, but I very much doubt they're going to go over to trump in the kind of numbers that people are suggesting.

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       Right. So with the sanders people, my sense is that a lot of them really want to just burn the system down and that's sort of why I can't get behind them because yeah, we have a lot of problems in America. We've done bad things internationally. There's too much money in politics. We need a fair economic system or all kinds of stuff that I can get on board with the ideas of what he says. But there's still something pretty good here in America and I think we forget that as Americans. And that's what I fear is that these people want to actually burn the system down and I'm afraid if you burn it down, what rises out of those ashes is not gonna be any better or at least the chances of it being any better or not. Very good.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       Well, when his support as a carrying around hammer and sickle communist flags and talking about a socialist revolution, I mean that gives me the jitters. I mean you can look at sanders personally, you know, he didn't have a job until he was 40 years old. He was basically a mom living on the flaws of other people's palms. So it's personal lifestyle kind of turns me off towards him as well. But as you said, the kind of things, his support as advocate or in many cases a lot worse than what he's advocating. So they want to tear the system down, but they basically want to replace it with outright communism. A lot of them, and again, it goes back to this, you know, resist capitalism. Hashtag that was on twitter a couple of months ago. These people are, you know, they're probably aged 20 to 30. They've got no idea whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          00:33:01       The absolute horror that communism has role on the world over the last 50, 60 years. And we keep having to, you know, have that debate over and over again of why communism is bad and why leaving people to their own devices and building a free market economy is good because there's this fundamental ignorance surrounding capitalism. People think that the system of capitalism we've got now is free market capitalism. It isn't, it's corporatism crony capitalism, but they think that that's free market capitalism, which is why they go to the extreme other end of the equation and think that communism is the solution. When history has proven that it's not, we keep having to recycle that argument over and over again because a lot of these millennials just don't know the history,

Speaker 1:          00:33:49       right? So instead of detangling some of the crony capitalism and some of the Wall Street money and all that stuff, which he talks about, which is extremely legit, they go, we're going to burn the whole thing down. We're going to become communists, which is crazy. All right, so a lot of the Bernie support is obviously a mixed with the black lives matter support. And, you know, one of the things I've been saying about the black lives matter movement is their intentions are good and somehow what's happened to the movement seems to have been hijacked or derailed by, I think, what you would call far leftists. Um, do you agree with that or do you think the movement was always that way? Where do you see it now? Where do you see it going?

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       Well, I mean, back in 2013, 2014, myself and Info wars were on the forefront of exposing police brutality. I mean probably 25 percent of my content every day was about police brutality. Now that, that whole narrative has been hijacked by black lives matter. It makes you less enthusiastic to actually talk about police brutality, the effect that they've had. And the polls show this is massive support for police departments across the United States because the tactics that they engage in a so divisive and turn ordinary Americans off to such a degree that now a lot of people simply would immediately support the police even in a flagrant case of police brutality. So you know, yeah, you have to go back to the founding of black lives matter, obviously a lot of well meaning people jumped on board in the first six months or so, but the inspiration behind black lives matter, and this is the woman that the three female founders of that embryonic group said was their inspiration, was a woman named the softer Chicago.

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       Now she's on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list because she killed a cop in New Jersey back in the seventies and then fled to Cuba. This is a woman who's, you know, black lives matter activists. They invoke her name at nearly every rally. She's a domestic terrorist who left the Black Panther party because it wasn't violent enough. She joined the Black Liberation Army. You know, this was another domestic terror group that was involved in bombings and assassinations, killing police officers. So when you have that kind of guru, that inspiration behind the movement, obviously it's going to tend towards violence. You had black lives matter protesters in New York walking down the street chanting, what do we want? Dead Cops. When do we want them? Now? That's the only going to turn people away from your movement. So it's not an inclusive movement. It's been a divisive movement since almost the beginning since just after the first ferguson protests and it's only got worse as it's been hijacked by all these opportunists and operatives.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       Yeah. So for you, as you said, you guys were ahead on this stuff and I remember seeing a lot of videos that you guys were doing where you were talking about police brutality before it had really bubbled up into the mainstream news, so it must be extremely depressing for you as someone that is in this and you talk about this, you understand that there was something good here and as you just laid out that it has been derailed. How do you, how do you get it back to that is, is it too late? Is the. Is the wave already gone to to get it back to what was right? Dealing with legit issues about police brutality?

Speaker 2:          00:37:19       Well, when the entire movement Blm was founded on this Michael Brown case, the whole hands up don't shoot mess and the media pedaled that for six months or more, the autopsy, of course it turned out that was complete bs. He never had his hands are, so they base all their grievances on these completely fraudulent cases and then you have a case like Eric Garner, which was a, you know, a legitimate acts of police brutality, which we support the victim in that case, but they tend to base all their grievances on these ridiculous cases that are obviously justified use of force by the police. So it's difficult to see how we're going to get back to, uh, a rational conversation about it when these people are, you know, invoking the inspiration, the guru or the domestic terrorists, they're chanting for dead cops. You know, you had people planned to bomb the Ferguson police station.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       You had the cops that were killed in New York as part of a black lives matter, revenge attack by Ishmael Brinsley. So when it attracts those kinds of extremists, I mean at this point, I call it a domestic hate group, if this was a bunch of why Oregon militia members who were chanting for black cops to killed black people to be killed, who some of them were actually planning to do that and who's ideological inspiration was? Timothy Mcveigh for example, the media wouldn't get behind that, but we've seen elements of the media get behind black lives matter. We've seen, you know, Time magazine, Time magazine in defense of rioting. So they built this whole grievance industry. It was supported by some elements of the this media and now you've got Hillary Clinton meeting with black lives, meet a is back a few months ago saying she's prepared to change laws for them. I think this is very divisive destructive movement and it's de-legitimized genuine opposition to police brutality, which was an su and continues to be an Su, but now people are so turned off towards that. As I said, the polls show that people don't like black lives matter. They're now more likely to support police.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       Yeah. You know, a perfect example of that would be sort of what you alluded to, which is what happened in Oregon here, what two months ago when you know the cliven Bundy people, they took over basically a vacant lot house office and everyone I saw, all my progressive friends were screaming about what terrorists they are domestic terrorists. I'm not defending them. They walked into a federal building. Even if nobody was there in the door, was unlocked with weapons and I think maybe one person did die somehow related to it or something that. You could correct me if I'm wrong on that, but there was such outrage over that where there was virtually no violence. I'm not defending everything that they did versus the lack of outrage when there's actual violence. So everything comes down to race at the end of the day with the progresses. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       Well, yeah, that was a. That was a young guy hold up there in the, in the wildlife center, right at the end of that situation who was threatening to kill himself and it was being broadcast live on the Internet. It was [inaudible]. It was a tragic situation, but on twitter you had all the regressive, celebrating it, calling him a racist and saying you should shoot himself in the head. You hadn't Lavoy finicum who was in the vehicle with a couple of these other protests as females traveling through. They say FBI roadblock. He gets out of the car, he gets gunned down. God knows two dozen times or whatever. That was a shady situation, but again, as you said, a complete lack of outrage. They filled the car with bullets. It's a. it's a surprise that these are the women who were unarmed and we're not showing any resistance, didn't get slaughtered themselves, but on the left there was no outrage whatsoever because they weren't black. I think we should treat everybody who's a victim of police brutality the same regardless of race, but because they don't do that, it turns white middle class America away from their movement and it prevents us from becoming truly united and addressing police brutality.

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       Yeah, I mean that's it right there. There are unintended consequences of what they do actually drive drive people the other way. What would you say to. I have progressive friends, most of them, well, most of them are talk to me anymore, but I had progressive friends that when we, when we discuss this stuff, they would say, well, a certain amount of violence. If you really want social change, a certain amount of violence is necessary. Do you buy that at all or do you think that's just an excuse because look, you're not going to get headlines If, if there isn't a certain amount of violence, right? If you just have a peaceful protest, the media doesn't show up.

Speaker 2:          00:42:02       Well, I believe in nonviolent civil disobedience. I mean, if you look at everyone throughout history who actually change society, if you look at it, you know Gandhi or Martin Luther King, who now the progressives are trying to disavow because he wasn't inclusive of transgender people, then you don't need the results of violence because that causes powerful enough. When people become a threat to the establishment. When the united black people, when are unite white people, when they unite people from different political persuasions, they don't become a threat when they results of violence because they can be easily demonized, dealt with by the state. So no, I don't think that's a terrible idea. I think it's going to be unsuccessful.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       Yeah. And it's also directly linked into why these regressives and now we can get into the regressives. Somehow we did 45 minutes. We barely said the word progressive, uh, why they label everyone you me, everybody else as bigots and racists and everything else because they are, they can't control people without splitting us all down into the little racial markers or you know, this one's oppressed more than the know the, as somebody keeps saying the, uh, the oppression Olympics basically. So let's talk about the regressives. Was your wake up to them at the exact same time as you sort of woke up to the social justice warrior stuff? Or did it come a little bit after that? When you really saw that there was this group of people that was, was protecting and pushing this ideology?

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       Well, it probably correlates with the rise of Isis with these terrorist attacks in Europe with the migrant crisis and the fight that we're importing people from bad cultures and I mean that's the heart of regressive. You itself proclaimed liberals who defend and tolerate non liberal ideologies and I think because at their heart, their cultural relativist, right? They believe that all cultures are equal. Well, I don't believe that. I think there are bad cultures and good cultures. I made a video a few days ago. Some cultures are better than others, but at the heart of progressivism is this idea of utopianism, so there can't be such a thing as a bad culture accepting the fact that there are bad cultures, demolishes, utopianism, so that's why progressive so cold progressive's column entertain the fact that there are bad cultures. Even for a second, even though that blatantly off. I mean, you know, when US troops blew the whistle on how Afghan police officers, we're bringing young boys onto the army base and raping them and they were told to shut up about it because that was part of their culture.

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       I think that's a bad culture. You know when UNICEF has to do pr campaigns to educate 600 million Indians, half of their population, not to deprecate in the street because it's causing deadly infections and child malnutrition. That's a bad culture. We need to call out bad cultures because I don't think importing them into the West is compatible with western ideals of, you know, liberal tolerance, but the regressives can't entertain that for a second because their cultural relativists they can't entertain the notion that some cultures are better than others, which is why in Germany for example, these migrants that came in and started deprecating and hot tubs, started masturbating in swimming pools, started raping children in swimming pools. One of the swimming pools in Germany responded by banning male migrants. How did the regressive left respond to that? They complain. They said it was racist. They intimidated. They forced the swimming pool into lifting the ban because again, they can't entertain the notion that some cultures are worse than others and that's the heart of regressives. It's this utopian idea that everybody's the same and everybody's equal. Even though this is bad behavior that we shouldn't be accepting and embracing in the west.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       Yeah, and there's really no end to it. Right. That's why this snake will eventually eat its tail because, you know, if you look what happened in Germany, uh, you know, right on New Year's with, with all the rapes and all the sexual attacks on women, suddenly all the regressives we're defending basically the perpetrators, they kept saying not all Muslims, all this stuff. Nobody was saying all Muslims. People were saying the specific people here who did this, they have these set of values. They're the ones that did it. That's what a rational person would say. We didn't say this is condemning every single person that believes in this and yet they go to defend that. So they throw women under the bus. So it's like they have their pecking order and in this case women came below the migrants because the migrants are mostly Muslim.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       Yeah. That whole oppression, Olympics idea. And when it came out in Cologne, it later emerged that most of the perpetrators were not newly arrived refugees. They were migrants who had been there for several years and they're aggressive. Celebrates.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:17       How dare you demonize the refugees. This was done by migrants. Okay. So migrants who were supposedly assimilated, they've been there for years and yet this is the kind of behavior they're engaging in and that's something to celebrate. I mean, that's again, that shines light on the heart, progressivism, and as he said, you know, after every single terror attack, we hear the same thing again and again, don't blame Islam. Not all Muslims are terrorists. Nobody ever suggested that. That's never been part of the debate. They try and frame the debate so it becomes that because they can't win when you actually drill down, you know, into the statistics and show that this isn't a tiny minority of people. This is what I bang on about again and again, you know, I make videos saying Islam is not religion of peace. Get death threats as a result of it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:11       I guess to prove that it isn't a religion of peace, but I mean you can look at the statistics. This is not a tiny minority of people. This is a problem within Islam. This is why we need to support the voices of reform within Islam. So Pew had a poll, for example, the percentage of Muslims who think that suicide bombings are justified under some circumstances. They asked Muslims in European countries, so in France, 31 percent of adult Muslims over the age of 30. You think that suicide bombings or sometimes justify, if you look at young people aged 18 to 29, that goes up to 42 percent think that suicide bombings or sometimes justify, and it's similar in Spain, 22 percent of adults think the same. Germany, 10 percent and 22 percent of those aged 18 to 29 think that suicide bombings or justify. You've also got huge numbers of Muslims throughout your trip. In France for example, 27 percent of Muslims aged 18 to 24 support isis. So again, this is not a tiny fringe minority of people. Twenty one percent of Syrian support Isis. These are the people who were bringing in. So it's this lie that the Islamophobia industry upholds the. It's just a, you know, a tiny fringe minority. It isn't. And the facts, the stats prove that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       Yeah. What do you think of the Word Islamophobia? I assume you're not a fan of the word itself. I think it's. It's an imaginary world. You can't fear a set of ideas. You can fear actions that people might do, and Islam itself says a lot of bad things about infidel is like a the two of us. Right? So it's not an irrational fear to fear this set of ideas. It's just, this is just a made up word, right? That doesn't discount that there might be bigotry towards Muslim people, but the word itself is a slippery slope. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:04       Well, it's become interchangeable with racist, doesn't it? I mean, at this point, the Islamophobia industry is bolstered and exaggerate it to such an extent. I mean, there are Islamophobic attacks and they're horrible and we shouldn't cry them, but it's presented.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       Those are anti Muslim attacks, right? Not, not Islamophobic attacks. Right. They're not afraid of the idea of something they're. They're afraid of the people. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       Yeah. That was. That was a basically racist attacks. But if you look at actual hate crimes that far outweighed by antisemitic attacks, for example, in in most western countries. So I think that's exaggerated. We saw that again in molenbeek just the other day where the media reported that a right wing protests had run over. A Muslim woman later turned out that it was a Muslim teen from molenbeek who ran over the Muslim woman. So there are these, these fake Islamophobic attacks. It was another one on Wall Street where a Muslim woman says she was slashed across the face. Then Islamophobic attacks turned out. It was completely made of. So again, you know this point, why not own it? Why not say yes? I'm afraid of an ideology that supports Sharia law, that supports stoning women to death, executing homosexuals killing people who leave the faith of Islam. Yes, I'm very afraid of importing those kinds of ideas into the west and when, for example, 50 percent of Muslims of American Muslims support the right to live under Sharia law in the United States. That's a problem. And I'm going to call attention to that figure because it's, it's way too high. And to call attention to that figure is not to be Islamophobic, it's to be rightly concerned about these intolerant beliefs being imported into the west as they now are in such great numbers.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       So for people like us that want to have honest discussions about this without bigotry and without hyperbole, and I know it's very hard to do and we don't win any points for doing this really, but for people like us and I know it's a growing movement, should we start thinking of Islam more as a political ideology than a religion? Because people, no matter how many times we separate ideas versus people religion first people, people can't seem to do it. They just. There's a certain amount of people, they cannot detangle these two things. But I'm starting to think that if we start describing these actions as political actions, killing gays, not good. You know what I mean? A oppressing women not good. If these were political, a political party was pushing these ideas, the left would be completely against it. So is that sort of how we have to. Not to give up our tactics publicly right now, but is that how we have to start focusing on this argument?

Speaker 2:          00:52:51       I think it is exactly. I mean, you know, Sam Harris Majeed was dave outline the fact that this is not just jihad is the problem, isn't just jihadist. Yes, you can point to that and say that's a tiny minority, but the main problem is Islam is, you know, I agreed with Obama when he said terrorism is not an existential threat. I mean we're not going to all be killed by terrorists is not going to be such a massive, you know, onset of terrorist attacks that it proves an existential threat. But when you import these ideas that are incompatible with western, then that's a direct why quality of life, our culture and the entire underpinnings of Western society as a free liberal tolerant society. So we have to emphasize that distinction that there are not just jihadist Islam Miss. I mean look at deadline there in molenbeek and Brussels.

Speaker 2:          00:53:46       He was protected for months after the Paris massacre by his friends and neighbors. Okay. Then not jihadists. They haven't gone out and slaughtered anybody, but they were protecting a jihadist because there is limits and this is, this is the problem when we get huge numbers of people moving into Western societies, they create these ghettos, they create centers of power and then isis comes out and its manifesto and says, we're going to encourage the creation of these ghettos in the west to radicalize these populations to support our cause. Then that's a problem. I mean, you can get an AK 47 on the streets and Malombe within a few hours for 400 euros. That's doesn't just arise out jihadists. That's this whole is support network that protects Solo Abdeslam for example. So that's the distinction we need to emphasize to leftists and regressives. Again, it's not a tiny minority. We have to include Islamis as part of the problem and if you include them as part of the problem, the figures show that it's a distressing proportion of people who support, advocate and promote these intolerant believers.

Speaker 1:          00:55:00       Yeah, and I know no matter how many times we repeat the difference between jihadists and Islamists and the average nominal Muslim somehow that just can't get through to a certain amount of people. But before I let you go, I want to dive into the immigration thing a little deeper because you've done a lot on it and when I've watched some of your videos, you know, we really, in the mainstream media in the United States, we barely talk about it. I would guess that if you watch CNN 24 hours today, um, that you wouldn't see one story on it, literally not one minute on it. Um, and then I watch your videos and some other people and I will watch some stuff on the BBC or something like that and I get a sense that it's a big problem and I get tons of messages. Mainly I'm getting a ton of stuff from Sweden especially talking about this. Would you say out of a 10 where, where is this thing hat right now? I mean, is this really as bad as the videos that you put out? It makes it sound like there's a massive crisis right now, or is some of it overblown? Is it different for every country? I'm still struggling to get a hold on it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:58       Well, it's different for every country. That tends to be a tipping point. When a country goes above, for example, six to seven percent Muslim population, that's when you get the no go areas, which the media still claims is a conspiracy theory. I got chased out of one in molenbeek. I can attest to the fact that it's not. So that's the kind of tipping point. I mean to illustrate this, you can look at the prison in these different European countries. So for example, Belgium, which of course just stuff that the Brussels attack, the Muslim population is around six percent, but the prison population of Belgium comprises 45 percent Muslims. The 45 percent of the prisoners in Belgium. A Muslims, despite the fact they only make up six percent of the population. You look at friends, six to 10 percent Muslim population, but the prison population is 70 percent Muslims.

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       Same in Spain. Muslim population, three point seven percent. Prison population is 70 percent Muslim, so obviously something is broken here and we were getting the correct word, seeing the creation of more of these ghettos, they don't assimilate for our political leaders want to bring them in for their own agenda, which is the goal of imposing huge numbers of people from the third world to vote for bigger government. If you look at polls conducted amongst Muslims, they typically support expanded welfare state and they vote once they become citizens for bigger government, so they've placed Europe security. They placed our entire social cohesion under grave danger in favor of. Of advancing this political agenda. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       Do you think it was that in the case of like Angola Merkel, do you think it was that calculated like I. my sense is that there was some level of guilt because of the Holocaust and Germany's stills trying to deal with that, that they partly we're trying to do something good here. They brought this. I think it's one point two or one point 3 million people in and that it is just crushing the system and creating all this resentment and a country that has, has a tough history with xenophobia. It's only gonna get worse and it's hard to believe, uh, that she knowingly did this even if it was just to get votes, which it's not working right, because it didn't, some of the right parties just win elections.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       No, not. It was a reaction to that. I mean, for the past couple of years you've had a basically a conservative backlash sweeping Europe, the, your elections in 2014 proof of that. So it was a backlash to that. Now of course, 500,000 migrants who have come into Germany haven't registered with all authorities, so that's going to become a massive problem. But yeah, a lot of it was virtue signaling on steroids. Right. So you had, you know, the German Green Party politician, Stephanie, Yvonne Berg, she got up in front of the German parliament and said, Whoa, ass city will change radically. I hold it in 20, 30 years. They will no longer be a German majority in our city and that's a good thing. So she said that simply as a way of pissing off the right wing in Germany, they would bring in these migrants to displace the German population. So it, part of it is virtue on steroids.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Part of it is that guilt about the Nazis, which of course we have to remember only a minority of the German population actually supported the Nazi party in the 19 thirties. So I would argue that, why would you punish, you know, German citizens, taxpayers now we've got Germans being kicked out of social housing to be replaced by migrants over one point, 2 million migrants brought in already over the past year. And again, politicians celebrating the demographics, suicide of their country and it clearly isn't working because every single day we have these cases of people being raped now, the primary victims of rape of Muslim women and girls in these moment, migrant camps. But now you see these reports of, you know, African migrants raping boys in swimming pools. And quite frankly, I'm sick of seeing it every single day. This is a bad culture. These people aren't being assimilated. If you import huge numbers of people at break neck speed with no clear plan on how to assimilate them, there's going to be bedlam, there's going to be chaos and that's now why top military chiefs in Sweden and Switzerland in Norway or warning that this could lead to civil unrest, an outright war. Basically if it. If it continues this way.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Yeah man, I wanted to end with you on a positive note. Can we figure out how to do that? Whereas Europe going to be in 10 years, any hope?

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       Well, as I said, I mean a lot of these parties are being voted out of power and that's been happening for the past couple of years. So there is a kind of backlash against it. You know, I'm all for limited skilled immigration. I don't think that's healthy for a society, but the way it's going, you know, 300,000 immigrants every year coming into the United Kingdom. We've only got a population of $60 million and that's after the. That's the number after the other ones have left. So it's going to become overwhelming, it's going to cause more problems, more riots, but from a positive perspective, you know my videos, your videos about this or reaching a huge audience because the media continually lies about it. They don't point out that 72 percent of the people coming in and man, these are generally not families. Four fifths of them at one point weren't even Syrians, but the fact that I can do a video about this and it gets over a million views, proves that people are thirsty for the truth and we are shaping the narrative and eventually the hope is that that will change government policy by sheer force of pressure.

Speaker 1:          01:02:00       All right, well listen, that's exactly why I try to have these conversations and that's why I liked the work you do and you know what? Here's what we'll do for anyone that's watching this that thinks that anything that Paul said was conspiratorial or unfactual, tag me on twitter with them and we'll talk some of this stuff out. Will you make that commitment? We'll talk some this stuff out with a couple of the people. Not Everybody I'll do it. You'll do it all right, so it's at prison planet on twitter and he's doing all these videos on youtube and I thank you guys for watching and Paul, you stayed up late for me so I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, man.
