Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Alright everybody, I'm doing something a little different with the direct message this week. I'm actually in the suburbs of DC at the moment. You can probably hear the Cicadas in the background. Uh, I wanted to do a direct message about the RNC and everything that's going on in Cleveland right now. But then last night you all have heard this already. Milo Yiannopoulos was officially banned for all time for the rest of human existence. He was banned on twitter. You know, he had lost his blue verification check a back A. Obviously Milo and I, we become sort of comrades were friends. Uh, we don't agree on everything. I've brought him on the show twice and we've done a couple of other things where we've had a healthy exchange of ideas. We've gone to ucla together where we were protesting for exercising our right to free speech. I've gone out of my way to show some of the differences that I have with Milo, for example.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       I always make the distinction between the doctrine of Islam and the various people that are of Muslim faith who practice their faith completely differently. Some totally nominally and some that are violent jihadists. All of the different things that are in there right now. Milo was banned from twitter and there is a free speech issue here and as you guys know, I'm all about free speech and the free exchange of ideas. So first off, this is not a first amendment issue. The First Amendment of the United States means the government can come through your for, for your free speech. I've said many times before at the moment in 2016 in America, I'm not that afraid that the government's coming from my free speech. I think we're taking it from ourselves and I think this is a good example of it. You know, twitter and facebook and snapchat and the rest of these things, they become almost too powerful in their ability to control speech because these are now the roadways, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       These are the super highways for us to communicate with each other beyond our ability to pick up the phone and call a friend and talk to people on the street and scream from town square. Our ability to communicate with literally thousands and thousands and in Myeloma case hundreds of thousands if not millions of people on these platforms. It's hugely powerful and there is something that's happening right now where it's not necessary about the government, but it's about companies now. Look, they have, they're a private company. They're publicly traded reit, but they, they are allowed to instill their own terms of service, which they did. And if they say he violated them, then yes, they can ban him. So I'm not saying twitter can't do what they did. I'm not saying the government is involved in this in any way. I'm just talking about the principles of the free exchange of ideas and free speech.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       These things are under threat right now. Look, obviously, look, forget the nitty gritty details of what happened in the last day or so. I'm not even fully aware of what happened and there's a lot of tweets. I can't follow everybody's tweets every second to see exactly what happened. Um, but the point is that Milo is a provocateur. He intentionally shit posts and gets people riled up and look, some people respond to that. And some people will respond to us something a little more nuanced, right, like might do and get into an idea a little bit differently. But the point is, you know, on twitter there are all kinds of Nazis. Look, look at the responses that Ben Shapiro Milo, who has fought with Ben Shapiro all the time and I was trying to moderate a debate with them. I hope it's still gonna happen. Ben Shapiro, who was an orthodox Jew post anything on twitter, he gets a zillion Nazis photoshopping his head in ovens and horrific picked, put picturing him in Auschwitz.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       All kinds of horrible stuff. Muslim people get all kinds of horrible imagery shown to them. Gay People, people young. I get fag and Jus bag and rob about all the time. My book, this is, they're exercising their free speech if these people are not calling directly for violence or acted on violence. As far as I know, Milo has never called to harm anybody. He's never directly called for violence in any way. He's a provocateur, sharing his thoughts. Uh, and we have to understand the difference between words and actions, right? Like just somebody sitting in their basement sharing a Nazi meme and Milo saying this or that. Even if it's directed at a person saying, well, I don't like what you're doing to the girl, the girl in ghostbusters, or I didn't like the movie or whatever it is, and then he can't control whether his people say mean things to her, but that's what the mute button for and that's what the block buttons for the point is.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       We have to figure out how to have a healthy exchange of ideas and realize that not everything that that happens. I met online world is transferred directly into the real world. If real people started using. If people start, if a Nazi party appeared and said, started saying we're going to kill all the Jews were going to kill all Muslims, all of this stuff. Then you have a problem, a direct call for violence, but right now that's not where we're at. And there's an issue here. So there's a couple issues here, but to me the primary issue is the power that these social media companies have and we can't pretend that they don't have a political agenda, right? These are all pretty left organization, so of course they're really not going to like a guy like my look because it's easy always to attach style, attack, stodgy old conservatives and Republicans.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Milo represents something different. He's young and cool and gay and British and blonde and has this huge groundswell of support. By the way, it's his support is from conservatives and liberals and all sorts of other things. I know that because when I went to Ucla with him, I had liberals in the audience, kids college, kids from Ucla saying that they don't agree with anything he says, but they were there to defend his right to free speech. So that strikes me a little bit of a what Obiwan said to Darth Vader, if you strike me down, I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine by striking him down here and banning him from twitter. They're probably making this movement that much stronger. Anyway, it's. It's complex and there's a lot of things here. I would love to talk to someone from facebook about this because they band a couple of people just in the last week they banned my friend Feisal and my friend Melissa, both who'd been on the show, there'll be reinstated sense.

Speaker 1:          00:05:53       I would love to talk to Jack from twitter. I'd love to talk to any of these tech people. So they're welcome to come on the show. Uh, I'm not trying to inflame anything any further. I, I genuinely want to have this conversation. Uh, and by the way right now you can go on twitter and you can check Ayatollah Khomeini, his twitter account. He regularly calls for another Holocaust. You can see what's going on with the president of Turkey, who right now in the midst of literally just just assembling democracy there and arresting protestors and sacking judges and not letting people leave the country because they have no problem with him being on there. So there's just, there's an inconsistency in the way they apply these rules. It's just a lot of stuff here. But let's try to have a mature discussion about it. And my guest this week, uh, so as I said, we normally do this from the studio in Los Angeles.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       I'm in DC right now. My guest this week is Michael Ian, black comedian, actor, writer, great guy. He is a big in fighting you controls and we have a really interesting discussion about fighting trolls and twitter Nazis. We talk about Milo now. We shot this last week, so everything that you're going to see a is not about what happened, uh, yesterday and today we shot it last week, but it's a great discussion about these very issues. So the timing is perfect, uh, and I appreciate it and I'll be back in studio soon enough. And as always, thank you guys for your support. Here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:07:11       My guest this week is a comedian and author, an actor and a twitter Nazi hunter. Michael Ian Black. Welcome to the show. Thank you. Which one of those would you say you mostly are? Is it twitter, Nazi hunter, or comedian? Probably twitter. Nazi hunter, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       yeah, because I'm not particularly funny these days on twitter. I'm just annoying you are fighting the Nazis constantly on twitter. And my policy with the Nazis is, congratulations, you guys came up with a meme and you're alone in your basement, but you liked engaging these people or I don't know if you'd like it, I don't want to put words in it, but you do engage with these people. I think it's,

Speaker 4:          00:07:53       uh, I think it's valuable and important to engage these people. Yeah. Because I think it's worth to the larger public knowing that they're out there knowing that there is this a sub subculture. I don't even know how large it is. I'm assuming it's very small. It's like sub so, but they are very vocal and uh, my sense is there are

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       uh,

Speaker 4:          00:08:20       more sympathizers than a actual participants and so I feel sort of duty bound to hold to hold them up as idiots so that, those who may be inclined to sympathize though. Oh wait, they're idiots.

Speaker 2:          00:08:35       Yeah, they're always anonymous too. Are you ever finding a Nazi that's like, hi, I'm a Nazi, you know, this is my real picture

Speaker 4:          00:08:41       new. It's always, uh, it's always either some pre pubescent Japanese anime Avatar or some repurposed like Hitler Youth Avatar. Right. What do you make of the Japanese

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       anime thing with related to that, because I don't think there's any connections between Japanese and there. No, not between a Japanese anime and Hitler, but there's absolutely some kind of connection between, uh, those who would move towards that ideology and fetishizing pre pubescent Japanese girls. There's actually a connection there and I'll leave it to brighter minds than mine to try to tie those two things together. But that absolutely exists. You're just exposing them and now it's for the social scientists that's trying to figure out that you. Are you ever afraid that sometimes that by fighting with them that it's almost like elevating their relevance because that's a little bit of not fighting with them, but by exposing them and arguing, there's absolutely a case to be made for that. And uh, but I think it's, I think it's more important from my point of view to show that they're there to just say, look, this is, this is who we're living among. And in the context of the current political climate, I think it's important to let people know that these people exist and that, uh

Speaker 6:          00:10:05       hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:10:06       Given the right circumstances, more of them could pop up. Yeah. Now I take it you're not against. You wouldn't be for banning them. Right? Like you're just, you're exposing them, but you wish you would let them do their job. What you do. That's, that's why we have a first amendment. Yeah. Alright, good. Um, so, and I don't report them. I don't do any of that shit. Yeah, I just, I, I just showed them. Yeah. So let's back up to the first thing you said, which is I used to be flooding. Is that what you said? I used to be funny, right? I am not. Yeah, just annoying. Yeah. So I feel that since I've been doing this, I mean I did stand up and 12, 12 years in New York and a couple years out here I used to be funny. I was, I mean I can get you some letters to show you later. I was funny at one time, but now I'm talking about all these serious stuff all the time and I like to try to pepper some comedy in there when I can. But there's, the world just feels particularly crazy right now, doesn't it? Which should be ideal for comedy, right? But I'm not, I'm not good at making light of things that I find deadly serious and I'm just not good at it. I mean there's, there's great political comedians out there and I'm not one of them. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:11:09       I can talk about my own life, I think in a funny way, but I can't. I mean there's, there's, there's people better able to talk about trump and be hilarious than me. So we'll get to trump in a second. So, um, you, I always think of you more so as or until the last year or so. I always thought it'd be more as like social commentary, all the bad stuff, all that stuff. And a lot of the movies you've been in seward, more like personal social commentary. Did you ever think you were going to be more in the political sphere? Because that's sort of where I put you now. Well, I mean, I don't, not that insert myself in the political sphere now. I mean the last thing the world needs is another jerk off community spouting off about politics. I don't, I don't aspire to be that person, but if I can set aside being a comedian and just be a citizen who's interested in this stuff, that's sort of how I view myself. I mean I. I definitely am not.

Speaker 5:          00:12:01       I'm not an activist. I'm not marching. I take no action. I do nothing other than I have this twitter platform and that's, that's how I express myself politically. You do tweet while flying first class because that's the first time we had any face to face interaction. I was going to go away in the back and you sort of dismissively wave as it was very. It was embarrassing for both of us as a first class. I've only flown first class once and it was on a little plane from Detroit to New York, so it was like eight people and I was first class was just that. I was in the first seat. It wasn't anything special, but as a first class, are you. Do you feel that we shouldn't be allowed to look at you? I always feel like when I'm walking through I shouldn't be allowed to learn misunderstanding part.

Speaker 5:          00:12:43       Maybe the main Julia first class which were seated first. Yeah, so that. So you, the people walking back are forced to look at us already ensconced in our blanket already ordering our beverage of choice. Maybe you're already asleep. Maybe getting massaged from the chair. Like there's all kinds of things that it's important for the business model of the airlines and for my own self esteem, they walking back to steroids that I have that you do not. That's interesting because I always thought they should be one way glass so that you could lock it us, but that we have no desire to see you. Yeah. You don't exist for me. Very much exist for you. Wow. You're thinking about those fuckers in first class while you're crammed in. Starting little seat stewing for the duration of your flight on that jet blue flight though. Jet Blue, let's you get your own soda.

Speaker 5:          00:13:34       You know you can go to like a thing and I was almost going to peek around the curtain and just like, oh, they would know. Or did you out? Yeah, and I know you would've called people and it would, it would've been, they would've landed us in Salt Lake City or something. It would've been, it would've been a disaster. I'm glad you didn't do that. I'm glad you had the foresight to know better than to do that. Can Get. You would have been escorted out immediately. Well, speaking of social, full pause. Let's move over to trump because you have written a children's book about trump. Yes. So you must love trump. I assume if you wrote a children's, everyone loved children's books and um, here's my problem. Despise trump wrote a book about trump, uh, a sort of

Speaker 6:          00:14:17       a

Speaker 5:          00:14:19       kind of a children's book, a parody of a children's book, but it was a children's book at the same time. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:14:25       so I am exploiting the trump brand as much as an actual trump and making money off the trump brand. So I don't know. So you're using it right? You're using a trumpy and tactics on trump. That's right, yeah. Where did the idea to make it a children's book come from? Uh, I was at a bookstore and I saw a book about Hillary Clinton as sort of a children's book, a rags to riches story about Hillary Clinton, and an inspirational tale started, I think at young girls, and it made me chuckle a bit to think about what that would be like if you were to write about trump because he's not an inspirational figure in any way, shape or form. He's just a toad. And so, uh, I, I just thought level, let me try to do that. So He's a toad. Is that why they're used? You know, that toad thing?

Speaker 5:          00:15:16       Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where did that come from? I Know Kiki or. Yeah. I don't know where there's a toad with trump hair, but there's a lot of toads. Yeah. On that, on that part of the Internet, they, what's with the Pto? I don't know. We don't know. We have no idea. I don't know. It took me long enough to figure out what the three parentheses meant. Wait, wait. So the two? No, it's three Jewish three. Yeah, it's, it's. Yeah. I see. Oh, because they came. There were some list or something that was exposed where they tried to expose people to something like that came later. The, the uh, the three parentheses is meant to indicate an echo, right? Uh, and it's like the Jewish Echo. I'm not sure quite what that means, but that's what the three parentheses are meant to indicate. Is that just that, like a nagging mother?

Speaker 5:          00:15:59       I don't think so. I think it's something worse. Oh, I think it's far worse than that. I'm a. and then there was an app that just identified Jews for you. Right? I don't know. It's insane. Yeah. So what do you make of just the general climate right now? Because to me, I've been off until this show and we did one more. We'd launched relaunched last week and uh, for the three weeks that I took off, so to speak, you can see the world not the world was. I was paying attention. I just didn't have a show to talk about it. And it seems like the world went even more crazy. Don't you think the last month seems like particularly nuts, you know, sort of starting probably with the pulse shooting and then, I mean, I wouldn't say I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm past the point of being surprised that anything is happening. Yeah, it all feels of a piece to me and I feel like I can kind of grasp the outlines of what that piece is, which is the larger story is sort of what, what is, what is fueling all of this. Um, and I think there's an, I look, I'm, I'm,

Speaker 5:          00:17:03       I'm not particularly savvy about this. I'm just regurgitating what I've read, but it really does feel like we're at a moment where the foundations of capitalism are, are crumpling and nobody knows what to do. So is that the scary part that nobody knows what to because I, I agree. It feels like something that there's a real shift happening right now and it's almost like we have no leaders when, where even if you love trump and if you have loved Clinton and Obama is on the way out, but even if you love him, that we don't have leaders who talk to us in an honest way and that that's part of the problem. Like we're all walking around like, could somebody,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       like, I feel like everyone's looking around. Somebody help here. Is there anyone we could look to for.

Speaker 4:          00:17:55       First of all, I don't think trump understands the problem better than the relative, the average citizen. Uh, he knows how to exploit it, but he'd, I don't think he understands it, but I agree with you that there is not, knows, sort of global leader has stepped forward in a articulate non condescending way to say this is what we're going through. Um, and here's where I think we need to move. It would be great if somebody would do that. I'd love for Hillary Clinton to spend an hour just talking into the camera and saying, this is where I think we are. This is why I think we're here. This is where I think we need to go in a very mature, not alarmist way. Are you a hillary supporter? I mean, I think I have the enthusiasm for Hillary that a lot of people have, which is.

Speaker 2:          00:18:44       Yeah, I could just picture the gift right there. I said, are you a hillary supporter the other way you got? Because that's what everyone does. No one's like, there's very, very. I know there's a couple, but everyone supporting hillary, my friends that had been democrats their whole life and family members. Are you supporting hillary?

Speaker 4:          00:18:58       Well, but there's good reason for that. It was easy to gin up that enthusiasm for Obama because as he himself said, he was a blank slate. Hillary has a 20 5:30 year record and it's very easy to cherry pick what you like and Cherry pick what you don't like and say she's a villain. Say she's a hero. She's a flawed human being as we all are, and we know what our flaws are. So it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's like getting back together with an old girlfriend or something. And you're like, no, I still love her. Right. You know, I know, I know it's going to be a pain in the ass. God Damn it. I still love her. Uh, that's Kinda what it's like.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       So is that a little. That's kind of dangerous thought though, because Obama came in with the blank slate and whether you like him or not, uh, the idea that we'd only be okay with blank slate. That's what sets the appeal of trump right now. Yeah. Um, even though his sleep actually is full of stuff again, whether you like it or not. Well it's full of political stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:20:01       So he, you know, one hand races, what the other hand wrote, he can be whatever you want him to be as long as he's a racist because that's ultimately what people want from him.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       So what do you make of the people? And I get this part, here's my part of trump that I do actually get, forget all the policies for a second, but I do get the part about, forget the policies because they were. Because they're all over the place. Right. And I've even had, I've had ardent trump supporters sit here like Milo Yiannopoulos, sit here and basically tell me it's not about the policies, it's about this one thing that I'm going to tell you and I at least get this part, which is that this is a cultural election this time, it has almost nothing to do with policy. But the one thing that he's getting with people, and I've seen this when I've been to colleges when liberals are coming up to me and saying this, that he's cracking this political correctness thing. Now. The irony of that is I don't think he's going to be some major free speech beacon because he talks about suing reporters all the time, but at that. But I do get the level of people are feeling very repressed right now. Like they can't say anything and they're always screamed at in called racist and all that stuff. But I don't think you're with me out of that. Not at all. Yeah. I think

Speaker 4:          00:21:10       when Milo talks about political correctness, that term political correctness has come to mean, I think in those circles, um, nativism, racism, xenophobia, and what have you, when you say he's cracked political correctness, what he's, what he's cracked is the, the agreement that we had been coming to as a society, and that agreement was, um, diversity is a benefit to the nation, and tolerance is a benefit to the nation, uh, and having different points of view is a benefit to the nation that has all gotten lumped into that agreement has gotten lumped under political correctness. And when he says he's cracked political correctness, what he's, what I think he means is he has, he's attempting to unravel that agreement. And what's left is white nationalism and nothing else. No, because trump's appeal is not policy based. He has none. It's not judgement based. He seems to have no better judgment than anybody else in possibly worse. It's not principle base. He has none. It's not character based. He has very little to none. All he has is on day one starting with Mexicans are rapists and whatever else. He said that's what he has and he's built on that from that spent his entire campaign has been a divisiveness and hatred geared towards angry white males.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       Yeah. Well, I love, I love hearing your answer on that because obviously I've, I love, I like Milo and I've given him a platform and you know, we work together and stuff. But the whole point of my show is that I want to hear that and I want to hear what you're saying. Well, and when I've watched your show, I've, I've watched him on it

Speaker 4:          00:23:22       and you know, I think he's a disgrace. I think he's an utter disgrace. I have a feeling you're going to hear from him on twitter. I very well might, but he's not verified. So, uh, I know, so at least it starts there and it feels very calculated and it feels very machiavellian to me and it feels very put on and it and it,

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       uh,

Speaker 5:          00:23:47       and he is allowing himself to be used,

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       I think, as a, a tool by a,

Speaker 5:          00:23:59       the intolerant. Right. And the fact that he's gay, for example, is, is, is, is, makes it all the more appalling to me, um, because he's giving them more license to say, well, we like this guy, you know, we like this crazy Brit, this crazy flaming red or whatever. Um, and that is,

Speaker 5:          00:24:25       I think it unconscionable use of moral licensing and that he's allowing himself to be used in that way and, and promoting himself in that way. Moral licensing. I like that. You just come up with that right there. That that's something somebody said that before I learned it from Malcolm Gladwell. Oh, okay. There you go. So a moralizing. So I guess part of this is that our system is just so broke that anyone that had a moral license or a moral compass, would you ever want to run for president? I mean, could you imagine as a, as a, as a smart person ever wanting to put yourself in politics at all? No. No. Yeah. Is that the bigger problem here that we're just getting, we're just getting what we've created, right?

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       Yeah. I mean, if you, if you have any,

Speaker 5:          00:25:13       if you've, if you've lived any kind of life, hemingway, for example, whoever those guys could not run for office or anybody who's lived a life that has any

Speaker 5:          00:25:28       human experience, right? So meaning you might have cheated on your wife, you might, if you might need some coke. Sure, yeah. He might've done any number of things that make us human, make us flawed human beings. You know, that stuff's going to come up. You know, you're going to be vilified. You know. So if you're thinking about running for office, somebody like Ted Cruz for example, who's been thinking about being president his entire fucking life, he's lived his life in such a way to make his resume the resume of a future president or at very least a senator. You're not exaggerating by the way. There's no video of him at like 16. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna be president. Yeah. Um, and so you live your life in a way that is calculatedly

Speaker 5:          00:26:12       unrelatable to the rest of the nation. You know, someone like Bill Clinton, who I think probably was running for president his whole life too, at least he, he wears his humanity on his sleeve. He's like, I'm, you know, I'm just a big goober. Yeah, and that's part of his appeal, but I can't imagine subjecting myself to the kind of public scrutiny that is required, knowing that there's people whose job is to dig up shit on you, just about your life. It has nothing to do with your ability to make good policy decisions. Yeah. What does it tell you that when a show. What was the show with Kevin Spacey? It's been blank, but how's the cards? I watch house of cards and I think, wow, there's a lot more reality in that then anything that I'm watching on CNN, meanwhile, all the CNN people are pretending to be themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:27:03       I hate that. By the way. Do you wait? Do you like that bugs me. Drives me fucking crazy. I wha. What movie was I watching just these past couple days ago I was watching one of the unjust, some superhero movie and it's like jake tapper shows every since it was dot who I like. I think it was Jacob. Like what? What movie was it? Superhero movies. Oh, Batman. Batman. Superman. I don't know if it was jake actually. Oh, it was Anderson Cooper in that when I was like, you guys are all pretending to be yourselves. Why can't we have alternate universes where there are also, we can have. Kryptonite will also have alternate news casters. Don't even hit journalist, but journalists don't show up in Batman. Right. But doesn't mad show it. It's like they all want to be stars. So when I say this, it's probably with some do irony to people that are public people and share our opinions, but it's like they all want to be in. Right? They go to the White House correspondence dinner. They all want to have dinner with these people and go to the parties and all that. That's to me, one of the biggest problems we have in the whole country. Well, the, the, the, the political starfucking I guess I don't really have a problem with it. I think

Speaker 5:          00:28:07       it doesn't, it doesn't upset me maybe the way that it upsets you because I do feel like, like in any profession, most people in any given profession are trying to do a good job. Um, so like when I see Anderson Cooper reporting on something, I feel like most of the time he's done pretty good job, you know, I think he's pretty good. Uh, Chuck Todd who I think can be a little supercilious, but I think he's trying to do a good job and I think he's doing. I think he, I think he approaches things the way he approaches them for very specific reason. It's thought it's thought it's thought out jake tapper the same way and you know, these guys will land punches that kind of meshing of

Speaker 5:          00:28:54       politicos and, and journalists. It doesn't really upset me because it seems like, well, if you're a journalist you want to have relationships with these people to get information. Yeah. I guess for me the bigger problem is that if you ask easy questions and look, I'm an interviewer, so if you ask any questions you're going to get them to come back. You know what I mean? So if I had Obama here one time and I knew this is the one time that maybe we'll set up the rest of our relationship, I don't think I would attack him in a way that I might the second time, but even in that that causes a problem because then they always go at a press conference are always like, Oh guy who I know I get easy questions from, you know. Right. But there's a way to have that conversation. Have a tough conversation with him or with anybody in a way that he doesn't feel attacked. You can. I think most politicians are receptive to being asked

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       tough questions in a respectful way. I thought Jon Stewart was. He was a master at that. Jon Stewart would have any conservative on his show. He would read their book and he would grill them about it, but it was always respectful and I think as a consequence, they would come on the show because they knew they would get a fair hearing for their ideas. Then they may end up, they may have, they may walk out feeling foolish, but it's not because of him. It's because of them.

Speaker 2:          00:30:07       Yeah. What do we do, do you think, to make people smarter? Again, I keep saying that being smart is now counter culture. Culture is dumb right now and when I meet smart people, I'm like, thank God.

Speaker 4:          00:30:18       Culture is gleefully dumb. That's the problem. I don't know that as a culture, we're probably smarter than we've ever been. You're right. There's this attitude that book learning is somehow anti-american. Uh, knowledge is suspect. Science is political. It's, it's very much an up is down, down is up kind of world. But I still think that's a,

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       that's a minority of the, of, of the country that really believes that. Yeah. I, I firmly believe it's a minority, but it's the minority that we keep hearing from. I mean, that's what I keep saying to the political side. It's like we hear from the crazies on the left and we hear from the crazies on the right and I would argue that most people, I think really 80 percent of us actually want pretty decent things and pretty similar things. I think if you're a, if you're just a regular conservative, you don't want a world that's very different from what the average liberal really want. You might have a couple of policies. So how do we, how do we get those voices to be heard again? Well, for one thing I think it's important to to for the larger

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       a national dialogue to state what you just stated, which is true and I would say it's even larger than 80 percent. We all essentially want the same things. We want safe communities, we want opportunities for our kids. We wanted the ability to make a little money and feel like if we, to use the tritus political expression, work hard and play by the rules will get ahead. That's basically all people want right on, on both sides. So if conservatives can agree with that statement and Liberals can agree with that statement, you go, fine, we know where we're going. It's really just a question of tactics on how we get there. That's where we disagree. But as long as we keep in mind that the goal is the same, I think we can work together, but we become so, and this is largely a result of, of uh, at the entertainment aspect of journalism, we become so polarized because that's what drives eyeballs to television screens is people yelling at each other as opposed to people having comity and being like, oh yeah, we agree. We basically agree,

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       right? Yeah. And that's the irony is people want that. I know they want to because they're messaging me every day saying that what I'm here is what they want to see the guy that you're important, you're doing God's work. We get it. Dave. Listen, if 100 other people were doing this, I would gladly find something else to do. You know what I mean? I really would. And that would show a good sign that some smarter things have had occurred here.

Speaker 4:          00:32:55       Yeah. That I, I, I, I wrote a book a few years ago with my friend, Megan Mckenna. I wanted to ask you about that. Yeah. Uh, and that was essentially the central thesis of the book, which is we all kind of want the same things. We differ on the margins may be a bit about guns for example. Um, but even then we don't because conservatives and liberals both want gun debts to fall. Right. It's just a question of how we get there. There's a certain disingenuousness I think on the part of the right about how we get there and in fact entirely disingenuousness, but just from a, from a purely philosophical point of view, both sides would like to reduce gun deaths. Yeah. So then it's just how do we get there?

Speaker 2:          00:33:39       So when you wrote that book, and that's actually when I had you on my Sirius xm show many lifetimes ago when you wrote that, and I think I had megan on maybe the next week or something. Um, what made you think like, oh, I should talk to her because she's obviously she's in it. Her Dad's a pretty powerful guy who ran for president and you know, she's on the right and I do continue. I mean, do you consider yourself on the left? You just. Yeah. So, uh, what made you think that, like, this is the apprentice ears. You got to do that. A couple more parentheses. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What made you think like, let me talk to her and let's do this because that was ahead of its. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:34:14       that was, that was the reason it was. She's somebody who I should have very little in common with. Let's go on the road together and write a book and see if we can sort of bring these issues to light a little bit. And we did a, it was fun and we wrote a good book and nobody bought it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       Nobody wants to hear more similar than dissimilar. Yeah. That's such a dangerous. That's the thing I want to unpack with this more than anything else is like we've got to get past it and it's, it's uh, it's uh, you know, I turn on CNN and it's like, people think they're watching news and they're not watching news. They are literally watching Wolf Blitzer debate between the trump spokesman and a hillary spokesmen and people think that that's news. Meanwhile brexit happens and we don't even. We literally, I watched CNN almost a full day just trying to see like what are they going to show us with, onto the background. They didn't know the audio on the whole time, but like there was nothing. There was like one 32nd thing every four hours. Right. So it's like our media is just making this dumb too.

Speaker 7:          00:35:15       Yes

Speaker 4:          00:35:15       and no. I think there's a certain percentage of the population that will look at the coverage of brexit and be curious enough to want to understand more what that means and there's a much larger percentage of the population that understands the headline of what Brexit is and doesn't need to pursue that any further. And then there's a certain amount of the population who doesn't give a shit, but I put it, but it hasn't. That always been the way I've always been the case, that, that you know, that I don't, I don't, I, I, if anything, I feel like we're more engaged as a nation than we've ever been on almost because we can't help but be the. And I think that that's good and bad. I think what's going on in the country right now, there's, there's absolutely a pollyanna ish way of looking at it and saying this is actually quite good. What's happening. That there is a, I mean, aside from people just being gone down in the streets, which is great.

Speaker 3:          00:36:11       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       so you're saying that the issues that are being earthed up are good. The question is yes

Speaker 4:          00:36:18       or being dredged up. Yeah. Aren't necessarily issues.

Speaker 3:          00:36:21       Um,

Speaker 4:          00:36:23       and they're being brought to the fore by two imperfect messengers and that's fine. That's fine.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       Uh, so as we're taping this right now, black lives matters in the throes of. There's a lot of stuff going on. I mean, between the shootings of the black people that has obviously been going on for quite some time up, but these last few in particular and now the, the bride or the protests against it and then the cop shootings and everything else where, where do you kind of fall on all of this stuff? Because I find it very hard and even even as I'm prefacing this, I know that no matter what we say right now, a certain amount of people are going to hate it. No, you know what I mean? Even if they agree with us on 99 percent, if we say one word the wrong way, people will start freaking, but I. So I haven't talked about it that much because I find it's very hard to decipher what's actually happening by watching little clips of things. Well,

Speaker 4:          00:37:18       there's a few things we know that are happening. Yeah. Let's start with the black lives matter side of it and instantly, I don't think these are two opposing sides, but just, yeah, separating them out. We know that black people are being killed by police. We know that. We've known it for years. Uh, we've known it for generations, we've known him for centuries. Black people get killed. Um, what changed is obviously the ability to live stream those debts as they're occurring. It has changed the dialogue. It's very hard for white people to now say or not to, to, to live in any kind of denial about that. Now, when you see the evidence presented in front of you and there's a lot of white people trying very hard to maintain that denial, very hard, but I think most of us look at that and go, Oh yeah, yeah, we knew what you were saying for the last 300 years,

Speaker 2:          00:38:18       I guess. That's right. Yeah. The blatant denial people are the ones that drive me nuts because you can say that we can get to the other part of this too. You can say there's some legitimate issues there, but it's the people that no matter what happens, no matter what evidence they're shown, they immediately go to that. It goes to character assassination immediately. Yeah. Right, right, right.

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       If somebody had a weed in the car or whatever, well they deserve to get shot. No, no, they didn't. Right, so there's that side of it and then the other side is a, that violence gets redirected towards police and I haven't heard anybody defend that in any way, shape or form other than a couple of crazy people on twitter just being idiots. The two on the two ideas are not opposed. We shouldn't be killing people like that. Let's just start with that central premise. People are dying unnecessarily. Yeah. And there I believe that there is a uh, incredibly entrenched, I don't know, and there's no polite word for it. Racist Culture in police culture. I've seen enough evidence and read enough account and spent enough time looking at, looking at, added into it to suggest that that is a problem, a real problem, a genuine problem. Um, for probably a plethora of historical and cultural reasons. So something's broken with policing and I think always has been, but now we're just seeing it. Um, that needs to change.

Speaker 6:          00:40:15       Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:40:16       The idea that the police force, we've come to think of more and more as a militarized force as an extension of the military. That has to change. It's weird. It's weird that. Sorry to cut you off, but it's weird that people don't see that. That piece of it where when we have these tanks out there are not taxed, but these armored vehicles on our streets, it happened and that doesn't truly. Yeah, and that doesn't feel like if you were just looking at it, we're moving specifics. We armored tanks on our streets, forget why they're there, but that in and of itself, this alarm, a problem. You should. You should have to call the national guard tank and pick up the phone call. Gomer pyle haven't bring the tank. There's no reason the police forces need them, but what it does is it inculcates an us versus them mentality, both from the police point of view and from the community's point of view and the idea of community policing is lost.

Speaker 4:          00:41:09       The idea of to protect and serve is lost because it's become a a. The the these police precincts I think in many communities have come to feel like occupying forces as opposed to extensions of the community. That's a real problem. The fact that the fact that police routinely recruit from the military I think is a problem. There's no, there's, there's no real linkage between those two organizations. The police are paramilitary to a certain extent, but the local police force in my mind should be essentially liaison from, uh, the law, law enforcement to the community. And it should be a partnership. It should be a two way street.

Speaker 2:          00:41:57       Right? So in army is dealing with enemy combatants, but by definite way that police obviously she's right there,

Speaker 4:          00:42:03       like definition and army is dealing with, with an opposing force. Yeah. And when you recruit from the military to fill out your police ranks, I have a hard time believing that they're not going to bring that mentality to policing and it infects the entire culture. And it's been that way now for I think decades.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       So what do you make of [inaudible]? One of the things that I've struggled with, this is what I see the protests and there in the middle of the street where they're not supposed to be on highways and things and you know when they've been burning cars or whatever it is or or looting sorts of things. Look, those things are not legal. You're allowed to protest, but you can't shut down highways and all. That's a. and usually the cop usually not always of course, but usually you see the cops basically trying to keep law and order so it sort of a self fulfilling prophecy here, right? Because you could. You create something, you do something illegal even if the intentions are good. Let's see. Your motives are good, but you shut down a highway which you can't do. Now. The cops have to do something and now you've created this stalemate here and now of course everyone's got cameras in everybody's face and they're just waiting for the pin drops, right? To set the whole thing off. So how do we, how do we unfurl some of that?

Speaker 4:          00:43:15       This is given two different examples that I think are not quite the same to me. There's a big difference between sitting down in the middle of a highway and burning a car and looting a store. Sure. But both are legal. Both are illegal. One is causing a property damage and destruction. And is, is essentially a violent act versus the nonviolent protest of sitting down in the middle of a highway.

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       You could be stopping ambulances that needed to get in all kinds of other stuff, but you could also do those sit downs

Speaker 4:          00:43:51       in a park. You can, you know, but, but you don't get the fanfare. Right. And, and protest is about spectacle. That is, that is it's point. Um, so I may be annoyed at the people sitting in the middle of the highway, um, but I don't have the same reaction to that as I do to people being destructive. Sure. In their community. And I think I, I, I think sitting down in the highways a perfectly viable, a nonviolent demonstration where I think black lives matter is falling short. Um, and I, I, I was reading a commenter commentator on twitter, Oliver Willis, who was talking about this all night

Speaker 6:          00:44:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:44:44       without a directed legislative agenda. It's so much smoke, but there's no, it can't catch fire. There's no substance there. Um, and I think that's true. I think, I think at this point, the black lives matter umbrella because it's not really sounded organization, it's whoever wants black lives matter can claim it wherever you can claim yourself to be a member of black lives matter and you are um, but it needs, it needs more directed leadership. It needs to have some stated legislative and policy goals. Otherwise all you're doing is you're raising awareness for something that people already know exists.

Speaker 2:          00:45:32       This is the inherent problem with that though, that they feel the system has failed them either, either true or not. So they're there. Their goal is

Speaker 4:          00:45:42       to

Speaker 2:          00:45:43       make waves, not necessarily like they're trying to change the system in a way that the system doesn't want to change. Like that's where this thing's at loggerheads, right? Yeah. But like if a guy came out and said, I have this legislation that's going to do this and this and this, it's almost like, well, the protesters wouldn't, wouldn't be down with that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:58       That's possible because again, it's the blank slate theory. It's easy to say, I'm, I project all my hopes onto x, x candidate x political movement. It's much harder to go to then take the next step to y and Z and saying, well, here are some legislative, uh, differences we can make and it's not going to be perfect because it never is. But we can move. We can move ourselves forward in fits and starts. Yeah, that's what we need.

Speaker 2:          00:46:29       Wouldn't it be fun to talk about some of this stuff with some level of comedy involved? But I get ya. I get ya. I warned you in an email and I prepare for me not to be funny. I'm not going to be funny. And I said I wanted one applause break. We don't even have a studio audience. What I was hoping for. One, one, minor applause. Break there. I don't know how to talk about this stuff with that. Funny Way, I mean I just,

Speaker 4:          00:46:48       I find it interesting, I mean I'm just, I'm just some dude who reads the newspaper and it's just interested in it and doesn't, doesn't pretend to know how to make it funny.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       Are there any comics right now that you really think you're hitting this out of the

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       park? Just sort of the general political stuff. Yeah. You know the, the people who came from the daily show, I think our

Speaker 2:          00:47:08       still doing the best work in that arena. We need John Back. Right? I had some issues with them, but I think we need him back. He was the best. Yeah, I think he is coming back right? He's got some HBO. He's going to do like little snippets on hbo or something, but I mean sort of that nightly long form. It would be great. It really wouldn't be. Yeah. So let's, let's shift to movies and comedy and TV and, but, but we can probably circle it back to some horrific societal stuff and end of civilization stuff, but in case society ends, I want you to at least be able to share your thoughts on some of the movies you've made. Some of the others about Wonky Shit. All right, well we'll let you know what, five minutes of it. I was going to go for 12 to 15.

Speaker 2:          00:47:45       We'll do five minutes away and then we'll finish back with all this stuff. Um, so first off I was telling you right before we sat down, uh, that you were in wet hot American summer, which I hadn't seen until about a year ago. Even though I went to one of those camps. I went to Camp Shannon wind up in Pennsylvania and I thought it was one of the most absolutely hilarious we've ever seen. I watched the series on Netflix, which now you're just telling me you're writing for season two, right? Which is pretty great. But you didn't write for. She just not right for season one, I did not write the movie. Yeah. Is that hard for you and in a movie like that where there's a, it's so many of your friends obviously writing and you didn't get to write but you have to just act it. Is that harder than if you're writing for it and acting on it?

Speaker 3:          00:48:21       Uh, no. I mean

Speaker 5:          00:48:24       I've been friends with all of those guys essentially my entire adult life. So

Speaker 5:          00:48:31       it says if I wrote it, yeah, you know, we, we share a sensibility. So it's just, it was just fun and it's not like they were so precious with the words that you couldn't, so they let you kind of do your thing. I would imagine you guys are having a great time because it's great. It's really fun. Yeah. And now now I'm, I mean I'm nervous writing for it because I feel like I have something to live up to write as a writer, which I, I didn't have to showing up on set. So I'm, I'm, I'm conscious of, of not fucking up something that I think is really funny. All right, so we're going to pack all the comedy stuff in real quick. So you're working on like 87 other things. You're on Gaffigan, you're doing something that I just saw a billboard when other period.

Speaker 2:          00:49:12       Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So that's. I haven't seen it, but it's like a, it's like a takeoff. Downton Abbey. Is that

Speaker 5:          00:49:17       abby? It's as if, well, they pitched it to me as the Kardashians meets Downton Abbey and that's essentially what it is. And it's really funny. Yeah. All right. So I, I knew what channel is it on comedy central? I actually know that I should've, I should've known that. I apologize. We have ruined the whole interview. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not here to plug shit. You're not plugging. I'm here not plugging. You said. Well let's talk about the real stuff. That's all I want to talk about. All right. Let's circle back to the real stuff. Um, so I mean I've got other shows out to it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm on a lot of shows. What's your favorite thing that you had up? All the things you don't see. So I always associate you with the. I love the bad stuff, which probably does that cause you to roll your eyes Kinda like it was, you were like, it was almost as if they, that whole genre of stuff, which, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       they did a zillion shows after that best week ever. And I in the seventies, I love the nineties, I love the twenties or whatever else they've. And now every channel has those shows too. But you were sort of the one that like.

Speaker 5:          00:50:09       Got It. Did you kind of feel like you figured out what that thing was? That, that commentary thing was? Uh, I think in a way that some of the other people who maybe didn't get well when, when it first started it was much more sincere. It was much more like Soleil Frye going, Oh, do you remember Wacky Wall crawlers crawlers. Right. And that was never my approach to it. My approach was just, just make jokes. Uh, I, I, I feel totally comfortable shitting on your childhood right now. Uh, and that, yeah, they eventually, the tone of it shifted more towards that then. Then the, can you remember Wacky Wall crawlers? Tell him? Yeah. Speaking of the eighties, the Sega Genesis, do anything for you because nothing. No, it was after my time. That was. So your eight bit Nintendo or colleague? A Vision or a vision? A intellivision Atari Twenty 600.

Speaker 5:          00:51:07       Wow. So even eight bit Nintendo. We only have five years apart. It technology changes, man moves very fast. Yeah. Uh, I was, I had graduated from video games and by the time the Sega Genesis came out. Yeah. So I remember once I auditioned for, I shot a best week ever once and one of the jokes I did, it was right when current TV came out with, which was Al Gore's television and my joke was something to this effect that was like, Oh, you know, Al Gore has a new TV channel called current TV. Can you imagine if George W dot Bush did? Oh yeah. Fox News. Not, not the most brilliant thing ever, but I thought I thought pretty solid. That's a solid joke. Right? And I remember the producer kind of looked at me from the side, like, we're not going to be doing that sort of thing around here.

Speaker 5:          00:51:51       And I didn't think they aired it, uh, my little too political for that. That was too political for that were pretty mild, extremely mild. But you know, we live in corporate culture where everyone's afraid to offend everybody. How do you deal with that stuff? So now we can circle back to that. Like when, where, how you ever have you ever said, I'm sure you know you've gotten into some heat, right? Like I'd said Shit on twitter that gets people upset. Yeah. I'm, I'm not just talking about the Nazis. I mean like a wider, wider. Yeah. But I mean, it never really like widespread condemnation. It's always coming from the Michelle Malkin crowd who never called me whiter than toilet paper once or something like that. She said this guy is whiter than old toilet paper. Well, not according to the alt right. You're not even like my friend.

Speaker 5:          00:52:42       I know big Ju. Yeah. Yeah. Not even like, um, I, I am not particularly self censorious. Is that the word? Yeah. But do you think about it ever? Because I do sometimes think, man, like there'll be something that I want to say like really, and even just I'll be like, ah, I gotta change this one word, not because it's really what I mean is any different, but because there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with making sure that what you're trying to say is being heard in the way you want to say it. Right. I mean, when I've gotten in trouble on twitter, it's generally because I've been too hasty in terms of how I say something, not really about what I'm saying.

Speaker 3:          00:53:31       Um,

Speaker 5:          00:53:33       I have no problem with there being consequences for people saying stupid shit. The First Amendment allows you to say whatever you want, but it doesn't protect you from the consequences of your speech. It's just the government can come in so you can use your speech and then other people can use their speech to counter years. It's actually a beautiful, beautiful thing. And I want to be a total asshole on twitter and say racist. Horrible Shit. I can do that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:58       Yeah. Um, but,

Speaker 5:          00:54:01       you know, my employer might get upset with me and I have to be, I have to understand that going in. So there's free speech, but consequences of course there's always been consequences to free speech. Uh, I, I think the idea, the concept of free speech is widely misunderstood in this country. People think they should be able to sort of, uh, uh, excrete whatever diarrhea they want from their mouth and they absolutely can. But if somebody comes along and is like, I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap, got to be prepared to deal with.

Speaker 2:          00:54:32       Right, right. Not Punch you all on what washing your mouth out, but they can use their speech, not going to throw you in jail. Yeah. You know, it's funny, when I went to Ucla, as I mentioned before with Milo and I, we just did one of these, which we've done many times before and there were all these protestors and first they were blocking people from coming in, which you can't do that. You gotta you can protest of course, but use your, do a counter rally the next day, scream all you want, but you can't throw garbage cans. And they were getting, getting in cops faces. I mean really there were people with phones, right in touch with just begging to set them off, which goes to the whole other thing we discussed. But at one point, uh, one of the protestors came in and, uh, we started screaming in the middle of it and I stopped and I said, look, I bet you that if you ask Milo a question right now, a direct question.

Speaker 2:          00:55:16       So we were going to do this at the q and a, but if you ask him something right now, he'll answer it. And she just screamed. I, Hey, I. and I was like, that's the problem here, that that's my problem with what's happening on the left. It was like, I opened the door for you to make a point, make let's have that exchange of ideas. But all she could come up with was that. And it was like, that was your chance to say, no, you are a whatever you want to call him. You know what I mean? You're a, you don't like Muslim people, you don't like that. But whenever you want to do like, this is it, I'm giving you a chance. That's a lot of cameras here, but you're in front of 500 people and that's what you came up with. And that's my problem with a lot of what's going on on the colleges. It's like, these people don't even know what they're protesting. They're, they just hear something that they kind of don't like. And then they freak out and they want safe spaces and trigger warnings and all this other.

Speaker 5:          00:56:01       Well, I am,

Speaker 3:          00:56:05       uh,

Speaker 5:          00:56:06       as somebody who traffics in free speech for a living, I am cognizant of the concern on campuses that, that free speech is being shut down.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       And of course, if I, I, I oppose that. I oppose inviting somebody, the campus and then because some group has an issue with that person, just inviting them. Uh, uh, a college campus of all places should be a place where every point of view is heard. Yeah, no problem with protesting those people, but as you said, protest in a respectful way or protest in a way that is lawful, right? You don't have to do it respectfully. You can be loud and upset and angry and. Sure. But, um, but I, I agree with you. I don't think you can block the, I mean, well you can, I'm just going to get arrested. That's a, that's on you. Um, but, but I do think the, uh, the, the, the college campus thing has gotten, from what I read, I mean, I don't know because I'm not experiencing it, but it feels like it's gotten very intolerant. Uh, and that's a problem. That's a real problem.

Speaker 5:          00:57:24       And the danger is that these are our future leaders. That's what I'm contributing is I don't think it's a problem. Ultimately, I think it's a problem in the sense that

Speaker 5:          00:57:36       I think it speaks to a larger problem, but I do think people will leave those institutions and take their place in society and it will all be fine. I'm not, I'm not concerned about it longterm particularly really, I mean you don't think like that. Just a generation of these people who had been sort of coddled into the safe space thing that they're going to be the 20 year olds that are 25 years. You know what I mean? That eventually they'll have been so used to never hearing anything that they didn't like or, or everything that they don't like is hate speech in their eyes that they've diminished the ability to do this. That that's my concern. I think it's a little

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       what concern. I've seen no evidence to this point that it's going to be a problem down the road. Maybe it will be. Maybe it won't be. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not that concerned about it. Only because I feel like my, my basic philosophy in parenting and in life is the kids are all right. They're going to be fine.

Speaker 5:          00:58:28       Did you steal that from movie? I did not. You were thinking that before? Yes. Um, the kids are all right. There'll be fine. It'll all work itself out. I do think the larger point is this idea that victimization is empowerment that you, by claiming victim status are there by empowered and thereby take the moral high ground in whatever you do by the victim status. That's problematic to me. So what do we do about that? Because that, that gets to the heart of all of this thing. Everyone's trying to figure out how they are a victim so that they can somehow be a little more moral problem. Everyone beneath him is with very few exceptions. A lot of people can make a claim, you know, their, their, their, their claims are not without merit. Um, whether you're black, Hispanic, Muslim, female,

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       gay, whatever it is you are, you can make an argument like you, you have faced some problems and you have to deal with them. Um, and there's nothing wrong. I think in asserting and stating your case and saying, this is where I feel like society is coming up short and dealing with us.

Speaker 6:          00:59:42       But

Speaker 4:          00:59:45       there's no, as you're saying, there's no, there's no positive movement beyond that. Once you've identified your grievances, you can't wallow in them

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       because the world isn't going to give you anything, and I don't think the world should give you anything. We should all be treated equally. The playing field has to be equal and maybe the playing field isn't equal. Well, that's I think, the larger issue that the playing field isn't equal. And so

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       what's so funny about trump is he's elevated the white male to victim status. He's, he's, he somehow made white men into victims and

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       you know, that's the final frontier of hilarity. It's funny to me too because if I make fun of Hilary, which I do all the time, they love it and it gets a zillion retweets and if I make fun of Bernie, of course they love it, but I make fun of anyone and the whole time they were telling me how much they love free speech. And I, again, I say this as I understand that free speech, Lma you should on there, but then every time I make a trump on bullet but joke and now you're saying you don't get it yet, and that they can use their free speech to counter me. But I always think it's like, I just want them to understand like a little bit of the irony here. You know what I mean? Like guys, I'm literally like, I'm not like, kill the guy. I'm like, right. It's like, it's hard

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       when your guys being attacked and you know, in a, in a, in an election season, you know, even as somebody who's not like an and a hillary supporter, when I hear her getting attacked,

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       my hackles go up and I'm like, and I have to check myself. I'm like, why? Why do you care? But that's funny because I've had, I don't really like Hillary and I don't like trump and I don't know what I may vote for Gary Johnson. I'm still in that short. I'll say something a couple weeks I guess. But like, I've defended Hillary at times because I think the attacks from a lot of the Bernie people were totally unfair, like making it sound like she's truly this warm on monitoring neo-con. It's like she's not calling for war against anyone. You know what I mean? I know she's made some bad choices, but Obama was the president for a lot of those bad choices too, like, you know, Olivia and whatever else and a lot of the serious stuff. But it's like every time I'd defend her then people say, Oh, you're a hillary supporter. And then I make a joke about trump, but that isn't it. Like, it's like, it's just, it's a lot of noise at the end of the day. That's, that's the world you're trafficking in right now. The noise world and noise. Where's the Iot world? Uh, come to my house in Connecticut. You are from Canada. Great. Quiet. Yeah. No, but the problem is though, that you're a heterosexual white man. And I feel like being around that privilege wouldn't be that great for me. For you.

Speaker 6:          01:02:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       Gay Married Dude. So technically little better. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:14       Well, you know what, we're, um, we like, we like little, a little, uh, diversity up in Connecticut.

Speaker 2:          01:02:23       What do you, what do you get a little bit? Yeah. You're not in a, what's the really fat granted. Sorry. No, yeah, no, no. Diversity over there. I used to, when I was doing standup, I would do catering gigs a lot in Connecticut. There was not a, I mean there was the widest thing here where it's colors of white that I had never seen before. That's how white it was. Yeah. There's anything wrong with that. Where I am

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       is, is pretty white and it's embarrassing. It gets to the point where like every Sunday there's a concerts on the green in my little town and um, you know, the few black families that live in town, you know, you just, you just stare at them like this. I know most patronizing way. Like, I love you, I love you. White guilt is something, oh, it's the worst. It's the worst. I, I, there, there are, there are times where I feel like I could die from white guilt. Uh, I was on a cruise ship and the waitstaff at this dinner, I dunno, they're from all over the world and at one point, uh, one, one of the evenings, they had to perform a song and dance for us, the waitstaff, and it was unbearable to me.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       I, I honestly felt like if I could die from white guilt right now because you were all white patrons, mostly on the lady's staring at those people from Bangladesh going, thank you for coming to dinner tonight. We hope you like your chicken or whatever they were saying and you're just like, oh my God, these are the songs about the first songs are not about the food, but that would have been. That would be pretty good. But the subtext of like, you are eating this stuff, we don't eat that well. They give us is the needs of glad. We ended this thing on a funny note. So you see what we did there. We went serious. Then we went. I think there was something funny about not really, and it's go. I thought there was one

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       moment of humor that phishing email to introduce me as comedian Michael, Ian, but just be with citizen will Ian, black, American citizen. How about depressed dark? I'm not depressed, but um, no, but I'm trying to make you give you a little cred, you know what I mean? Because if you're depressed or if you were going to limp or something that way next time you come out I'll say he's depressed. He's limping. Being he's the first. He was, you know, next time I'll tell them that he couldn't fly first class. Yeah. Yeah. I did fly first class coming out here on jet blue on jet blue again. Are they as good? Those real nice, real nice. It, it seems like extra. Like you don't even need all that space. Oh yeah. Well you know what it's for. It's for a halfway through the flight that come into the jerk you off.

Speaker 2:          01:05:08       Meanwhile I'm doing it myself back in coach, like some kind of schmuck. And on that note I want to thank Michael Ian Black. You can follow him on twitter and if you want to send them any Nazi names or anything like that, he might retweet you or comment on it. I think that's possible. Or check out Michael Ian Black Dot com and the thousand shows that he has in production at the moment. Thanks for watching and we'll do it again next week.
