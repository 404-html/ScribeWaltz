Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Joining me on the show this week is author, speaker and Associate Director of the Henry Jackson Society, Douglas Murray. I've been familiar with douglass work for almost a year now. His name kept popping up in my twitter feed after the Charlie Hebdo shootings, like last week's guest, Ayaan Hirsi Ali Douglas has been a relentless defender of free speech even when it isn't popular to do so. Part of my awakening about the regressive left came around the same time as Charlie Hebdo when I saw more concerned for political correctness then for the victims of the horrific attack. I was really impressed with. Douglas is clean and clear explanation of why free speech must be protected at all costs. And that's one of the issues we're going to talk about today. This is where I should tell you the Douglas Murray is a neo-con. The word neo-con sounds kind of evil to me. Sorta like a decepticon. Uh, and like decepticons neocons are big on world domination, or are they.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Well, that's where we're going to find out when we talked to Douglas today. You know, we get so lost in throwing around labels all the time that we hardly know what they mean anymore. As I understand that a neo-con is someone who wants to spread democracy through military intervention and we all know how well that usually works out. Right? Uh, well this is just generally thought of in the American Lens, but is it the same for the British? I want to find that out. Am I way off altogether? I want to find that out too. And that's what we're going to talk about. Some of you might be thinking, Dave, you've been labeling the regressive left for weeks now. How is that different than labeling someone to neo-con? I think the thing is here that we had to identify what the regressive left stands for us so that we could also identify what we stand for.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       As I've said before, I felt the need to talk about the lunacy on the left because there just weren't enough voices amplifying the battle of ideas that you guys all want to have. That's why you're here. And that's what I'm going to continue to do. So today, as I sit here with someone firmly on the right, a scary neoconservative, let's all have a battle of ideas and actually listened to what he says and then formulate opinions on those ideas. Let's not do what the regressive left does, which is label someone and then prejudge everything they say based on that very label. I think there's going to be agreement, disagreement and everything in between and it's our ability to have those honest conversations and know that people we disagree with can feel as just an as principled as we do. That's the spirit that I'll continue to do this show in.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       While I do want to continue having these types of conversations, I also want to assure you guys that we're going to be widening the net around here as well. I want to talk politics, science, culture, and more. Of course, free speech and the battle of ideas will always be a mainstay, but I don't want to become a one trick pony either. Next week I have two people who are putting many of the ideas we've been talking about into action, David Keys and Faisal Al Mutar from advancing human rights.org. They're using the tools of democracy to help advance human rights in parts of the world where the people are most effected by the ideas we've been talking about. The point is I'm going to keep mixing it up, keep letting me know what you guys think and who you want me to talk to. Most importantly, let's keep pushing the conversation forward so we can build bridges where others were just tear them down. Douglas Murray is an author, a journalist, and atheist, a neoconservative and an outspoken defender of free speech. Douglas, now that I've labeled you all sorts of things, welcome to the show.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       Very nice to be with you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       I told you right before we started that, you know, we've only been doing this show for about two months now, but I, you by far I've had more requests to have you on then pretty much anyone else because you seem you seem to be like this sort of hub of free speech and free thought and that even though I think maybe we don't line up exactly politically, people wanted to see us sit down. So I'm excited that you took a little time here.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       I look forward to hearing our differences.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Alright, so. Alright. So first what I want to start with is the word neoconservative because it's really the first thing that if someone googles you that pops up that you were a neoconservative or a neo con. Now I know since I come from the left, this is a real buzzword for my people. They, they freak out on this. I think that you're some sort of imperialist, this kind of thing. So first I thought, well let's just get what the definition of neoconservative ism is from you first.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       It's quite nice to know that's the first thing that comes up on Google. What I expected far words were basically people have been moved from the left in the postwar period in America and famously described themselves. Thanks. So I've been crystal as being. Liberals have been mugged by reality. The truth is that now I wrote a, I wrote a book on neo-cons about 10 years ago now. And um, the truth is, is that the word neoconservatives with ms.so filled with pejorative connotations. Everyone thinks they know what they mean by that. I, I wrote a book partly to correct those ms dot apprehensions. I didn't think it was remotely successful in that regard. Um, but, uh, I, I'm, I'm, I'm not that bothered about the term. I think it is interesting and it remains interesting, the movement of people from a liberal position as it were. Um, but apart from that, I think has gotten relatively little relevance today. I think the word is probably noxious for at least a generation,

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       right? So I think within an American context, it basically means using military force to spread democracy. Is that, is that fair to say?

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       Um, no. I mean, actually, mainly no conservatives in America where we're not interested in foreign policy. The first, first, certainly a glitch weren't, uh, but, uh, certainly in recent years it's been perceived. I wouldn't say that in terms of bringing democracy, I think the most striking a neoconservative foreign policy idea was really that idea that you could use military force for humanitarian means. It partly solved a sort of imbroglio that cut for a long time by that point, which was that people on the left, broadly speaking, didn't believe in the use of force and people on the right, broadly speaking, didn't think that humanitarian catastrophes where the sort of thing you use the military for neoconservatives were few people to sort of meld these things together and say actually, as in the Balkans, the use of military force to alleviate human suffering and to prevent, in that case even worse genocide occurred was a good thing. However, I mean, um, as we all know the last 10 years, if, if it's possible for a neoconservative to be a liberal who's been mugged by reality, then I think it's probably possible now to be a neoconservatives who's been mugged by reality as well.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       So I guess this is why labels just suck in general because I think what you're saying is there's, there's various lines through here that you could be someone that does believe in nation building and obviously there are some people that do believe in nation building and then you could be someone that just purely believes on intervening on Humira and humanitarian regards and probably several other things beneath that. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       Absolutely. I think that thing of that being a sort of coalition with people from left and right, who certainly met I think in the nineties over the Balkans mess again in a bit and the early part of the last decade, but I think since that aligns that occurred is suddenly gone and sold in different ways.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Okay. So that's. I just wanted to start there just so that people have a little bit of a sense of the word and don't get too hung up on it before all the commenters start yelling at you right out of the gate. Uh, so I wanted to start also with that, where I became familiar with you was right after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in France because you were all over the media and I saw an interview. Uh, it was a discussion on Al Jazeera and you were incredibly, I thought lucid and clear and clean and your explanation of why we can have no, um, we can have no give when it comes to free speech. So I thought you could possibly explain that for me.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       Yeah, that wasn't the best interview I've ever had. One always tries to be polite of course, but um, it was a bit much, but within 24 hours a of the 12 people being shot dead in Paris, the Algiers you inviting me on, I wanted to have a discussion about what this would mean about the, uh, allegedly nascent European hatred of Islam and Muslims and, and so on. The, the socal backlash thing, um, and uh, I was fairly furious about that because I thought that this was obviously diverting attention from actual dead bodies onto a potentially hurt opinions, hurt feelings and so on. And um, anyhow, I did actually, it was a prerecorded for what it's worth and I went back, uh, uh, afterwards and said to a colleague or they're never going to wear that because, um, I think I did at some point give the interviewer who was sitting in Doha a piece of my mind about the fact that he seemed to, uh, well he didn't like it, let's say when I pointed out he lived in an unfree country and was working for an unfree media and that I wasn't answerable to him.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       I still haven't actually got the fee for that interview

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       because

Speaker 2:          00:09:18       I'm not being asked back either.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       I'm guessing the check is not coming in the mail, so I would just let that be. So what I liked about that though is that you clearly. So yeah, you called out the interviewer in Doha, but really you were, you were really calling out your own media, right? You were calling up people in the UK and you were calling out people in France and probably in America and all over these, that sort of. We were doing this to ourselves literally before the bodies had been buried.

Speaker 2:          00:09:46       Yes. Well, you know, it's, it's, was recognizing in a way when you've lost. We've lost every round of the free speech wars in recent years from the satanic verses a fair on. Whereas we always sort of get a technical, uh, there's always, there's always a technical way out. We allow ourselves, you know, I mean, I'm off the satanic verses, you know, thank goodness someone wished you remained alive. But, but basically everybody has been. Has this been often said, internalize the fact why there's never been another book. Like the satanic verses published. There probably won't be in our lifetimes. I'm off to Charlene Abdo. You know, people walked through the streets of Paris world leaders in that sort of preposterous parade through Paris. Parisians holding up pencils as if this was an act of defiance. No inactive defiance would have been if everyone had marched through Paris holding a cartoon of Muhammad, the act of defiance on the part of the media that was so desperately trying to find a way to be showing alliance with they're slaughtered colleagues.

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       The best media could do is to sort of repeat the same weasley excuses even doing for 10 years since the Danish cartoons, the FA and try to save their dignity. I mean, it's a very undignified site. I think the media, uh, after all we've got, remember it probably awards itself more awards than anyone else in the world. Uh, I know firemen and policemen don't, don't, don't have endless award ceremonies for their bravery and give each other metals and so on. But journalists are doing it all the time. There is lots of journalistic bravery, don't get me wrong, but, uh, the reason why we keep on failing and this is because actually our media as a whole and most individuals just don't want to make the kind of standard which if we'd made it 20 years ago, we wouldn't have to keep on going through today.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       Right. And I suppose that's why people are responding to you the way they're responding to you and responding to what we're doing because it seems, it seems late at this point by us talking about free speech. It seems so late and overdue and I think that's why there's been this, this sort of groundswell of support for what we're doing. Do you agree with that?

Speaker 2:          00:11:51       I hope so. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm a bit pessimistic about the, you know, the possibility of another satanic verses. But look, I mean, things could change, but it certainly seems to me that a lot of people are increasingly aware of the fact that we live in an age of extraordinary caladis at an age of cowardice that masquerades as an era of truth telling. Um, you know, I mean, but these things are very confusing. I think for most people when they're living through them. You know, if, if you just said, if you just said I didn't know in 1999, uh, if I didn't see me, you'd see me in one of us had said to the other, you know, the 21st century is going to be racked across the Western world with blasts for me was you just thought you must be drunk or I'm at the most.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       If you believe that prediction, you would have said, well, how do the Spanish inquisition come back into Europe here? How did that occur? How did I know? How did the Catholic Church remains returned to medieval times and start burning heretics? Well, no one would have thought that in 2015 a newspaper offices across the world would be debating whether they could show a little cartoon or some guy just, just, just to not even have the, I mean, not even as it were, accurate photo fit of Mohammed, just anything which they then say could be called Mohammed. You wouldn't have believed that this would be the thing that broke a, um, the western press, but it. But it is.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       Yeah. So was was one of the most infuriating parts for you that actually what Charlie Hebdo did was incredible satire, making fun of all religions. So I saw in that Aljazeera piece and in another piece where people were saying that this was racism, what they were doing was racist, but actually it was the reverse of racism. They were fighting for the principles that the left is supposed to believe in. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       W W, w what? Let's not forget the fact that we live in an age when everyone not only has an opinion but is expected to have an opinion and most people therefore have to mug up very fast on things they know nothing about. So after Shawnee Abdo and January, a lot of people were just cropping up on things who had always said he never actually seen a copy of Charlene. I've never actually, uh, read it or seen the cartoons or new anything very much about it. But one of the immediate attacks on the dead journalists was of course to say they were racist. That was probably for me, the thing which I have to keep going during that period. I thought it wasn't remain under the belief that it was intolerable that a group of people could go through the front doors of the newspaper office in Europe and gum people down with Kalashnikovs and then for their fellow travelers to, as it were, more pub afterwards by saying, well, they were kind of racist anyway. I didn't know much about them until 24 hours ago, but I'll say they're racist and then nobody needs to mind. I thought that was a real low point. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       You know, we've been calling them. It's a, it's a phrase that marginalized coined the regressive left. Uh, and is that really where they have failed us as a society more than anything else by this meme that everything is racist. Everything is based in, you know, if you, if you say anything you hate women or you hate gays, all of this, this idea that people on the other side that you disagree with can't be as principled as you are. Is that where the left has really failed?

Speaker 2:          00:15:21       Oh, you want me to just start with describing why the left?

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       Then I'm going to push it and then I'm going to put you on somebody.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       Look, the problem is several things. Firstly, just because people aren't religious doesn't mean they don't still want to be thought to be good by their contemporaries and their peers. And it used to be quite straightforward to demonstrate how are you a good. Well, today we're sort of making it up on the hoof, you know, I don't know. Um, we've got to be the most frenetically supportive person ever of whatever the latest rights issue, but really the deepest, uh, um, a desire of. I wouldn't say it from the left, it's just this, whatever this movement is that being so gripping in recent years to 70 people, I think a predominant thing is, is that people want other people to be racist. They want people to be racist. They want Nazis. They are fighting a war that was effectively finished consummately 70 years ago and they don't seem to realize it or they want to look as brave as the people who fought narcissism, but they can do it from their home on skype or twitter or facebook.

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       And, you know, the, the, the, these people are in so many ways disappointed people because the number of Nazis around these days is quite small in number, thankfully. Uh, um, I mean there's a supply and demand problem or there's an enormous demand for Nazis, but not much of a supply. So people go scouring around, uh, the social media is media, political landscape, desperately trying to find people who they can call Nazis or racists in order to position themselves as therefore anti racist or anti Nazi. These people need this because they need to feed off it and they're great hope is that they can call everybody else racist when and then be the only person standing who's not a racist. It's, it's, it's terrible. I mean, these people are not only fighting, as I say, uh, I pretty much dead battle about they're wasting their lives in the process.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       Right? So is that where the, the meme of Islamophobia has come in and been dealt with in such a dishonest way? I'm going to guess that you wouldn't argue that there's no people that hate Muslims, right? You agree that some people just hate Muslims, right?

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       Sure. And people hate all sorts of people. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       sure. People hate people because of their color or their religion or whatever, so their sexuality, whatever. But this idea of Islamophobia seems to me that it's taken on this new thing where you're not allowed to hate an idea, not people.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       Yeah. I, I, uh, I think this is one of the most successful ways that anyone's come up with in recent years to shut down debate. It's no surprise that the people who started off the I, the term Islamophobia, the people who were keenest on it from the outset in the 19 nineties own words, what were his limits? Uh, they wanted to portray themselves as the only defenders of Islam against these haters. These people who hated all Muslims, hated the religion. It's been a trickle that's been going on for a very long time.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       Yeah. We just, just to clarify that the word came from the Muslim Brotherhood, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think people realize that they think it came from some think tank probably in the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       No, it, it, it, it was just picked up by such people. Um, and I, I think when a real problem because a, still most people when they hear the cry, Islamophobia Think, oh, this must be a, you know, some racist problem and so on, and the problem is among other things, and it's scooped up any and all criticism of anything to do with Islam. And, and that means that, uh, uh, if you come out with a criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood, for instance, the group, which is eminently possible to criticize a, you are being Islamophobia. Uh, if you say you don't like something which may well be very fundamental to the Islamic faith, you are being Islamophobic and that for the time being, and I think this will change and it may change very fast and very nastily, uh, but for the time being, Islamophobia trumps most other things. So for instance, um, uh, I, you know, you could be the, you can be the most outspoken feminists of your generation, but if you said something that was Islamophobia, Islamophobia would, for the time being trump, feminism and so on, gays by the way, go really down low in this pecking order. No one really cares about that,

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       right? Actually, people seem afraid to talk about the fact that isis is literally throwing gays off the roofs of buildings. There's no outrage over that, right?

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       It should get it. It should not be easier than this, uh, isis, throw gays off buildings, uh, criticize isis and what's more, criticize the ideology that they are coming from. I mean, I, isis poses an enormous problem because Isis don't get their ideas from nowhere. They didn't invent them yesterday. They always publish along scriptural explanations, uh, from the Koran and had he, of why they're doing what they're doing. Now, that doesn't mean that people should say isis through the gaze of the buildings. Therefore, all Muslims hate gays. Therefore, all gays or anyone else should hate Muslims obviously. No, of course. Yeah. But obviously you have to identify where the problem comes from and I mean, you know, I look around and I find ones of people willing to do this, uh, uh, at the moment, you know, and just a quick one, you know, the, the, I mean, you always get reached to the National Union of students in Britain if you want to reach for a bunch of idiots at the National Union of students in Britain recently, didn't, uh, didn't condemn isis because they said that it would be Islamophobic to do so. So while Isis, uh, throwing gays off buildings and raping young girls for the alleged crime of being a Yazidi or occurred or from a Muslim sect, the, a group, men, men have a rapist, salacious. Don't believe in it. If you criticize that, your Islamaphobic look, as I say, uh, people are caught. They're caught in this terrible, terrible. I'm a mess of half thinking a nonthinking and um, everyone's got to find a way to help them think their way out of it. But they've been to be quite fast.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       They better be fast. I fear that they're not. So what would you say to the people that would argue, well, we really created isis because we went into Iraq, which now by most accounts was the wrong war to go into. I'm not sure if you agree with that, but uh, and then by leaving so quickly the way we did, we just, it was a breeding ground. It was fertile ground for religious extremism and all of this awfulness to happen so that it's not just about religion, it's also about the geopolitics.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Can I make a point which doesn't always go down well with American audiences, but I think he's worth pointing out as an outsider, as a question because part of the American thought disease on this is now in Europe as well, but it started with you. We give you some bad ideas and you'd give us as well this, this American, um, self obsession. This American idea that nothing in the world can get screwed up unless it's because of America is a, an intellectual disease. You've got to get over the world can go to hell without America doing anything. The world can go to hell without America lifting a finger. But every time anything in the world does go to hell, Americans ask themselves, what is it we did or didn't do that made this happen? That's why you still see the amazing, uh, an example of not only the president of the United States, but other senior figures in American politics even wanting to apologize for, you know, the era of the Crusades.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       I'm sorry, this stuff happened centuries before, uh, before the British even discovered, uh, um, uh, the early cities of America and so on. I mean, you know, this, this, this, this happened before, before the US was, was founded. Uh, you keep blaming yourself for things before the creation of America. And nobody is fooled apart from you. I had a friend some years ago who went to interview Yasser Arafat and Iranian friend, a journalist, very distinguished journalists from Iran. And he went to interview, yes or I for some years ago. And he said, I'm at the end of the interview. Uh, it was a knock on the door. And one of you asked about how fast goons or porthole or male friends or whoever, I'm said, Chairman Arafat, the American delegation is here to see you. And uh, and my friend thought he had a scoop and he said to, I don't know who is this American delegation? And there was a delegation that's come from the US to apologize for the Crusades. And Arafat burst out laughing. Everybody laughs at this apart from you. Uh, um, isis was not created because of George W Bush, uh, uh, um, al Qaeda wasn't created because of Bill Clinton or George Hw Bush. There are things that America can do well and things that can American can do badly. And there are things you've done that haven't held. There were things that Britain has done that hasn't helped, but it is not all because of you.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       Right? So I, I do agree we have a way of making everything about ourselves. Maybe it's because we're a young democracy and a lot of respect. So we're still in our infant tile phase perhaps. Do you guys not have that in England? Because obviously England has done all sorts of imperial things, far more far, far richer history of materialism than the United States saying you guys, you guys don't have that feeling is that it doesn't exist at all.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Britain, Britain could teach America something about imperialism and it can teach and he could teach America something about post and pivot as we've been going through. We've been going through this for decades and rightly so. I mean, you know, Britain, like all countries are after their height. It looks over what it's done and wonders whether it was a force for good or ill in the world. And we have periods where we are. We seem to think we did no good. And other times when, when we realize actually that on balance, maybe things were better than that. Maybe. Maybe we did more good than we did harm. It's always in the balance that goes up and down and perhaps so it should. But the fascinating thing to me again about this is it's so one sided. I mean, you know, we hear all the time about what empires do and about the British empire and about the mandate in Palestine and about America is really quite minimal involvement or at least quite brief involvement to date in the Middle East and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:25:51       But you know, why don't we ever talk about Turkey? Why don't we ever talk to them. One of the most important, the longest and largest empires in human history was the Ottoman Empire. I never hear anyone from America or Britain or anyone else saying, you know, the Turks have got so much to answer for. Nobody ever says the Turks have done so much wrong in the Middle East and until we punish them sufficiently, you wouldn't hear this. It's only people in America and Britain and the rest of the west who so self obsessed and I know so little history and, and, and what, what we think is we will be able to solve it if we beat ourselves up and we could beat ourselves up for every year we have in the future and it still wouldn't solve the problems in the Middle East. It wouldn't solve Iraq, it wouldn't so serious. Wouldn't solve Turkey, wouldn't stop Isis. It wouldn't do anything. It's a luxury. It's a luxury that I think is a kind of decadent luxury. I don't, I don't approve of it. You may have, may have gotten,

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       but I think I got that idea. So it sounds almost like a sort of like, you see this as like a disease of the Western mind sort of that we've, our, our society because of our freedoms has moved so far past some of these other places that we turn everything on ourselves. We don't realize sort of how good we have it or something to that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       Well, and also it's laziness. It's laziness masquerading as moral sophistication. You know, if, if you go to a dinner party, I mean, I know you went at a, I mean this is, this is squared for you there, but if you were to go to a dinner party and somebody was going to see them about Afghanistan and you wanted to say something really clever about Afghanistan, you would probably say something about how terrible American involvement in Afghanistan has been. Uh, uh, if you signed to any other power other than a western powers involvement in Afghanistan, uh, um, it's not so sophisticated, you know, uh, if you go from America or you go for Britain, you go for yourself, you know, you, you, you look like, you know, something about African history, which let's face it, very few people do. You start to look like, you know, about African history and you also look like you're so morally sophisticated that you can even beat up on yourself. And what it means among other things is you don't actually have to pay attention to the world. You don't have to go anywhere, you don't have to really think about things. You don't really have to keep up to date because every time anything happens you can say, well, there was that time and you know, and, uh, in, uh, and just come up with some date and uh, and hey, presto, you walk away looking like you know something and looking like you're someone.

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       Yeah. You know, it's funny, I never thought of it sort of through the prism that you're presenting it right now, but I think Turkey is a really interesting example of this because if I'm not mistaken, since 1974, Turkey's been in occupation of half of Cypress, right? Isn't that, isn't this an occupation of a sovereign nation?

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       You still have one of my most salient important points I should have gotten.

Speaker 1:          00:28:49       Okay. You all right? So I just tossed it up for you. Take it away.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       I mean, Cypress is, is the most startling example of all, you know, Turkey is a member of NATO and there's an occupation of part of a European country. Uh, and I never hear anyone talking about this. I mean, you know, unless you have Cypriot friends, no one ever raises Cyprus at dinner. Uh, whenever anyone's got a placard on the street marching up and down and in the occupation, they never talking about Cypress. No one ever raises it. Uh, why? Because they don't care and they don't know. And I'm, I know I'm in it. It's these things. You can only point these things out and hope that over time that trickle down to this information gets somewhere, you know, but as I say, in the meantime, people have got a very narrow set of facts and the easiest way out is to think it's our fault.

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       Alright, so I want to delve a little more into, into Israel and Palestine and the imperialism and how it all happen and right. People never talked that. It all started with the Ottoman empire and then the British empire and the mandate and all that stuff. But before we get to that, let's just do a little bit quick on, on Syria right now because it seems to me by every estimation, it's no longer a country under any, under any circumstances that we consider a functioning country. Um, and it seems to me that we're at this point also basically just in a proxy war with the United States pretty much in a proxy war with Russia. And my completely oversimplifying it at this point.

Speaker 2:          00:30:25       Well No, it's not quite approximate war with Russia. It's something else. The truth is, is that Syria is the end of Syria, the end game in this area as it were, which I think we probably are in now, is the end game that aside, and the Iranians always wanted, which is assigned against Isis, um, because if it's a sad against Isis, they know that the world will not back Isis. And you know, earlier this year I started, was interviewed by Jeremy Button at the BBC and said, uh, you know, talks about the opposition as these terrorists of Isis and, you know, some years ago, he wouldn't have been able to get away with that so much. She still can't completely get away with that line now, but some years ago, he certainly couldn't. I knew and worked with some members of Syrian opposition more than 15 years ago, I think to begin with and know and knew that there were people who were very good, who wanted their country not to be run by the Bashar Al Assad family forever and wanted Syria to be the great country it could be.

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       Um, uh, all of our hopes have gone. Most of those people are dead now. And side has got what he wanted and the Iranians have got what they wanted. No one will bag isis, quite rightly so in the end, will allow us to remain in power a look. This is to some extent, um, uh, what happened is when we don't take any interest and don't really get involved, I, I've always been against us intervening in any major way in Syria for one reason in particular, which was that I always said that, uh, after Iraq and Afghanistan, we should realize that we clearly don't have the desire, the willpower or produce the people anymore in your country or mine who want to spend, you know, 20 or 30 years in this country governing bits of it, helping with infrastructure problems, with anything else. We're good at going in and doing the first phase. But we're no good at the follow up and we should realize that. And in the meantime, uh, not be responsible for any country's collapsed. The WHO's who's nation building afterwards, we really don't want to do.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       So you're not a very good neoconservative that I think because wouldn't, because wouldn't all the people that are going to label you neoconservative would say you should be for all these things.

Speaker 2:          00:32:49       Will it be, will he do the labels never listened to to actually say,

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       uh, so what, what should we do then? Basically, I mean without, without really belaboring Syria, because I know we could talk about it for two hours. I mean, at this point watching this country just collapse and Russia filled the vacuum. What should the role of the West v?

Speaker 2:          00:33:06       I don't think we have much of a role now as I say, oh, the, the opportunity for, for backing would go guys, the window closed very early in the conflict. Um, the truth is, is that the future of Syria is not going to be an American hands. It probably never was. It's certainly not and never was going to be in British hands. Iran will win in Syria. Russia will win in Syria. Bashar Al Assad will win in Syria and everyone else, including most of the Syrian people lose. And that's the end game. That's the result. How much would you like it or not like it, but that's the result.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I basically agree with you on that. How much of this do you think is that it's very obvious that, that Obama just wanted out of this part of the world. He just simply wanted out and the way we left Iraq and everything else I was against, I was against, that's going into Libya was against this, Syria, all of this stuff. But to your earlier point, it seems like even if we do something, everyone hates us and if we don't do anything, everyone hates us. Is that the ultimate irony here?

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Well, it's an irony. There are many others as well, but, uh, yes, I mean it is true that when America rack, so it gets blamed on when it doesn't act to get blamed and sometimes that blame is, um, is worth listening to and sometimes it isn't. I mean, to some extent and how you have to listen to who it comes from. I would say, um, uh, um, when people who criticize America or her allies or country like Britain do, so, uh, as helpful critiques, you can usually tell and when people criticize America or Britain or any other country and they're speaking as enemies, you can also tend to tell, um, uh, so you know, that there are lots of things that we can learn from this period. I would think it would be very regrettable if America decided that the response to all of this will be the America will decide, well, we, no one ever loved us anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       So we're going home. You know, you wouldn't have America to kick around anymore. Sort of lap is a Jeb Bush like line. And I, I hope that, I hope that America doesn't take that view, but you know, Obama as, as I hope everyone also learns the lesson of Obama on this. I mean, bomb his predecessor and he found all sorts of ways, uh, uh, to mark up the Middle East, but Obama has as well how many new ways in, in, in, in some ways, uh, you know, a bomb was meant to be the president who, who, who brought the troops home and brought peace in the Middle East and um, you know, he did a bit of that, but he certainly hasn't brought peace anymore than the waters receded and all that other stuff. And it's been a very, it, it, I think the Obama presidency, the end of it, people will realize not that his predecessors were terrific and that he wasn't or anything but that, but the, but the noblest aspirations, uh, it can all go wrong in wholly different ways.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       Doesn't that Egypt speech, the speech he gave in Cairo, which really was the reset, doesn't that seem like not just a different time, it almost feels like it was from a different planet at this point. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:36:04       As, as, as did the Russia reset and as does the Russia reset now, you know, after 9:11, uh, I'm a Dick Armitage. A famously said to the Pakistani ambassador who was saying, you know, uh, oh wait, no new usual guff about, you know, when an Isi and so on, don't know who we know about our cage and all this sort of stuff. Dig On. A teacher said to a bang the table and when the Pakistani ambassador said, you know, there's a lot of history and you said to bang the table and say, history stops today. It's a very noble a, a threat. But it's never true. Um, history didn't start a, uh, nine slash 11. It didn't start with the beginning of the first Obama administration. I, I wish we were wiser about this anyhow.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       Well, I think in a world of twitter and vine and short videos, our attention span just is afraid to the point that people just forget history. People just don't really care about history. So one more quick thing on Syria and then we'll move on. The refugee situation in Europe, which I'm seeing these videos every day coming out of all sorts of different you from Denmark and Sweden and Germany. Just, it sounds like an absolutely terrible situation. And what I think is most interesting about it is nobody had heard about any of it a month ago. I mean, it basically started a month, maybe five, six weeks ago, something like that before that it seemed like there was no refugee crisis and now it seems like an epic refugee crisis.

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       Um, well, I don't know. It looks at that from that.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       That's at least what we were getting mainstream here. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:37:37       in Britain and of course you have, I mean certainly southern job, it's been going on for a very long time. Obviously a and southern Europeans, the Italians and the Greeks in particular and asking for help for a very long time. And if you go, as I did, I'm a producer in south of Italy. It's nearer to Libya than it is to anything else in it. Thinking Sicily, uh, you didn't see the graves of, of migrants who tried to get over going back 15 years or more. Um, so it, it is quite long developing story. It's true that every year in recent years when you get towards the summer months, there's a surge. Obviously it's easier to cross the waters during those months. This is a, by the way, I mean, this is such a hugely complex story and it's one that really, uh, we're all getting wrong. It's a classic example of the sort of twitter age not being, not being really fit for purpose, uh, because this is one of the most extraordinary and vast and migrations that we've seen and it's being misunderstood by almost everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       The majority of the migrants who are coming into Europe and not from Syria for the Syrians comprise of a minority of the migrants. You can pick your presenters, some people think is a narrow and 20 percent some people up to 40. It varies obviously between the points of entry. Um, but, uh, the vast majority are coming from all over the world. So people from Bangladesh, people from coming from a, um, the farther east than that, there are people. The majority, I would think by my mo, my own observation, uh, coming from a sub Sahara in Africa. And so when you hear statesman a saying and pundits and others saying, well, you know, we need to solve Syria for instance, and then we'll solve the migrant crisis. These people don't know what they're talking about, even if it was in America or Britain or any other countries, gift to solve the humanitarian catastrophe of Syria that would only solve a part of the migraine crises.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       Yeah. What's your plan for Eritrea? Has Anyone got one? Has Anyone fortive one? Can anyone point to Eritrea or on a map? Uh, uh, we are so not fit for purpose in rising to this challenge. And all that can happen. I don't know if you having to lower the tone somewhat. Benedict cumberbatch, uh, uh, one of my compatriots was on stage in London the other night, finished a performance of hamlet and berated the crowd and berated British politicians for not bringing in enough people. That is the clever, a caring thing to say at the moment. We must open our doors. Refugees welcome. You know what? In the UK, a recent poll showed only seven percent of the British people wanted immigration into the UK to increase seven percent. It's the same across Europe. People don't mind accepting genuine refugees, but no one knows what to do with a number of refugees, genuine refugees who are coming and absolutely nobody knows, including Chancellor Merkel who having saved Europe, uh, in the financial crisis has now totally floundered on the refugee crisis.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       And Angela Merkel doesn't know what to do. The European Commission just recently tried to force quotas on European countries to take migrants they couldn't and didn't want to take. And as the European Commission issued that they admitted that that number they were talking about was not fit for purpose because the number was so much higher. What I'm trying to convey, this is a continent wide catastrophe, which we are at the beginning of. And I think, uh, as I say, we haven't even begun to rise to it and we're going to see, I think terrible things. A winter's coming. Uh, uh, Sweden is now putting refugees intense because it's run out of properties. Sweden took the view. Let's let, let, let's show the world how generous we are. Let's be, they said a humanitarian superpower. Now they're going to have to raise taxes. They've got increasing public opinion against them and the top party in the polls in Sweden, the humanitarian, uh, uh, uh, um, hyper power of Sweden is the party of the January called far right now, top of the polls in Sweden. And we're going to see that everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:41:49       Yeah. Is that, is that what's coming next? Because that is what I feared that I think somebody like Bender Benedict Cumberbatch, I think there's some well intended intentioned humanistic thing going on here. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:42:01       well I don't know about that actually. I mean maybe, maybe they just want to look like they're doing that, but, but if you, you know, it comes back to a really a core mistake or error. If you want to be generous, be generous, but don't demand other people to be generous for you. Uh, the head of the Scottish nationalist party a little while ago since she would be willing to take in a Syrian family. It's months since she said that. And as far as I know, there are no Syrians living with her. Uh, one of the top members of the Labour party said the same thing months ago. So far as I know, she hasn't got a Syrian family in her house. Um, I think this is posturing and it really, it's not sincere because if you said to those people, look for numbers that are actually coming and look at the numbers of people who say they want to come, you will realize that it is not only economically but societaly unsustainable. So you would have to realize that

Speaker 1:          00:42:56       yeah. So under the best of circumstances, bringing these people in would be extremely difficult. And basically what you're saying is we're doing this or this is being done under the worst of circumstances because there's just simply no controls here.

Speaker 2:          00:43:11       Well, there's no good. Doesn't nobody knows who's coming. Most people destroy their papers before they get here. Most people pretend to be a, a Syrians, even when they're very obviously not. Um, and, and the truth is, as I've seen in covering this story in the south of Europe, the truth is, is that once you're in European waters, your, your in Europe and you never, you never go back. There is no, uh, there's no particularly good way. Even when this was a low point, there was no particularly sophisticated way to work out who was, who and to work out who was genuine, who was an economic migrant and that's whole system is basically broken down now. So once you're in, you're in and uh, um, I think this is going to, it's going to obviously approve a potentially breaking challenge for Europe because these are, uh, the owner, Germany is meant to be bringing one percent of its population in addition every year for the foreseeable future. Who pays for that? Who Pays for those people? I mean, you know, I'm not heartless about this. I would like to see everywhere genuine refugees get asylum in countries, hopefully return to their countries and help rebuild them when they're safe again. But I would like genuine asylum seekers to get assigned. But the moment, the whole thing is so tied up that actually I think Europe's heart is going to harden towards all of these people and in that lack of attention to the detail, I think yes, across Europe we see a catastrophe starting.

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       Yeah. What do you make of the Gulf countries? You know, Kuwait, Bahrain, united, Arab Emirates, etc. I read this morning that the six main gulf countries have taken in zero refugees. These are theIr brothers, are they not? I mean, what, what's going on here,

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       brothers? In the same way that the, uh, palestinians have their brothers. We'll get to that next. Uh, um, well, look at the gulf state countries bringing no syrian refugees. And one, one kuwaiti official, uh, uh, rina recent interview was asked why and said, I'm a, an interview in arabic. It's on the net. Uh, said, uh, that the reason was because a qa, you have to understand, he said that we are very fragile island countries. We are, we can't take in all these people. They are traumatized. They come from a different culture. You know, it's a different culture. Syria, we can't put up with them in the gulf as much more like Sweden. Why don't you go to Norway, Sweden, uh, um, and so now, and you see, it's another thing of people's good instincts being used against the european is here. I don't hear that. What european see is catastrophe, what did we do? We must be responsible. What's our responsibility? We must do this. We must do it even if it breaks us and, and over in the gulf, taking in zero people and they don't give a damn about it. And frankly I think they probably find it quite funny that the europeans have fallen for the idea that this whole catastrophe, it's the fault of the europeans.

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       Yeah. Alright. So I do want to move on, but I have to backup for a second. So what are you thinking in the mind of someone like angela merkel? What do you think? She's actually thinking. She has to know that it's not sustainable. Right. And I get it. She's either trying to have these lofty goals of trying to do something on humanitarian grounds or whatever. What do you think really is going on in her head? Also knowing that, as you said before, this probably is going to strengthen the far right in Germany.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       Yeah. I mean it, uh, Germany, it may, it may not actually be possible to solve it because in Germany for all sorts of obvious historical reasons, uh, if you, if you say, if you say in britain, uh, I don't know, we might have a migration so large that a british culture, but it's a cycle basically over. If you were to say that if you've always not true at the moment, but I mean if somewhere down the road you were to say that you, you would still get most british people sort of thing that, you know, we're nice guy. We enjoying ourselves a country where we've been broadly a force for good in the world. They wouldn't want britain to be over. Germany has a different thing. There are a lot of people in Germany, a who for historical reasons and some understandable historical reasons. Basically think that german guilt can never be alleviated and the anything other than the destruction of Germany could never, never rid Germany of its sins.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       Now, my own view is that those people may be in the years ahead themselves in a minority. I think it's quite hard to tell young germans that because of something their grandparents did, they have to abolish themselves as a country or as a society, but they've definitely got the problem harder nicely. You can see that in angela merkel's response angle America when she was asked recently at the press conference by nice german lady who just sort of said, you know, isn't this, isn't this a problem for our country? And I am concerned for my country. I was just brushed off by anglo marco as if this woman was some wacko weirdo. It who'd come from recess deville. And you see this all throughout. Let me give you one other very quick example of their least paquita protests, which I don't aGree with. I'm, I'm concerned about them.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       Uh, but I think that they are, there are all sorts of things. They are obviously an anti islam protests. They will spend 90 migration process and all sorts of other things, but it's a legitimate, uh, I'm used to be with time as legitimate political grievance and needs to, needs to have an eric angle, merkel users her new year message to say that the piggy to protesters have a coldness in their hearts if instead of that she had said the islamists who the buggy to protests are mainly concerned about have coldness in their hearts and we as germans must be careful not in response to this hatred to become hateful ourselves. Then that might be something. But because he, angela merkel's problem is she can only deal with secondary problems. She can't deal with the primary ones. Very, very. I said that will be a final, final, final point.

Speaker 2:          00:49:09       I don't know if you saw it, but the other week a fascinating thing happened at the un in New York angle. Merkel was sitting next to mark zuckerberg for lunch and, uh, unfortunately, uh, angela merkel's microphone was hot. Everyone in politics and how the hot mic moment, but how mike was still on it. Possibly the worst moment of could have been. I'm amazed it hasn't been picked up more, but she sat down to lunch beside mark zuckerberg in september in New York and said, whilst the mic was on tomorrow, looking at what can we do to stop people writing anti-immigration things on facebook, and mark zuckerberg says, we're working on it now. Look, I say This just as possible. If you wanted to create a volcano in europe, the best way to do it will be to shut down and stop legitimate public feeling about things and to say that is no good saying that you objected to the migration on facebook. It should be stopped. That is the biggest way, the fastest way to make sure the volcano blows out of the site.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       Yeah, and it seems so obvious to me that this is what the regressive left has done by labeling everyone who doesn't agree with them racist. They've created a situation where good intentioned people, liberals are now finding themselves agreeing on a lot of things with people on the far right who they agree with. nothing else on the danger,

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       I think. I think. I think the fact

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       is, is that what the left has done in recent years with the term racist has basically ended up, uh, denuding the term of having any meaning and, or am or much meaning anyway, because if, if everybody can be called a racist at some point, and generally very often, at least for various various grounds, it means that you basically got no terminology left when an actual racist comes along and I can sort of sense the people just, I'm not going to end up not caring. Uh, in the future. I've always said, I want this solved. I want this problem. These sorts of problems dealt with in order. They're not dealt in the coming decades by marine le pen and the, your hydration elements in Austria, but a few people listen. Yeah, I mean, I totally hear that and that's why I'm trying to bring this message that if we have to get the left back, otherwise we're just going to hand everything over to the right, which would be a disaster.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       All right. Let's talk a little more about the middle east. Let's talk about Israel. Palestine. We can probably knock that out and just a few minutes and everyone will be satisfied. Right? Um, okay. So buddy seconds, thIrty seconds. Let's do it. So I thought maybe the best way to do this because I do know how much you know about history. Um, where should we start with this because what I'm noticing lately is that, you know, as we're seeing the stabbings and the shootings and all this, the debate is rarely about what's happening right now, but now the debate is starting to be on the partition plan. Ah, the british mandate. Like now it's starting to be unfurled and people don't understand history as we alluded to earlier. So where is a good place if we're going to have a decent discussion and try to get some common ground here, where is a good place to start with the, with the Israel palestine situation?

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       I think the only place you to start is from where we are really, and an acceptance that on the part of people who are broadly anti as well and acceptance by those people that Israel exists and that it's not going anywhere. You know, I've, I, I've spent a lot of time there in the surrounding areas and the west bank and so on and spoken with a lot of palestinian representatives and so on. And one of the saddest things is when you hear them talk about the occupation and you discovered that talking about the occupation from 1948 because then you say, you know what, you're, you're giving your future generations know, hope you're selling them a lie. You're telling them that we'll get back to tel aviv, you know, we'll get back to the whole of jerusalem will get back heifer. And so it's not going to happen is they're a bit, they're selling the young people a crock.

Speaker 2:          00:53:00       And, and I think it's a tragedy if it's, if they accepted that Israel is not going anywhere and Israel felt confident enough that the palestinians accepted that, then the negotiations for the border dispute, uh, uh, frankly quite straightforward. Um, uh, you can see, you can, you can see them on the ground. You can see basically, uh, you know, the israelis have one and basically when the palestinians have one and you can see that, you know, the, the, the, the, the basis for what's often been called the world's ugliest border. Uh, but, but, you know, you have to start from the premise, let Israel is not going anywhere. And, and I think it is one of the most striking things, uh, that in 2015, so many debates on college campuses and in the media and so on, don't accept that fact. And you know, if we had a conversation about a Pakistan and uh, and we started by saying, you know, should Pakistan have been created or not as a mistake? And we wonder If we could rectify this error. You know, people would say, what are you talking about? It's 20 slash 15. Pakistan's got all sorts of problems we need to talk about. But uh, why are we talking about this? This is, this is a problem from seven decades ago. you'd be a maniac. But, but, but on Israel that's thought quite normal. Israel and Pakistan to the same age, and these, these crazy Israel obsessives uh, uh, keeP going back to the basis and they're not going to win. That's over. That's done.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       So what do you make of these people? so because I see that, I see very clearly, I try to tweet as much stuff as I can about coexistence. I want there to be two states for two people and understand that people can't live in occupation. And I want everyone to be treated with dignity and have the right to self determination and all that. but I see nothing except on the, on the left. All I see is just this relentless demonization of Israel. No matter, no matter what they do. Look, they left gaza. There's not one jew and guys, a hitler would love the place, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       Yeah. No, yeah, you'd feel right at home in certain Way. Is that. Yeah. But, uh, but the problem is that by the way, when you said tuesday, the tuesday solution doesn't exist. It's dead. It's gone. Uh, the best you can hope for now as a three state solution because it's in no one's gift to unite the palestinian.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       Right? So I want to, I wanted to ask you about that too because it really is a three states. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:55:25       Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It'd be which you'd stopped using the two to state idea. Um, but you then have to ask some serious questions about the negotiating partners on both sides. Now people like to say here and again, the clever thing to say is, well, you know, six of one, half a dozen of the other and so on. It is simply not the case that the israeli prime minister, it Uses the rhetoric about the palestinians like palestinian, moderate, so called moderate leader. Mahmoud abbas is used in recent weeks about the jews. Uh, you know, mahmoud abbas was talking about the, we, we, we don't want the filthy feet of the jews on our holy sites. I mean this doesn't even get very much coverage outside of the region. And if benjamin netanyahu had made a speech where he said, we don't want any filthy muslim or arab feet in our land, I reckon that would've made the front paGe of the New York times, you know, I think it would be being, I think people would know about it, does the most extraordinary incitement now in the most extraordinary denigration and, and all that, all that, uh, allegedly, right thinking people in the west can do is to say this is the man with whom you must do piece because he's not as, um, I, I think that the world should, should concentrate less on the israeli palestinian dispute.

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       You know, I think it's, um, it's over egged. It's got too much attention on it. None of the attention helps. there are intractable problems around the world. Uh, the sovereign question, the western starland question, a cypress, all sorts of ones. And, and actually a massive amounts of international opprobrium and attention do nothing to solve these conflicts. Uh, um, you know, we have seen in recent years the, the, the, the motif of our time fall apart in the middle east. And that was, and it was said by everybody from light, from right and left throughout my upbringing. At any rate, if you could only unlock the problem of the paleStinian israeli dispute, the rest of the middle east will be solved. I heard this for years. Uh, you know, some of the israeli palestinian border dispute and the economy of Yemen will boom and the iranians will see the point of gay rights and the saudis will understand, you know, the potential utility of women in this society. It was obviously nonsense then, but we've seen it's nonsense in recent years we've seen it because the middle east has managed to fall apart with zero israeli involvement.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       YeAh. So is that the bigger issue here? Is that sort of, that we're really talking about a three day thing because gaza and the west bank are totally separate ruled by different people. And there's no reason to think that if a boss signed an agreement that hamas would abide by it. I mean, in their, in their, uh, you know, their, what do they call it, their charter. It says Kill all the jews. So they're not going to suddenly change, so they're not. So that's the strange part as I see people in the west saying, well, you know, just make a solution, make a magical solution, and they'll stop wanting to kill you. But it doesn't seem like there's a

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       connection for those people. It's not about the middle east. They've gfo never been there. They don't, they don't know anyone there. Uh, it's about them. Goes back to that point I made the star. It's about them. Uh, if, if, if you say how concerned you are about this situation, you come across as virtuous and knowledgeable cad. It's way out,

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       right? And yet there's one place in the middle east that stands for their progressive values

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       now and now they use the progressive values against it. Totally. But if you highlight the fact that, you know, uh, that in isRael, uh, gays have everyone in one and in every other country in the region, you get hanged people, god said, detail why you bother, why, why you pink washing, why, why you doing this house for them and you, you're actually, you know, for me it's not a detail. I mean, I, I mind whether I'm hanging with or not, uh, uh, mind whether other gays are hanged on our mind, what their views are, and a whole range of things in mind. There's a difference between a society in Israel is actually talking about what you do about ivf rights for lesbian couples and a few miles away, uh, lesbians, lesbians don't get a look in on the ivf treatment or anything else I mind about that. These are details, but all of these things that used to be the things we used to say, well, what we used to call me, the things that matter are now a brushed aside as being odd. Don't you bore me with all that, all that, all that, all that, all those facts. So you keep comIng up with.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       Yeah. All right, well you gave me a great segue there because I wanted to discuss one personal thing with you because you're,

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       I personal. You're going to get.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       Well, we'll see. We'll see how far I can push it. You're openly gay. That phrase seems silly to me. You're gay. Um, and I wonder if for you. I'm gay also. I don't know if you know that, um, or, and it shouldn't matter in any context of anything we're talking about here, but I wonder for you, how much of the principles that you're talking about and wanting to help when you talk about the lesbian that might live in gaza under hamas or any of this stuff, you know, the people being thrown off the roofs by isis or women's rights here, there, how much of whAt you talk about and what you care about, do you think has been colored by the fact that you and a lot of respects are the other at the same time?

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       Yeah, a bit. I think it's easy to over again most of my political ideas or not, uh, not based on I know who I am or, or, you know, then I like to think they're not me centric. Um, I didn't like in politics on me centric because I'm something therefore I have to, I like to think I, I try to use reason and go beyond identity politics. I suppose there was some things which you notice some things which you might notice first. I do have a sort of view that when it comes to radical islam, of what we've seen in recent years, a set of early warning sirens going off basically around the world and some of those early warning sirens are gay. Um, some of them, I mean bruce banner, for instance, the gay writer in scandinavia who went off as an early warning signal, you know, uh, some of them are feminists, some of them are, um, some of them are from our religious dissidence or you know, minorities within a minority.

Speaker 2:          01:01:50       And, and of course some of jews. And I, I think in a way that's interesting because as I said, I do think it's a basis for my interest or focus on these areas. But I think it's true that the, there's, um, there's a lovely phrase that the composer benjamin britten volunteers, and I'll let her to another composer. He said that, um, the composers have one less layer of skin than everyone else. And I've often often thought that might apply in some of these very programmatic world events that were sort of starting to go through at the moment, is that there are a set of people who feel it just a little bit before everyone else. And I think that's true of gay people. A lot of gay people, a lot of them have raised close to that and don't care a lot or don't take notice. I think it's true of a lot of jews. I think it's true of a lot of minorities within islam who suffered, um, and, and others. So it's true that it might be a habit, sort of early warning effect. But apart from that, I, I like to think that my politics don't come from any rabbit.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       Yeah. No, I, I think the same thing about myself because I hate identity politics obviously. And yet I do. I feel this kinship when I hear about gay people being killed somewhere in the middle east just for being who they are. And then at the same time, they're also, when you repress all these people, it's fertile ground for all of the awful religious stuff to also take root. So it's so multilayered. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       But, but, you know, I mean, I do think that the, I do think the big problem of our time is the identity in, in, in the western side is, is this, is this basically self centered way of looking into the world. I haven't absolute bugbear, which is people who start Questions by saying, speaking as a and then say, you know, speaking as a gay man or whatever. I mean, you, you do it if you know it's going to wind the hell out of someone I suppose. But I don't like that. I don't like it when people start off as either speaking as a woman of puerto rican descent or anything. I get it again, you know, if your point is good, it'll be valid, whoever's saying it. Um, but unfortunately, uh, um, I mean the whole, the, the, the amazing thing. We're seeing a moment of that sort of breakdown.

Speaker 2:          01:04:02       I think of identity politics. It's having a breakdown. I at the moment and that partly is it is coming because it was always going to collapse under the, the way to its own absurdities and the only answer to that when you sift through the rubble of that strange spasmic collike movement in recent years and the only way out of it will be through reason and, and, and using rationalism and, and, and, and not trying to work out what we think about the world from what is most convenient for me because I may, but uh, but trying to work things out on principles and there's quite a lot of work to do.

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       Right? Which is so crazy because when you think about it now I've sat here with you for probably about 50 minutes or so. I got no indication that you Were racist or a xenophobe or any of the other things that people might say about you. I only got an indication that you want to deal with the realities as they are not sort of as you want them to be. A. So my last question for ya, and I barely looked at my notes because we could do this for hours and I hope next time you're in town, we'll, we'll do it in person. But my last question is gimme gimme some hope. What can we, what can we take at this interesting moment as you said, you see identity politics crumbling. I see the same thing. What can we as a secular people as, as atheists, as people that care about gay people, all of that stuff. WhaT can we take from this sort of precarious moment where at and, and sort of feel good for, for the future.

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       Good luck. I think optimism is overrated. I don't like the idea. One has to be optimistic or pessimistic or anything. I wouldn't have to sort of look at things as they are. And sometimes you might wake up in the morning feeling optimistic and you might lose it by lunchtime. Sometimes you might go out in the evening feeling pessimistic and come home optimistic. Who knows? These are things that come and go. Um, I, I think there's a lot that one can be optimistic about. Um, you know, I, I do have a view that I'm trying to finish a book about this at the moment. I do have a view that I'm, one of the things that multimedia and social media things has done and is doing at the moment is, is it going to create a reform within islam or change within islam because what people are having to face up to is now coming to them at a speed which in, for instance in christianity took a couple of centuries to drift down from learning institutions in Germany, for instance, down to the person on the street, um, that took a couple of centuries in the past.

Speaker 2:          01:06:38       And now it's happening with unbelievable speed. I think it's going to be a, this is the bad news, quite bloody and a very bad for a period. Um, but after that it means that we'll be out of it within a fairly short space of time. Um, as for other things, I mean, you know, people, people's access to ideas and things, you know, obviously we hear a lot about all of the craziness that goes on the web and elsewhere, but people's access to ideas now, it's never been better. Um, and people, people geT to find out the good things as well. you know, what, you can open your computer in the morning and read about a train crash somewhere that you've never heard of until that day. And you can feel sad for a bit and people do and people feel overwhelmed with the amount of information, the, well, the amount of negative things.

Speaker 2:          01:07:30       But, uh, I, I think in middle of that as well, you know, you have to have a life and you have to try to think your way through the things that are going on. And I, I think the, the most important thing is the appeal for something beyond a, a utopia. Something other than utopia. Religions and others constantly told people how to get utopia in the afterlife when this life, most political movements promise people utopia. Utopia is called utopia for a reason. It's no place it doesn't exist, it never did. It never will, but in the meantime, it's a much better thing to think of how You can make the lives of the people around you better and how you can broadly have a good influence in the world at the time you've gone, but not to think that your role is to make everything else better for everyone else in the world when you come to even help mom with the dishes unit and and, and, but as I say, I mean, the only thing I can think of that that's positive is the fact that all this is happening so fast now that just as things can screw up at an amazing speed, it's possible.

Speaker 2:          01:08:40       It is possible that they can also be sold at an amazing speed, but that won't bring us nirvana. It just is an appeal that, that will have to keep on paying attention. I have to keep on concentrating and reading and thinking about these things.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       All right. I actually, I think that was pretty lofty right there. It was a pleasure chatting with you and I fully get why so many people wanted this to happen. By the way, I should mention that your ebook, islam ophelia, isn't available online anymore. Uh, but you're, you're rolling it into a new book that you're working on right now. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:09:12       I'm very proud is affiliate with an ebook I wrote a quite swiftly a couple years ago and, uh, I was very proud of the fact we immediately beat the chron and the best seller lists on amazon, uh, around the globe. And I thought, well, I'm onto Something here. It's true. It's true that mohammed had a head start. But anyhow, I'm finishing a book at the moment that incorporates islam affiliate, which is a word I wish I could encourage people to, to use more.

Speaker 1:          01:09:39       All right, well, we'll see if it picks up for more info on the work that douglas is doing. You guys can check out Henry Jackson society.org and douglas. He was, it was an absolute pleasure. So thanks. Thanks a lot for doing this.

Speaker 2:          01:09:52       Yeah.
