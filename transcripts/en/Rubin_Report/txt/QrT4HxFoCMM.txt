Speaker 1:          00:02          We're going to be talking about marijuana this week. I'll give you guys just a sec to roll a joint, pack a bowl or put fresh water in the bond. Of course, those are just a couple of the old school ways of getting stone these days. It also includes vaping, waxes, edibles and oils. I should tell you, I've tried all of them a couple times each to cure this darn glaucoma. I diagnosed myself with back in high school. I still have been being cured, but there is always hope before we get into a big discussion about marijuana, meaning legalization, health benefits, recreational use, and more. It's only fair if I tell you guys a bit about my history with weed. After smoking, my first joint during Sophomore Year of college for a couple of years, I was probably what most would consider a pothead. I'd get stoned and watch TV, right, or go grocery shopping and gathering all the best snacks I could get ahold of.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I should note I never got into a fight, robbed a bank or murdered anyone while smoking weed. After College. I smoke now and again, usually while just hanging out with friends, despite the marijuana raging through our systems, we also seem to never get into a fight. Rob a bank or murder anyone since moving to la where medicinal marijuana is legal, at least on the state level. I got my med card and I smoke every couple weeks. Usually I enjoy a nice bowl at the end of a long day when I just want to veg out and watch Seinfeld or the simpsons and to this day I haven't gotten into a fight, robbed a bank or murdered anyone while smoking weed. When it comes to marijuana, I'm a libertarian through and through what I do with my own body in my own house is nobody else's business, much less the government.

Speaker 1:          01:42          As long as I'm not doing harm to another person, then I have the right to do as I wish. As a citizen. This is a place where libertarianism makes absolute sense to me. We don't even have to get into the health benefits or the dangers of other currently legal drugs. The liberal argument for weed is pretty good too, which basically is. It's not doing any real damage, so you should be able to smoke it. Plus we're putting too many people in jail for partaking in a drug that generally doesn't lead to criminal behavior. This is a case where libertarians and classical liberals take on something really lines up. On the other hand, conservatives in the US have generally been against marijuana. They call it a gateway drug, which is pretty much like calling Gerber's a gateway. Food conservatives have scared people into thinking that marijuana will make you a criminal or degenerate and they don't mind wasting your taxpayer money, locking up people for a personal choice that they do with their own bodies.

Speaker 1:          02:42          There are some conservatives who even now with all we know about the multiple benefits of marijuana are still against legalizing even at a medicinal level. Ironically, it's conservatives who also preach about small government. Yet they seem to want to regulate what you do in the privacy of your own home, while at the same time wasting taxpayer dollars, which they say they want to save on trumped up criminal charges. Of course, none of these examples are perfect, which is why ran Paul Libertarian still hasn't fully come around on the marijuana issue and Hillary Clinton, a Democrat hasn't either. Meanwhile, the Republican candidates are all against it in one form or another, despite the fact that the only tolerable way to watch a republican debate is milestone. The one candidate who I do think understands the issue is Bernie Sanders, who wants to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. Ironically, in this incidence, it's the big government guy who is making the government smaller by getting them out of your private life and not putting you in jail for having a good time.

Speaker 1:          03:44          If you are sick with cancer or with Parkinson's, why should the government or any other human being be able to stop you from doing anything that would alleviate your pain and suffering? If you get caught with marijuana, should you have your life ruined by being thrown in a federal jail? If you get really high and watched the wizard of Oz with dark side of the moon, playing in the background doesn't really sync up. These are just some of the important questions that talking about weed brings up. My guest this week is Angel Tieger Angeles, part of the Los Angeles medical cannabis taskforce and owns her own edibles company, Ruby Doobie. She got involved with marijuana after Western medicine, failed to help her with her debilitating migraines. Angel now speaks about the medicinal benefits of marijuana, the ongoing quest for legalization and removing the stigma attached to the conversation. Some of you have probably heard me tell the story of how in 1997 I went to see the movie Air Force One after eating some pot brownies with a couple of friends.

Speaker 1:          04:41          The movie was sold out, so we walked into another movie called contact, which I had never heard of. Remember that incredibly mindblowing, extended panorama of the universe that opens the movie. Well, it may sound Corny, but my world actually felt bigger. After seeing that movie stoned, I ended up reading many of the books by Carl Sagan, who is the author of contact and brilliant scientists. After seeing that movie, that stoned moment opened up something in me that got me interested in many of the ideas that I talk about today. Maybe it would have happened without the weed, but it sure didn't hurt. That also reminds me, I'd love to tell you about the week I spent in the red light district in Amsterdam a couple of years ago. I just can't remember any of it.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Angel Tieger is a speaker and activist and an entrepreneur. She works with the La Cannabis medical task force and runs her own cannabis edibles company known as Ruby Doobie and we've got a lot of Ruby doobie goodies in front of us right now. Angel, thanks for. Thanks for joining me. Thank you for inviting me. Dave. Yeah. I'm very excited to talk to you because I've wanted to do something a little more in depth on pot for a long time. And uh, and you brought pot cookies and brownies. Let's get into this stuff first and then we'll talk about the history and legalization. What, what are we going

Speaker 2:          05:58          in front of some of the things that I make. I'm sweet dreams Brownie. It's a dusted with a little bit of sea salt on top. It's about 57 milligrams here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Fifty seven milligrams of thc. What does that mean? So you, you eat that. How do you feel after?

Speaker 2:          06:15          Well, I personally would not eat a whole Brownie. I would have half and that's plenty for me, but it really depends on your metabolism and your, your, uh, how experienced you are and it can differ on things depending on the day and on how much you've eaten that day. But um, and, and dosage, dosage guidelines. Very, you know, I've seen a recommended dosages that between five and 15 milligrams for people or some who want between 20 and 30

Speaker 1:          06:48          and this is all sort of unchartered territory for a lot of people because for a long time, you know, I, I think I said once I, the show, when I got my weed card I went in there and I said, you know, they showed me wax. They showed me oil. They showed me edibles and I said, well, do you have any just weed, you know, green buds, like old fashioned weed. And that made me feel like, oh, like, oh, that guy wants to smoke weed, but this is sort of the new thing, right?

Speaker 2:          07:10          Well, I mean, you, I think not as many people are familiar with edibles, but it's been around and um, it's a great way to make use of the whole plant because really what, when you smoke, you're smoking the flowers, the buds, but you still have all of the leaves and the trim and the small buds and all of that has you active ingredients in it too. And that's primarily what I use to make my goodies. And here's the peanut butter Brownie. A ginger cookie crew is very excited by the way. Oh, I'm happy a ginger cookies and cream cookies and chocolate chip cookies. And I make cakes and other things

Speaker 1:          07:51          to lemon bars. So you make all this stuff and this is for people that may want the medicinal benefits. This is for people that may want the recreational benefits. A, it doesn't matter to you, right? Like you're selling it for then and yeah, it's nice if someone could alleviate some pain.

Speaker 2:          08:07          Well, I worked with the dispensary's, I worked with a handful of dispensaries in, in my area. Um, so I, I'm, I'm a member that's, that's providing edibles for my fellow members. Sure. And um, you know, you can't really, you can't in California, you still have to get a doctor's recommendations even go to those dispensary's so it isn't tried and it's tough to make the distinction between what's recreate for, in my mind, it's, it's tough to distinguish between a recreational and medicinal because if it's, if you're using it to relax at the end of the day and um, to, to distress.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Yeah. Um, all right, so let's get a little bit into your story and then we'll talk about business and legalization and all that shit. So you got into, we'd basically, I think you were smoking it recreationally, but the reason you really got into this was because you were having migraines and pretty much the western medicine that you were trying

Speaker 2:          09:15          wasn't working, right? Yes, but I, I think there were two forces that kind of a both intersected in and drove me into cannabis and definitely my migraines. Um, I, I've had migraines for many, many years and about 10 years ago they started getting a lot worse and more frequent and I was, I'm trying all kinds of different medications. I had, um, steroids injected into my nap to try to get rid of them. I had some prescriptions that were so strong that they require the triplicate prescription and nothing helped me. I mean a, lots of times that the drugs would irritate my stomach so much that I would feel worse sometimes they would just knock me out and that's how I survived my migraines.

Speaker 2:          10:10          And cannabis is really what allowed me to, to continue living and manage them without having to check out for weeks at a time or days at a time. Um, so that definitely treating my migraines was one for us. And also a desire to simplify my life. You know, I, um, I was working at the x prize foundation. I was a chief of staff there and um, you know, very rewarding, challenging position. Um, but I just felt that there was something missing. You know, I, I wasn't spending very much time with my son who was two years old at the time, uh, I would have to travel a lot and um, I just wanted to create a change in my life where I would, uh, not be so dependent on, on a check, a grow, grow my own food and Cook my own meals and, and rather than pay someone to do this and that, I wanted to do those things I wanted to be the one with, with my family. Right.

Speaker 1:          11:25          So that's really interesting. So it wasn't just I want to get stoned and had the good time. You got into the edible garden thing, which was nice. You were growing weed but you were also growing stuff to actually eat and to eat

Speaker 2:          11:38          your child. We were growing and at one point we were going enough food in our garden that it was too much for us to even eat. I mean, neighbors would come and we encouraged our neighbors to come and, um, tomatoes, artichokes, peppers, eggplants, a, uh, collared Greens, Shard Kale. I mean, we still have, you know, lemon trees, apple trees, a nectarines, oranges. It's a beautiful thing to, to just go outside and pick your food and you know, you don't have to get in your car. You can't get anything fresher than that.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Yeah, it's funny. I have, I mean, I live in La too and you know, I have a little outdoor space with a little garden and even if I'm just plucking tomatoes or something, I find that very therapeutic. Oh, it is just that action of doing, of growing something for yourself, whether it's marijuana or a tomato or pepper or something. Even right there connecting with nature. So this is all intertwined with ultimately you going into this business.

Speaker 2:          12:41          I believe so. I mean, it's wanting to simplify, wanting to be more in touch with nature, you know, it's, it's so easy to get disconnected from food and to know what food looks like when it's actually growing. I mean, um, when I, uh, when we first planted our garden, it was with the help of a nonprofit called La Green grounds and uh, we had 50 volunteers come out and help us plant our front yard and our parkways and um, I was intimidated because I had never tried to grow food before and I didn't know how it all worked and it's never put my hands in the dirt and planted anything and to watch things grow and to be able to feed my family that way and, and help, you know, feed the neighborhood. Um, it was an amazing experience. And food. Food is medicine. You know, cannabis is medicine. I mean, I really don't see much of a difference. Right?

Speaker 1:          13:45          So you see this green thing that grows naturally from the earth, like all this other stuff that we eat. You see that just sort of as an extension of every other thing, but the city wasn't that thrilled. Right? With your, with your garden. So here you are a person that sort already takes life into your own hands on your own property and the city of Los Angeles. What did they do?

Speaker 2:          14:05          Well, okay. Going back a little while. I. What got me inspired to plant the garden was I watched a Ted talk by Ron Finley. I don't know if you've heard of him, the, uh, a guerrilla garden against gangster gardener. So the whole idea of that he presented growing your own food is like printing your own money. I mean, there was some things that just resonated so deeply with me that immediately after I saw the talk, I, I got in touch with la green grounds and said, I need to learn how to do this. How, how can I volunteer? Um, and, uh, it turns out they were actually looking for an la resident. I'm a to plant a garden. Um, and, uh, the timing was perfect. So we planted, we were selected in and that's how we got our garden. Um, so yeah,

Speaker 1:          15:01          the city though, didn't want you to do it at some point. Right. So Ron, when he, when he did his ted talk, he had planted an edible garden a few years before mine

Speaker 2:          15:11          and was cited and um, went to city council and, uh, made the case that it doesn't make sense. You should allow people to grow food on their, on their parkways, and the city council at that time agreed and said that, um, they would work to change the laws and fast forward two years later, I plant, we plant our garden and I was operating under the assumption that it was all good. Right? But the changes were in the works. Um, but a few months after, um, this w we were cited, I'm a guy, came to my house and kind of aggressively said, you know, all of this has to come out and you have 48 hours to put it all back to the way it was. And,

Speaker 1:          16:00          and there's nothing to do with weed. Just to me, this is growing squash, eggplants. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          16:08          Yeah. Things like that. So, um, that because we had the support of a lot of, you know, La Green grounds and Ron and um, it was easy to, to get attention drawn to the, to the issue it had been going on for some time. Steve Lopez from the La Times came out and wrote an article about our, our garden and it, it, uh, it helped bring the city council's attention back to this issue and I'm not long after that they did change the laws so anyone in La can, can, uh, grow fruits and vegetables on their, on their parkway before you had to. There was only a short list of approved things you could grow. And if you wanted to deviate from that, you had to, uh, I think a file a request and I think it was like $400. Stephen asked just to ask

Speaker 1:          17:03          to use your own property, your own yes. And then, you know, you might not get the approval.

Speaker 2:          17:10          Now, I think the way the law reads is you can grow whatever you want except for, um, uh, some, some fruit trees are not allowed to be on the parkway. But it was, it's a huge step.

Speaker 1:          17:21          Right? Right now, as long as you have a medical marijuana license, you can also grow weed. I'm guessing you can't do that in the front of your house though with. I don't think I would say it would be such a good idea. Probably not the greatest idea. All right, well I don't want to get too into the weeds on that. No Pun intended, but I thought it was an interesting way to start because it shows how marijuana and legalization and the distal uses and all that are so tied into our legal system and then we can get into some of that stuff. So. All right, so you have the Migraines, you start saying, all right, I'm going to smoke weed to make myself feel better. How long did it take to figure out what worked for you, what actually was the right strain? And can you talk about strains a little bit?

Speaker 2:          18:03          You know, I, I, I know with some conditions, um, people look for particular strains. Um, uh, you know, I think. Okay, so there, there are. Yeah, let's do, let's do one on one. When you talk about cannabis there a cannabis, indica and sativa, right? I'm sit there. They look different physically, like sativa plants are usually taller and leaner, thinner branches and a grow better in warmer climates. Indicas are kind of shorter and Bush year and heartier. Um, besides that, indicas are usually, um, they helped you relax. You, um, most people will use them at night to as a sleep aid or um, and sativas generally will give you more energy and let you keep more focus. So more people will use. Sativa is during the day because you can still function

Speaker 1:          19:09          all my comedian friends that get stoned on sativas and write all day.

Speaker 2:          19:14          Right? And then, um, uh, within, uh, okay, so you have strains that are either endeca or sativa or they can be a hybrid. Um, and then each particular strain has its own, uh, profile, uh, how much thc is in there, how much cbd is in there.

Speaker 1:          19:35          So let's unpack that a little bit. So thc is the psychoactive part. Correct. And CBD is, is the medicinal part. Is that fair to describe it? That thc also has medicinal

Speaker 2:          19:46          properties, but it is the psychoactive element. CBD is, is cannabidiol. It's another cannabinoid. Those aren't the only two. I mean, there, there are others, um, and, but CBD does seem to have most of the medicinal value. I mean, it can, it can. Um, it's been shown to a stop some tumor growth. It's um, uh, you know, it's great for pain relief. Um, it's a, uh, reduces inflammation. Um, you know, it's,

Speaker 1:          20:25          I have a friend that takes cbd oil for anxiety and she told me all she does, literally as she was a little dropper in the morning, she drops two drops every time. That's it. She doesn't have the diarrhea and vomiting and thoughts of suicide and restless leg syndrome and all the other crazy things that come with all the commercials that you see on tv for all these other antidepressants and antianxiety it's, it's,

Speaker 2:          20:50          it's so gentle. I mean, it has so many benefits and has never killed anyone. Um,

Speaker 1:          20:57          you mentioned that at the top. I've never murdered anyone,

Speaker 2:          21:02          but it's still, boggles my mind that, uh, a plant, first of all, that has so many medicinal properties. So besides medicine, I mean, what about renewable energy and uh, you know, paper, you know, I mean, it's strong. It's a strong fiber, replaced so many things. Um, the fact that we look at it as such an evil thing, um, I don't understand.

Speaker 1:          21:34          I can, I can tell it. It truly boggles the mind. Yes, yes. Alright. So we have a thc cbd, uh, and then you have the indigo and the sativa and the hybrids of that. Um, so for the medicinal stuff, let's just do that first. Most people, if you didn't want to get stoned but you just wanted medicinal benefits, that's where you would use just the cbd, is that right?

Speaker 2:          21:58          Okay. CBD, yes. You want that. But there's been a lot of research researched that shows that a cbd alone is not as effective as when you mix it with thc, meaning that it's the whole plant that you want to treat you with. Not just taking one piece of it. Um, I think it's referred to as the entourage effect because there's so many elements and they all kind of worked together. Um, so people who are looking for cbd are usually looking for cbd rich strains or in some cases, you know, like the, the concentrates and things like that. Um, but I think for the most part you'll find that they're more effective when, when there is a little thc in there.

Speaker 1:          22:52          Yeah. So when you found the right one for you for. Well, first off, how long did it take for you to find the weed that was like, oh, these migraines?

Speaker 2:          22:59          Nah, you know, I didn't even think about weight as a treatment for my migraines because when I get bad migraines I would get barrier. I'm nauseous, dizzy. Um, uh, smoking pot was the last thing I thought would help me really. Um, but then I did read that it, it helps. And um, for me it's, it, it, it relaxes me enough that, I mean, it, it, it, it helps the nausea. Um, and also it helps me control the anxiety that comes along with, with, um, the onset of a migraine. I don't know,

Speaker 1:          23:48          two things attacking you at once, you have the Migraine, but then knowing it's coming now you're saying, oh my gosh. About that. And try to hit both of those. Both of those things. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Alright. So then you started doing that. It was working. When did you say, all right, I could make a business out of this or I gotta I gotTa tell people what's going on here.

Speaker 2:          24:07          Well, you know, a friend of mine was baking and I was fascinated by it and so I would um, look up recipes and send them to me. You should try this, you should try that. And he's finally, he got to the point where you said, you know what angel, you should try it. So I started experimenting and um, that's how I got introduced to making edibles and then I started trying them because, well honestly I tried a few edibles and hated them. You Go, this is going back to like 2008 or something. I mean, because you. Before they had perfected. Exactly. I mean, at that time he'd go to a dispensary and you see stuff that was just in like Ziploc bags and, you know, totally unappetizing to look at and oftentimes didn't taste very good and I mean, I, I found myself in those early days just sort of like, you know, eating it real quick and just hoping for the,

Speaker 1:          25:13          we're now, it's like literally, it's like going into a great big

Speaker 2:          25:16          Oh, you can get any, anything, pizza sauces. So

Speaker 1:          25:20          this can be anything you can think of. Yeah. So you started making this and it was really for yourself and then you started selling it. How quickly did you realize they were going to be some legal issues? Even in California where it is legal?

Speaker 2:          25:34          Uh, well, right away, right away. I mean, you know, there's still such a problem with perception first of all. So, okay. California was the first to allow for medical marijuana. It's been that way for about 20 years. But, uh, beyond doing that, there really aren't any regulations established. So, uh, it's like the wild west or it has been like that. Um, and there are a lot of people who want to do the right thing, wants to operate in a safe way, but without guidelines, without regulations, you can't really do that. And um, you know, there because of the perception problem, because of the stigma problem, because there are no clear laws. A dispensary's are still being attacked, closed down, shut down. And um,

Speaker 1:          26:36          literally, I mean, you're not making the dispensaries in California, there was a dispensary maybe five blocks away from me that about six ago was closed down. It was legal within the California set of laws, but federally, because it's not legal, the feds pretty much at anytime could come in and stop you. Right,

Speaker 2:          26:53          right. But I'm at risk right now and we have no fans watching. Sorry about that. Yeah. But in, and it's not even just, it's not that the, I guess that is the case in some instances that the feds do come in and shut them down, but even local municipalities are going in and shutting down places because they're using, um, um, land use codes to evict people and threatened their landlords. And I'm sure shadow places down.

Speaker 1:          27:27          Yeah, so how do you operate knowing that, that sort of out there, it's a very precarious position to be in as, as a business person?

Speaker 2:          27:35          Yes. Well, first of all it's a business, but for me it's primarily a passion project. You know, I do this because it means a lot to me to be in the industry and um, to help change how help change perspectives on it. Um, I, I know that I believe that a lot of people who are anti marijuana, I really just a misinformed, you know, there's been a lot of negative propaganda, um, and it's going to take some time to get good real information out to people.

Speaker 1:          28:18          Yeah. This is sorta like for people that are pro marijuana even, not even recreationally, but even medicinally, this is sorta the fault of you've had the government which scared people about marijuana, right? You can think of those, just those posters in the sixties, you know, just like making everyone look evil, smoking weed, and then even the Hollywood side of things, Hollywood, which is obviously very liberal and pro drug generally, but every movie related to Pod is just a bunch of goofballs doing ridiculous things. So it makes it seem like it's going to make you dumb or stupid or something like that. Yeah. There's really nothing in between those two places, which is. Well, I guess this is, this is between those two years,

Speaker 2:          28:53          you'd be surprised at how many of us really fall in between. Most people aren't at the extremes. Me, I can't believe it. It's just that people are afraid to come out and, and rightly so because because it is still federally illegal and, and there is still this stigma attached to it. Uh, when I was working full time and in the corporate world, I definitely kept, might use a private because I didn't want to be judged. It's, I didn't feel ashamed, but I didn't want anyone to use that information against me. And I think that, um, that a lot of people fall into that category and it's a shame because it, it's so easy to keep those stereotypes going of the pot head stoner, um, you know, it's easy to, to, to dismiss the whole industry if that's all you have in your head when you think about it. But there's so much more to it than that.

Speaker 1:          29:59          Yeah. I'm so fascinated by that because, you know, I've talked about, you know, gay people coming out, they're not trying to push anyone else interested in gay. There is coming out for themselves. Exactly. I've talked about this related to atheist because I get emails all the time were atheist, even in western societies where it's okay to be atheist will say I'm afraid of coming out because you might have an effect on my job or my parents or my cousin or something like that. And I never thought of it really in the context of marijuana. But yeah, as a professional person you didn't want to be seen a certain way. So how did you remove that stigma? I mean, did you go home to your parents and say, I'm going to go on and do this and weed

Speaker 2:          30:37          once I decided that this was important and this is what I wanted to do, I definitely made a shift to being out and I told my parents, you know, and this is what I'm doing. I use cannabis for my migraines. I use cannabis, you know, I, I, I'm still a good mother, you know, a productive member of society. I mean, not that they questioned me. Um, but,

Speaker 1:          31:09          but you felt it was like sort of on you to sell your case in a way or something.

Speaker 2:          31:13          Yes. And it's interesting, you know, there's still, even though they know what I do is, is good. Um, they believed that I'm providing a good. Um, but there's, you know, they worry, they worried they, they, they see how the laws are and see how um, you know, there's a risk. Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:42          Yeah. So one of the laws that I simply cannot believe is this section one thing, right? So this is that the federal government basically says at this point that marijuana has no medical benefit. There's a jillion studies that show that's not true. There is a zillion examples of people like yourself that show that that's not true. I've smoked weed after hurting my knee playing basketball and fell better. So, you know, most people know that this isn't true, but this is the Obama administration that still is backing this. So when these dispensaries are closed here in California, where again, it is legal, this is coming from Obama who was pretty good on weed. So it's, it's so complex, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          32:23          Yes. I, I had hoped for more change, uh, you know, I did read the other day, who knows if this is true that Gary Johnson predicted that Obama would we classify or declassify it on his way out and, you know, that's kind of one by the way. Um, so that would be amazing if he did that. Um, yeah, it's,

Speaker 1:          32:52          I had Gary Johnson on the show and I mean a libertarian, as I was saying at the top, a libertarian should be the most pro we'd person there is, this is you and your life and you're not pushing it on kids. You're doing something that makes you feel bad.

Speaker 2:          33:05          Yeah. I, I think the problem is just this, it's been this way for so long. It's hard to change course, especially when you're going pretty much one 80, you know, I mean to have cannabis, uh, on the schedule one, it has led to so many people suffering needlessly, you know, being put in prison. I'm having criminal records that affect the rest of their lives. And what's horrifying about it is that it's, it impacts communities of color more so this whole war on drugs is a failure and it, it's been used as a way to target certain communities. And um,

Speaker 1:          34:00          I think just this week there was something that came out at one of Nixon's advisors has now admitted. Yes. Part of what they did related to criminalizing certain drugs was purposely aimed at minority communities that you're not just picking up

Speaker 2:          34:15          exactly fact, yes, I read that same thing and he, he admitted it was the hippies and, and the African Americans that they wanted to be able to go into those communicate communities, um, arrest their leaders, raid their homes with. That was the goal. Um, and here we are, it's, it's, it's still happening, it's still happening. Um, and so I think we're asking people, you know, law enforcement to give up control of this. Um, and um, you know, there are a lot of law enforcement that, that believe that's for the best, but there's still resistance because it's the way we've operated for so many years. Right.

Speaker 1:          35:02          So basically if you're a business owner, like yourself or someone at a dispensary or you're just somebody that likes weed, if you want this thing to flip as quickly as possible, basically you want pretty much a lawsuit to get involved where the dispensary is shut down and that case has to get up to the supreme court. Right? Like, is that where you see that ultimately the only way we're going to stop this federally is through the Supreme Court? Right.

Speaker 2:          35:25          I don't know. I mean, you know, I just read something that, uh, I think it was normal issued it about how, uh, that's probably not the fastest track, you know, it's more of a state's issue and the more states that, that, uh, legalize it then, then we'll just kind of give us, we'll follow. Hopefully, you know, Bernie Sanders said he would schedule it. A Hillary Clinton said she'd move it to schedule to write waffling on this thing as I mentioned, but you know what, for California at least, I can speak to that a little bit. I mean, that's what the La medical cannabis task force is trying to accomplish here locally. You know, California is like 49 percent of the national market when it comes to cannabis and La is, is the center of all of that for us to not have common sense regulations for this industry.

Speaker 2:          36:21          It's ridiculous. And you know, we all know it's here, you know, the majority of La residents want it here. Um, so how are we going to provide access to people as part of it that it's hard to motivate people that smoke pot? You know what I mean, like I was trying at the top, I was trying to say, you know, it's hard to, to have this conversation without saying things that sound silly like that, but there's some level of that, right? Like, I can think of my four years of college when I sat on a couch stone, but if you had told me, if I would just go next door, we could legalize it. I probably wouldn't have got up. You know what? I think it's more fear that, that has stopped the community from coming together because when you know that you could get busted at any time, it's hard to form alliances, you know, it's, it promotes everyone having a, you know, a, a mentality of being just out for themselves, you know, um, that's the way it's been.

Speaker 2:          37:18          People operating kind of in the shadows because I don't want to draw too much attention to themselves because who knows what's gonna happen next week, you know? Um, but that's what the task force is trying to accomplish is, you know, the state of California recently passed some laws that went into effect at the beginning of this year, uh, uh, Murcia medical marijuana regulation and Safety Act, uh, which, uh, creates a path for legitimacy and, and licensure for, for everyone that's in this industry, but it's up to all the cities, the cities to, to then enact regulations that comply with that. So La does have an opportunity now and that's what we're hoping to accomplish is to, uh, get some regulations on the books that really encourages this industry. I mean, we, we want it here, you know, so what should that look like? What's the, how do we need to make that happen? Yeah. It's so interesting because it's so much. Reminds me of the fossil fuel versus green energy argument because obviously like the fossil fuel lobbyists, big pharmacy has a lot of lobbyists, right? They're all paying all the politicians to basically keep weed illegal at some level, keep cannabis illegal

Speaker 1:          38:36          because they are trying to sell a lot of pills. And it sort of goes back to what you started with about creating a garden and a life that you could grow something out of the earth that could take care of some of your problems. And yet we're so afraid of that and we'd rather them handed to us in pill form. And then at the same time, half the commercial for that pill tells you worse things than you had to take four in the first place. Side effects may include doing it. They should have to show those people having those side effects, show someone vomiting and on the toilet I've been diarrhea and thoughts as soon as we hang gliding and they're dancing around and it's like, come on. Like how much of that is just related to politics that the pharmaceutical companies don't want this to happen. So

Speaker 2:          39:20          I think that is a big part of it. I mean, the way things are a benefits, a lot of people, those people don't want to see things change because that takes money out of their pockets and it's, it's pretty simple. But, um, for me, you know, it's, it's not about getting rich for me, it's about simplifying, like I said, and you know, I would love to just be as self sufficient as possible. I mean, to grow my own food, to grow my own medicine, to compost, to, to, you know, to not have to go to a store for everything that I need. I mean that, that's kind of the default mentality, you know, you need something, you go out and buy it, you, you use something, you're done with it, you throw it away. And we're so disconnected from nature, um, from what we're doing to the environment, you know, it's so easy to, to not think about that. And for me, um, cannabis is an important part of taking care of myself, you know, in a way that, you know, um, you know, it, it helps me in so many ways. Um, I don't need to go to a doctor to get it, you know. Um, yeah, it's,

Speaker 1:          40:50          yeah, when you see those guys, you know, if you walk down Venice Boulevard right on the Strip there and we've got the guys all dressed in green and there the four slash 20 doctors, they got a hat on with a weed leaf and all that. Do you think that actually is doing some of the reverse effect because then people are like, this seems so silly. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          41:08          I think so. I, I, I see a lot of tourists taking pictures of those a lot. Um, I think I did it exactly. Um, so it's, it's, um, you know, it's, it's a spectacle. I guess that's mostly what they're going for. I think I'm down there on Venice beach. Yeah. Um, but I, I do think it, it points out kind of the, the, uh,

Speaker 3:          41:37          the,

Speaker 2:          41:39          that there isn't really that much of a difference, you know, between, for, in my mind, between medicinal and recreational and um, yes, you have to get a recommendation from a physician to get it in California. Um, yes, it's pretty easy to do that.

Speaker 1:          41:59          Have there been any. I mean, everything that I've read about what's going on in Colorado right now, I'd say 90 percent of it has been very good. Basically they're bringing in a lot more tax revenue. It's, I don't, I don't, I haven't seen anything about crime suddenly going up or suddenly other spikes and other drug use. You know, they always say marijuana is a gateway drug. What, what do you say to that? When people say that

Speaker 2:          42:19          I can't wait. Uh, what, that's what I wonder about, you know, I mean, uh, okay. So I've, I've used cannabis for many years and I don't like to drink alcohol. I can occasionally, but it makes me a sneeze now I get really congested and I don't, I just don't really enjoy it. Um, so, and, and you know, I think there's been research that shows that, you know, a lot of people that can use drugs and not get addicted, you know, addiction is a, is a problem. But to say that just because I smoke cannabis, I'm, I'm, you know, headed down this road where there's, I'll never come back. It's, it's silly.

Speaker 1:          43:08          Well, I always, I remember thinking how crazy it was, the way they've demonized weed because when I said at the top of the show, I had never smoked weed until I was a sophomore in college. I remember smoking weed and then laughing or whatever, whatever went on. And I remember thinking, well, wait a minute, they've told me weed is so horrible. So what about these other drugs? So in a weird way, by demonizing weed or marijuana and cannabis, whatever we're calling it now, uh, they actually have convinced a lot of people I think to try other drugs because then you try weed, you go, this isn't so bad. Well,

Speaker 2:          43:38          what about crack and crack? But I'm just saying. Yeah, no, I understand. Yeah. Because it's so clearly a misinformation, you know, and people aren't stupid, you know. So, um, yeah, I, it does send the wrong message. What

Speaker 1:          43:54          do you think about how I noticed that a lot of my friends who used to be huge, huge potheads either don't smoke anymore or barely ever smoke or when they do, they only need the tiniest flub. As I said at the top, I, I spoke at this point maybe once a month, I take one puff, a granddaddy purple, the Grand Daddy, which is an indycar because I told the guy I just want to melt into the couch and watch tv and that's it. And I really, it's once a month, one pup, I'm good to go. But something about weed is different than other drugs because people that use it a lot of seem to. I think George Carlin did a bit about this. They seem to not grow out of it necessarily, but it has a reverse addictive thing in some ways. You know what I mean? Some people, because for the people that get paranoid, let's say, well, I don't want that anymore. And I think you would probably say, well, that may be trying to go more than a sativa. Right?

Speaker 2:          44:40          But what's interesting is, okay, so they have found that your body has an endoccanabinoid system, right? So there are receptors in your brain and all through your body that are there to accept canabinoids. Um, you're, you, you produce cannabinoids in your own body. You know, it's in breast milk, so, um, they've found that what cannabis does, it's just, it affects your endocannabinoid system which then brings your body into balance and that's why it helps with so many elements and that's why for many years people couldn't believe that it helps with so many things. How could it do this and this and this and this. No, no drug does that. It's because you have this built in regulation system in the endocannabinoid system and cannabis helps bring. You're bringing that into balance. So it Kinda does make sense that if you're using it, you know, and that after a certain amount of time, maybe he need to use less because it's just such an interesting

Speaker 1:          45:52          thing. Thing about a drug, right? That you know, you think, oh, you need more, you do it more, you're going to need more. And in a lot of ways I know that that exists at some level with marijuana that some of my friends, you know, they need to smoke more because it doesn't hit them the way it used to or they'll change strain or something like that. A lot of people eventually either need much less or have much less of a desire that, that doesn't fit any of the definitions of what addiction and drug.

Speaker 2:          46:16          Exactly. You just need to. Normally with addiction you have to keep upping the dosage and the dosage and you know, like for when I use, when I have an edible cookie at night, I mean it's 12, 13 milligrams and that's plenty for me. Yeah. And I

Speaker 1:          46:31          may not be migraine related. That might just be

Speaker 2:          46:34          just to, as a sleep aid, you know, or if I'm feeling like it helps if your muscles are sore, you know, just relaxes you. But 12 milligrams is not a lot. And um, and if, if it were, you know, if that were true, addiction and, and having to have more and more. I mean I would be eating more, more cookies, you know, and it's one is fine

Speaker 1:          47:04          right now. These are all carb free, right? Yeah. So with some of the medicinal stuff, when I was doing a little research for this, you can see all kinds of crazy things. I mean, you can see people that say literally, I cured brain cancer with just by, you know, using cbd oil or something like that, and then you can see people that it helped with pain or it helped with nausea. I got my appetite back. I mean really the gamut of everything. What's like the most amazing case that you've ever seen of, of helping, you know, something really serious like cancer or Parkinson's or somebody.

Speaker 2:          47:34          Well, I have a good friend that had kronos, has crohn's disease and, you know, he really credits cannabis with giving him his life back and he was suffering tremendously for many, many years. And another friend of mine has a, uh, a young niece, um, who had a brain tumor and she, her family was treating it with the Rick Simpson oil. And um, what's that? Um, it's uh, it's, I've never tried it myself, but it's, it's, um, it's. Rick Simpson developed this method of making this concentrated oil. Um, and you can find directions on how to make it yourself.

Speaker 1:          48:20          Was this like what they give very young kids? Right. Does this sound to do with what happened in New Jersey? And Kristy got in all that because I think he didn't want to pass it, but then got sort of into it, which made no sense anyway. I think, wasn't he just allowing the CBD stuff? Right. All right. So we'll, we'll try that again.

Speaker 2:          48:41          You don't have to know everything. Yeah, I try. But I think that, um, uh, you know, uh, I've seen a lot of people who really believe that it's helped them for so many different things. Um, even if it's just, you know, I have a bad back and I rub a topical on my, on my back and I feel better. Um, it's not always about getting stoned. So, um, you know, and, and for a while I was volunteering in a cannabis physicians office and, you know, different. I would see different patients and how they were using the medicine. I mean, it's, it's great for any kind of. I'm a neuro neuro, uh, neuropathy, you know, any kind of nerve pain. It, it, it's, uh, provides great relief for that. And, you know, breast cancer, there has been studies showing that, I mean, they've shown that it can really just kill certain cancer cells. I mean, to me that's incredible.

Speaker 1:          49:49          So for the people that would say this is, they still have this stigma attached to it, you know, I think a lot of them, they don't want people to even deal with their own pain. It's unfathomable to me that if someone across from me had cancer or had Parkinson's, the rite eight or whatever it is, what right would I have to say? Well, you can't do that to yourself to alleviate your pain. Right. What do you think goes on in the mind of that person? I, I really, I cannot imagine.

Speaker 2:          50:19          I, again, I think it's fear and misinformation and that's why. Thank you so much again for having me here because think it's, it's, it's so important to come out and speak on the topic. Uh, I know I'm fighting a stereotype, you know, um, but I do not consider myself a stoner and I am very productive, you know? So, uh, I think that's

Speaker 1:          50:45          the board. There's money to be made here for a lot of people. It's happening in Colorado right now. It's happening across California. So this is, these are serious business people, right? It's like the new California gold rush in a way where you have to be willing to sort of put your butt on the line, I suppose for hopefully not

Speaker 2:          51:02          too much longer. I mean, we'll see. We'll see. I mean, I think that the energy is definitely going in the right direction and hopefully we'll get some regulations in place, especially here in la because, you know, we, we are the center of this industry and we should take a leadership role in creating regulations that could be used other places as well. Um, and what I'd really like to see is, uh, an industry that encourages entrepreneurship, encourages a small business owners and encourages creativity, uh, and not a monopoly. And that's really another, a goal of the task force is to allow that to happen. You know, really bring everyone in out of the shadows and operate a legitimately.

Speaker 1:          52:03          Yeah. So I know you don't buy the gateway drug thing. Where do you stand on legalization of all drugs in general? Because I think this is probably one of the places where the argument gets tough where suddenly you say, I'm all in on weed and then there's probably a lot of people that say, well, I'm just all in on everything and then you could get what I would think, even though I'm basically for legalization of most stuff, pretty much I think people could make a more sound case and say if you legalize all of this stuff, people are going to just be trying all kinds of really crazy. Okay, now I'm not, I'm still sort of vacillating where I stand.

Speaker 2:          52:38          Okay. Drugs, there are many drugs that aren't legal now that people try and it doesn't limit people's ability to access,

Speaker 1:          52:48          right? They can get

Speaker 2:          52:49          right. Um, you're risking a going to prison, you know. Um, so I mean, legalizing all drugs, I do believe that there are drugs that don't have any real health benefit and are dangerous. Um, but I don't think criminalizing activity that way. Um, is, is the right answer. You know, if you're trying to fight addiction, putting someone in prison is not going to solve that. I'm preventing them from having a, a life is not going to solve that.

Speaker 1:          53:28          It's a crazy system that someone could try to alleviate their pain because of a chronic disease. And our, our, uh, the way we deal with them is by putting them in jail.

Speaker 2:          53:40          Yeah. I mean, you know, veteran veterans right now I really fighting to get access to medical marijuana. I mean the fact that um, they've had to fight to be able to treat their ptsd with cannabis is crazy, you know, I mean, I think they've earned that.

Speaker 1:          53:57          Yeah, I agree. All right, well we have to wrap up. So first off, I'm very happy about this. This is very exciting. Uh, I think I've got it already, but give me your. Give me your file sale. Give me your 62nd sell on why all this is important for our. So we can clip it for facebook perfectly. Why is making this legal and do it all this? Just give me, give me the elevator.

Speaker 2:          54:20          Cannabis medicine is, you know, cannabis is an amazing plant. It has so many health benefits. It has saved many lives, um, to, to, to, to make it illegal or to continue to keep it illegal. It just hurts. It hurts us as a society. It hurts individuals. I mean, it's just bad all around. I mean, this is, this is, um, you know, for me it's about really getting people to understand that I'm, I'm, I'm not a bad person. You know, I'm, I'm here to provide a product that people enjoy and that people benefit from. And um, you know, it's time to, for La especially to, to, uh, accept this industry and to create some framework for us to, to, uh, to be successful. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          55:23          Yeah. I think you nailed it. Well, as I told you before we started, you know, I spent a lot of time here talking about terrorism and politics and jihadism in all kinds of crazy stuff. So this was an absolute pleasure and this will help me relaxing after the show. So I thank you for that. And you guys can follow along with angels doing a. it's Ruby Doobie, bakes.com, right.
