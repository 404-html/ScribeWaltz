Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Joining me today as a lawyer or a gun rights activists and the host of know are on NRA TV. Kalia. No, are welcome to the Rubin report. How's it going? How's it going, my friend? It's going good. It's good to be in la. I am. I'm glad to have you on. We've been trying to do this for about a year. Yeah, you're a busy man. Yeah, I just don't like to think so. It might just be a facade I put her onto avoid people, but no one actually were in reality now it's been. It's been a pretty busy year. Yeah. Like extremely so. And it doesn't ever seem to slow up and just want to think it does. Something else jumps off. Well, if you think coming out of this show is gonna help slow it down. You are sorely mistaken. Yeah. Well I'm a bit of a masochist in that regard, so we'll see.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       We'll see by the time this hour he's done work on earth. Hell, we can release you. I'm pretty sure there will be some. Yeah. Well, don't worry because there will be equal amounts of me just sitting here with you. That's the interesting thing. You know, I don't want to say I've been blind to it, but just being. Just seeing some of the reaction and the responses that I got, especially like for instance when I was on radar when I. After I did Bill Maher, I still saw some of the comments from the like I say the other side just for ease of communication, but for people who largely don't agree with me and his audience and he was like, oh, why would drive the NRA guy on there? Even a, it was a tweet I responded to yesterday and even though I was on my no tweeting deal that I like to put my cell phone because so toxic and they're sometimes.

Speaker 1:          00:01:26       How often do you do that? Every 30 minutes. I'm trying to do weekends disappearing and all of August see it man. Twitter's toxic man. When you're in the lane that you and I are and it's toxic man and it can really. Even though you don't think you're taking that in, even when you just kind of scrolling through, you're taking that in. Yeah. You know, and it's like I constantly have to develop this pattern of just, you don't respond to that because they're baiting you and things of that nature. But um, I, I saw a tweet and she's like, yeah, I love, Oh, I love this episode, but you have that NRA guy on there. I'm like, Jesus, are we not allowed to have discourse anymore if it, especially if it disagrees with something that you believe in and, you know, and I was like, this is a very dangerous road we're going down if that's, if that's going to be the case because you forget, you know, we live in this country together and we're not all the same.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       There's about 350 million might not all think the same thing. Exactly. Pretty crazy. It's, it's kind of sad. So it, at least for me, it's a little disheartening because I grew up under the guise and understanding the importance of discourse and being able to talk things out even if you do disagree with someone. But then they even still having the ability to set aside whatever views I may have on a particular issue and then be able to speak with you cordially or have respect for you even though we don't agree that's the way I was brought up. And so to see the country kind of falling into this extremely vitriolic divisiveness it, it's heartening to know me get all emo on you, but it does it like we don't have to guess cried until the end. We can do it this way. But. But that's exactly why I wanted to have you on because you are okay going into enemy territory.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       I'm not calling this enemy territory, but you did, you did Maurice Show where you knew a certain percentage of the audience was just going to hate you. And we talked about it briefly right before we started, but you found Martin to basically pretty, pretty respected. Even kill. Yeah. Even though I'm policy, he probably disagrees with you with 80, 80 percent of this tournaments. Yeah. And, and, you know, and it was something that I ended up respecting about him in that regard because like I said, I kind of, I went in prepared for, I didn't go into dual war, but I went and prepared for it, you know, it was like prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Um, and I tell you I got the best in a sense of it was a, it was a discourse where he challenged me, but it wasn't this kind of tumultuous kind of butting of heads where it was just turned into something that was just ugly.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       Yeah. He, well, he wasn't trying to get. Yeah. Yeah. Trying to understand you because that, that, you know, I'm trying to do that here. I think there's a couple other places where people are trying to do that. But yeah, that's the thing that's been lost. And that's an interesting thing you pointed out there. It's, I think sometimes people take offense to that idea. It's like, well, I don't want to intrude. Intriguing. I think intrigued kind of offense people sometimes because it's like we all grow up with a typical understanding of what we expect certain people to be like and then when certain things don't fit, it's like, hmm, that's interesting. How did you get there? Right. And I think when it's innocent like that, I don't think there's an issue there when you use it to try to kind of muscle people into believing a certain thing based on what they are, then that's when we start having problems.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       You know what I mean? It's like you see me as like how to you as a black guy. Like it happened to me when I first started doing what I did with the NRA. I'm a Russell Simmons or, and I'll never forget this. I was like, I was like in Virginia Beach, I think. Um, and Russell said, I, I, I did my first sets of videos rolled out with the NRA and I get this tweet from Russell Simmons. And he was like, how can you as a young black man push data, you know, the typical rhetoric in that regard, even though he often is all about trying to get people to. Exactly. Which was really odd. And so I, you know, I responded, I said, you know, like I didn't know advocating for self defense and self reliance was a bad thing. I didn't know that only non black people were allowed to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       And so that was Kinda like my first foray into that world of wait a minute. People have an expectation of me based on my race that I'm not going to say I was oblivious to, but it just, when it was coming from people that look like me as well with the same level of intensity, that's when I go wow. Okay. Alright. So here, that's what this is. Yeah. So I want, I want to back up a little bit of childhood and growing up because you're evolutions kind. Interesting. But let, let's just sit with this for one second because I think there's something really interesting about that thing right there that often if you listened to the media, they'll you that that police are hunting down, black men are and all of this, and then at the same time you're saying, well, we should be able to arm ourselves and protect ourselves from the white supremacists.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       See whoever is doing that, but meaning that lawfully and legally we should be able to take care of ourselves. If you believe that the system is so corrupt and the police are so corrupt and there's racists running around everywhere, you're trying to bring the power back to yourself. That's to me, that's very empowering. Yet somehow this seemingly is lost. When this conversation hits the mainstream, it's amazing. I don't understand it. It's like in one breath you're talking about let's, let's take the current administration for instance, they'll paint it as this the most vicious involving on the planet, and then it's like, well then let's give the same guns that you have for your own self reliance. Would you would use to protect yourself against this monster that you said existed and let's give it to them and then place your entire alliance with respect to your safety on the same people you, you're telling me I should be scared of.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       It doesn't look horrible. Give them your weapons. What again? Just it's, it's mindblowing. Right? And so what it does though, it exposes this notion that the, there's an absence of ability to, I don't want to say mobility or people just choosing not to critically think. And we're at a point now where we have access and I tell people it's like, it amazes me some of the questions that I get and it's like you literally have a device that gives you access to all of the information in the world and it's in your pocket. And in the case of my overabundant tasks, I have two of them and it's like it takes you to fall into your. I assume you have like eight guns on you at all. Those rifles, some here. So you know. And it's, it's amazing how when we have such access to so much information, we've become so lazy at reaching for it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       This was almost like back in the day when we didn't have this access, we were more adamant about search searching and seeking it out and critically thinking about things. It's almost, we've become too fast for our own good. Right. So the obsession now is instant information, instant information regardless of whether or not the information is of any use or good or the or if it's even correct. Yeah. You know. And so it's it. I hate it because, you know, I, I blogged, I've done all of those things and actually get people get mad at me when I don't jump on a certain issue quick enough. And when I say quick enough, within 30 seconds, the second I'll see that sometimes something goes down in the news and literally two minutes go by her, I'm at dinner and I wasn't living at home. And then I'll get a slew of tweets.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       People. Well I see you didn't comment on that. You must be in and God paid off. God forbid it involves a black person and there's a gun within 10 miles. I have to jump on it. Yeah. And in some cases I understand there's some people who do who are just now getting into this who are just now getting into firearms and they are black. Right. And you know, they look to me for understanding and direction because I've been doing it for so long so that I understand, but, but other people, it's just this constant desire to be like, ah, I got you. I knew you were coon kind of deal. Right. And it's like, like, give me 30 seconds to even read the article you just sent me 10 seconds ago. Yeah. Right. And then from there, and then not to mention, you know, there's this thing called work that I do.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       So yeah, I'm still doing that as well. So I'm, I'm, you know, I'm juggling a lot of things. I think I don't have to tell you, you probably have to read 10 more articles to even ascertain anything close to the truth. Bingo. And that's the one thing that I think a lot of people don't do. And almost tweeted that the other day I go, you know, it's very dangerous to read headlines, especially in the day and age of clickbait titles, to just read headlines and then make an opinion based off of that or think you know, understand what happened at a particular story because there are so many articles that I've read about me and what I've said where the headline said one thing and to cover their assets within the article. They'll clarify exactly what, what it is that I said, but they're banking on the idea that people are just going to read the headlines and then run with that and so it ends up making a fool of you in full of people.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       What's your personal policy on that? About how to respond to that? Do you go all in on the fight? Do you ignore it? Because that this has happened to me just in the last week. Daily be said, I was all right. Cheerleader. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, if you're black. I think so how am I doing for the. For an orange, you suck now. Well, no, I mean, but this is the level of pity, but then it's about how much time do you want to invest in, in defending yourself and by doing that defense, do you just add intensity to the people going, I see we can get them to defend himself and then before you know it, your whole life is dedicated to defending yourself from fake attacks rather than you and the work that you care about. Two things. One, they do it to you because you're dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       You're dangerous. Not Because you agree with me in certain, in certain issues, you're dangerous and the fact that you're just simply willing to talk to me. So for instance, same thing happened when I did. I did the interview with killer Mike, Right? They jumped all over him, not because of what he said, but just because he sat down and had the conversation with me. Half the time they don't even listen. Oh, that's interesting. You can point it out because I was talking to my friend. I'm like, I'm like, how can anyone watch this interview and not walk away with saying, you know, that was a great conversation about two people who don't agree on everything, but there's some things we agree on like, because they don't watch it. That sounds like. What do you mean? It's like I had just this weird blonde moment, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Yeah. I'm like, what do you mean? He was like, they didn't watch it. He was like, they don't actually watch the video. They just read the title and then assume they know what happened in the video and then make their opinion from there. And I'm like, damn, you're right. I hate going down in the weeds with too much in this because it feels like we're just responding to all of the craziness. But even in the. Even in like the youtube ecosystem when we put videos up, sometimes within 10 there's 100 condoms and that was an hour of want, that time when she can, because I will be a lot more productive, but it's always the haters that that's why I wouldn't bring it up because it. Because then that heat is the thing that's always leading us and then I think that brings it back to where you started a moment ago, which is that we're in this polarized thing and it's because the haters are are sort of paving the road and everyone else is just going down the road.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       I think a few of us are actually trying to better road that. More of us can get it. The interesting thing about the discourse the way it is now, right? And so our politics have become our entertainment. That's the one that's the dangerous aspect, right? So if it's not vitriolic, if it's not snarky, if it's not any of those things, if people don't pay attention to it. And I'm the biggest advocate of like, all right, look, if you, if you don't agree with me on something, you don't have to be an ass about it right now. Can I be snarky? Hell yeah. No, I, I can absolutely be snarky, but what I, what I tried to do in response to your initial question, you asked me how do I like, how do I go all in? Do I respond? So like for instance on twitter, what I've kind of held myself back to doing now is if I can tell that the person is literally seeking out an answer or response, that's I'm going to give them that same energy in terms of, okay, no, let's, let's have that conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       Right? Because there was a point in time where everything I responded to when I respond to it through the lens of just being this snarky on, you know what I mean? And Yeah, sure, it was entertaining myself. Absolutely. But then I had to ask myself was I really moving the conversation and the dialogue along, even though it is twitter, it's twitter, it's a dumpster fire, but when I started has some importance, does just the truth. That's why it keeps coming up in so many of these conversations that high level people with great minds that are open and engaging, that are still involved in the stupidity of that. So it's like I always feel guilty when I bring it up with a guest. I'm was like, I don't want to touch that again. And then on the other hand, we all know it's really just, it just is whether we want it to be or nothing, like you said, whether we like, Nah, this the medium of expression right now.

Speaker 1:          00:13:55       Um, and so we have to either adapt or die, you know, but, you know, it's, it's, I try, I try to be what it is. I tried to be the opposite of what I could plan about. At least I try in terms of like, sometimes I'll see snarky messages and then I'll respond by trying to be reasonable. I say, okay, I get it. You don't like me, but answer this question for me. And I tried to move the dialogue along, you know, what ends up happening to get deleted. Yeah. Almost every single time. Yeah. The second you shed a little light on it. Grad scatter. Yeah. Yup. What, what is the, uh, before we dive too much into your past, what is the thing that they're criticizing you most for? Like you come across to me as a pretty rational, decent, open guy. You're trying to empower yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       Okay. So what is it that they're always going after you? Is it that thing that black men shouldn't be for guns? I mean, is it that simply stupid? So I'm like, so I don't, I'm not going to be so naive to assume it's simply just because I'm black and I'm in the guns and holds up. That's part of it. That's a big part of it is just aligning myself in the organization that they seemingly, that they see as being a racist organization that hates black people. And we're going to talk plenty about the NRA. Right? So there's that element of it, but then there's, there is also this idea that being a young black man that I am supposed to run from guns because of the projected image that we've all had forced down our throats with respect to black men and firearms in this country for decades.

Speaker 1:          00:15:26       You know, black man with a gun, he's a thug. He's a drug dealer. He was a gang banger period. So now when I young, attorney educated, open minded and you know, with respect to different issues and then I'm pushing the narrative of the second amendment, it sets off an explosive level of cognitive dissonance in people who have what I love this quote and I believe was Bush who said it, the soft bigotry of low expectations, right? And it, they hate it, they hate it the same way they, they hate you now because you can't control someone who's willing to think independently outside of what is stereotypically expected of you. Right? Um, and that's where the labels come in and so it's like, Yo, do progressive or liberal, you know, so, but you still have that ability to step outside of that and say, you know what, let me let me.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       Okay, I can see that perspective. That's dangerous for people who want to control people. So when I want to control the way you think, the way you see yourself, I cannot allow you to develop it and ability to think independently on separate issues because then I can't control you. So if I, if I say, you know what, I can do everything for you, depend on me. The last thing I want you to do and understand this, you know what, wait a minute. You mean to tell me I could protect myself. You mean to tell me I don't have to depend on calling a cop in order to come save me if someone does try to break into my house because then I can't control you. I can't own your vote because what the gun has done for me and a lot of people it serves as a catalyst for awakening for a lot of people don't understand, you know, what I can do more for myself than I realize, you know, and once that, once that spark is set off than a lot of things, you start to realize, you know, I don't, you know, what maybe, you know, not on, I'm holding myself to a different level of accountability.

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       Maybe I might try to do this on my own, you know, just feel good and they put an aside. I know a lot of people are into facts over feelings these days, but Shapiro but doesn't that statement right there that, that you can do more for yourself. It just feels good like pills, making some power back to yourself and go and the government or you, whoever you are or are not in charge of my life, my responsibility, my livelihood, my family, the rest of it. It's the most invigorating feeling in the world. And I'm with you. I'm all about facts over feelings and I'm meaning from standpoint. I don't allow my feelings to dictate the facts, you know, I do think feelings are necessary, right? Because we would, in the absence of them, we just become cold, calculated creatures. Right. And we are still human. We are getting, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       So it's like now at least. So you know, when I talk about the issue of firearms, I do actively try to inquire. I was, I was having a discussion with a lady not too long ago about just general firearm issues with respect to her son. Right? Who's the young black man. And I asked her, you know, like the, are you fearful of the idea of him carrying a gun and so forth and so on, and I have to bring myself back when I'm having a discussion with someone like that because I don't have kids. Right. So Yeah, and my godfather that, yeah. So, and, and I, and I love her but it's not the same for a woman who has a son. So I have to be cognizant of that and understand what goes into that when she's thinking about whether or not she, he, she is okay with him owning a firearm.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       And then on top of that having this idea that her son is more likely to get killed by a cop because he has a gun on him versus when he doesn't, you know. And that's where the feeling component comes in where it's necessary. I think if you can't sympathize with that, then it makes you dismissive. And so then that person can't relate to you, then we can have that conversation. You know what I mean? And that comes from personal experience because when I was reading your bio there, I mean, it's really interesting stuff about how you evolve sort of politically and personally, but when you started getting into guns you kind of had to hide it from your mom either. So everyone actually takes a little bit about, about growing up and then sort of your kind of politics and then how do we, how do we get so into gun director?

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       So I've, I grew up largely a closet anti gunner. I didn't realize I was going the wall, there was one president, right? I wasn't kind of rapidly running out, running out, screaming. I hate guns or anything like that. But when a woman was president, I remember there's one moment when I was in college, I had a roommate, um, when their friends brought a gun over, I was like, you need to get the hell out my part. You get the hell out of my apartment. And um, had a good friend of mine who randomly just asked me, hey, do you want to go to the range? Never even thought about it. Never even crossed my mind. Which is how I know a lot of times I can decipher based on certain comments whether or not somebody is actually coming from a place of ignorance or a place of understanding because I was that guy never even thought about going to range, never thought about shooting gun, but I can tell you all their opinions on the world wide.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       Right? And so when I hear that rhetoric now I can usually point it out and I'm like, you've never shopped before. You've never even held a gun before. And so from that perspective, we went to the gun range and shot for the first time and I was hooked. Now I was hooked not from a political standpoint now with not even from an empowering, oh my God, I can protect myself now standpoint, it was just pure fascination with the mechanics, the physics, all of it. I'm a very kind of like, curious mind. So for me it was like kind of like this, like the idea that I'm launching a project out faster than the speed of sound and a little target 100 yards away. Like that was awesome. So first shot you were hooked, first shot terrified me the second, so a little bit second shot.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Right, right. Um, so from that perspective, after, so after that, I just, I follow that rabbit all the way down the hall, but it was, like I said, it was more from a scientific, mechanical understanding of it. Then as time went on, then I started looking at it from more intellectual, second amendment political activist standpoint and then I started my, then the lawyer mind kicked in and then I started looking. I'm like, I'm hearing something. We [inaudible] we during the time period. Then that particular time period we had a couple of pretty big mass shootings that happened and so I started paying it and so now I'm paying attention more to this kind of like when you're thinking about buying a car and you never see it on the road. And then once you start thinking about buying you see it everywhere. That was pretty much what happened now.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       So I'm like, I'm hearing the conversation about guns everywhere now and I'm like, none of this is making any sense logically like what people are proposing. It doesn't. It was so pure, it wasn't like an agenda driven. I was like, this doesn't make sense to me. It's like a window, like a sticker on the window, not going to stop somebody from bringing a gun in there saying that it's illegal. You need the dad's not going to read the sign and be like, oh exactly. I go to the other place. Right. So interesting. That's Kinda when I started jumping into the more activist advocate side effects, um, with respect to the second amendment. And when you first got guns. Yeah. You were literally hiding them from your mind. Cause cause, cause she was very much let me, she was a single parent mom raising a black son.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       She wanted to court every stereotype on the planet. Right. My mom over compensated with me tremendously because she understood, she understood in her mind the limitations that come with being a woman, raising a man by herself. So she overcompensated. So whereas usually typically have like mama's boys who were just kind of like, mom does everything for her. She ain't did shit for me. Go wash your own clothes, come here and go do shit. Like everything she made me and I didn't at the time I just thought she was just being, I mean not realizing, you know, it was her overcompensating standpoint. It's like I gotta make this through. I got to raise a man. Yeah. Right. And so, but so she was trying to buck. So I knew once I started getting into guns. No, no, no, no. Because the perception was black man with gun gang banger.

Speaker 1:          00:23:16       Right. And you know, she had some insecurities in that. She's like, you know, like there's gonna come a point where I'm not gonna be able to control this kid. I don't know what it's going to be doing. And so I didn't want to terrify her and make her think that I was living in the ferris lifestyle, that she. And it was almost in a way to protect her more than once to hide it from myself because I didn't want her to feel like she, like she failed as a mother and so I knew if she saw the AK 47 that I had hidden under my bed. In her mind she knows nothing about guns. All she knows is what she sees in the media. And we all were like we touched upon before, that imagery is not positive. So she comes home, sees ak 47 in bed.

Speaker 1:          00:23:56       She's, Oh my God, my son is a gay man first instead under the bad guy. You said in the bed. Is there anything you want tell here we're talking about that. Like, I already did this. I did this guy. Both basketball fans. I used to sleep with my basketball. Oh yeah. Oh Man. Yeah I bought was life that was everything out. And you still got any skills? Some, some something. Something. I'm actually working on trying to open next. NRA annual meetings put together like a to a charity. Basketball it. If you're down. Can I get into that? Let's do it. Alright. Let's do it, but uh, I've never slept with my guns. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       Okay. So, so from that point when you started getting okay with this and now you're exploring it, as you said intellectually, uh, how long before you were really an advocate for this stuff because you always sort of wanted to fight for something to be a theme with you. A long time. It was def that that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to be an advocate. I wanted to be in the courtroom defending people. That's, that was my goal. Like even to the detriment of my grades. Like I focused more on like my mock trial stuff when I was in law school than I did my actual work, like the, like schoolwise, right. And um, I liked being the voice for people. I like being able to speak to people who can articulate certain things away that maybe I can. And I never saw this going way that it did, but I'm doing exactly what I always wanted to do.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       And, and for me with the gun thing, I remember being in like I'd be in class in law school and the way that they, like the seats are staggered or like stadium seats, right? So if I'm on my computer and you're behind me, you can see what I'm doing on my computer and I'd be in class in like I'm researching guns and all man, God, dude, like people. And the thing is a lot of things that were being said about me I didn't even know about till later on, people were concerned. Yeah, I really like Yo. It's like he's like, he's not crazy. He's not, you know, um, and I get it if you don't, if you're not into that kind of thing, um, and you don't follow it. The idea of being passionate about something you perceive to be a tool that you use for killing people and only killing people.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       It's gonna seem new to you. But because I came to it so naturally, so organically without any of that, it just made sense in my mind. I was so unapologetic about it. Once I got over being apologetic about it, that I didn't push it in people's faces, but you know, there was a, there was even a time like that's how my instagram got started was me separating. So the people who followed me up until that point, you know, I had a girlfriend at the time was like, you know, I get a lot of questions where people can tend to tone down the gun stuff a little bit. And it was, it was kind of an innocent thing, but I never really. I just said, you know, what, forget it. I'm just going to set up a whole nother page and now I'm just going to do all the good stuff I want to do on that page.

Speaker 1:          00:26:47       Yeah. Um, and, and now that's taken over. I don't even use the other one that I don't even know if I remember the password, but it. So from there, that's where things really started taking off. And then with the and, and then when I started I started doing gun reviews. And so then from there when I got into the political component of it, then I started talking during my commentary and then that's when things started really taking off. All right, so let's do this. I want to do gun one on one with all the things that we should know about guns. And then I want to do the most common misconceptions about guns. Because I think part of the issue right now is every time something happens, every time there's a shooting, half the people don't know anything about guns. On one hand, half the people then give you all of those misconceptions.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       It gets confusing for everybody. And even the people who I generally trust, I, I don't know exactly what they're saying. So I want to do a video with you right now. Every time one of these incidences happen and someone starts asking me this, asking me that I want to go, I've got the thing that I can point to with the answers. So let's do gun. What on what? What do we need to know about guns are first and foremost, ar does not stand for assault rifle. So when they say ar 15, that's not assault rifle, does not mean assault rifle. And the assault rifle is a gun that is fully automatic, right? That means I pulled the trigger, I hold it back and an expense all of the ammunition in the magazine. So that's Jesse, Ventura and Predator. Boom. Okay. It's a great gun. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       Love that guy. I can argue that not going to side with my known again. But um, so, so that's automatic. You just hold it down and down and it will fire every round, uh, subsequently until it's completely out. Okay. Right. And does. So at a very high rate of speed. Generally speaking, somebody automatic. So now there's been this thing where people conflate this or use somebody automatic as a kind of a hyperbolic way of characterizing guns as death killing machines, right? Virtually every modern gun is semiautomatic. And what that means is one press of the trigger, one bullet versus holding the trigger down once and getting all the bullets. Okay. So that's a great distinction out there because often when this happens, you see people saying we have to band semiautomatics semiautomatic. That's virtually every month. He's just because all the, the only difference between that and a what I guess fully automatic stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       Well what's one that you're just loading one bullet in that. Okay. So that would be a bolt action. Okay. Right. So there's fully automatic, semi automatic and Bolt Action Bolt action more. It was more like to like, like hunting, right or high high precision shooting and it's a bolt because it allows you to build a gun up in such a way where you at the tighter constraints within a gun and allows you to be more accurate without certain mechanism moving back and forth causing. Throwing off the accuracy of the shot. So you would say then that when with all of these people come out and say we have to band semiautomatics and that they are actually just flat out confused or intentionally conflating or a obfuscating what the truth is related to them? Yes, absolutely. And so it's either they're confused, they're ignorant or they're doing a purposeful that you just stated.

Speaker 1:          00:29:55       Okay, so what is the. So let's do some nra stuff while we're. While we're doing this, what is the NRA stance on automatics just being able to hold an shoot. I mean, the way it's currently regulated is the way it stands right now. There's like in order to get an automatic gun, there's a certain process you have to go through in order to get them. And it's been that way for a very long time now and that's been that it exists as it does now. And that's essentially where the stance is with respect to fully automatic what's, what are people using fully automatic guns for? So um, because I think this is where you'll hear people go, well, no one needs an automatic to see. Here's the thing though, it's the idea of putting it under the guise of needing, right, their name, another right where we use that same standard, you know, begs the question.

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       And so it's like, okay, you haven't fully automatic gun and you have some automatic gun shot bolt action. There are different reasons why you would want each of these guns. Now I can delve into that. But then that starts getting into the very nerdy side of firearm ownership. Whether enthusiasm aspect of that comes into it, it's understanding tactically why you would want certain things. And so for me, I'm not personally, I don't have a problem with people on fully automatic gun personally. I just don't see that as a significant danger above and beyond say owning a nuclear suitcase. Right? So people tried to make that absurd argument to me before. It's like, well then why don't you read a lot and well that's because there's a, there's a cost benefit ratio that doesn't make any sense, right? That you just inherently self destruction. So how is, how is that protecting you in any way from the very thing that you're supposed to be taking yourself against?

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       Do you think there should be a higher threshold to be able to get an automatic than some of the other records you're talking about? Me Personally? Threshold in what respect? Like in terms of either hire back graded background checks or references. So. So talking about background checks for a minute. So there's this idea, this notion that we don't have background checks for guns. We do. And the funny thing is we, in the gun community, you become become a victim of technology. And what I mean by that is people think that just because I can go into a gun, if I really wanted to, I can go a gun store right now, buy a gun within two minutes just like that. You can. Yeah, because you've done all of the background and see that's the thing though. I'm still going under. I'm undergoing the same processes.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       So I go into a store, I find a gun. I liked this gut. I say I want to buy this gun. I fill out the 44, a forum, 44 slash 73, which asked me a series of questions. Then they take that information and they submit it to the FBI database and they do a background check, but it happens instantly because technology people. It's interesting because there's a lot of people who feel, like I said, undergo some type of CIA investigation before I buy a gun. The same people who also hate the government. Exactly right. So when they did the instant aspect of the background check causes people who don't know very much about the process that think that there isn't one. Right. Just because I can buy the gun easily doesn't mean it was done thoroughly. You know what I'm saying? I underwent the background check.

Speaker 1:          00:33:02       There's a system there. They checked it against the system. If I don't have any felonies or anything that prevents me from owning a firearm, I'm allowed to buy the gun. Okay. So when people say there are, there are no background checks and background checks aren't tight enough or however you want to extrapolate that. Is there any credence to any of that that you can. So now let's talk. So I think what you're, what you're kind of going into is universal background checks, right? So when they say universal back, now they do conflate these terminologies. There's universal background check is a very specific statement. It's not like saying coke, right? Because people here universal background checks and all the. Here's the background check part. That universal means something. And what that means is it's a requirement that every single transaction you have to undergo a background check, even private transactions.

Speaker 1:          00:33:47       Right? So right now in California, if I had a gun, right, I can bring a gun into California, just can't carry it. But you were like, hey, you know what, cause I like that gun. You have right one to buy it from you in California. I can't sell it to you right now. What? Here's what I can do. I can say, all right, cool. When I get back to Texas, I'll transfer the gun to a gun store here in California if it's on a specific list that allows you to actually own that gun, right? Because California has the district. Yeah. And then you would have to go to the gun store and then buy it right now. Let's say I decided to give you the gun anyway.

Speaker 1:          00:34:27       Privately, right now in this room, no one else is here. But you went on and I saw the either gun. You want me to shut the cameras and I don't have any plans on going to jail. And I sell you the gun. You know, and then let's say you have the gun, what is there to check against? What databases did they check against to determine whether or not you got a background check for that gun? Now, just completely two issues right now, so. Well if we did it on the dl there, there's no, there's no way and that's what the whole concept of the universal background check is. It is to require a background check for every private transaction. Now, legally right now I can't do it, but like in Texas I can sell a gun to a friend and as long as I know he's not a prohibited person and I know he's not a felon, I can sell him that gun.

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       No problem. That's completely legal with the universal background check idea suggests is I should have actually, he should be required to undergo a background check before I can sell in that gun. That would mean you and he and I would have to go to a gun store and undergo a background check. Then he can go and buy the gun from me. So is the problem with the way it is currently saying in Texas, the way you're describing that you just would not know intentionally enough about the person you were selling it to a potential? Absolutely. And so the reason why I'm against the universal background check is because there is no other way to enforce it, but for a national gun registry, because otherwise you have nothing to check it against to say if a cop walks down the street sees you have a gun and he's like, did you get a background check for the gun?

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Yeah. How's he going to prove otherwise? Unless there's a national registry and then there was, okay, fine. Or then let's have a national registry. No, because we've seen time and time again that when the governments have a national registered firearms, they subsequently use it to confiscate guns. Now the problem is when you say that they try to put the tin foil hat on you, right? Except because what they. What they envision is roaring truck, black military trucks coming down the street pulling guns from people's houses. No, that's not what happens or how they do it. It's constructive and then when you have potential presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton suggesting we should take apart, we should take up the Australia model, which did that very thing. They use the national, they use a national gun registration to tell people to say, you know what, you need to turn in your guns.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       It's a voluntary buyback. No, it's an. It's a, it's a mandatory buyback. Right, so, and if you don't sell your guns back, guess what? You go to jail. That's a confiscation. It's a constructive confiscation, but compensation nonetheless, just because they didn't roll the military trucks down the street and pull them out of your house doesn't mean it isn't confiscation. And so that's why I'm. I'm adamantly against universal background checks unless you can demonstrate away from it for it to be applied in such a way that would not require a gun registry because I do not trust my government not to exploit that registry in their favor. Yeah. So how much of this then, because we've talked about it, you said to me right before we started, you're sort of a libertarian. I think it's exactly what he said. I don't want to put words in your mouth. How much of this does go back to that states should be able to make the decisions that they see fit. I mean, I suspect you probably wouldn't be that thrilled living in California other than the weather. I. I'm here in California. Whether the women.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       That's pretty good. Food and texting. Yeah, we do. Yeah. I'm not complaining about that. I'm so. See. That's just it too. It's like, well, how far those states' rights go from the standpoint of violating my second amendment. Right, right. I believe in states rights, right? Them to point. You started violating my constitutional ones and so when you have places like California, which I think I think I'm being currently violated now, the fact that I can't carry my gun, what is the difference I can take? I can take my car with my Texas license and drive it right into California. No one has a problem with that. I can drive up and down these roads and as fast as I want, as recklessly as I want. Yeah, that might be illegal, but I can still do it. Does that potentially to do it, but yet I can't carry the thing that I carry to protect my life with the same license.

Speaker 1:          00:38:35       That doesn't make sense to me. Like am I any in any less danger here than I would be in Texas. If anything I can make the argument that I'm more. There's more danger for me here in that I don't know the area very well. So in a weird way, you're actually making a non states' rights argument here, right? Because if you're saying you want the same thing everywhere, that's not a states' rights argument. It's not that, but that's what I'm saying, but that's under the guise of me feeling like me not being able to carry his violation of my constitutional right. Right. Because there's rights doesn't allow them to violate those constitutional rights and that's, that's the argument I'm making now. It's difficult because when you start talking about the idea of having a uniform like concealed carry platform, right? Where one license allows you to carry a gun everywhere, right?

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       Then you start getting into the weeds about, okay, well that's violating states rights, but that's only if you don't see my ability to carry your firearm as a, as a, I'm sorry, uh, my ability to carry a firearm as a violation of my constitutional rights. Right. So it's a, it's an interesting philosophical place to talk because it's like, it just depends where you start because even though I'm definitely a states' rights guy, I hear what you say there. And then on the other hand, as a state's rights guy, to me, if a state wants to have stricter laws and you're a big gun guy, then you actually are allowed to leave. It's kind of it as I would say for virtually every other situation. It's kind of shitty. It doesn't feel great to have to leave a place that you want to be at, but if they are doing things as part of their state experiment that you don't like well on, it's on you to get going.

Speaker 1:          00:40:03       Yeah. But if that same state creates a law that violates my right to privacy, right? Well we have constitutional rights superseded. So I see. So I get, I get nature. Are we missing anything else on the technical front because we did that pretty well. I'm sure we will see a from a mechanical standpoint just from a mechanical standpoint or just any of the language that we use related to this. Okay. Okay. So yeah, so then of course there's, some people can say it's trivial. Some people say it's not. So the magazine versus clip, the general terms. Actually it's called the magazine a clip is an actual thing. It's just different from a magazine but that's kind of slightly trivial, but it, it does typically kind of expose people who don't really know much about guns when you say clip versus magazine because the proper terminology would be magazine.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Um, as far as any other mechanical components, what, what do I need to know about the magazine? Well, that's just terminology. It is semantics, right? Get this. I don't always go about correcting people because I felt like it just creates it. It kind of makes me look like an ass, but that's why we're doing this. I don't want to clean up. The biggest thing is just the assault weapon thing, right? Because the Ar 15 is the civilian weapon. It's, it's designated. The biggest difference between an ar 15 and an assault rifle is that the assault rifles, fully automatic and they are 15, isn't it? That's the biggest distinction between the two. Now, of course, then you can make the argument. Well that's some very minor distinction. You know, there's a lot of people who make that argument, but I don't look at the Ar 15 any differently than I look at the handgun in that sense.

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       Okay. So every time when one of these happens and we hear the Ar 15 is a weapon of war and so were handguns, you would basically put the Ar 15 of the handgun in the same categories as pulling ones. Yeah, she even wants. Yeah. So that would not be categorized as a, as a weapon of war will see that. See that estimation, that terminology is designed to, to manipulate the emotions of people who don't know anything about guns. So when you hear, if you don't know anything about firearms and you hear he used a weapon of war, technically speaking our guns or weapons of war, right? So words can be weapons. Exactly. So, but what that does mentally, like they understand language very well and they liked our unit, but in terms of the, I call it the anti gun side of it, I things they understand the use of language very well and um, and they confuse it purposely.

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       So when you hear someone who doesn't know anything about firearms, think about it. Like if, if I'm already kind of, I'm a little scared of firearms and then I hear he used a weapon of war. What image comes up in your mind at it's, it's Rambo, he's running down, they're just going crazy and that's exactly what he's doing. He could do the same thing with a handgun. And so the biggest thing that I like to, when I'm having these conversations with people's, you're going to walk away with, we're going to walk away with two with two points of two trains of thoughts. I'm even going to get you to admit you just want to ban all guns or you can see my perspective because if you're, if you're willing to say, you know what, we need to get rid of all the assault weapons as they, as they understand them to be, which is essentially a fifteens, but now it's actually become even more broader.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       Like we need to get rid of all semiautomatic weapons right now. Virtually every modern gun. So let's say they want to ban Ar fifteens air 15th rifles aren't even used like the, the, the percentage that rifles are used in actual shootings is so low and marginal. It's, it's unreal. So then why are we focusing on that? But okay, so then what are most shootings? Our handguns. Yeah, right. So if we get rid of that and we got rid of Ar for teens and then we have another shooting happened because the army was deadliest. Mass shooting was Virginia Tech and he used the hangup. So then what happens if that happens again? So now what are you going to ban you? You're going to abandon the hangup and that's when you're stuck. Having to confront the fact that, okay, either you really just want to ban all guns or you understand that the distinction is irrelevant, right?

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       With God to get to the absolute point of issue and why these things are happening and focusing on the gun is doing a disservice to the conversation. It sounds like I'm just utilizing. I'm using the bigger issue as a scapegoat, but in reality if you really sit down and think about it, right? We have over 300, close to 400 million guns in this country and not going anywhere and understanding that you've got to then sit down and say to yourself, all right, if we're going to try to fix this issue of gun violence or just violence in general, we've got to get to the root of the issue of why people are doing it and then understanding that. Staying within the context of reality. We've got to understand well in the process, I still have to protect myself and because people are still gonna be able to get their hands on guns whether illegal or not, and and use them to commit crimes and the bread and people's lives.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       I've got to be put in a situation to defend against that so you can bend all the outfit teams you want. Doesn't mean it's going to stop somebody from getting one on the black market. So now, yes, I don't run from the fact that the ar 15 is a more powerful platform that I agree with and I don't think it. I don't run from that. They're going to be people on who we were going to be mad at me for saying that, but the reason why the run from it just because that's the very reason why I want an ar 15 when it comes to defending my life. I don't want it to be a fair fight period. I don't want to have to confront someone with an ar 15 with a handgun if I don't have to. If you come in my house, I'm not grabbing a handgun. I am grabbing an arm,

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       see we have this strange thing. It's like when people will say, okay, well the second amendment says the right to bear arms and then they'll put up a picture of, you know, the type of arms that existed way back when and it's like well then we should have the right to that because that's what they were talking about it. It's like this is so disingenuous. Very disingenuous. It's like they were also talking about why you should be able to form a militia and it's like the thing that we'd be fighting against now has a lot more power and it doesn't mean that just because you have some guns, you're going to be able to stop the guys in the black trucks as you talked about earlier, but maybe you could defend yourself a little bit longer and who knows what happens with a little bit of time.

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       I mean fruit and be real with them. They're still fighting in Afghanistan and those guys over there just using AK $47. You get what I'm saying? So like we can't just because we're going to lose something that you just lie down and do it, you know, and in, in that the whole notion of like, ah man, I just lost my train of thought that this idea of owning firearms to combat the government and they think it's preposterous, but I'm like, ask the people in Venezuela,

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       and again, these are now the people, at least in this current moment, the people who say that the government is run by Orange Hitler. Exactly, man. It's really well. Well this is a good spot. I think changed some minds and as I said to you before we sat down and I've never considered myself a gun person per se. Uh, I'm interested in. I'm always interested in talking about these things, but I do find myself now more pro gun. It's probably not even the right phrase to say that I've ever been in my life and then. But for me it has more to do with that. I really understanding what rights are in a much clearer way and, and what I want

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       the government to do. And, and once you understand that, then

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       yeah, no, it's tough. It's tough to take other positions. It is weakened. So is there anything to you that when they always say sensible gun control and I'll always see the pro gun, people will say, well, the people that always say that just don't know what they're talking about now I sense you're probably in that spot because of that. You were just saying that they do with language. Yeah. So sensible gun control. Most of the time when people say that they actually advocate things, we already had background checks, things of that nature. Right? And then you like, and you have other language like the loop, uh, the gun show gun, your gun show loophole. Yeah, let's talk about that. That's not a loophole. All the, all that is, is a private transaction. That's all that is. And it's just happening happening. It just so happened to happen at a gun show.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       If you bought a gun from an actual dealer at a gun show, you still have to undergo a background check. So the when they say loophole with saying is that if you are at a gun show, you're not a dealer, you can actually sell that gun at the. If you are. If one person's not a prohibited possessor, you are from the same state then? Yes. If they. If there's nothing that precludes them from owning a firearm, legally I can sell them a gun at a gun show. Right. So the only slippery part of that is what we talked about earlier, which is you just may not know all the information. So there is a, there is, I guess there's a little bit of a gray area and that one is, is that a fair in terms of the backgrounds that you're sort of taking somebody's word for it at that point.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       When you guys meet somebody that day and they're like, I want to buy that gun. And you say to that, you asked them all the appropriate questions. They could be lying to you, but that's just. Yeah. But then that sold in the way. The response that they have to. That is a universal background check, but as I pointed out, how do you, how do you enforce it without a national registry and then with that national registry, even with the national registry, it doesn't stop anything, right? We, we, we, we tend to go down this road of just wanting to do things to make ourselves feel better, but in reality name one mass shooting that would have been prevented with a universal background check.

Speaker 3:          00:49:40       No one.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       Because even the people who had gone to war, supposed to have them, it got them illegally. Right? It wasn't because there wasn't a universal background check that stopped them from getting, you know, it wasn't. So I have to so I have to ask the question. I go then why are we doing this other than just to make ourselves feel better because it's literally doing nothing, nothing. And so that's why like the person who who bought and sold the gun privately at a, at a gun show could have done that in the parking lot of the gun show, could have done it at their house before going to the gun show. You get what I'm saying? But what it does is when you frame it within the context of the gun show loophole, it makes it seem like it's this bizarre where everyone comes there together and sells illegal guns.

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       That's the image that's created in the mind. Like it's barter town. Exactly. Like they feed on the, made on the ignorance of people, right? Because they're not. Everybody knows that much about guns. It's like it's one of those things. It's like, I don't know, I don't know a lot about a lot of other things that people may know a lot about. Right. So if you tell me something and I'm not really researched and schooled on that issue, you could give me the beliefs. I'm pretty Kooky stuff. Yeah. And, and that's what I'm talking to you. I mean, that's what you consistently see every time we talk about this. And you know, there's this other piece of it where it's like every time a shooting happens, you know, there's this pile on we now we should talk about it. Yeah. And then there's this other part of us where it's because we go from one crisis to another that there's never read it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:07       It seems to me at this point, we never really have time to really ever fully unpack any of these things. I think. I think there's moments like this, but on a national level, we're not particularly good at these conversations. No. Because then what it does is just turns into a political sparring match. Yeah. I mean right after the last shooting and when, when Dana Lotion and Rubio are on that CNN town hall and it was, it was amazing. I mean the gladiatorial fests, it, it was a disaster. I mean it was everything I hate about cable news. It was everything I hate about just the quick bites of all of this and flashiness and just who can we take out right now? It was a disaster. And then, and I sat and I pointed this out, how can we have a real honest conversation when they try to paint program people as crazy when we say no, the ultimate goal is to ban guns.

Speaker 1:          00:51:54       But then I can watch cnn live town hall where we suggest you do realize banding on somebody. The amount of guns is essentially banning all guns and the entire stadium erupts in applause and cheers. Yeah. So then it goes, Yo. Rubio said exactly what you said. And they started cheering even even when confronted with the core, because Rubio said, look, you want to bet on somebody that had a gun to your me kitchen really quickly and tell you that it's virtually all guns. So even when he corrected them, so it wasn't. They can't, they can't, they can't claim they will be ignorant on it because he just explained to them that needs banning virtually all guns and they erupted. So it goes, okay, so now you have all those programs are like, we just going to go back to our client. There's no discussion. Because while, while we're trying to be fair, you're ultimate goal is to try to ban them all.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       You know, there was that moment, I'm sure you remember this, after the Parkland shooting, when they had the big rally and one of the survivors got up there and said, we're going to come. What was the line? Do you remember the exact line where she said, basically, we're going to come for the semiautomatics now, but we're going to come through everything later. So something to that effect them. Yeah, I'm slightly butcher head, but I thought, wow, now now you're flat out saying and you're just giving. You're telling them now. So I could see why. You know, I, I see this with all my frustrations with the left all the time. It's like I know they're never going to stop. I've seen it so consistently and that's why I'm staking out some positions, but sometimes it's, it's kind of sucky to have to just be like, well, the people that I'm fighting against so to speak, they're not dealing in the same world that I'm dealing in and I.

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       and that makes it more important for me to stake out a position. But the thing that's most frustrating about it is the way they'll color it in the mainstream media is that were unreasonable. We don't want to move on inch. We've dug her heels in. All we want is we don't care about anything. And really what it is is no, I let you into my house and now you're trying to take my house from me. So get out because that's essentially what they're saying is all right. So they'll say, well common sense. That's why we hate that word. Common sense because it cause it's disingenuous. It's like, well we need common sense measures after a shooting in another shooting happens, we need more common sense measures. And another shooting happened. We need even more common sense measures. Windows commonsense mentioned, stopped being common sense and just intruding on my rights and I can see the, you know, you know my thing for guns to use, free speech to me.

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       And it's like I can see this coming with that give these guys took control. You'd start seeing, well we can have free speech, but we need some common sense controls around Greece, so I. So I do understand the position that I tell people all the time. I'm like, there are over 300 federal gun laws in this country. I think we've been reasonable. I think we were really truly being unreasonable. We wouldn't have over 300 federal gun law and I can't even begin to tell you how many we have on a state level. Right? So it's incredibly disingenuous to think that we're just being hard, hard assets who don't want to move one inch on the issue. Right. No one's saying it should be a free for all where we're just handing out guns to everyone like Oprah. Right. I don't think anybody has a problem inherently with background checks.

Speaker 1:          00:55:15       Now he's talking about universal background checks. That's a different thing. But since nobody. Since they never want to make that distinction, right? No one ever knows that you can't, you can't. Exactly. And then the idea of like, you know, we can talk about gun free zones and it begs the question is like what does that, what does that sticker on when they're going to do for me? So now I have to make like people don't really like to sympathize with gun owners in a sense of like we all want the same result, right? We want the killing to stop. We want the violence to stop. Notice I said violence and killing, not just gun violence, right? Because we can't just focus on gun violence because violence is violence. However you die, you die and it's bad all the way around. But when I have to make a decision about whether or not I potentially break a law to go into an establishment that may or may not cause me to need my gun at some point, and that's messed up.

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       And I know that there are a lot of people who don't see it that way because they don't see value in the second amendment because they're not firearm owners. Right? There are a lot of people who look at the second amendment is useless because they don't own firearms, but when you have a group of people who understand the importance of it and how it fits into their lives and they understand that at the end of the day when something happens, the only person who's going to be there to stop it is you. That's a big deal. So it's not just me trying to protect a piece of metal because I just want to have fun with my guns. No, it's much bigger than that. It's this idea that I have to rely on myself. You can tell me all day long, the police are going to be there, the police are going to be there, but they're not going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       They're just not. And then, and then you think you named were at Parkland. Exactly right. So then you, then you add kids, family into the mix. That ratchets it up to a whole nother level. So that. What about the piece of this that just sort of optics. So, you know, every now and again you'll see a picture of like three dudes with big ass guns at Aaa, an open carry. Now I know if I was, if I walked into Japan and three guys came in with big ass guns on their back, you can prototype notice why would take notice? And I probably leave. I probably would, I would just be like, you know, like, and again I'm here, I'm here in California where that would be so, so out of the norm. But for the person that's living in Texas, you can do this. If I was in AAA, right?

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       And three guys walking in, I probably would leave no one. Everything that you just said there, knowing that these guys are probably NRA members and, and as far as I know, no NRA member has ever done a mass shooting know. Right? Okay. So, uh, you know, because you see this, all the celebrities, Michael, Ian Black light out on the show who's on this rampage telling everyone that you guys are terrorists. I mean really that you're part of a terrorist organization. Okay? And so all the other 5 million members, but I think there is something about some of the optics of that, you know what I mean? Like I would be nervous now. I get your point would be, well those guys are going to protect you and the other guy walks in or whatever. And some of that may be feelings over facts right there, but it just, it just is.

Speaker 1:          00:58:13       The interesting thing about it that is a big debate within the gun, the gun community as a whole. The idea of open carry versus concealed carry. I don't ever open carry except for maybe if I'm out hunting or I'm on the range or something like that. But that's, that's a personal decision. I'm choosing my own for various reasons. One, sometimes I rather not have the attention. And tactically I liked the advantage of having the element of surprise. You don't know I have a gun on me, so if I had to use it, I'm going to be reacting. Right? I'm not going into a place to shoot it up. If somebody decides to come into a place to shoot, I'm going to be reacting to that. So I need all the advantages I get from my personal perspective. So I want the element of surprise. There's some people who think only alternative.

Speaker 1:          00:58:56       They feel like just the mere presence of that gun is a deterrent from anyone who wants to come in and do some bad. So if a guys casing out a couple of stores in, then ecs, there are certain citizens in there with long guns and some that have a hand guns on the side of your hip, then that's a deterrent. I understand the alarm that people who don't necessarily engage in interact with fire arms get when they see people walking around with rifles. Right. Even though I've never been. I've seen a couple of people in Texas do it and initially my gut reaction and I'll admit was like, what? What's going on here? I'm now, I'm very versed firearms and I have a gun too. So at that point I actually almost welcome it and the reason why is because if you're going to do something, I now get to see you attempt to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       You get what I'm saying? There's a telegraph. They are in a unique case. Yes, but I'm speaking from purely a personal preference, right? Am I getting on the whole for anyone else or anything like that? Me Personally, I would rather like to know you have it right if I can see it, because then I know where to focus my attention versus me kind of being alone to a state of complacency because of its absence. And then all of a sudden somebody stands up and decides he wants to shoot the place up. Um, and then I have to react to that. Um, but again, that's tactics, right? That, that's personal preference in that regard. However, I do understand the alarm that somebody who would have seen you three guys walking into aaa with, uh, with rifles because it seems seemingly, especially to them, it seems like that's a bit excessive.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       I'm not gonna lie to you. If I can conceal carry a rifle, I would because it's better at defending me than a handgun was the only reason. The only reason I have a handgun it was because it's small enough for me to conceal and it allows me to live my life in an uninterrupted. Otherwise I'd walk around with a rifle. Okay. So we can't end without doing sort of what I think would be the big question for everything we've talked about. Hearing for someone that works with the NRA and your show is on nitv and all that. So what is going on in America right now that seems to be unique to our society? We do have more shootings here than I and I think virtually all other western nations combined. Um, so. Okay. For you to fact check me on that if I butchered that one.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       But it does seem it's. And even if I'm slightly. Oh No, no, you're good. You're good. It seems that there is something uniquely happening here now. I would argue that there's all sorts of mental health issues and probably a prescription drugs and maybe non prescription drugs and all sorts of other stuff. So there's a, there were a couple of things. So I'll try to. I've try to keep this as concise as possible because we are going to get into weeds for a split second. He got. So first of all, let's talk about mass shootings, right? Your schools, school districts. For instance, I recently just read a study from northwestern university I'm not too long ago, which talked about comparing the number of school shootings back in the nineties versus the versus today. And what they concluded essentially was the perception is that it's happening more frequently, but it's not, it's actually on par or even less now than it was then.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       Now you can people who are going to do like, oh my God, how could you possibly say that? Google it. It's a northwestern university. Um, research. Uh, I can't remember the actual title of the actual research, but we're going to grab it from you after this guy's linked to it. And absolutely. So that being said, mass shootings account for a very, very, very marginal percentage of shootings in this country. Let's start off with the overall. So 35, 35 to 36,000 people each year die from guns, right? I didn't specify gun violence, but just guns because they don't do that. They'll just say gun violence. Right? So 60 about 60 to 65 percent of those, that 35,000 suicides. Now what I'm not saying is we don't care about suicides. We do. However, when it comes to the idea and the issue of somebody shooting at me that's a.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       that's not. It's not Germane. But then even still, if you want to make the argument, well, if we had less guns, we'd have less suicides. That's also not true because our suicide rate is on par with every other major country. So if it was a case that the more guns you have, the more suicides will you be leading the charge? We don't there where there's a will. There's a way. Exactly right. Even some of the more famous suicides that we've had, they didn't use guns. So we sat that number aside, which is a huge number, 65 percent, it's huge number out of 35, 36,000. So then you have about one to three percent which are justifiable homicides, that self defense, that's including police shooting criminals who are shooting at them, right? And people who use guns in self defense, right? We got to set that aside because that's not the issue we're trying to address.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       So it's at that number. So and then you have about five percent which are accidental, right? Kid gets behind the gun, pull triggers, unfortunate, extremely unfortunate. However, I believe personally half of that can easily be addressed with more education. So if we took the energy that we took that we we placed, now I'm trying to vilify guns and have national campaigns teaching people about gun safety, that we'll cut that number in half because a lot of these accidents easily preventable, but they're just people who have gone to just don't know. And so if we spend time educating those people, do we know what percentage of that subset is getting those guns legally or illegally? Because I would imagine that a lot of it's probably illegal, which is why they don't know how to use the gun in the first. I'm not going to assume I have that answer because I don't have that hard number.

Speaker 1:          01:04:23       Um, but, and I would bet I do feel comfortable assuming that as well. Right? Um, and so we take that, the accidents and set that aside, purely homicides were looking at around seven to 10,000 every year. Right now, that's a different looking number, right? When will be accounted for all of the, the context here with those, those other shootings. Now the vast majority, I'd say close to 80 percent that I've read in a couple of articles of those homicides are happening in the inner cities of our country. Right? So then reasoning goes, all right, so let's look at those inner cities and it's, look at the dynamics there, right? You have low jobs, lack of economic opportunity, storied households and a narco economy that warrants that warrants but creates the necessity for this type of violence. So if we dealt with the socioeconomic aspects of what's going on in those areas right to we really have a gun problem,

Speaker 1:          01:05:42       just think about it. I know I know other communities filled with black people, they have guns, they don't have the same level of violence because I only say black people because most people associate the inner city with with black people. Right? But the reason why we had that high level of concentration of violence, it's because of the conditions in those environments. And then even within those communities there are. The vast majority of people in those committees are good people and it's a very minor group of people who are creating a large number of the violence. Right? So there's something to be said. Do we really have a gun problem or do we have a social economic suicide problem in this country? Because at the end of the day, this 35 to 36,000 that people assuming is all gun violence by way of homicides, people shooting at other people to kill them. It's not the case. We're looking at closer to seven to 10,000 if that. So if you take those numbers and you compare them other countries, then how does it look?

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       Could it be continued? Yeah. Well I'm so glad that we finally did this and we will definitely do this again because I absolutely. This story and everything we've talked about here is just going to continue. I mean these are the battles that we're now fighting on many fronts related to the constitution and free speech and free expression and your ability to, to own your life and all that stuff. And that's all we ask is. This is a. let me see.

Speaker 1:          01:07:05       Well I'll say one last thing. Yeah, people are, there are a lot of people. It was like, why do you feel the need to carry a gun? Why? I like the chances of you needing to use that gun to protect yourself one percent. And the answer I have for that is this. You may be right. The chance of me need to care to actually use my gun to defend myself. Maybe really slim, maybe one percent, but if that one percent happens, it's 100 percent of everything. The consequences are 100 percent and that's why it's so important. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:07:35       Well, that's how you and to show you know, you maybe we'll do this next time. Maybe we'll bring you on with someone on some of the other side of the issues on this. I will tell them what that conversation sounds like. A plan. All right. For Moron coli on check them out on twitter. Mr Leon nor.
