Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Paris, San Bernardino, Jerusalem, Brussels, it seems not a day goes by without another murderous assault on innocent civilians. Last Sunday bore witness to one of the most horrific attacks in recent memory as a Taliban affiliated group, um, to park in Lahore, Pakistan, killing scores of women and children celebrating the Easter holiday. These attacks only seem to be getting more brazen, more coordinated, and more effective. People all over Europe are worried and with good reason. It seems governments all throughout the European continent had been ill prepared to deal with the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Please note, I once again said radical Islamic terrorism and not all Muslims. I think I've done that once or twice before. This distinction is becoming increasingly exhausting to have to point out, but one I continue to make unfortunately, many on the right refuse to separate the nominal average person from the radicals and many on the left refuse to acknowledge there are a few of us who do make that distinction over and over.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       While I've now conceded that the far left will never accept any good faith critique of Islam and will always excuse and sometimes even endorse it's terrorism. I know that many good people are waking up to this nonsense every day. This is one of the themes the rubin report has been all about, and I'm glad to say that we're ahead of the curve on it, so one more time. It is radical Islamists, a subset of people who believe in Islam, who are blowing up airports, trains, and parks. They don't care whether the people they murder are men or women, grandparents or children, black or white. They want to sow chaos and destruction in the name of their religion. Don't take my word for it by the way, read the statements, the jihadists issue after each terror attack, these statements are all filled with religious reasons, quoting doctrine to kill infidels and nonbelievers.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       This is a good time to remind people. Once again what a religion is. It is a set of ideas or religion isn't built into you like your sex or your color or religion is just a bunch of ideas only made of reality by people who practice it's beliefs. Any set of ideas is worthy of critique. Whether these ideas are religious, political or personal, so if you would be against throwing gays off of roofs, making women wear burkas and treating minorities as second class citizens. If a political party had those ideas and its platform, then you must be against those ideas. When a religion has them in its doctrine and for the billionth time, this doesn't mean you should be bigoted against all people who practice that faith because there are a multitude of ways of being part of any faith. What it does mean however, is that at the very least, you must be against the ideas that you would be against if they came from anywhere else besides religion.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Actually, you should be much braver than just being against bad ideas. You should impact stand for good ideas or one day the violence you silently condone will be at your doorstep. This is why the regressive left is so dangerous. They've tricked decent people with good intentions into thinking that they're legitimate fears about terrorism or somehow bigoted or racist. Not only is this pure nonsense, but he has also fueled the rise of the right wing parties in Europe and Donald Trump here in America. The ideas of the regressive left have gone from wrong to malicious screaming about the crusades. Every time there is a jihadist attack is pointless. Focusing on one random atheist who committed a mass shooting is irrelevant. These regressives or trying to guilt and confuse you into accepting their backwards thinking. We in the west, fortunately can't stand up to jihadist face to face, but we absolutely must stand up to those in our own societies who will excuse people who would kill us due to their misguided sense of protecting a religion.

Speaker 1:          00:04:11       Ironically, this disease of the mind which regressive thinking really is, is the furthest thing from progressive values, but also is an added bonus for the jihadists. They can kill scores of people and then their Western allies will do mental gymnastics to excuse and explain why they did it. The more that jihad is, say it's about religion, the more the regressive say it isn't generally I find jihadists to be more honest than regressive, so I'm going to take their word for it. The world is at a precarious point. We can debate how much foreign policy is enabled jihadists or whether America's toppling of Saddam Hussein led to Isis. Of course, we can go much further back in history to the British empire or the Ottoman Empire even further. These blood feuds have gone on for thousands of years and will probably go on until after we're all gone. The question is, will we in western societies now stand together and no longer accept excuses for terror?

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       If you feel the need to make an excuse when a bomb goes off in a Paris theater, you're inviting terrorism to your farmer's market. In Los Angeles, people will always have a grievance and if you tell them that it's an acceptable to murder innocent because of your western guilt or misguided sense of justice, then you are condemning yourself to a world where there are no rules. We will all live between terrorists trying to kill us and Authoritarians who will promise us safety. It's a false choice, but it's exactly where we are headed. If good people won't stand up. Now, I'm not sure how many jihadists watched the show, but I'm pretty sure many good and decent people do start calling out this regressive thinking in your own world, stopping being cowed by false cries of racism or bigotry. Start beating their self flagellation with the truth about why Western society is good.

Speaker 1:          00:06:04       The Islam is earned bed with liars and regressive conmen. Their ideas will spread faster. If we don't wake up now and if you think this is a job for someone else, then this evil alliance has already won. I don't think it has, but I know we need more vocal allies. One such ally is my guest this week, Julie Lunars, Julie's a terrorism expert and director of the Human Security Center in London. She's on the front lines of calling out radical Islam for the danger that it is. I'm looking forward to talking to her about some difficult topics and maybe I'll even ask her about those pesky crusade. Remember, if you're still upset about the Crusades, which happened a thousand years ago, then you should be at least equally upset about the ones happening. Right now. Julie Lynn, ours is the executive director of the Human Security Center and a principal consultant to the European Parliament intergroup on religious freedom. Julie, welcome to the show.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       So good to beat him.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       Uh, I'm really excited to talk to you because I've been following you on twitter for probably three years or so and you've really been ahead of the curve on calling out Islamist extremist terror or Islamic extremists terror or jihadist terror or whatever phrase you want to use. Y'All let you break down some phrases. You've been ahead of it. And one of the people that when I see with the things that you tweet, I'm always like, she gets it. She understands it. A. So let's start. What brought you to this spot? How did you get involved in being one of the people that studies this, that talks about it, that consulted about it?

Speaker 2:          00:07:45       When I read my first book on politics when I was 12, and I know that probably makes me sound like a complete geek. I read my first book on politics when I was 12 about the conflict in Ireland about Northern Ireland and I was interested in why people were healing for their belief and for their ideology. And of course Ireland was more about national terrorism rather than religious terrorism. I mean there was a religious component in the sense that you have, you had the IRA on the one hand that was kept clinic and you had the Uda and the other power metallic power monetary, um, organizations that were Protestant or the other items. But anyway, I mean that's how I got interested in, in conflict and white people were killing in holiness and people for their beliefs. And then two years later, of course, nine slash 11 happens and I report in at the time I remember it, acid acid was yesterday.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       I wasn't in school that day. I was at home. I was ill, I was sitting on the couch, I was watching random television and suddenly this horrific images it pay it on my screen and obviously my first reaction was this was a terrible, terrible tragedy, an accident. But the moment, the second plane hit the towers, I think everybody knew that whatever it was and that the time, obviously we were still lacking the rhetoric to describe what just happened. I realized that this was a game changer, that the world would never be the same again. And that is true. I mean the world was never the same again after 9:11 and an obviously Afghanistan happened in Iraq happened and when we went into Iraq, I was 16 at the time. And I think that was really the moment I would describe as my awakening in the sense that I realized we were not just fighting the enemy from the outside, but also the enemy within.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       And I'm not talking about the people who post a wolf a perfectly legitimate reasons, more everything's strategic reasons. Um, I'm talking about the people who hijacked the antiwar movement and who were happy to call George George W dot Bush and Tony Blair war criminals, while at the same time turning around and embracing people. I come as a terrorist organization, had prejudice genocide against the Jews and people like George Galloway who was on record praising Saddam Hussein, some courage strings in project finishes. And that was the moment when I realized, guys, we really have a problem and we need to talk about this.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Yeah. So I really want to dive into that because it's a, it's so related to everything we've been talking about here, this sort of moral confusion that people seem to have in a lot of it unfortunately does seem to be on the left and the right's got plenty of moral confusion itself. Um, but yeah, we seem to see a lot of that. I left. That's interesting. So because you were young around the time that nine slash 11 happened. I'm a little older than you. I was in. I lived in New York City at the time and of course I had studied politics before, but of course it was a defining moment for me and for literally millions of people as well. So the. So all that happens. And then when did you actually start working in this field and really sort of talking about this publicly and making that your, your life's work?

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       Well, I actually started writing a personal blog at the time the war in Iraq happened and I talked about it a lot. I mean that was the first thing I really talked about publicly a lot about the reasons why. Even though, as I said before, I always had great respect for the people who opposed the war for perfectly legitimate reasons that I. However, there was also a more legitimate case for the wall. I mean, look at the torture chambers and the concentration camps and the genocide against the Kurds. I think it was a, a former Kaddish president who once said that Iraq was a concentration camp above ground, above ground and a mass grave beneath. And that was true. It was one of the worst dictatorships on earth and that's when I really got involved in this debate and was exposed to dwight a public and that was also the time really when people started attacking me for my views.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       Yeah. So when, when people talk to you about the Iraq war now, I mean, the meme in America is that, you know, had we not toppled George had George W had we not topple George W Bush, George W Bush, uh, not, not toppled Saddam, that ultimately had we not gone into Iraq that, that would have, that isis wouldn't be here basically is the, is the idea that, and you know, as I've talked to some experts in this, a lot of people are saying, well, Saddam, as you just said, was doing some pretty horrific things. So despite knowing now that there weren't weapons of mass destruction or at least that we never found them, do you still in your mind, do you feel that that what we did was still a moral case and what you guys did as well? And obviously, uh, you know, Tony Blair had something to do with it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       Yes, I still believe, I still believe after everything that it was right to, to topple this regime and you know, some of some of the things that people were saying, why we shouldn't intervene, like at least Saddam Hussein contains. Iran for me really never was a moral argument. You cannot contain one dictatorship with a theocratic regime and vice versa. And um, for the curb it was a liberation. I mean, look at Kurdistan today, Iraqi Kurdistan as a beacon of hope in the entire region. And, um, I obviously, I obviously I'm acknowledged that we did something's terribly wrong, which led to bloodshed and chaos. The dismantling of the Iraqi army to debar certification. All of the big things really, um, I think were catastrophic and I'm really happy to admit that, but it doesn't change the fact for me that this was a genocidal dictator. I mean, he committed a crime of all crimes. Ninety five percent of Kurdish villages were exposed to chemical weapons during the DNF pumpkins pain. And that is still the reason why I still believe after everything, that it was the right thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:13:57       Yeah. And that's not even to talk about what he was doing to dissidence and free thinkers and secular, secularism,

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       all of them. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Yeah. So tell me a little bit about the type of work that you do now. What, what's actually the base work that you're doing?

Speaker 2:          00:14:15       Well, we do different things. We work with the government, a government, of course we work with non governmental organizations. We've worked with media, we work with the public and we do public outreach. I'm. One of the things that we currently doing is we're working with a European Parliament intergroup on religious freedom and um, what, what we're doing for them. Basically it's a once a year we are looking at the worst violators of religious freedom across the world. Everything is really old continent from Latin America to Asia to, to um, um, to Africa. And we, we look at the sources of persecution, we look at why religious minorities in that particular country are targeted and by whom they are targeted and what we can do to help these people.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       Alright. So who's doing most of the targeting?

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       Well, first of all, it, it is a, it is a phenomenon and affect all countries across all continents really. And it also affects all religions. Of course you have a, you have, for instance, the brutal persecution of Muslims in Burma by Buddhist extremists. And do you have the persecution of Muslims by Christian minutia and the Central African Republic or you have, um, you have the persecution of Christians by Hindu nationalists in India, but the vast majority of religious persecution we see in the world today has some kind of relation to the religion of Islam, whether it's by a state actor or a non state actor.

Speaker 1:          00:15:58       I had a feeling that's what you were going to say. So because we're, we're the good guys in this case and we try to separate people from ideas. How do you guys, when you're studying this and you're learning about this, how do you separate what is done in the name of religion in the name of doctrine versus just the geo political realities on the ground?

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       When I mean, um, we, we looked, for instance at, at the law of the country and the constitution of the country and what you will find at many of these countries is that the constitution in itself already discriminates against minorities. So for instance, the president of the country can only be Muslim and um, that is of course not just something that, that is purely decided on religious grounds. It's also a strategic decision, right? I mean they want to, to, to keep to themselves, but then you also have completely irrational persecution of minorities who can't do any harm whatsoever to the state because they are a tiny minorities and they are deprived of all their rights. And that is of course, when it's no longer strategic and when it really comes down to religious doctrine. And I'm talking for instance about the Ahmadiyya Muslims, the values, uh, in, in Sunni Muslim states often does she, um, again, that is both related to religion. Enter your politics are often, it's also a mixture of both. And it's very difficult to tell what it is for political or religious reasons that people are being persecuted. But yeah, I mean that definitely is a problem that we have with religious inspired persecution of minorities in the Muslim world.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       So I know you do a lot of work with and for the Kurds. We've been talking a bit about the Kurds here. It's incredibly under reported, especially in the states. Um, are they the best example of a persecuted minority because they're a minority in at least four countries. They never got their state when the whole thing was carved up and they were basically treated incredibly poorly by Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. So are they really the best example for you when you were talking about this kind of stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:18:11       Well, you know, I was, I was joking a couple of weeks ago that I should get myself a tee shirt saying I supported the cats before it became fashionable because now be know a lot of people talk about them and don't get me wrong, I'm, I'm really, really pleased that people are finally giving them the attention and exposure that these wonderful and openminded and largely peaceful and brave people deserve. And yes, I, I honestly believed that probably since the formation of the state of Israel in the 19 forties at what we're seeing with the Kurds, the struggle for self determination is probably the most promising democracy experiment in the Middle East because low had one, the curts are doing, I mean the Iraquis can, if you, if you take Iraqi Kurdistan as an example, we're just a semi autonomous region and in the north of the country they have their own president and prime minister in Parliament and the passion of God, which is we just eat the, the army of off the Kurdistan region.

Speaker 2:          00:19:12       I mean they have taken hundreds of thousands of people from Syria, from Iraq, persecuted by the Islamic state, hunted body outside regime, including tens of thousands of Christians who otherwise would have been slaughtered or at least enslaved. They were able to celebrate Easter in safety and peace. And it's not just that they are providing basic needs to these people. They are going a step further. They are actually trying to support the rights of religious minorities. And last year, the Kurdistan region of Iraq did something that I feel is absolutely unique and historic. They decided to give to each of the minority minority communities, religious minority communities in Iraqi Kurdistan, the official representation. So they all have their own representatives now and not just one. It's not just the Muslims and the Christians. No. Also the Jews and the buys and to show that the shoebox and and Ahmadiyya Muslims were persecuted all across the Muslim world. And you know, these are not just token appointment. These guys are really doing work that the first Jewish represented just comes back from a visit from Israel where he met with lawmakers and always trying to really find ways to build bridges between Israel and Kurdistan. And this is absolutely unique in that region. And it's fascinating if you think about the defect that just miles away from Erbil where the, where the Kurdish parliament sets the stage is, you know, is, is, is in place. And that is of course the most fundamental manifestation of radical Islam

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       had a few weeks ago who is the, uh, the Krg rep to the United States. And we were talking about that border and how close everything is and it's really crazy because basically the Kurds, the peshmerga, they are fighting the isis on one side and then they're also fighting Turkey on the other side and Turkey as a NATO ally. Can you explain a little bit of the complexity there? Because it's really complex because there are also Kurds in Turkey and they have a political party and they're trying to negotiate with Turkey. It doesn't sound like it's going that well.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       Yep. You have to make a distinction between the Kurds in Iraq and the cat's in theory. I ended up the text and the cuts and Turkey and the cuts and in Iran because they all have different goals and they all have different relationships with. With Turkey as well. The relationship between the Kurdistan region of Iraq with Turkey is actually not that bad. It's a. it's the problem with the PK K in in Turkey, that is in for many years now. I'm trapped in a brutal conflict with the Turkey stage and of course the PKK is allied to the GPJ in Syria, which now controls almost the entire border with Turkey and Turkey is bonding the Kurds, the same people we are working with, the US is working with to find Islamic state. So what we actually seeing is that the US net coalition is at war with itself.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       Yeah. So what, what is that? Because it seems like this is now an open secret that this is happening. The Kurds are fighting isis on the ground. They're basically the only fighting force on the ground fighting Isis and Turkey is bombing them. And we are a NATO ally with Turkey. So how is this secret being allowed? It's being, it's out and we're not doing anything about it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:55       Well, what Europe needs the cooperation of the Turkish state because of the refugee crisis, right? Turkey in many ways from the gateway from Syria to Europe. And they need to go on to play a play along. And that is one of the reasons why so many governments in Europe, uh, hesitant to criticize the Turkish government for the way they're treating the cuts both in own country and also in theory.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       So Turkey basically is having their cake and eating it too, and that they're letting the fighters in through Europe, right? They come from Europe, they go through Turkey, they go in and then Turkey is then bombing the Kurds because they're not thrilled with the Kurds. So it's good for them. And then we have to play ball with them because they're also the buffer zone. So it really, that's like one of those cases where you can really see how complex this stuff is.

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Yeah, I mean basically what do you can say is that Turkey is more afraid of a Kurdish stage than it is Islamic stage. And that's exactly. I mean, if you look at that policy and the way they react in the region, I think that that's crystal clear. And we, we, we can't, uh, we can't really deny that. And I personally agree with you that it's, it's absolutely shameful that a NATO partner is bonding with the group of people that is most efficient in fighting the Islamic state. Now, I'm not condemning by any means the terrorist attacks that we've seen in Turkey by the PKK. No, no. Terrorism is ever justified against anyone. I, I con I rejected when you some extent is doing that. I rejected when the IRA was doing that in Northern Ireland. I rejected when the PKK is doing that in Turkey, but it's more complex than just the PKK and the Turkeys state. I mean this goes way beyond Turkey just taking action against the PKK. They're really using this to sort of justify an entire crackdown on, on the Kurds within Turkey and the Kurds in Syria. And this basically goes hunting it hand in hand with an increased all three, um, authoritarianism inside Turkey. If you look at the crackdown on the media, free speech activists, this all goes hand in hand. It's not just the, the cuts that being targeted, it's freethinkers. Everybody you to criticize President Erdogan.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       Yeah. So I want to back up to something that you said about the Kurds a moment ago that they've sent a representative to Israel and I know that there is supposedly some other sort of behind the scenes relationships there, but does that sort of proved that at the end of the day, regardless of what religion people are, uh, that really that having sort of the base human freedom and respect for minorities and things like that, that that's what will make these countries succeed or fail. It's not a coincidence that the countries that seem to fail are the least tolerant. So that's a relationship that should be nurtured further. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       Well, absolutely. And uh, I think what would you say is absolutely true. The cut are the best example because let's not forget they are Muslims. The vast majority of are Muslims and yet they practice and if not that is inclusive and respectful to other people. And it is possible. It's not, it's not mutually exclusive to be Muslim as, as a person and be, be open minded towards others. And the coke have a long standing history and culture of tolerance and peaceful coexistence. So in, in that way, yes, the kids really are the best example and the beacon of hope and a region that is otherwise drowning in blood and, and, and my mom,

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       right. And it also, it's a beautiful thing because it shows that religions can, don't always have to be their extremist parts, uh, and that they're using street. There are strategic reasons in that area that they might want to partner up with Israel and things. So it gets the religion out of it and it gets some of the Geo politics out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:56       Yes. And it's quite interesting if you go to Kurdistan and he talked to two people about Israel and about America, you don't get this hostility that you get in many Arab countries where they perceive and Israel and America is the worst of everything. And now we got, you get a very different attitude in Kurdistan where they are looking at Israel and looking at American. They're looking at our science and technology. You know, leave aside politics for a moment, look and everything else, you know, the lutheranism that we have, the freedoms that we have, freedom of speech to everybody, you know, has the right to do whatever they say in what they admire, that they inspire, they inspire to be like us, not in the sense that they were giving up their own culture, but having an open minded view of the world that is compatible with the 21st century.

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       Yeah. Alright. So let's shift we, I mean, we could spend, so it's so complex that we could spend the rest of the hour talking about it, but let's shift to some of the other stuff going on right now. So obviously there was the attack in Brussels last week, just a few days ago. There was the attack in Pakistan. It seems to me that these things are starting to become more frequent and there's just a feeling that now, you know, I saw something this week that they're saying that there's probably 400 isis operatives in Europe ready to partake in whatever the next event is going to be. Um, so can you just break down Brussels a little bit because I know for, for weeks before people were saying this was about to happen. Uh, so they obviously had good intelligence and it still happened and I think that's what the really scary part is.

Speaker 2:          00:28:35       Yes. I mean obviously what happened in Russia is absolutely horrific, but it was not up to me at least, it was not a surprise, you know, it was coming. We knew that and you were just saying that obviously we had good intelligence. Well you have to distinguish the Abbott, but because obviously the Belgian authorities didn't have the intelligence that they were supposed to be having. And that is a problem that people like myself who have raised for quite a long time now that the very weak nature of the Belgian state. I mean, it's sometimes even problematic to speak of Belgium as a state because it's so torn apart in eternity. And the state of the Belgian, um, secret services and intelligence services, they are inequipped. They are massively undecided and they simply don't have the resources to monitor all the people that they're actually supposed to be monitoring because let's not forget that Belgium has the highest percentage per capita of foreign fighters do some estate in the entire European Union and it's no, it's no coincidence that these people have chosen Belgium as a place where they can gather and plan and carry out a text because of course there are well aware of all these weaknesses that I've just missed it and you know, by failing their own people, Belgium is putting everyone else at risk because obviously these people do not appreciate nation states.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       You know, someone in France, someone in Germany or the UK. It's just as much an enemy to these people as the people of Belgium and it can openly cross borders. I mean we have, we still have the Schengen area in, in Europe where people can cross borders without showing that passport or a new form of identification. And that's why we're seeing the terrorism that we see. And that's also why we see a network really spamming from. From Paris to Belgium. And this was the first time ever that one terrorist cell managed to attack to European capitals?

Speaker 1:          00:30:43       Yeah. Did you hear any? I saw a story that I saw in one place and then I didn't see a picked up anywhere else. So if this is not true, please stop me. But I heard that when they were going to arrest the guy in Belgium just a week ago, that apparently that in his community that about 200 people we're trying to stop the police and the anti terror people from arresting and they were throwing bottles at the police and all kinds of stuff. Did you hear about that and is it being reported in Europe at all?

Speaker 2:          00:31:12       I heard about that as well. I think some media outlets reported that there were riots taking place when they arrested him and to be honest, it's not surprising to me at all because you have to understand these people don't work in isolation. They are embedded in communities and if you look at these notorious neighborhoods like molenbeek and mountain, it's not just the terrorists that are the problem. It's the wider society in which they live who may be on not jihad this themselves and who not engaged in violence themselves, but who are at least to a certain degree described to the Islamist ideology, which brings me to the overall problem really that it's not good enough to say this is just a problem with a fringe because yes, there there is only a tiny minority that carries out violent attacks, but there is a lot of minority that subscribed to the Islamic world view and an even larger minority, a significant minority that practices conservative Islam that is not compatible with the modern world and we are not talking a few hundred or a few thousand people. Here we are talking millions and even if you say that just one percent of all Muslims in the world. Do you hot it? We are talking about 15 or 16 million people. I mean wrap your hand around for a moment.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Yeah, no, it's incredible. And I know that many people like Sam Harris, who I've had on this show have gone out of their way to talk about these concentric circles and you have the nominal people who don't necessarily care about religion or following doctrine, and then it sort of extends outward from that. So what do, what do we do with that? Because this is where the conversation gets difficult. So you've obviously just laid out there that you don't think all Muslims are doing this, but you do see a certain amount of problems. A certain amount of people are going to use violence. A certain amount of people are going to condone that violence. A certain amount of people are gonna see it brewing in their communities and not do anything. And then it just keeps. It's like an onion. There's just more and more layers. So how do we in the West combat that because we're fighting, we're fighting the people, we're fighting them, and then we're fighting the people on our left who are trying to silence us from talking about it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       One good example, it's your show really because you equip people with the rhetoric to to engage in just daily live in these debates as well and to make the distinction between the religion of Islam, which is a set of eaves and Islamism, which is an ideology which partly derived from a particular interpretation of the religion and jihadism, which Dennis sort of the violent extension of Islam Islam. So I think that's first of all a distinction that's very important to me because it also makes it easier for people like ourselves to reject, you know, charges of racism and bigotry and Islamophobia

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       doesn't get exhausted by making the distinction though because it almost doesn't win you any friends on the left because that's how I feel. But I'll continue to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       Exactly. I mean I don't really have another choice. Right. I mean the other option would be to, to, to join Don Donald Trump's camp and just generalize and stigmatize or Muslims and that's really not what I want to see mean. That is precisely why I'm not a bigger, that's a race because I don't want to engage in these generalizations and sweeping statements and brushing every, everyone over the same Ta. I don't want to do that and that is why I keep explaining to people there is a difference between a religion and Islam is a religion like any other religion. It is a set of beliefs and we should have the right to criticize particular beliefs within the faith if they are harmful and incompatible with modern way of life and it was sometimes called sometimes called Islam the virgin amongst faith because you are not allowed to touch it. You are not allowed to touch virgin. They are happy to discuss with you gender inequality when it comes to Orthodox Judaism and they are quite happy to discuss with you bigoted views on the fundamentalist. Christian write about abortion and women and gay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Don't forget about the crusades, the Crusades,

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       what I say all the time, but don't forget what we did 200 years ago. Know they talk about the persecution of Muslims in Burma by, by Buddhist extremists and they're not. They don't hesitate to call them extremists and make the religion and the, the, the, the link to the religion of Buddhism. But when it comes to Islam, it's off topic. You are not allowed to touch Islam. The moment you touch Islam, you're a bigot. You're a racist no matter what distinction you're making between the religion and ideology and m and g, how does him. You're a racist that very moment. You want to talk about Islam?

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       Yeah. So basically you'll continue to make this distinction because we sort of have no choice. I mean, that's how, that's how I feel too, because I don't want to hand it to the far right. But that's a good segue to a lot of what's happening in Europe right now. So you mentioned earlier that because of the European Union, uh, you know, that they're, the people don't have to use passports to go all over the place. So this is why the ideology can spread and it's white people can, can go from Paris to Brussels. Um, so two questions here. One is people seem to want. There's a certain amount of people that want to break up the EU altogether. Uh, and secondly, I want to talk about immigration as a whole. So why don't we start with the first one?

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       Why don't we see that there is a debate going on everywhere in Europe about open borders because many people feel like I'm no longer an asset and rather I'm aiding those people that we are trying to contain. I mean, I always, as a European myself, I always felt it was great and I could just cross the border. When I lived in Germany, I thought it was great, just crossed the border into the Netherlands or Belgium or France without having to show my passport. It's great. But the problem is if you have a system like open borders, you also need adequate security to back this up. And what the Belgium example shows you is that right now we are not having the security apparatus that can safeguard us was having open boarders because Belgium is failing to contain the threat and that's what they are doing and have been doing for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:37:52       And these people can travel freely across the entire European Union. It's a little different with the UK because you have to cross some water and it's more complex, but into France or Germany or the Netherlands, then we all have, we're having a problem and we have to talk about it. And I'm not even, I'm not very partisan when it comes to dessert and tie a yes EU until bud bay. But I do think that we have to honestly talk about the now your abilities of open borders at the moment. And that is true for terrorists as much as it is for refugees.

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       Do you know, is the vetting process for the migrants and the immigrants, is it the same in each country? Because if they're all, let's say they're coming through Greece, if Greece has more, uh, processes by which they can get in. Well then if you, once you're in Greece, if you can then get anywhere in Europe, I could see why you would be pretty pissed if you were in France and Greece had lead lacks, uh, you know, ways to get people in.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       Well, the truth is that all of these countries are actually overwhelmed. They cannot process all these people in time that, that day arriving. And the truth is also that many of them are just throwing away their papers so you have no way to even, uh, you know, check who they are, where they're coming from, and the truth they thought so that many of them actually not coming from Syria. They also coming from countries like Afghanistan and Eritrea. And I feel like the biggest problem at the moment is that we are only treating the symptoms. We are not treating the root cause because what is the plan for Eritrea? Nobody's talking about Eritrea. What are we going to do about the situation in, in Eritrea to make sure that not more people that coming. I mean we have to look at these countries and the situation in these countries and we have to ask ourselves what can we do to change the situation on the ground and to have people within their own region.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       Because the truth is that even a notch country like Germany, a welcoming country like Germany cannot take in all the people that need help. And how would you explain to someone from Libya that yes, we are taking in people from Syria and Eritrea and Afghanistan, but no, you Olivia, please stay away. We can't discriminate there. And the truth is that we cannot take in all these people. And my fear is that uncle amber sent a very dangerous message in the sense that people now believe everybody can come. And we, if you look at the situation in Germany at the moment, you see they're already struggling. I know that the government is not willing to admit that, but if you look at the situation on the ground, they are really, really struggling. And the opposition within even her own party is growing by the day.

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       Yeah. So this is an example where when I hear this, I always say, well, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. So Angela Merkel, her intentions by bringing these people in where to help immigrants, right? Help migrants, helped people that needed help integrate them into society. Obviously Germany has a long history of xenophobia and and the Holocaust, so they were trying to do the right thing. I don't think, you know, I talked to people who think that she maliciously is trying to destroy the country. I, I don't quite think it's that. I think she was trying to do something good here, but then because of I guess the questionable the vetting process or just allowing too many people and these people come in and then the system just can't take it. And then when people in other countries see what's happening in Germany, they don't want it happening there. So this whole thing is just has just snowballed and it is it too late? Have we already left this? That the only will be that far right? Parties are going to win throughout Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:41:38       What, first of all, I agree with you that I don't think there's an eba master plan of, of Angola to destroy Germany or to Europe Union. I don't believe that. I believe for whatever reason she believed that if the right thing to do the problem is. I recently spoke to friends of mine who sits in the German parliament for her party for the video and he said even now we have still not having a discussion about quota, you know, there, there is no end to this, that even the people within her own party don't know where it stops. And that of course gives people like the far right in Germany and we see, you know, the piggy to movement and we see the, what is called the alternative for Germany. These people are really gaining support and really gaining ground and these are of course not the people that we wanted to handle the beat over to.

Speaker 2:          00:42:27       And I know that there are people who tried remain to sti movements like piggy die and say, Oh, you know, they are just concerned citizen to take to the streets and exercise their right to free speech. But you know, I, I'm quite familiar with DNRC seed in Gemini and I looked at footage from Pegida demonstrations and do you see very well known people from the Neo Nazis taking part in these demonstrations? And I'm not a fan of guilty by association. I mean, you cannot always control who comes to your demonstration. Sure. But it was fun. I mean this guy gave an interview to one of, of Germany's a well known political magazines and very openly admitted that the NPD, which is the Neo Nazi party in the country, helped begin to organize this particular demonstration in the east of Germany. So you see already, you know the lines blurring between the populist. Right. And really the, the extreme extreme, right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       Yeah. I'm curious little, let's dig into Paquita a little bit more because I had Tommy Robinson on the show and you know, a lot of people were very angry at me. I got a lot of hate mail for, for even just talking to the guy now. I think in the context of the hour of our conversation, he did basically make the distinction between ideas and people and all of those things. And after the interview, which I thought was pretty fruitful, people did send me tweets that he sent out years before where he was talking about all Muslims and there clearly was an element of bigotry to it. I can't vet my guests tweets from, from five years ago unfortunately. Um, but what, what do you make of someone like him that I think, from what I can tell, he's trying to make the distinction. He and I know he's left organizations when it's gone too far. Right. Or when they were bigoted against black people. Um, I guess that just shows the complexity of this, that these organizations, they have all kinds of people in them.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       Yeah, I mean Tommy Robinson is a, is a very, um, tricky. I don't want to dive too much into this because to be fair, I'm not familiar with every everything that he's doing at the moment. I mean, I, I what I know is because I, uh, we worked with Quilliam as well and I know Martina was, that he was really trying to get him away from the edl and at least making an attempt to engage with him and explained to him the difference between, you know, the religion of Islam, which is a set of leave and Islam as an ideology and Muslims as people and Islam as, as a system of beliefs. And I think to some extent, if you're listening to what he's saying now, he has definitely made some progress, but I don't, I don't want to, uh, I don't want to, um, sort of approve of everything that he says because I still believe that some of the views that he holds a problematic to say the least. And for instances, involvement, movement and the pig Edo movement, that is something that I do not approve off and I do not believe that piggy, that isn't legitimate political. Well, it, it legitimate in the sense that these people have the right to speak their minds, um, but not legitimate in the sense that I would ever support their views.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       Sure. And that's why I wanted to have him on the show because I can't figure out what someone thinks unless I talked to them and maybe he secretly was harboring ideas that he didn't allow me to hear. Um, but I think we got a little closer to the truth maybe by talking to him. I'm curious, you brought up my jacket and my jade is a, has been on the show and we've become friendly. Do you think his job here is the hardest, do you think it's much harder than what I'm doing or what you are doing or what Tommy's doing because he's trying to reform the religion from the inside and I see the most hate and the worst things that people on the left white people on the left in America say about Majid, a brown Muslim man from Egypt. Uh, so he's getting the worst from everybody I think is his job the toughest?

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       Yeah, I mean, I, I don't envy invite by any means. I mean I get a lot of hate mail and all of that, but that is nothing compared to a, to what he goes through. And if you look at some of the things that people say to him, you know, you and I would never get away with things. Some, something similar to, to the Brown men. I mean we would rightly called a racist and a bigot and a and in a summer job. So I write hugely admire what he's trying to do. And obviously there are two types of people that I admire enormously. You have, on the one hand, you have people that are in Hirsi Ali who's left her faith and it's now campaigning really for people to have the right to leave Islam and to criticize the religion and then you have people like Margaret who's obviously had a change of heart, but it's still a Muslim and he wants to reform his faith from inside and you know, these are probably one of the most important people at the moment that we should support and align ourselves with because let's be under no illusion whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          00:47:25       We cannot win this fight without the support and the friendship with people from inside the community. We need Muslim leaders. We need Muslims themselves within within their communities to speak up for a, for a form of Islam that is compatible with the modern world. And we see basically we see, we see similar things happening in Jordan and Egypt were President Sisi and King Abdullah. I now finally, you know, finding the words to address some of these problems and that is hugely important. Whatever else you may be. Think about what President Sisi is doing to journalists and to he human rights activists and I certainly don't approve of that, but I think he plays an important role in fighting Islamic extremism.

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       Yeah. So that again, that goes to the precarious position that people that really care for human rights or put in so cc is doing terrible things for human rights and minorities. And he's basically, he's basically a military leader that took power by a coup after they had the, you know, the actual democratic elections that sort of ended up going the wrong way. Um, but we have to play ball with him because at least Egypt is a stable country. So if you care about human rights, it's like you have to play ball with these strong men. And then at the same time the strong men do terrible things. It almost sounds like a repeat of Saddam Hussein. Not to say he's doing the types of violence to his own people that Saddam was doing. But is that just the best wherever going to get out of this part of the world?

Speaker 2:          00:48:59       Well, you know, it's always a mixture of optimism and realism. Mothers in the Middle East, there are no pretty solution to anything. I mean, even if you look at the curt who I greatly support, there were still problems within cardiac societies that need to be addressed. So you do not find a perfect regime or country in the middle. He is not even Israel. I mean, I'm a huge supporter of Israel. I'm a self declared proud dryness. I loved it. I loved the state of Israel. I think it's a beautiful country and a democratic country, but Israel is not perfect and I disagreed with this on certain things. Now obviously Egypt is a much more extreme example, but I think people have the intellectual capacity. So make a difference and say, I completely disagree with this human rights record, but I do acknowledge that he is trying to, you know, trigger a debate about Islam and the Muslim world that we really, really need and what the, the only option that we didn't really have is to say like, we cooperate with him on that, but we don't stop criticizing him when he arrested journalists or human rights activist or anyone else.

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       Yeah. Um, what, what do you make of the West's fascination or the left's fascination? I should say, not the, it's everyone's fascination. Everyone's fascination with Israel. I mean, this is a piece of land that's the size of New Jersey. It has one international airport. You can drive east and west of it. The border to border in a couple of hours, I think like four hours north and south in like six or eight hours. I mean, it's an absurdly tiny piece of land that gets all the media play a that people are obsessed with. You know, I, I feel similarly to how you just described it. Um, and of course it's not perfect and they're in a very precarious place. It's hard when you have a tiny little border, um, and the Middle East is a mess and sometimes people die, but what are you make it just the fascination and the endless of the United Nations endless assault on the one tiny little democracy there.

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       Yeah, absolutely. Bizarre. And I know I'm going to get 100 hate emails just holding Israel in a democracy and not an apart hype stated engages in the genocide of the Palestinian people, which by the way would be the only genocide ever to take place in history where the victim populations increases. Right,

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       right. So just to begin, can you just really lay that out? I mean the, the population of Gaza since 1967. It's sometimes something like four times bigger or even eight times bigger, I think than it was back then. So this is not, it's the reverse of the genocide. Not to say everything's perfect, but it is certainly not a genotype

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       upside down. Yeah, it's the only Jennifer in history, you were the victim population. Having the alleged victim population has increased, that goes for both Gaza and the West Bank, and if you look at the standard of living and something like health care and life expectancy, this has all improved over the years. No, I'm not saying that the Palestinians are not suffering and that, you know, Israel is always right in the way that it deals with the problem. Not at all. But to say that Israel is engaging in a genocide, I mean, the word genocide is a very, very serious allegation. It is the crime of all crimes that is just absolutely bizarre and frankly, it, it, it relativizes the concept of genocide and it relativizes to cry of people that have actually committed a genocide. And the most bizarre thing about it all is that the people who accuse Israel of engaging in genocide are often or very often aligned with Hamas. We just actually preaching a genocide, the genocide against the Jewish people. That is the irony, the episode today about it. All

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       right. So that's what I've tried to explain to people many times because people will say that somehow on this issue, uh, um, this right, we maniac. I'm for two states where you have to have two actors that are willing to have two states. If Hamas is only willing to have one state, uh, you know, look, Israel left Gaza. There's not one Jew in guys there, right? Hitler would love the place. There's actually a store called Hitler. It's a clothing store, a in Gaza. So it's like, what do you want them to do? That's why it seems that's one of the ones where religion is so tied to it because in my opinion, they just simply, they just don't want Jews there.

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       No, you're absolutely right. I mean if you not just listening what Hamas is saying, but also to what president Abbas's thing. I mean, if the baby. No, Tanya was saying the same things about Arabs and Palestinians that the Palestinian Authority, you're saying about Jews, not just Israeli Jews in general. I mean, the entire word would probably go up in flames. It's completely ridiculous. And what is also completely ridiculous. This visa interdependence theory that people some how believed that if only we were to solve this problem and this tiny strip of land at all the ills of, of, of the Arab Muslim world would disappear and to thin out. I mean how is what we're seeing in theory are related to the problem in Palestine. There is no relation, there is no relation and this unhealthy obsession with Israel is, is just. I can't wrap my head around it because again, I'm not saying that it's rent as perfect and I consider myself a critical friend of Israel that reserves the right to criticize us were always read this wrong. Sure. But if I look around in the region and I see what what's happening in Syria and what the Saudis are doing to women in their own country,

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       why are we, why are we having a part hide weeks at our universities for Israel and never for Saudi Arabia. Why are we having mass demonstrations on European street for the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank? Well, if suffering, of course, but that's nothing compared to what Bashar Al Assad is doing to them in Syria, starving them to death. Actually really engaging in math. A lot of Palestinian. No, you don't hear these people talking about it because it's not really about Israel. I mean these, you know, it's not, it's not really. It's not really about the Palestinians really. These people are really pro Palestinians. What they really are. It's anti Israel.

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       Right? So that's the fascinating part. I mean, there was the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria, which means there should be no refugee camps in any of these Arab countries for Palestinians, but they've kept Palestinians in refugee camps. They don't even let them become citizens aside, killed about 2000 of them within the last two years. Nobody. Nobody seems to care. So it was part of that, that people just don't care about history. So for example, they'll say, well, go back to 1967, but it's not as if there was peace before 1967. And also, uh, I'm pretty sure that the Westbank was part of Jordan and that guy's always part of Egypt. So it's not as if the Palestinians had to state then, so it's like people just don't, the people love narrative over fact and I'm seeing this bleed into almost everything these days.

Speaker 2:          00:56:03       Yes. And it's old, so I mean they call it finer and finer them today, what there are taking, but what they really very often mean is, is Judas, you know, sign and it's just become a clean word, the word to describe Jews. So it actually has a lot to do with antisemitism, which never went away. It took different forms and different ways of describing it, but it really comes down in many cases to the fact that people just don't want you staff.

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       Yeah. Now you realize people are going to say you're a paid Mossad agent and I'm opposed to paid Mossad agent and we're working together on this.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       You know, I'm really angry now that you blew my cover. I was trying so hard.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       You thought you were being slick, but they don't pay me enough to really keep it a secret. That's the thing, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       uh, I get a call after the show, you know, and I have to explain myself.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       All right, well, uh, okay, wait, so we only have a few minutes left. I want to circle back a little bit too to the European problem. I saw that this week in Denmark, uh, that they're looking into stripping citizenship of moms who are preaching hate and preaching things against the state in Denmark. Now I, my whole ethos is about free speech. Uh, everything that I do here is about free speech. So I'm very torn on this one because I would basically say that people can say anything that they want as long as they're not inciting to violence. Now, it seems to me that these moms are probably going as close to the line on that as possible. If they were preaching to take down the state, uh, there's the, at least a inclination or hint that it may be through violent means, uh, where, where do you fall on that? Because I know you're huge on free speech and secular values also.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       I am. But, uh, I'm, I'm of course also have to believe that about all we have to have. God, I'm the lives of innocent people living in our country and we just had a case in the UK this week that the mom of the largest mosque in in Scotland praised the assassination of the anti blast for me activists in Pakistan a couple of years ago. And then just hours later, a shopkeeper who posted a, a message on facebook congratulating Christians for Isa was brutally, brutally murdered,

Speaker 1:          00:58:29       like a Muslim

Speaker 2:          00:58:30       by a Muslim because he is, he belongs to, to, to the Ahmadiyya Muslims, which is a, a, a largely peaceful and progressive movement within the Islamic community. And within the Muslim world, these people are often called heretics and a state. And you don't have to be surprised that if the mom or the largest mosque in Scotland believes that it's perfectly legitimate to murder people for last, for me, what he actually meets with free speech. But what these people call blast for me. That we then see people actually being murdered on our street in the name of their religion. And I know people would say no again, no, he was not a Muslim, but he was not in. It has nothing to do with Islam, what it has something to do with Islam because what these emom is preaching is based on Islamic teaching and there is no way around it. I mean we can deny the problem and many people still prefer to do that, but it is a part of Islam and we need to talk about it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       Right? So now I know you've made this distinction several times even in the course of this interview, but that there's a political component to this. So it's not just that the Islamists have to blow up things and then maybe force our governments to take away our own freedoms to protect us, but that there's a political ideology that they'll use the rights that the West grants them to preach these things, to turn their own populace against us. When you start going down that route, it all starts sounding like a big conspiracy or something that there really is this massive invasion and I don't want to start using the fearmongering techniques that the right uses. But that that's real, right, that there's a political element that goes beyond violence here,

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       I'm third years ago, that Muslims don't need to, you know, infiltrated western countries. They just do this by, by immigrating to these countries and then getting a lot of children because that. That brings me back to what I said before. We're not just fighting the jihadis, those who commit violence. We also have to deal with the Islamist who wants to impose that way of life on our societies, but also with a conservative Muslims who are maybe not Islam is and maybe not jihadists, but who at least to a certain degree with some of the things that these people are saying. Because if you look at opinion polls, and I know this brings me dangerously close to what happened to to Sam Harris on that show with Ben Affleck looking at opinion polls. I mean legitimate opinion polls, not some fringe, crazy conspiracy fearmongering opinion polls. If you look at what people in the Muslim world think about apostates converting from the religion, leaving the religion, it's shocking. It is shocking the percentage of people who believe it is legitimate to use violence against people just leaving the religion or converting to another religion is to me absolutely shocking.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       Do you think the West is fundamentally doing something wrong here that somehow, and I can even feel it when I'm talking to you knowing that we'd go out of our way to make this distinction over and over, that we still feel we have to guard our words somehow in all this and again, as we've talked about, that sort of gives the strength to the to the right, but that the west is doing something wrong in that we're not selling. Why freedom is good anymore. There was a time where it was like it was cool to really stand up for Western values, stand up for free speech and religious plurality and rights of minorities and all of those things and for all the faults of the West and for, for wars that we probably shouldn't have got into. Although they were, as I said at the top of the show, there were a thousand year old blood flute feuds going on in the Middle East, far boat before America was a country. Um, but that nobody really stands up. There aren't public figures anymore that stand up and say, you know what, what we're doing here in the UK is still good. We still have more integration here than they do in most other places. Certainly in the United States where people still want to come. Do you think we're just, we're just not doing a good sell job anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:02:51       I think you raised two interesting points here. One is that yes, indeed. Every time, like if such an interview I think about what am I going to say because I know it will be people out there watching are just waiting for me to slip. Not even intentionally, just a snip and say something they can twist and turn and make me sound like a racist and a bigot and you know that there are people like John and Glenn Greenwald who do this on purpose and have their own malicious agenda and they know quite well they are misrepresenting what we're saying, but they're saying it anyway because they are too afraid to debate us with ideas so all they can resort to is, you know, smearing us and trying to silence that. That is one point. And the second point that you raised about not selling ourselves anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       Absolutely. And you guys in America are doing more of a better job at this than we do in Europe because you're still what? Yeah, I mean if you look at it from a European perspective now I left in Washington dc for Harvey. Yeah. And I was really surprised how proud the Americans really are about America. I mean if you come from from Europe, it's still, you still feel proud about America at least compared to two years. And we have to be part from this perpetual sense of guilt, you know? And and culture of self destruction and self blaming that we have somewhat to blame for all the ills of the Middle East. So I'm not saying the colonial period is period was pretty, you know, we didn't do terrible things to people but this is not the reason why people blow themselves up in Nigeria or Indonesia.

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       This comes down to the Islam, Ms.audio that g and these people can ignite at as much as they like and they pretend it all comes down to us. And again, it's what George W dot Bush called the soft bigotry of low expectations because somewhat, you know, these brown people can not be responsible for their own faded must always come down to us. It must always have something to do with us. They can say that as long as they like, it doesn't change the fact it's not true. And as you can explain, the global and I, I believe magic now was called the global Islamist insurgency. You can only explain that and its roots with the ideology of Islam, Islam and not with Western foreign policy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:15       Yeah. You know, it's so funny. So many of my guests have mentioned the phrase, the soft bigotry of low expectations and many times on the show I kept quoting, I thought it was bill Maher that had coined the phrase. So I felt good about it. Then I learned it was a George W dot Bush. It was one of his speech writers. I've been saying it less, but maybe that's the phrase that George W dot Bush gave us that, uh, that we don't have to be upset about.

Speaker 2:          01:05:38       No. And uh, I mean, it's quite funny, you know, I talked about Iraq, the, and you know, they will actually, people who would have been happy at the top of George w Bush and toppled Saddam Hussein. And that really brings us back to the absurdity of the left and in everything that we talked about today, for all his faults and by no means George W Bush was not perfect, but he was also not a sudden the same.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Yeah. All right, so final thoughts to wrap all this up. If you had a crystal ball and you were looking five or 10 years into the future of where Europe is going to be a, the state of Jihad in Islam, Islam and all that, or are you hopeful? It doesn't feel very hopeful right now. The only grain that I can get this hopeful is that these conversations are happening and at least that the free thinkers aren't feeling as held hostage, uh, between jihadists and leftists. So I think that's the hope for me, but I don't know how big, how really hopeful I can

Speaker 3:          01:06:37       hang my hat on that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:39       What I'm. I am by nature an optimist. I couldn't do the job if I were not an optimist. And I do think there is reason for hope because if I look at the emails that I received, a tweet that I received, the private messages that I received, the feedback that I received, when I talk to people, people are waking up in our own countries. I mean, I have many people come to me and say like, Oh, you actually saying what I would like to say, but either they're, you know, they're too afraid to say it because they'll be called a racist or they don't have the rhetoric to really bring across their views were just why shows like yours are so important. But also people in the Muslim world. I mean the Muslim women that we work with really no longer want to live on the oppression, who don't want to be treated as second class citizens who have the right to education and to opportunity in life.

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       The free thinkers, the poets, the gentleness, the activist, minorities like homosexual converts, atheist. These are the most important people in the Muslim world at the moment. And who deserves all the respect and support that we can give them. And I think if we can forge a genuine alliance between those in the Muslim world, want to see change and want to make Islam compatible with the modern world and us who are not afraid to speak. How to probe about the problems of the religion and about the ideology. Because you know, the irony is that by denying all of this, you were actually aiding the extremists because you're taking away, you're taking away the justification for those who want to bring about change, why they want to bring about change. If you don't name the problem, if you take away the problem, what are these people going to do? So that's something we need to realize.

Speaker 1:          01:08:25       Yeah. At the top of the show I said, you know, as you've said that a religion is just a set of ideas and if there was a political ideology or political party, let's say that it was an offshoot of the Republicans here in the United States, and it said, we're going to throw gays off roofs and we're going to put women in Burkas and we're going to oppress minorities. Well then the progressive's would be going bonkers and they'd be, they'd be calling them the racist instead. Uh, well I think you know, where I'm going with this. Well Julie, it was really a pleasure talking to you
