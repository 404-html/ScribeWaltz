Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Again, I want to thank you all for and Browny. You're doing a heck of a job. FEMA directors working twenty four.

Speaker 2:          00:00:16       Joining me today is the former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, better known as fema, as well as the host of the Michael Brown radio show. Michael Brown. Welcome to the Rubin report. Hey Dave. Good to see you. Good to be with the. You know, this is the first time we've ever done this where we played a ten second clip. Let me get. Do you have any idea where I can. I can't even imagine what you might be talking about. Yes. I struggled with it for a little while because I thought, do I want to go right in and throw this right at him? Sort of the infamous moment or do we want to ease into it, but then I thought, let's just. Let's just get it out there because it is what it is. It's a seminal moment in my life. It the. There's, there's before that moment. Then after that moment.

Speaker 2:          00:01:01       Yeah. Alright. There are many, many reasons that I'm glad to be sitting here with you because I think we're going to get into so many of the things that we talked about on the show all the time about the role of government and the difference between local government and federal government, all of these agencies and red tape and all that, but also that for that moment and what happened for the months and probably years after that and actually even I when I was googling you this morning, all the 10 year anniversary people that were still pissed at you and all that stuff. It has a lot to do with your sort of the general outrage culture and blame culture and all of that. So we're going to do a lot here. So first let's just start with that moment though and then and then I want to do everything else back.

Speaker 2:          00:01:40       Sure. Okay. Just tell me a little bit about the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina. It became clear to me probably within. Well, it came clear to me the day after the storm made landfall because I was on a Black Hawk helicopter with former senator Mary Landrieu, and we were supposed to be going straight to the superdome to meet with Mayor Nagin, who I always like to joke is remind people he's still in federal prison and in I'm sitting there and I'm not. I'm just kind of reading my notes from my staff and I look out the helicopter and I realized that we're going the wrong direction across lake pontchartrain and I asked the pilot, where were you going? And he said, well, the senator has asked that we go check her cabin before we go to the superdome. I was livid, so now I have a sitting United States senator next to me who's just overridden what I said we need to be doing and what the priorities are.

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       I have the governor sitting next to her who doesn't have the wherewithal to say to the senator, you know what? Your cabin is not our priority. The priority is the people of New Orleans. It was a moment that I realized that I had walked into a state that was so much more corrupt. I've been involved in politics and so I was literally six years old that was just so corrupt and it was so dysfunctional that I knew that everything that I had in my head about how things should operate, we're going to start going out the window. Okay. I think that's actually a perfect story to now start with your childhood. Let's just, let's just get a little bias because I think that's really interesting and what led you to eventually be the director of Fema and then we'll go through everything else. So just tell me a little bit about growing up.

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       Was Your family political? What sort of got you into this world like? Yeah. My family was kind of political. When I think about it. I mean my mom is 86, 87 years old and she still works for the election board. She still does the little local elections in the little town that I grew up in. I think you'd have to be over 80 to work at the electrical. Exactly. I think it is a requirement, she's been doing this since she was in high school, but when the first Republican governor of Oklahoma was running, he was state party chairman, a guy by the name of Henry Belding, uh, was coming out to the Oklahoma panhandle and they recruited me at six years old to be the little kid to him the push cards out as he walked these rural streets of Oklahoma. So I just grew up in this political family that was always involved and of course, you know, involved in student council and, you know, in college and Young Republicans know all of that.

Speaker 2:          00:04:11       And so politics has just always been a part of my life and I always thought I understood politics until I got to Washington DC until Hurricane Katrina. And it just gave me an entirely different perspective. But anyway, long story short, you know, I took the typical route, uh, graduated from high school to my, my, my wife is my childhood sweetheart. Her Dad actually delivered me. Wow. That's the kind of small town we grew up in. Wow. Uh, we've been married for, Gosh, 40 some years. I don't want to say how many, um, uh, and, you know, went to law school, raised two children, very successful, very, very successful children, and just had a pretty normal life except that I knew I wanted to be a lawyer, but I always had this thought process that you never turned down an aisle, you always looking at an opportunity and if an opportunity looks good, you take that opportunity even if it's off the path you thought you were going to take.

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       And so that's led me to these incredible, incredible experiences in my life that most people don't do because they become lawyers and all they do is practice law their entire life. That's not me. So what was the first one of those moments when you thought, wow, there's a good opportunity? A little little to the right off that exit. I'm the alum Republican Party, came to me and asked me to run for Congress back in 1988, promised me all of this money that they were going to. In fact, that governor, who was the first Republican governor, went on to be a US senator and then came back. He was a big supporter of me, but I was running can rebuild them, former US senator. He was involved in the Panama Canal treaties and everything, but, um, the Oakland Republican Party recruited me and said, come on, we really want you to run, and so I let ego get in the way.

Speaker 2:          00:05:55       And I ran against a 12 term Democrat, incumbent in a gerrymandered district where I got my butt beat, but it was, um, it was an experience that again, most Americans never do. Most Americans never throw their hat in the ring and actually go out and say, I'm going to do it. And I would encourage people, whether it's a city council, county commissioner, state representative, whatever it is, if you don't like the way things are going, if you're going to bitch about it, I don't want to hear about it unless you're actually involved doing something. Doesn't mean you have to run for office, but you gotta be involved.

Speaker 3:          00:06:31       Yeah. It's so funny after the ringer that you've been through, I guess it's that maybe it's not funny. It's either ironic or perfectly politik that that's still is your message as someone that you know, we sort of put up as as the poster boy for everything that's wrong with Dave. Let me tell you, it may be poetic, but it. Sorry, I should quit pointing to the lawyer. Yeah, it is.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       I can tell you so many stories about how dysfunctional state I've been involved. I was a city councilman, A. I've worked with state legislature as the finance director. Then you go on A. I'm the Under Secretary of Homeland Security. I have seen, I have been inside the bowels of the government and I can tell you how it works and it is not what most American

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       instinct and we're going to get to all of that. So the Under Secretary of Homeland Security, that is the director of Fema, right. That's the. That's just sort of the more technical term for that. Were you involved in the administration before nine slash 11 or was it after that? That's when Bush know Peggy for those.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       I was there. Yeah, and in fact I was in Montana getting ready to deliver a speech to the national emergency managers association about the role of Fema and terrorism on nine slash 11, 2011. So you were the director of him at that time? I was, I was the general counsel at that time and we ended up on a c 1:35 going back to Andrews Air Force Base. Uh, Joe Wall Ball, who was the director at the time? Uh, immediate went, went to ground zero on that Wednesday morning and I went to the White House and just spend the next, gosh, seems like year, just day in and day out. Just planning, getting ready for we didn't know what.

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       Yeah. What's the one thing that really sticks out in your mind about that day itself?

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       For the first time you are flying alone. There are no planes in the sky. You're flying alone. Some airman asked me if I went to go down in the tanker bay and and just watch as we fly across Middle America and I'm listening on the, on the headset and the chatter you hear are among the fighter jets that are flying around the country and when I landed it was not knowing. It was like there was this blank wall in front of us. None of us knew what was going to happen next and so we meet in the Roosevelt Room in the situation room that next morning to get briefing by the CIA and everybody else and I remember just this, this quietness in the room that everybody knew that none of us knew what we were facing. Yeah. Was there a feeling that George W dot Bush was the right guy to handle this because for all the frustrations that people may have with him and that perhaps you have related to some degree with Katrina and we can get into that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       Right. I do remember at the time, and I lived in New York City at the time, so I was there for nine slash 11. Right. Family was there. My grandma was there, my, my dad, um, I do remember that between George w Bush at the time, but particularly Giuliani, I think there was at least a feeling that these guys are sort of the right people to be handling this at the time. Certainly Giuliani, at least from a New Yorker's perspective. Did you, did you feel that, did people feel that within the government that, like, that Bush was kind of able to handle this or have the right skillset to handle this? Yes, it was for me it was more than most. Um, I mean, I can still remember vividly that in the Roosevelt Room you've got Colin Powell, you got Donald Rumsfeld, Condi Rice shouldn't have andy card, so you have all these heavy hitters.

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       And then here's little old me sitting at the table too. And I remember watching because I just, I'm an, I'm an observer of people and I remember watching all of them and there was none of the usual because I had been in these meetings before and there was none of the usual, hey, how you do? And everybody was at the table. Everybody was reading their briefing, everybody was trying to understand. We know that we always referred to the president as the boss. We know the boss is going to ask some tough questions and we know we're not going to have answers and that's indeed what happened. Know we had theories, we have ideas, we have plans, but nobody really knew for certain what was next. Yeah. And especially in those first few days where we didn't know if another attack was coming or anything like what was actually the job of Fema for those first few days.

Speaker 2:          00:10:45       We are, um, we're the nation's federal first responder. We coordinate all of, for example, if the Pentagon ground zero, our job was to make sure that we have all the urban search and rescue teams deployed, that we take care of the firefighters, we provide all the equipment, we provide the training, we do all of that stuff. So our job was to clean up ground zero. Our job was at the Pentagon to help clean that up. And what was fascinating about it was normally you go to a disaster. It's not also a crime scene, but in this case, both the Pentagon and in and in and in Pennsylvania and obviously in ground zero, they were also crime scenes, so we now had to coordinate talking about federalism. So now we had to coordinate, you know, the federal government, state government, local government, and on top of that we had to coordinate with the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and everybody else who's doing all of the forensic work.

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       How does that go? I mean, one of the things we talk about here a lot is sort of the unwieldy giant government we have right now, sort of all the middlemen and bureaucrats. They get in the way of everything. I mean, how did it really go up? That's your job. Here's what's fascinating. When the governments under pressure like that, everybody does what you have to meet. My mother in law had to say that drove my drives, my wife crazy shoot, she's now deceased, but it was, you know, sometimes you just have to do what you have to do and when, when a crisis hits of that magnitude, it's all hands on deck and if you need to break the rules, people are willing to break the rules to make things happen. So I would say that in, in, in those intense moments, that's probably when the government tends to do the best job because everybody's trying their hardest to do what's best for the country.

Speaker 2:          00:12:26       Yeah. So how soon after that did a debbie tap you to be the head of FEMA? Uh, let's see. So, uh, shortly after I became the deputy director, I would say like just a couple of months later, I went from general counsel to deputy director of when they announced the creation of the department will story about the creation of dhs. So they're going to create the DHS. So w points me to the transition team, we're one of five people putting together the department. And I apologized to the nation for that because I've got lots of regrets about dhs. I'm happy to talk. We will. Um, and then soon thereafter all ball left and that's when I became the under secretary and the director of Fema. So probably within, Gosh, a year. Yeah. Oh. And then just, it's the mailman story. You know, you start in the mail room and you work your way up.

Speaker 2:          00:13:16       Yeah. And on the two years after that, then the other crisis, certainly. So tell me a little bit about your regrets creating the Department of Homeland Security. Here's a backstory first that most people don't know. The administration was opposed to the creation of the department. We thought it was a mistake, huge mistake. We're going to create this massive bureaucracy, why things are working the way they're supposed to work. But Congress felt this political desire that you have to be seen doing something. So once congress said, hey, we're going to move forward with legislation than the White House says, oh my God, now we've got to get in front of this because we want to control it and mold it in our own view, not congress's view, because in effect they don't want to get legislation put on his desk that he lido and then it's like he's against almost. Exactly. So.

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       So our job was an example of how screwed so, so I'm thrown me and four other guys with Clay Johnson, the president's best friend, college roommate, a deputy director of omb were thrown together to create this massive new bureaucracy by taking 22 different cultures, 22 different cultures, 22 different organizations and throwing them in together and trying to make it work. What are a couple of those organizations that were thrown in there? I mean, it's everybody, right? Well, it was secret secret service. What the hell, Secret Service and homeland security. Uh, the, the coast guard, the coast guard has this kind of schizophrenia role. They've worked for homeland security, yet they're subjected to the military code of conduct and they kind of technical work for pimp for the Pentagon, so we've got all of the. You've got that, you have ice customs and border patrol immigration, a different grants from the Department of Justice Fema.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       Everybody had a different culture and my objection was you can't throw different cultures together and really expect them to work either in the short term and the longterm. Every organization, corporate, private, governmental has a culture and trying to meld those is the one of the most difficult things to do. Look, I love Carly Fiorina. Consider her a friend, but they brought in to talk to us about how to do mergers and acquisitions and I'm thinking, wait a minute, the HP and merger and acquisition, that didn't seem to go too well and you're going to tell us how to do this 22 government agency thing. I mean, that's one objection. The second objection was, you know, we got to airports with a major concern and for whatever reason we wanted to blame the private contractors who have a vested interest in making sure that the airlines are secure, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       But that's not good enough. Instead, let's fire all of them and let's create this massive new bureaucracy called the Tsa. And I'm, I'm like the kid in the back of the classroom that keeps raising his hand and say, but professor y w, how's that gonna work? Um, but there was just this way. What would happen when he said something like that? Because now I think in 2018, if you say something about the Tsa, most people that agree with you, that really ridiculous, the reaction was always, well, we're going to meet your objection by doing y. and I had been around the block long enough to know that that answer was bs. But when you're the one person out of five, you're out voted. So you, you, you tend to. There's a great Washington Post story that talks about brown as the bureaucratic infighter. And I was in the post, writes it as if that's a bad thing and I considered a badge of honor because I was fighting for just the reality that when you tell me that putting these, deploy these different agencies together, there's going to be budget neutral.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       That's BS. When you tell me you're going to create Tsa, but you're going to prevent them from ever being a union. That's bs because I just know how government metastasizes. And so the TSA has turned out to be what I thought it was the dysfunction within dhs. While it may be minimally better, it's still a dysfunctional organization. So let's back up for a second, because you mentioned that before this, the security. Was it all done by private companies before the TSA? That's almost hard to believe. Or was it all done by private? Yes. The, uh, the airlines who have, who has the most now you think about just trying to figure out what's the best way to put a program together. Well, who has the most interest in making certain that they're planes are never hijacked or flown into buildings. Oh, the airlines. Why don't we let them decide security, because what do they have?

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       Competing interests. They want to make sure that their planes are secure, their passengers are safe, but that the security operates in the most efficient and effective way. Now you tell me government's going to care about those three things be as well. It's also interesting because it's like what a great lady used competition in the right sense where it's like this airline that's doing it the right way where they could go, you know what? Look at our marks on security, so we're charging you $5 more than a lot of people wouldn't have a problem with it. It would. It would be a beautiful thing. I didn't realize that it was fully private before that. Yes. Wow. So any other. I mean that's a pretty big issue, but any other big regrets related to. Well, for example, we have within fema what was called the catastrophic disaster response group.

Speaker 2:          00:18:31       Everything is an acronym, so it was, it was the Crg and because the FEMA director under under federal law, when in times of disaster reports directly to the president, you're the of representative, so this cdr, gee, when there was a disaster, like nine slash 11, we brought all of the cabinet departments and agencies together, so usually had the deputy secretaries there because they were there on behalf of their bosses and we would deconflict policy. We would set priorities and if State Department wanted to do one thing, but dod you wanted to do another and ag wanted to do something else. That was where we got all of those deconflicted because the FEMA director had the authority of the president sitting in that room. Well, that's gone away now and you've thrown these all together and I've always said if you want to find out whether a disaster is being handled properly or not, or any sort of crisis, this could be in the private sector to ask this question, who's in charge?

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       If you can't answer the question, who's in charge, then it's a cluster. Is there an inherent sort of. There's a conflict here which is that basically you're taking government people and for someone like you that maybe wanted less government, and I think this is what you're really saying about Bush at the beginning of this. I didn't want this, the administration, he didn't write it, but government, and this is the problem with Libertarians in general, like people that want less government. Well, if you're in the government, it's hard to look around the office and be like, guys, you know, most of us probably shouldn't even be here. You know, we're, we're going to need new jobs guys. So in Fema first started in 1979 under Jimmy Carter, they had a policy of providing ice to hospitals so that lactating mothers had a place where they could keep milk, where you could keep insulin and other medicines that require pharmaceuticals or require refrigeration.

Speaker 2:          00:20:22       That ice was for hospitals to provide their local communities a place for the medicines to say stay cool and safe and everything else that has metastasized, which is my favorite word of government. It has metastasized now to where in a disaster we, we provide every Tom, Dick and Harry two bags of ice so that they can keep their hamburger cold or there or the coors beer cold. And I went to Congress and said, this is out control. We're spending tens of millions of dollars on ice so that a private citizen can keep their food cold. Is that really a government function? Even talking to conservatives on the hill, let alone Democrats or liberals or anybody else. I was a heretic because we can't support that because that's taking something away from our constituents. Would you reckon that you realize it's a waste? Right? Why should we be doing that?

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       Well, we can't stop it now. Yeah, it's fascinating. And then you just get all these sort of middle management, Kratz men. No, nobody's going to give up that. Right. So, uh, was there anything else major between, for you professionally between nine slash 11 and Katrina, like what were, what were you doing before that was instilled chess related and we had the Columbia space shuttle disaster, which we had to coordinate with NASA because NASA was in shock. So we had to help them do all the search and rescue from California to Texas. We had a huge wildfires in California that were just massive. Luckily they've recently experienced, we had fires throughout the west, flooding in the Midwest. We had the tsunami in Southeast Asia. I mean I could go on and on and on. Yes. My life was just full of hell from nine slash 11 on.

Speaker 2:          00:22:02       So until that, until the Katrina moment. Yes. What was the general feeling about you? Because then now we'll get into this where you were then used as. Well, I was competent, knew what I was doing. The White House always turned to me to, to get things done. Uh, it. Yeah. Okay. So I'll, I'll take, I'll take it, I'll take your word for it. But by and large you were thought of as a competent executive. And everything was okay, so now, now feeding habits. I love the story that you told right at the beginning because what a, what a perfect story of like just awful abusive power. Go check out my home instead of, you know, the, the disaster areas and all that kind of stuff. Uh, how does it, how does it, there was a certain amount of time we knew that this thing was going to be a crazy, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       I mean, how long before it happened? It was going to be crazy because we had, I had gone to Congress and ask for an appropriation. I actually wanted to spend some tax money to plan for 10 truly catastrophic disasters. Something like a hurricane. You, your former New Yorker. Can you imagine a category five going up the Hudson river? Can you imagine something happening to the LNG natural gas, a port in Boston, a terrorist incident there. Imagine the big one hitting California or the new magid fault. Imagine because New Orleans a Fishbowl, a category five filling up New Orleans. So Congress had given me money to start doing catastrophic planning for these kinds of things. New Orleans was the first one we picked and when we did a tabletop exercise to see if we could coordinate the response, the table top exercise fell apart, Dave, so I knew probably nine, 12 months before Katrina actually occurred that we weren't ready.

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       So what does that actually mean when you're doing a table top exercise that that's just coordinating all the, all the players in the room and you pretend like you're going through a disaster. So what? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are the conflicts? How do we deconflict all of these policy issues? Do we have enough food? How do we get dod to dod? Have enough equipment on hand, Gideon food supplies and everything else. You exercise that around the table and Louisiana fell apart. Yeah. Wouldn't work. Was it right at the beginning of it that you realized how severe it was? I've been criticized because in May of 2005, I had my wife. This is before. Before busy for Katrina? Yeah. It may of 2005. Several Friends of mine, including Colin Powell, had said, you know what? It's probably time to leave and I, I asked them, seriously, why is it, well, you've done everything that you can do in terms of trying to mold dhs into what you think it should be and nothing else is going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       It is what it is that you have. You have fought the good fight. Uh, you've been here six years, you know, and of course my wife was, we, it's time to go back to Colorado to go back to Colorado. And so I told Andy Card, the White House chief of staff in malleable five that I wanted to resign and go back to Colorado. And what typically happens, Andy said, can you wait till Labor Day and go through one more hurricane season for us and that will give us time to find a replacement. Now when the president asks you to stay for five more months, sure, I can do that, man. Labor Day. What? What was the day that Katrina hit? It was August 29th. August 29 Labor Day, whatever it is, eight days later. Um, okay. So, so it hits. I mean, I can remember watching everything on CNN at the time.

Speaker 2:          00:25:40       Uh, you mentioned Nagan. Who is the mayor? Uh, mayor of New Orleans. Lauren's. How chaotic was it to coordinate? You've already, after you said this, this initial test had failed about. It was for. It was a, it was virtually impossible. So I landed the superdome. The superdome. Well, let's, let's go back a step before I actually went to New Orleans before the storm made landfall, Max Mayfield, who was the director of the National Hurricane Center fellow Okie. He and I go on the phone together and we knew how bad the storm is going to be, but we could not get the attention of state officials and frankly we couldn't get the attention of the dod and State Department, other people that would be playing a role. How is that possible? You now had this new dhs that was supposed to be cool because who's in charge? I remember who's in charge. Well, everybody's now competing for their pecking order because of dhs.

Speaker 2:          00:26:37       So I tell Max Mayfield, would you please explain this? I'm going to have bushes and Crawford. He'll be on civic call, this top secret phone conference, video and everything, and I'll have the mayor, the governor of all the Gulf states, their job will be there for Florida a and I need you to read them the riot act about how bad this is going to be, and he did, and then I pulled out an engineering report that said the New Orleans superdome cannot even withstand a category three based upon engineering reports, and the mayor just announced that he's going to use the superdome is a shelter of last resort. I'm screaming on this call and you can't do that. That's a huge mistake. Blah, blah, blah. At this point, what? What category did they think it was gonna be? We thought it was gonna be a fight when it actually hit.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       It was a three, but as we all know is still ripped off the roof of the. Of the superdome? No. So I knew going in, it was gonna be bad. I say all that to lead to this one point, the day that I'm leaving to fly to to baton rouge. I remember exactly where I was. I was on one 95 going around the, uh, the Pentagon and I called Joe Hagan, the deputy chief of staff to telling that I'm headed to Andrews. I'm going down, we're doing everything we can and I said, Joe, but this is going to be a cluster because I can't get stuff coordinated now. And the storm hasn't even hit. And because I had already told them I wanted to leave. I said in an email to the and hey, can I quit now? And of course everybody picks it up. Oh look, Brown doesn't care.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       He's, he wants to quit before the storm even hit. That's fascinating. I mean, I remember that. Sure. I remember that. Yeah. And um, I mean, you were just being sarcastic. I'm a sarcastic guy. Yeah. I'm a total smart ass. And so I had already agreed to stay through Labor Day. I knew I was walking into a buzzsaw and I'm telling Hagen, Hey, can I quit now? And of course, the New York Times, you know, for years, all of my emails, they see the jokes that I crack because let me tell you something, not to get off the subject here go, but when, when people are suffering and people that are the rescue workers, the firefighters that are taking people off roofs that are taking them out of flooded homes, they're working their asses off, they're tired, they're worn out, they're stressed out. You know what the best thing to do is give them a little humor.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       Yeah, show them. Show a little humanity. It's my father in law was a smoke, told you, delivered me, and he was a surgeon. He used to talk about how he would relieve stress in the our by cracking jokes and I've always thought that the best way to manage people in a time of stress is to remind them of their humanity. Make them laugh, and if they can laugh for five seconds, that gets the endorphins running and they can go out and keep working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And I was criticized for joking. Well, you know about school because I've been asked before. Well, would you take any of those emails back? Not on one of them, because you know what, that made a staffer smile that made somebody laugh and if you don't understand the context within which it was made, then you are deliberately just trying to make hay out of something.

Speaker 3:          00:29:51       All right, so let's get back to that 10 seconds of video. Know the exact line. Even though everyone says it's a heck of a job, they don't even get that right. He actually said, Brownie, you're doing a heck of A. Yeah, I just want to clean that up for him because even that line, they don't get it. Right, right. Okay. How many days into the hurricane was that?

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       Oh Gosh. I want to say it was maybe four, maybe five days. I've kind of, I conflate time, but four or five years.

Speaker 3:          00:30:15       Okay, so four or five days. You know what? Now I watched plenty of other video today of what you were doing at the time and you're standing there. People can see this on youtube. You're standing there with giant maps of the whole area. He was very clear to me at least watching it now that you had total command of where things were and who was supposed to be, where, where water was going to hit harder. And you know, Bush, you know, to his credit, he, it seemed that he was listening along with us and you know, doing the best job I think that he could, uh, after. Was it a, was it three minutes after he says that, that you realized there that the media went crazy with it?

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       No, it was the minute he was, the minute he said it because here's what you don't know what you, what most people don't know is that I had told the I called Air Force One and said when he lands and gets here, I need five minutes before we do any sort of public photo op. And when you, even at my level to the under secretary, even when you say I gotTa have five minutes with the president, they still want to know why. And I said, because he's got to understand before he walks in front of cameras, how bad things are in New Orleans because we're gonna leave that Air National Guard base, get on marine one and we're going to fly to New Orleans and he's going to start seeing how screwed up it is in New Orleans and I want to make sure he understands that before he gets there. So sure. We got plenty of time.

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       So we walk into the green room. I'm just starting to talk to the president and they come in and say we gotta get moving presses out here. We're already running late and they pull him out and I don't have time to brief him or how bad it is. So the moment. And here's what really happened. Bob Riley, who was the governor of Alabama, former congressman, good friend of mine, we were doing great male, a Bama thing for perfect and Alabama perfect. Things were very good in Mississippi. It was just Louisiana. So Bob Riley being the supportive guy that he is said, oh, by the way, Mr President, I just want you to know that the team is doing a great job in Alabama. And that's when the president said, boom, slap me in the gut. And it was that moment, Dave, that I knew. Oh my God, now three things have happened. The press knows that I've got a relationship with the president that I have a nickname. So I'm one of the few people in the inner circle that has a nickname, uh, to the press, knows how bad things are in New Orleans. And now both me and the boss looked like we're totally out of touch about what's happening down in the Gulf.

Speaker 3:          00:32:49       God, I mean, there's so much there when you really realize how this was happening, I was,

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       if you watch that closely, you'll see me grimace because I was just like, holy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:33:03       So okay. So once that happened, how much of what your job became was just dealing with media craziness,

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       total, total. Not just the media, but now with a secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, who have never done any sort of operations in his life. He was an appellate court judge and appellate court judge has clerks that bring your briefs and say, here's what we think your decisions should be. You sit behind the desk, you take your time. You don't realize that if you put off a decision for 30 minutes in the middle of a disaster, that translates to three hours and that costs lives. So now I'm dealing with a Boston DC that doesn't have a clue what he's doing, who's mad at me because I'm on a Gulf stream trying to get from mobile to Gulf port to Baton Rouge, to New Orleans and trying to keep my fingers on everything going on. Who tells me, I'm tired of you flying around because I can't find you and I'm thinking, you can't find me. I'm on a government. Gulf stream has got satellite. You can find me anywhere in the world if you want to. So tells me to plant my button in baton rouge. And I turned to my staff and say, this is the beginning of the end thereafter. Me, the media is after me, Chertoff's after me. They're looking for a scapegoat. I'm not that stupid. I mean I know what's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       Yeah. Are. Are there any points of criticism during that time that you think are.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       Yes, yes, yes. I have a friend who is a psychiatrist at the Kennedy School of government and the school public health. And I asked him one time, I said there was a point during Katrina where you haven't known me but a few minutes now, but I think you can tell I'm a pretty type a person person. Pretty energetic. I'm pretty engaged in whatever I do. I'm passionate about what I do. And I asked my buddy, I said, so I know that there was a point where I was just frozen. I literally could not make a decision what? What happens? He drew me a cartoon and it's a car, you know, the great wizard of Oz. Well, it's a picture of me in the first panel pushing all these buttons and levers and turning wheels and stuff. And in the second panel, I'm staring at that same group of buttons like what's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:35:24       And in the third panel I've gone around look behind and over wires have been cut. And he says that physiologically, whether it's, it's a, it's ptsd, it's a phenomena in the brain that when we are trained, like if I, if I have trained myself, that when I tell my staff, do x, I expect x to happen. When you and I turned on these lights or flip a switch, we expect the lights to come on. Now you add all the physical stress, the emotional stress and nothing is working. The brain starts to shut down and I will freely admit. And this is why I, I to this day, I saw a firefighter the other day on the street was having lunch. And I walked up to him and I said, what are you doing? We've been doing training and, and uh, I'm taking the guys out for lunch.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       And I said, well, you don't know who I am, but let me just tell you that, uh, you know, making sure those guys have time off and that they get rest. That's the most important thing you can do because if they don't get rest when they're fighting the fires, they themselves can become victims of that disaster. So we've got to learn to train ourselves that when we're under that kind of stress, you have to be able to step back. And this is what I speak about resilience. I've learned to try to teach audiences that we all have a network and what we have to do is learn that when we find ourselves in those moments that were either not making the right decisions or we're not making decisions, we need some external force to come in and kind of slapped some sense into us and say, change your perspective.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       What I see is this. If somebody has helped me do that during Katrina, might've still had the presidential bus run me over, but at least I would have known why and what was happening. But is that almost counter to the way a sort of big government has to operate you course it is. You can't assume people are running around smacking people and trying to get him to wake up because the machine is so stiff, but what? I needed a and you could. My very best friend and my lawyer, Andy Lester, who went through all the congressional hearings with me to this day, he'll tell you that he regrets not getting in his car and driving to baton rouge because he's watching this from a distance and he's seeing what's happening and he knows me well enough that he. He could tell that I'm just frozen like nothing's working, what do I do next?

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       And I just needed that external force to come in and say, you're right, nothing's working. Here's why. Let's take inventory. Have you slept? No, I haven't slept for three days. Maybe you ought to go try to take an ambien. At least get four hours of sleep. It's that kind of stuff that makes a huge event at that point. Also with what was happening because of the media. You were sorta just in a feeding frenzy. It was like a self fulfilling self fulfilling, right? You know, to this day I, I'm always amazed. I mean I could, I could go through the litany of false hoods, um, that I no longer defensive about because they're false hoods and it is what it is and I love talking about them in front of, you know, corporate ceos and

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Titans of industry who think they know that they can run everything. Well, let me tell you, someday the preferred, the proverbial theses is going to hit the fan and your company and you're going to want to learn these lessons and learn them. Well. That's why I run a small business here. We have very little management. Very good. What do you make of just sort of the. I guess this is just part of the human condition, the idea that we always need someone to blame. Now you are acknowledging that not everything went right. You didn't make every right decision. We're acknowledging government over a nonsense and all that, but just this need to blame because I think you are one of the first examples because maybe it was sort of at the, just at the beginnings of social media or lines of just like, let's just take this guy and we didn't know who he was.

Speaker 3:          00:39:21       Yes, and less just destroy it. Let's just will destroy his career and then we'll try to destroy his life. What are you, what do you make of just that general psychological? Well, there is a, um, there's two ways to look at it. In Judaism, there is the philosophy of finding the scape goat and putting all the sins of the community, putting all the sins of the village and escape. Let me go and throwing the gold over the cliff. Well, I think that really is applicable to life in general and we have through social media. I can't, I can't even imagine what it would have been like with social media

Speaker 2:          00:39:54       back in 2005. It was brutal enough without it. But I think we have, when you think about the hierarchy of needs that people have belonged, love, power, social media has amplified all of those and the, the feeling of being superior to somebody else so permeates our society that any chance we have to squish somebody, it makes. I don't know whether it's an endorphin rush, adrenaline, but something that we now have this horrible, horrible desire to just destroy people. They have lives. They have families now. Some people, maybe they deserve it. Maybe they don't. But I, I like to think that everybody, unless you just totally a doofus, people are actually trying to do the best I can.

Speaker 3:          00:40:43       Yeah. I mean I'm a firm believer in that, but yes, of course there are people that want to just destroy. Unfortunately, I think social media has amplified the best antidote

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       that heals me because I refused to stay down. There were people have actually advised me you need to slither away. And I was like, are you kidding me? I cannot wait for these congressional hearings because I can't wait for some dumb ass congressman or dumb ass senator who thinks that he's God's gift of creation to ask me a question because I'm going to tell him the truth whether he likes it or not.

Speaker 3:          00:41:17       So let's talk about this hearing's a little bit when you see it. Just not hearing right. Any hearing related to anything else. It strikes me as patently obvious that pretty much the senators and congressmen have almost no idea what they're talking about really, but they've been handed a brief and they've been told by Prob, you know, a handler or whoever. These are the three questions you got asked cause we gotta get you on CNN tonight so then you can push this and blah blah. Just did the hearings when they're trying to unpackage all of this. Did hearings ever make things better at the end? Like is there a hearing that ends and then they go, we really solved the problems of, of why Katrina happened, why the levees failed, what the problems were with fema or were there other responders, etc. Etc. RarEly,

Speaker 2:          00:42:03       in fact, let me tell you, it's actually worse than what you think. It's just more government growing. It's moRe government growing. But to tell you how bad it really is there. If as the under secretary, if I'm going to testify now as a private citizen when I testified in, in the katrina, the hearings

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       clear. So how, how long after the John Brown eight until you until you resigned?

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       Well, I, I actually, interestingly, I resigned on September 11th of 2005, but then they came to me and said, oh we need you to stay on because we've got to figure out just what's going on because they're going to come after the administration. So we went to cow, we want to keep you in the fold for awhile. So they kept me on as a consultant for all right, I want to say four or five months afterwards. And then I pulled the. You must have been seriously pissed at that because now you knew you were just saying yes. So I pulled the trigger and said no more consulting. I'm a private citizen and so when I'm called to testify, the white house has to do one of two things. They have to either accept that I'm going to tell the truth or they have to invoke executive privilege and prevent me from testifying and we deliberately settled up with Susan Collins and joe lieberman for senator lieberman to ask me a question, so about conversations with the president or the white house so that when that question was asked, my lawyer could say, my client wants to answer the question, but he cannot.

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       If the white house is going to invoke executive privilege, which then allowed senator lieberman see how the charade works, then allow senator lieberman to ask, is there anyone in this hearing room from the white house who wants to invoke executive privilege? And of course the room silent and senator lieberman laughed and said, oh, I'm sure there are plenty of people from the white house here, but apparently nobody wants to invoke executive privilege. Mr. Brown answer the questIon and boom, we were off to the races, but to go back about just a regular hearing. Yeah. If an under secretary or any other government official is going to go testify, his testimony is cleared through the office of management and budget. That testimony is given to the senators and congressmen in advance. The questions are given to the witness in advance. It is a show. It is a production.

Speaker 3:          00:44:26       How much of it also is that they're asking you things as if everything sort of works perfectly in any of the hearings. You know when hillary, the benghazi hearings where they're asking minute by minute, what did you say then to this person, that person. I mean, I know in my own daily life you asked me what happened three days ago at noon, right?

Speaker 2:          00:44:43       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:44:45       I'd have to think about it for awhile, but may I? Maybe I can come up with it, but just that they. They're trying to get you on every little thing. Plus the pressures of your. You're under oath, you're the media watching and everything else. It just seems like it's a recipe

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       for nothing. Nothing good, nothing substantial to come out. Nothing substantial does come out of them now. I think there's an exception if if in the house or senate, if they are truly conducting and investigation, and here's how to tell if they're truly conducting your investigation, they'll depose witnesses outside the hearing room. They will ask a witness either voluntarily or with a subpoena to come in and subject to a deposition by staff lawyers. That's a real investigation that's really sitting you down and saying, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. Now, let us ask you a serIes of questions and that can actually result in something productive. Now for the witness, do you have to be very careful because like anything else to your point, why don't you do on wednesday at noon? Um, I, you know, I went to uh, went to this bagel shop down the street and have lunch.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       What was the name of it? Well, I think it was x. They find out actually you went to a burger stand and had a burger. Now they got you in perjury. Yeah, it's crazy. It really is crazy. So what was the resolution and when the, when the hearings ended, like what, what do they do? So then they issue a report that report, is there a prior brand and the report, the report, I get a kick out of this because the report virtually acknowledged everything that I had said was wrong about the integration of fema and these other agencies in the dhs. There was a virtual admission to that then the things that they wanted to do to correct. Uh, we're, I don't want to over exaggerate. So let's just say 50 percent. The nss dropped about 50 percent of the things that I've been arguing about. Now, is it working? It's not working Because the way things go in dc, whoever has the money has the power and you can't wander. I'm using the theme of current fema director who's a former employee of mine as an example. you can't expect him on a day to day. what's his name? brock brock long. Okay. Used to be the at the national hurricane center. emergency manager in Alabama. He's a great guy. I love this guy. Uh, probably shouldn't have said that because that will know.

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       Plus they'll regret having said that, let's edit that out. We donate It for you probably made his Kenya everybody, right, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       So we're, we're, we're, uh, well the reports and the report. So if, if you're fighting on a day to day basis for your budget with the secretary of homeland security and all the other under secretaries, and then when a disaster hits, now you're the boss and the secretary is subordinate to you. Can you imagine knowing that in the private sector one day you're the ceo, but under certain circumstances you as the ceo or actually subordinate to somebody else on your staff. I mean that's an untenable situation, but that's kind of the situation they created with the post katrina act. That's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       So we, we touched obviously on the media portion of this and I mentioned how when I was googling you this morning as I'm doing research, half the articles come up are about the 10 year anniversary and they're still attacking. Yes. Yeah. Again, you have sat here and acknowledge that you did not do everything perfectly. Right? But what does, what do you make of that in a more broad sense about the media? Because I talk about the media a lot here and I'm extremely frustrated with mainstream media and it's almost gotten to the point where every time they write something bad about somebody, I started thinking that they're actually the good guy because I see the way they do it to me that the neo really has completely gotten out of control.

Speaker 2:          00:48:32       They've. They've lost, they've lost all integrity, they've lost all. I'm just, this is what I do on my own radio program is I don't tell. I don't ever try to tell people what to think. I try to give them a different perspective so that they can, with their own minds. Maybe think about something a different way. The media, if you look for those 10 year anniversary things or there's a one example that just stands out to this date irritates me. I had the highest level of security clearances with the cia. The nsa had a q clearance with the department of energy, which means I had access to all the secrets and everything else. I mean, I, I top secret special access programs. That was me.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       I don't know if you're going to drop any other secret knowledge while you're right,

Speaker 2:          00:49:16       if you're right. So I had all these clearances and everything else. Time magazine ran a story that I had lied on my resume. Now my first reaction when they ran that story was sued the bastards. I want to go after him and then my lawyer starts explaining to me, okay, um, first of all, you're going to have to prove they did it with willful malice because you're a public figure. Then you're going to have to go through all of the strain and time and energy of depositions in a trial and hearings and you want to relive all of that. Or do you really care about time magazine having some story that's now 10, 12, 15 years old about you lied on your resume when you Know what the truth is. And half of America knows what the truth is and the other half of America you don't really care about. Yeah, no, but the media gets by with now I am not. I am not. Repeat. Not going down the road, the trump goes down that says we need to change the libel laws. I'm just pointing out that the media has this amazing power and with that power I believe countries possibility and they've abdicated the responsibility.

Speaker 3:          00:50:22       Yeah. You don't 50 Slash 50 on the libel thing and everyone that's watching the show that I am an free speech. Absolute statute is an absolute twice there, but I do believe in libel laws and I do believe we should have laws to protect privacy and a series of other things. I don't know. I would prefer that they don't be changed because I don't think we need the government doing anything. I don't think we need more laws. I don't think we need more regulations or any of that. Right. There is something that I see so consistently these days where they Just pick somebody and it's awful. I mean, it's often people that I have on this show Because they're right in the thick of have important conversations and we say one thing here and then I read the article about it the day after and it's literally the reverse or they cut the word not right, you know, or didn't. it's

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       what I have found that I find fascinating and I know that media is in this transition. You let me look at what you and I are doing. They hate what you and I are doing right now because it throws away our business model out the window. Yeah. I think what the. Like I'll. I'll be doing a story on, on air and I've got the article in front of me and I'm a. I'm a kind of a grammar nut and I'll look at. I'll go, holy crap. An editor never even looked at this. The wall street journal. You the stellar newspaper, right? Yeah, I'd have. They fired all their editors. I find so many grammatical errors, punctuation errors, all. I just think the media is in this flux, so you add the flux With their agenda at times their sloppiness. You had all of those things together. The media is just not filling their fourth estate responsibilities.

Speaker 3:          00:52:03       Yeah. So how do we clean up some of this government stuff? I suspect, although you just saId you're not with trump on the, uh, alIve, but I suspect that there's a certain amount of deregulation that he's doing and cutting back some of these agencies that you got to be pretty happy with

Speaker 2:          00:52:18       static about it. When you think about this whole, you'll find it so bizarre example, but whether it's here in California, back in Colorado, wherever, wherever we might might be. I challenge people watching this go look at any government office and I would bet it's the nicest office building in your community. Now, wait a minute. Who paid for that? The guys in the garage who were coming up with the next big thing, assam startup company or some guidance working an eight to five blue collar job that got his hands dirty and his nails are cracked and he's working with his hands like crazy. They're paying for that is, It shouldn't be the reverse fact. Shouldn't the government actually be in the garages? Shouldn't they? Actually be the ones that are in the office buildings that you know, they have to go up 20 elevatorS to get to their offices instead of having all the edifices that we allow them to use and create and build.

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       We have this, we have this perverted sense that the government, and I think it's getting worse, that the government is the answer to everything and that somehow government is going to solve all of our problems. Let tell you the government doesn't solve problems. The government causes problems. So what would you say the answer is related to? So at dhs or fema now or anything else? I mean if these things didn't exist, I'm sure somebody is watching this right now. What do you mean? I mean if these things didn't exist, well now you know new orleans still is below sea level, which is a whole in that. That was just talking about that for a second. There are a certain amount of people that now say, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Because they don't realize it. Then they hear it and they go, wait a minute. We have a city that's below sea level that has all of these structural problems.

Speaker 2:          00:53:59       Maybe we shouldn't be living there anymore. What do you say to someone like that? First of all, I think anybody should be able to live wherever they want to live. If if, if I want to live next to the national forest in boulder county, Colorado, I should be able to do that, but then I should also assume the risk of living there. If I want to live on the fault lines in California, I should be able to do that, but I should assume the risk. Yeah, I think government has some basic services to provide. We all agree the police protection, fire protection, that's something we all want to pay for, but if you're going to deliberately choose to live below sea level and then why should I want to be very careful. I can feel it already. Why it's slippery. It's slippery because I think they should be able to live there.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       If you choose to live there though, it's the responsibility of the taxpayers that lived there to create those levies and build those levies and maintain those levees. Because I don't live there. It's not my responsibility. I pay taxes to take care of the hazard where I live and frankly I don't think the government should take care of all hazards because if we tried to start, if we start trying to protect the american population from all of the hazards that we face, we will end up with a totalitarian government because there's too many hazards. So this is sort of the case where the people that that were down there in new orleans, that ally, it's not just. I'm sure most of them had earned. I can't say most, but I'm sure a good portion, at least in the people that had money, had insurance and probably had flood insurance and everything else, but it's that afterwards, all this federal money comes in to help the rebuild.

Speaker 2:          00:55:39       But you're saying there perhaps that that doesn't quite make sense. Is that, is that basically there will be people who will say, oh my god, the former director of federal emergency management agency is saying we should revisit. Absolutely. We have a concept of federalism in this country. We have federal, state and local government and at at the top load, let's reverse that. We have the people, we have local government, state government and federal government. That's the order and what we have done is we've taken the federal government and we've almost made them the local fire department. We've almost made them the local police department and the many aspects. That's actually true. Tsa for example, we've made them a local police department. Even though I want to be a lawyer here, they have no law enforcement authority. They just think they do, but they have zero law enforcement authority.

Speaker 2:          00:56:29       What does it actually mean? They have zero law enforcement authority. I mean if they. If you go through and you've got a knife in your pocket like, oh, then they just hand you off to whoever the local daniel, you got to get a cup. I think I'd get a cop. They can. They can arrest you, they cannot detain you, they can't do anything, but they call themselves officers because they wouldn't put on the mask of authority because government always wants to put on the mask of authority because that's how you keep the citizens kind of subdued. No. Well, my whole point about female becoming kind of this first responder, the more we rely on the federal government to come in after any sort of disaster that weakened state and local governments because they become more and more dependent upon the federal government. So more and more things get nationalized and the more things get nationalized, the more we turn into a western european socialist type government, which we know it's not going to happen in our lifetimes.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Don't get me wrong, I'm not. I'm the tinfoil hatS. Not on, but, but I do believe that republics eventually fail and we are on this path that if we keep going down this path of throwing more and more things up against the wall for the federal government to, to handle and take care of, we will end up as a western european socialist government and over generations and generations that leads to tyranny. So then you must be digging trump on this. Oh, and this stuff. Absolutely. Yeah. The thing, the thing that bothers me, look, the president wasn't my first choice and I, before we go too deep and I do want to mention that we are taping this a little bit in advance of when it's going to air. So I just want to be very, very clear. But who knows what happened to the guys.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       Um, it wasn't my first choice, but when it came down to the, to the typical dichotomy of republican versus democrat have, you know, I still think I still want to believe that republicans or the government of individualism and individual liberty and everything, although I could argue that they aren't necessarily that way and the democrats are moving to the hard progressive, almost marxist left. So when it comes to the general election, if I want to vote for one of those two, I'm going to vote for trump. I only say that because he has totally up into what it means.

Speaker 2:          00:58:45       I work for george w dot buSh who people thought couldn't speak well. Um, but I thought was smart, knew what he was doing. A, I think trump is smart. I think he knows what he's doing, but he's the first president in this age of twitter and facebook and everything else. And I just don't think we've quite figured out how to deal with that. And quite honestly, I don't think he's quite figured out how to deal with it. He hasn't quite figured out that as president, if I say something even innocuous, they're reading, they're reading that in moscow, they're reading that in pyongyang there, reading it everywhere and so he needs to be a little more. I just wish it would be a little more circumspect with use of social media. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:59:30       right. I know enough about trump. Let. Let's just talk about George W. Bush for a second because you mentioned he was. He was your boss, you know. Well, you know, there was the caricature of course, of all the years of his presidency that he was some sort of idiot or you know. Yes. He had a strange way of speaking and kind of stilted and met a lot of that writing mixed up a lot of words. Wow. Tell me something about him that maybe would give us a little other side that we would know. Sure. There's an odd nostalgia. That's what I'm saying. There's an odd nostalgia about him now because I see it from people on the left all the time. Now they're, they're sort of galvanIzing him right there. There are lionizing him now.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       He, he and I were in the limo, we were in the beast, southern California, going back to a marine one, and we're on these kind of rural areas and people have lined the streets and eddie, who was his agent in charge of presidential detail, he kept telling eddie, and I wouldn't use these words carefully, eddie stop the car. These people want to see their president. It wasn't eddie stopped the car. They want to see me and he don't stop the car because they want to see, you know, hey, it's me and brown. No, they want to see their president. He had this understanding of that office was his temporarily and he was everybody's president and I saw that in that car and then I saw at one time in the oval office we were sitting in and press office comes through with a gaggle of kids and he stops the meeting entirely and shows these kids.

Speaker 2:          01:01:07       I mean they missed maybe sixth grade or seventh graders. Shows them the resolute desk and explains to them the history of the resolute desk and I'm sitting there like, oh, I can watch this all day long. Yeah. Then a third story we. It was the first presidential debate of the 2004 election. He, gemini, I in the car, we'd been at some hurricane center somewhere and jeb turns to him and says, I think it's time to for you to go to hotel, you need to. You really need to bone up and study some bushes. Like, nah, you know I'm going to whip his ass. He was kind of a job. He was kind of a frat boy alone. He was kind of a frat boy, jocular funding crack jokes, you know, smarted off. I'm never inappropriately, but just an ordinary human being. So these two brothers get in a fight and I'm sitting in the jump seat facing the president, like imu and jeb sitting there and they're arguing about whether they should go back to the hotel or now in jeb looks at me and said, lee, and I'm like, I am not going to the fight between two

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       brothers, one who's the governor of a swing state that we've got to witness election then, and the other guy happens to be the president. United stAtes in my boss. I'm staying out of that pipe boys and what happened? I stayed out of the fight and bush went to the first debate and lost big time to john kerry. Very good. Well listen, it's really been a pleasure talking to you. I hope we cleaned up some of this stuff. Did we hit everything that that should've been hit on? Are you kidding? I, I mean, I know we four more days that. Yeah, you gotta go do your radio show. Not too far from here, but I suspect we'll do this again. I hope so. Yeah, it was a pleasure. Absolutely. Oh, and by the way, I want to mention I've talked to the people over here, for those of you that follow us on patriot on so many of you know that my dog, emma, is a rescue from hurricane katrina and she's got a really wonderful story. Uh, so we did a video of, of michael meeting amma before and I, and I told her story and that's an unpatriotic and for more on michael and you can follow him on twitter. it's at Michael Brown, usa.
