Speaker 1:          00:05          Joining me today as a contributor for Canada's national post known here on the Youtube, as my name is Josephine, Josephine. Matthias, welcome to the Rubin Room.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Thank you for having me. I'm so excited to be here. So your real name is Josefina. My name is Jason. I know a lot of people don't believe that. I think it's like an alias isn't really not that believable.

Speaker 1:          00:26          You say, my name is Josephine and people are always getting pumped on line. So they were curious.

Speaker 2:          00:32          Sorry, that was gonna say. I think they assume it's like bunky show or something to Joseph until really late.

Speaker 1:          00:38          All. Alright, well I'm, I'm really super psyched that you're here. We met about a month and a half ago in Toronto after Jordan Peterson thing. We got to chat a little bit and I've been a fan of what you're doing for awhile and I think you're actually one of the few people on the youtube making some sense.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Whoa. I feel fresh.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Okay. So, uh, let's just do a little bit about your history first and then we're gonna play a clip from one of your videos in case people haven't seen some of your stuff and then we're going to talk about all sorts of political stuff because you are a true political beast. So you're originally from Nigeria. I lived there for what, eight or nine years before he moved to Canada. So tell me about growing up in Nigeria.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Yeah. Um, I actually don't remember much about growing up in Nigeria and my parents kind of a closed me off to what was really going on. I lived in a gated community and um, yeah, I immigrated here when I was nine years old. My Dad actually first went to Canada when I was two. Uh, he got here on a work visa, worked his ass off for years, for about seven years actually. I didn't even know who my dad was for seven years. And then when he got his visa and everything, he brought my family over and yeah, now I'm in. I'm in Canada. I mean a great country.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Yeah. So what did your dad do? Was able to get a visa to go there.

Speaker 2:          01:50          Yeah. My Dad was an accountant and then when he got to Canada he went back to school and decided to do nursing inside. And my mom's a teacher, so that's, that's what they do. What does your mom teach? Uh, she teaches. She taught English in Nigeria and now she kind of teaches special ed kids and stuff like that. So she still loves teaching. She obviously can't teach a Nigerian person can teach English in Canada, but yeah. So she still loves teaching, so I'm glad she's still kind of gets to do that. But yeah. So my dad's accountant, my dad, my mom's a teacher.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Yeah. Do your parents tell you anything about the political situation or anything at the time when you were growing up? Even if you don't have great memories of it?

Speaker 2:          02:24          Uh, not necessarily. My parents were not really that political. I think we became more political when we came to Canada and I mean politics in Nigeria is just, it's completely corrupt. There's no such thing as politics. It's all just money. And um, it was when I came to Canada is when they start to get a little bit more political and uh, I don't know, I think religion and strict parents kinda create conservatism in a way. So they're very, very conservative. Uh, so I grew up about, um, around that, but they didn't really name it as conservatism. It was just strict and religious and had all these rules that basically apply to conservatism in the way. Yeah. So then you get to Canada, you're not even 10 years old. What was that like to be in a new country? So weird here. I think it was 16 degrees outside and I was freezing.

Speaker 2:          03:10          So why is it so cold? And it was people wearing tee shirts. I did not understand. Uh, I remember like driving from the airport, I think it's piercing airport and we all stopped and was like, why are we stopping? And they're like, oh, it's a red light. Like what does that mean? Don't you just go with us? Everyone has figured out. My Dad's like, there's order here. I was like, oh, okay. And snow. Snow is the best one. I think I spent like half an hour just like touching it and like, what is this? And my elementary school teachers or middle school teachers had to tell me to get back inside. But yeah, it was, it was really, it was surreal. It was a culture shock. So it was mostly a weather related, whether an order, whether an order. Exactly. It's basically it, whether in order. So when you say you grew up in like a in a religious atmosphere, what was that like?

Speaker 2:          03:51          My parents were just super religious and they hoped I'd be also as religious as them. Unfortunately I'm not. But I think that kinda comes with age and also living in a different country. Nigeria, it's easier, easier. The majority of people are religious. Um, but yeah, they, they are still a very, very good Catholic Protestants. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. So, okay. So now you're in Canada, you're a kid, you're making a good life for yourself. When did you get interested in politics? Oh, I got interested in politics a while I'm taking political science and studying political science in school right now. And um, I was also president of the debate club, I was just interested in like this scores and discussing things. I was interested in people's ideas and different ideas and reasoning, the reason for things. Um, but I also think my political views were really shaped by me immigrating to Canada and we lived in the inner cities.

Speaker 2:          04:43          I'm not sure if you've ever heard of Jane and finch by any chance. It's Kinda like a south side of Chicago lights, like it's not, it's obviously not as bad, but it's an inner city majority black, um, you know, poor neighborhoods. I lived there for most of my Canadian life actually. And then from there I moved to a more higher income neighborhood and having to experience that. So it was really cool kind of seeing like the culture there and then get another culture shock and move somewhere else. So it's like I've experienced, you know, Nigeria in the inner city in Canada and then a much more well off neighborhood. So, which would you say is the best out of those three? Nigeria know all of neighborhood. But yeah, living in the inner cities really shaped my views because now when I look back I was like, oh, that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          05:28          You are a product of your environment. And a lot of people that, you know, I think about two slash three of my friends made it out of there. The majority of them are pregnant or single parents now they're in the system and it's unfortunate and weird to see that happen. And my parents being extremely strict and they gave me a curfew at like 5:00 PM everyday. I wasn't allowed to have boyfriends, which I guess I was young, I probably shouldn't have, but they were really, really strict and I hated them at that time. I didn't understand why they didn't me to go out and play

Speaker 1:          05:58          with people and now I get it because I would have ended up like a lot of the people that are still there right now. And then yeah, moving to the much better neighborhood. I realized that while there is a difference, there is a cultural difference I guess. But so when I've watched a ton of your videos, I thought, all right, I sensed that she basically is a liberal kind of liberal, but I think you have probably some conservative leanings perhaps, or at least have an understanding. I think that's what you're laying out here. You have an understanding of that line of thinking. Yeah. You consider yourself a classical liberal. I don't want to push you, but I'd like to hear you say it but, but what do you actually consider your views to be okay here? I know everyone says they don't like putting labels, but I absolutely hate labels because like I have some conservative ideas. I have some liberal ideas, I have some classical liberal ideas. Um, I have some progressive ideas, socialist ideas. Um, but I guess I just see a look of things from issue to issue, but I, um, you know, primarily liberal, but I'm fiscally conservative. So that's kind of where I lean I guess. So the route I think of, of your ideas, he's sort of individualization. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. You want to throw to a clip? Yes, let's do it. Alright. Let's get people to know you in your natural environment.

Speaker 2:          07:13          West has also been tweeting about the lack of freedom of thought in America and the backlash about whether blacks can be allowed to be Republicans. Sure is helping prove his point, but black Americans, contrary to popular belief, can hold wildly diverse and opposing opinions and political issues. Maybe Connie was a republican. I mean he's ever referred to himself as such, of course, but he said something about trump that wasn't severely negative, so he suddenly the Black Paul Ryan, but even if he is so what? In fact, a 2012 study by Vincent Hutchins and King Jefferson using data from the American national election studies found that 45 percent of black Americans identify as conservatives. Despite this, however, the Democratic Party typically receives 85 to 95 percent of the black American vote. The tendency of black Americans to vote Democrat allows the to believe that they have a strong hold on the black American vote. In fact, back in 2016 when Connie was announced he would run for president in 20, 20, the Democratic Party's official twitter account immediately assumed. He meant you'd be running for them responding. Welcome to the race, Mr West. Glad to have you. If only the Dems had Ron Kanye in 2016, better candidate than she who shall not be named.

Speaker 1:          08:21          All right. So I, I picked that one because I think this is a great example of what you do. There's, there's information and facts and it's kind of light to and fun and all that good stuff. Now, first off though, as a black Canadian yapping about black Americans, that's kind of racist, wouldn't you say? Yeah. I think I've gotten a lot of comments when people say like he don't understand what it's like to be black in America and it's like, oh my gosh, I thought I can have those same discussions about race relations in America. It's just a little scaled down in, in the Canadian context. And I think a lot of Canadians try to project, I guess I American issues on Canadians as well. So, um, but yeah,

Speaker 2:          08:56          no, I, I do get that criticism, which is annoying. We should all be allowed to talk about whatever we want. You are a black in America right now? Yes, I am. I know it's awful. I mean by 10 times people are yelling the n word at me. I mean I just, I feel so unsafe. Well that's why we create a safe space for you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So I won't hook that video though because the numbers that you laid out there are actually kind of incredible and something that we obviously have been talking about lately related to Kanye and candice and the rest of it for 45 percent of black Americans consider themselves conservative yet at 85 to 95 percent are voting democrat. That is a massive disconnect. So. So what do you make of that? Yeah, I think there's an idea that the Democratic Party is the best one for black Americans.

Speaker 2:          09:43          It's the one that's going to help black Americans. And although they are conservative in the true sense of the word, they aren't necessarily Republican. They don't believe in the Republican Party. Um, but it is, it is very interesting, I mean no one group or identity bolts the same way as black Americans do. So there is some kind of, I guess, story that's being told to them that this is the way to do it. This is the way to go. And I don't think, you know, the Republican party per se is the way to go and I don't think the Democratic Party, in fact, I think both parties are just garbage at this point. Um, but yeah, I think it's a little odd that the majority, 95 percent vote one single way, but yet there are still conservative in a sense. Um, but yeah, I just think it's, it's a, it's a leftover ideas, like they just need to kind of start to refigure things out.

Speaker 2:          10:28          But first we probably have to start with, you know, changing up the government and changing up the party systems and try to find who to vote for instead of just picking Democrat or a Republican. Do you think this was more of a good sell job by the Democrats are a bad cell job by the Republicans because when you look at all this, the cities, especially where it's the worst for black people, they're always democrat run cities for decade after decade after decade. Yet black people still extremely high numbers keep voting Democrat. So that's obviously a great sell job if somebody's doing some serious pr workload. Yeah. Oh yeah, definitely. And um, I think it's also the Republicans as well. I think Black Democrats make it feel like the Republicans are against the black Americans and the Democrats and the Republicans make it feel like, you know, the black Americans are against the Republicans.

Speaker 2:          11:15          Like it's just, I think both sides are not necessarily trying to help. They're just trying to pander to their own side. But it is interesting that you've been voting Democrat for so long and things are not getting better. It's like, oh, maybe I should start voting a different way, or maybe I should start criticizing the Democratic Party. I think that's actually the biggest thing is it's not picking a side. It's criticizing what they're doing wrong. It's criticizing, you know, this didn't work. Let's try something else. Instead of just saying we need Democrat. That's it. This is what's gonna happen, but it's clearly not not working. Let's try to figure out what policy changes we need instead of trying to pick like, you know, Democrat or Republican. Sorry, I keep saying that. I've never gotten. No, I'm with you. I'm with you. So I know you're not. You're not a huge proponent

Speaker 1:          11:54          of the SORTA candice Kanye training in general, but the fact that that conversation is happening now, the fact that you made that video, you view that all as positive,

Speaker 2:          12:04          right? Oh yeah, no, for sure. I think Connie really allowed a lot of people to think for a second and try to investigate some more information. Try to figure out what their real. Why do they hold certain ideas. I think that was the biggest thing and it was really exciting. It's like scroll through facebook and see people that are not normally engaging in politics now. Actually, that might be scary because it's like the majority of people are saying don't know what they're doing, but yeah, I'd rather have them involved in some way. Exactly. I would rather have them involved. And the thing is, I think as much as I, um, you know, dislike is politics. I do think that it opened a lot of people's minds in the sense that it allowed them to investigate more and that's the most important thing because then you're just stuck in the echo chamber.

Speaker 2:          12:43          Connie broke that. A lot of people, all they see is, you know, beyonce and Chrissy Tiegen and all these celebrities that are all just talking about the far left, you know, super. I hate saying social justice for ever super social justice warrior talking points. So kanye broke that and showed them the other side. Um, unfortunately I think, uh, you know, because candace is kind of harsh and you know, I think it's harder for people to connect with her that are already sold down the drain of the far left. And unfortunately we might have to cuddle them, fill it, we'll come on, come to the other side. It's okay, let me explain things to you.

Speaker 1:          13:17          So do you view that as just like a personality trait because that's what's interesting to me. Like people used to say to me all the time, well, you know, if when you have milo on like Milo's creating chaos and out of chaos, hopefully my feeling was if I brought my low on that out of the chaos that he creates, that some people would hear some good ideas in a more calm, relaxed way and then they joined me on the adventure that I'm on it. I think there's proof in that pudding. I think you're kind of a little bit more like where I think you see the little bit of the chaos that candice is creating and you want people to understand the ideas behind them.

Speaker 2:          13:51          Yeah, that's, that's the thing is that, you know, when candice says one thing like, um, stop the victim mentality for example, um, I think a black Americans that are stuck in like the far left echo chamber just sees it as like, excuse me, like what are you trying to save a little blah? So it's like they need either she explains it further, which obviously she doesn't have to do with me, she can do whatever she wants, but I think she needs to break it down a little more because saying get off the plantation, the victim hood, it's harder for people that all they've ever heard is white privilege, white people suck, blah blah blah. It's harder for them to kind of understand where she's coming from because if you do break it down it makes a lot of sense. But if it's just rolling like that, then it's harder for them to figure it out. What they can do. The I keep pointing here like the liberals are these people over here? Yeah. So it just seemed to kind of break it down and figure

Speaker 1:          14:36          you think maybe you need both. Like in any movement, like if you just look at the black rights movement that Malcolm x was different than Martin Luther King. And even the way comedians talk about things differently cause we talked about things differently than Dick Gregory than Chappelle and Chris Rock. We just need people. People just get affected by it. Different.

Speaker 2:          14:54          Yeah. Shock value works, I mean it gets people, it wakes people up, it allows them to kind of be more aware of what's going on. I totally, I do think we need both of them. We need people to say, know, shut up, you're being annoying. And we also need people to say here's why you're being annoying. I think we most certainly need both, but yeah, I think she, what she does is she's awesome. She has such a great platform and there are also other people that are doing the same thing but in a more kind of calmer. I'm not saying she's like crazy or anything like that. Um, yeah, she's just, she's a tough girl and it's a lot of sjws aren't snowflakes. So I really had any interaction. I'm not necessarily, I mean I think we've done under, like we've talked over dms on twitter before. Um, and this was after the whole Blair white debate and that was white guys guys, guys. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, no. I was just at reaching out to her and asking her like, Hey, what's going on? Like I don't because she was, I think closing everyone off that were criticizing her and I didn't want to openly criticize her. I wanted to go directly to the source, but we left off on a good note. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:58          All right, well I'll put it out here. Why don't we have a Jay z Kanye moment and you both can come on the show sometime and talk it out and going to be like guys, guys, guys. I'm a glutton for punishment. So when I was doing a little research and I knew one of the things that I thought was most interesting is that. So you have a twin sister. Yeah. And part of your awakening was related to a paper that she was writing in college. Right. So can you tell me about that? Because it's pretty fascinating. Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

Speaker 2:          16:25          Um, so my sister is not into politics at all. She is studying marketing and she decided to take, he was to Ryerson University, one of the biggest far left universities in Canada. And um, he took a sociology course that was her fault and it was called how society works. I think it was the title of the course or is what bothered me because if the chorus was feminism studies, if the course was, you know, how women are oppressed and yeah, sure, but this is how society works and you know, in your assignment they had to talk about some societal issue and discuss it and analyze it or whatever and she wanted to talk about the weight or I actually encouraged her. I like you to talk about the wage gap and you know, how it's falls and you know, how it's misinterpreted and all of that.

Speaker 2:          17:08          And you were sending her up. I was setting her up a little. I wanted to test it out, but I didn't know it was there. A professor would respond that way. Um, but yeah, I told her to write about the wage gap. So she just sounds like a short thesis and said like, here's what I want to talk about. I'm going to use studies, blah, blah, blah. Let me know. And the professor, like, her response is a meme. Like, I hope I could. You guys can like put it up or something. It's like the reality is patriarchy do not use business sources. They blame women and it's like period. The reality is patriarchy can do not blame women and like, you know

Speaker 1:          17:38          the screenshot on this, you can say yes for sure.

Speaker 2:          17:40          Definitely. Yeah, I was reading it. I was like, okay, this is fake, right? This is. And this is definitely fake. No, she basically shut it down. She said your premise is completely. And it was one of the most absurd emails ever and use only feminist sources. And in the assignment details, the list of sources they can't use was dictionary.com. The encyclopedia. You couldn't use the government of Canada website, you couldn't use statistic Canada, Statistics Canada. How, like how does that even make sense? How are you going to explain how society works? And the only source you have is feminist studies, as Peterson has mentioned, there's so many times they're not cited. It's just within this little group, the, these aren't real textbooks. Uh, but yeah, it just, it blew my mind and I was so excited and she sat back because I was like, this is exactly what is wrong.

Speaker 2:          18:30          So. Okay, so your sister gets this response. What was her response? Was she like, Oh, look what you did to me? No, yes, she was upset at me and she thought I was wrong and I have to sit her down and say, girl, let me explain it to you. Here is what is actually happening. By the end of that conversation, she's like, oh my gosh, I've been. Every class I go to, I've been lied to. They are lying to me every single day, and it, it, it's, it's, it's so messed up and I think it's, this isn't teaching. This is imposing your political ideas on students because if it's teaching, you teach it objectively, you show them the facts and let your students come up with their own conclusions. This is not teaching. She's trying to tell them how to think and you know, I, I did some research on her actually and she's the highest paid woman in her person, in her department.

Speaker 2:          19:11          She makes more money than the male counterparts are you talking about? So I'm sure there's a reason. Yeah, exactly. But it's like there's obviously reasons for it. She probably works more hours, she's, you know, doing all these other things and that's how you can explain the wage gap. So it was just interesting to me that why like why are you doing this? Why are you lying to your students or isn't the point of education for you? Like, or essays or assignments like you're supposed to come to your own conclusions by using facts. We have the facts. What's wrong with it? She just didn't want those facts. It, it blew my mind. But that was the right. Well, they're often not for facts. Yeah. Facts that they allege facts. So what, what happened with the paper? She's like, okay, this is too much for me. My sister and she ended up just doing some other topic and try to pander to what the professor wanted to get a good mark.

Speaker 2:          19:59          And that is my advice to a lot of students is like, just suck it up. I mean if you are already in this class, it's not worth getting a bad mark over. Um, however. Sorry. The great thing about it was I got a ton of messages from students from her class started to explain all the other things that this teacher is engaging and how awful it is and not made me happy because they said, you know what, next week I'm going to speak up and I'm going to tell her she's wrong. And I was like, yes, yes, but be prepared. Don't just take you through. So it's interesting. So I talk about this when I do college speeches. Yeah. Two years ago or so, I used to say what you said about get the grade, like suck it up and get the green because hopefully you know, if you want to move to Grad school or get a good job after or whatever.

Speaker 2:          20:37          And I've turned on that really to on that because to me it's like we live in a time where people can be on youtube and expose these things. Share the emails out on social media, periscope while you're in classes. The teacher is telling you that you're an evil white racism videos with my teachers. Just the worst thing. But that's been so empowering for you. So that's why I'm not for telling kids students not to do that, but I understand the line of thinking. Yeah. And I guess it depends on the person or is it's still kind of challenge your professor while he is, you know, just teaching. I meant more for assignments. Like if the assignment says explain why women are oppressed, like just do it, that that's it. Like if you, you're probably going to fail if you say women are not oppressed. Um, but if the teacher is actually teaching then yes please.

Speaker 2:          21:24          That is the best time because you catch them at it. And I love watching them squirm. I love watching them just kind of look around and it's like, oh, there's a black woman asking me to tell you know, tell her why she's depressed and my white professor please tell me what rights you have did I don't have in Toronto, Canada. And it's like, well, you know, there is white privilege. And it's like, oh my gosh, stop. Do you feel bizarrely empowered because of that? Now, I mean someone who's clear on their political thoughts and you don't, you're not a victim victim or anything or he's immigrant status or blah, blah, blah. Do you feel very empowered, like almost like your teachers can't push back on you in a weird way because they're, they're caught in their own guilt cycle. Yeah, no, for sure. And it's also funny because, um, you know, I am the, I am an immigrant, I'm black and I'm a woman.

Speaker 2:          22:10          It's like I just have to be, I guess most loving and I'm all the impressions. Um, so it's really difficult for them or anything. Yeah. I got to limit Stereo Mueller every oppression there is. Um, but yeah, no, it, it's, it's, it's kind of funny to see how they can't challenge me because a lot of their arguments, it is based on lived experiences. This is what black people face and I'm talking about the Canadian context. I think Canadian social racial relations is a little bit different than the states than here in the states. Sorry. Um, but yeah, me being a black woman, it's, it's very difficult for them that they can't give me any, they have to give me a legit argument because the only argument is, well, black people feel that way. I don't. So what is your argument? But yeah, I mean in, in a sense it does kind of make me feel empowered because it's, it's funny to watch them squirm.

Speaker 2:          22:55          Do you feel that you've had an undue influence in, I suspect in a positive way on some of your classmates because I'm imagining they're probably learning as much from you in some ways more than they're learning from some of these professors. Yeah, for sure. Um, it's actually funded. There are some classes I would have where a professor will say something absurd and like there's a student that I know knows me from Youtube and he will look at me and I'm like, I'm not saying anything and then they'll raise their hand and they'll talk and they'll want me to chime in and I'm like, I don't want to do this in every class. I'm not going to be challenging my professors. Um, but, uh, yeah, I really liked the fact that I've encouraged so many students step up and actually speak up and say what they believe in and um, yeah, it's just really, it's really interesting.

Speaker 2:          23:37          There was a course where one of the textbooks, I forgot, damn it, this is why school sucks because like you forget everything literally, instantly. Um, but one of the students said how it was problematic and before we just kind of brush it off and then another student rose their hand and said, why is it problematic? And it looks at me. I was like, Oh God. But yeah, I really liked that. I've encouraged people to speak up and you know, state what they believe and do more research and not just listen to everything your professors saying, not just listen to anything I'm saying do more research and investigate and try to find, you know, let's get closer to the truth is basically it.

Speaker 1:          24:08          Do you think students want to be smarter than this stuff? They're being spoon fed because I definitely do. And when I go to these schools, I see such a thirst for knowledge and honesty and facts and an exhaustion with this nonsense. But if you listen to the way the media talks either about millennials or whatever, it's like they're the spoiled entitled generation. And I'm not saying, I'm not saying that a lot of them aren't, but I genuinely think that, that most people, especially young people, they want real answers, not just like easy dribble.

Speaker 2:          24:39          No, for sure. And, um, I think a lot of this has to do with the student unions. And again, I'm talking, I'm obviously more familiar with the Canadian context of this, um, but the, you know, major schools, University of Toronto, York University in Ryerson University. I go to University of Toronto, run by black lives matter, Ryerson, black lives matter and feminist, uh, a university black lives matter. I mean, individuals that are part of the black lives matter. Original organizations are the presidents, vice president and all that of the student union. And, um, I was, uh, president of the debate club for about three years, the first three years of my schooling. And I was like, you know, what would be really exciting to have a debate on racial, racial issues. I would love to. I don't care if I'm on this side, on the other side, that would be such a good thing because all we're ever being bad is faced every corner.

Speaker 2:          25:22          There's some poster about being black and uft, which by the way, people just realized during the trump election, we've been here for three years. No one complained and all of a sudden trump is elected. It's hard to be black. Come on. Um, but yeah, I, I went to go talk to the school president and I said I would love to have this event. All of that. They shut me down. They said anyone that goes in the other side, on the opposite side is, you know, trying to question the humanity of black people, how dare they try. And I was sitting there like, I will be the one, like, what are you talking about? But yeah, they, they canceled it and shut it down. It's just so sad. It was so excited for that.

Speaker 1:          25:56          So it's interesting. I know you've been pretty critical of black lives matter and I want to get into that a little bit, but the moment for me that I realized it had morphed into something that I no longer felt was positive because at the beginning I did think it was basically a positive movement or a grassroots movement that was making some sense and, and addressing some important issues. But the moment I realized that it jumped, the shark was in Toronto actually at the Toronto Pride Parade. When they stopped the parade, they literally stopped the parade from marching to demand that the organizers of the Gay Pride Parade, another oppressed group, uh, submit to their demands. Whatever their demands were, that they were gonna focus on these issues. And I thought, wow, what a perfect example of everything that's wrong with identity politics, with the oppression, Olympics, the whole thing. And then subsequently I saw a lot more

Speaker 2:          26:44          of that style of thinking happening throughout black lives matter. But was that moment for you as someone that's from Toronto? We met in Toronto, is that, was that a seminal moment for you? For sure. I mean, I absolutely hate black lives matter Toronto, I can't say much for many of the other black lives matter chapters, but black lives matter. Toronto is extremely toxic and divisive and I think it's mainly because we were getting so much better in terms of racial relations and people were getting along and there wasn't really. I mean I'm speaking for myself. There wasn't really that many racism or racist acts happening, but all of a sudden they erupt and they say, you know, black people feel uncomfortable during pride because of the police. When again happens during the trump presidency, it's like all of a sudden you're starting to feel oppressed and it blew my mind.

Speaker 2:          27:29          Stopping the pride parade. I was so confused. They stopped it for like an hour asking for demands that the police be banned and it's like being a gay police officer isn't that? And oppression. And then they say, okay, but you can go without your uniform. Are you kidding me? No, that's not the point. The point is there was a stigma against being, you know, a police officer and gay being gay. How dare you take that away from them. And there were a lot of proposals, by the way, during the pride parade with officers and their uniform. That's beautiful. Like, what are you really going to try to. Marriage proposals. Marriage proposals. Yeah. And I was like, oh my God, this is such a great thing. But no, no, no. Now they, they've actually been banned. They didn't, they're not coming to the pride, right? Think for the next like five years or so. Um, but that actually was not the reason why I started to hate blm. Do you remember the Jordan Peterson free speech event in Toronto?

Speaker 2:          28:20          Uh, so he teaches at University of Toronto. My school, and this is actually when I started making videos. It was because during the, the event he, this was his first public event after making the series of videos and um, black lives matter was there, you know, just there are two sides I guess. And I wasn't really picking aside, it was also my very first protest. I was just there to observe. I was very confused as to why people are yelling at each other. But what's going on? Oh, I should have just got home. Uh, yeah. So I, I, you know, I observed the whole thing and it was pretty peaceful. There are people of color went up there and we're saying things like, you know, I don't feel oppressed. This is one of the greatest countries in the world. Especially Toronto. Like this is so diverse. It's everyone loves each.

Speaker 2:          29:03          Everyone's nice to each other. Um, you know, the black lives matter, recalling them coons, they're calling them sellouts, they're yelling all these things. And I immediately knew who the aggressors were. I immediately knew who, which side I did not want to be on. I wasn't picking sides, but I was like, Oh God, I stayed till the very end til the last person left because this was again first protest. I was like excited and talking to everyone. I got home and there are articles that are posted by the school newspaper by Toronto, Star about black people were, you know, called the n word. They were harassed. Someone brought dogs. Someone brought up. I was actually standing next to the person with the dogs. So when apparently brought dogs to chase off the black, black people complete lies, and that opened my eyes to like the media bias that didn't happen, not even close to being happening to happen.

Speaker 2:          29:48          So it blew my mind that they would lie about that. And then I personally messaged, uh, the leader of black lives matter instead, I'm disappointed girl. I was. They're like, what? Why are you doing this? And then I decided to start making videos because I said clearly they're getting the wrong information. The school literally things. Jordan Peterson was this Nazi that came and said I hate black people and women and transgenders and all of that. So I just thought no one's going to do it. I should do it. And then I started making videos, which was weird because I had to go to school the next day and then deal with it.

Speaker 1:          30:18          These people know what you, you put your ass on the line and it's paid off. Wait. So did. When you dim the black lives matter president, did she respond to you?

Speaker 2:          30:28          Yeah, she was wanting to me saying, I'm, I'm going to screenshot this, uh, to use against you in the future. Why don't you say it to my face? I still have it saved because I'm like, I, I'm gonna save this for the rest of my life. Yeah. The, the president, like the cofounder of black lives matter Toronto said she's gonna I should stay, stay to her face and she's going to use this against me. The future. Meanwhile, all I said was I was there. This was very inappropriate. Why are you telling lies or making black people feel like, you know, this is what actually happened. You're making students feel like that's why students feel like they're being oppressed because you're telling them. Sorry,

Speaker 1:          30:59          what? No, what do you think these people, and I don't mean just black lives matter in this case, but like this, this type of person at a university, whether it's from gender studies or whatever it is, you know, with all the identity politics stuff, what do you think they actually want in the end? Like if they were to get what they want, what is that?

Speaker 2:          31:20          That's what I don't understand is that they are obviously fakes because if they truly care about black liberation, there are policies that you could point to that you can probably fix and help the black community. And in Canada one of the things was a carding and that was actually immediately carding was gone. I'm in Toronto, Ontario. I'm not sure either the province or the city. Um, but that's the one thing where I was like, okay, random stops. I think that's something that you should be stopped and it's done in inner city neighborhoods and blah, blah, blah. Apart from that, it's like, okay, what else do you want? They want black professors. They want to police out of pride that's not helping black people. That's not changing their social economic status. So what do you, what is your goal? I really don't understand because it's. You don't care. I don't want to say I do care. I want to say like I'm, I have all the solutions, but I can tell you what to do. But they're telling people false solutions. They're telling them that we need all black professors to teach black people. But I don't know what their, what their goal is. I don't know if it's money. I guess I don't get it or you don't get it seriously.

Speaker 1:          32:22          Alright. So let's shift to Jordan Peterson a little bit because you are a student at the University of Toronto. That's where he's been teaching for many years. This whole kerfuffle over transgender person.

Speaker 2:          32:34          All his fault that the school is so like everyone's yelling at each other and hate each other. I blame him. What's the atmosphere like at the school? Actually he's not teaching there right now. We could obviously he's on tour and the book and the whole thing, but how has the atmosphere change then, do you think it's directly related to some of the stuff that he on earth? I think it has changed because there you can see the groups and when someone has a slightly right wing or. It's funny because the fact that they associate individualism and the fact that they associate thinking for yourself with being right wing, it's like, why would you want to do that? It should not be anyways. Why wouldn't you want to be right wing? Right, exactly. Exactly, like what? Yeah. Uh, so the, when you're a little bit more right wing, I guess they tend to say that, you know, you are a Jordan Peterson fan and you hate transgenders and blah blah blah, like there's a clear divide you can tell which side people are on.

Speaker 2:          33:26          Um, but I, yeah, I think it was bound to happen regardless and just again because of the trump presidency to like, can we just blame trump for everything? Yes. You're in America now in California too. So that's how I view it as kind of a necessary evil that he sort of got this stuff. I mean, again, it goes to what we were talking about earlier, like some of these people get these issues out there and then hopefully some goodness. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And um, I think the other thing is trump allowed people, like I said earlier, to think for themselves in the sense to understand that maybe not everything is how it seems. Maybe things that I'm learning is not exactly how it is and you know, I, you know, I may disagree with his politics because I'm a liberal in general. Um, but I do think that yeah, it was bound to happen and trump kind of shook things up and allow a lot more people are engaging in politics now, which is so exciting and also really scary at the same time.

Speaker 2:          34:23          Or is it that it, I mean that's it right there. I think just this morning I tweeted something out to that effect. It's like, wow, it's incredibly exciting. It doesn't mean things are going to be good. I actually, uh, I believe things actually are going to get better because there's so many cool new young people like yourself out there putting out ideas like I have hope, but yet doesn't mean that that's how it's gonna go. It might go the other way. But then the other thing is that because I'm the far left are scared that people are starting to do more research you to Google things. Nowadays they've started to, that's why they want to control google. Exactly. So now you can't find any information. You can only find there's. Yeah. But now they're changing definitions of things. So I mean the definition of racism is no longer individual.

Speaker 2:          35:08          It has to do with power plus privilege. So in other words, only white people can be racist towards minorities. Minorities cannot be racist towards white people. Um, they've also taken hold of the student unions and Jordan Peterson has talked about this a lot. I'm so sorry, what was the question that generally was about Jordan and being a student at University of Toronto that. So just keep going. Yeah. I just feel like I'm, the student unions are just influencing a lot of the students and they're influencing a lot of the events that are happening. They, they claim to speak on behalf of all students. So, and they claim that they're fighting against racism except they define it a different way. I was going to go against someone that says we're fighting against racism and sexism and every other buzzword that they can throw out there, you have to accept it. Um, and because they've changed the definition of racism, they've started to have events and there was a white privileged conference, which I actually did a video on at Ryerson University. Yeah. So that's the way that they're countering it. They're countering the facts with just, you know, all that alternative facts with their own, a BS, feminist studies ideas, I don't even know, but that's, I guess the way they're doing it. They're trying to influence students from schools, so then when they get out they can become more liberal.

Speaker 1:          36:18          So the things that Jordan talks about when he talks about the individual and when he talks about why the government shouldn't be able to talk, tell you what pronouns do you use, et Cetera, et cetera. You see these things as all directly related to everything else that you've been talking about here.

Speaker 2:          36:31          Yeah, no, for sure. And I think it's also about, um,

Speaker 1:          36:35          sorry I just blanked. We were at a Jordan event, that's where we met about a month ago in Toronto. And was it a white supremacists

Speaker 2:          36:45          man? I was stoned on my way out.

Speaker 1:          36:50          I mean, but were you surprised at all when you saw what type of girl and an interesting diverse young. I think most of them I've been telling people it's about 60 slash 40 male to female, but sometimes it's even closer to 50 slash 50.

Speaker 2:          37:03          Yeah, no, I think it's pretty diverse and I've gone to several events, political events, I guess where I look in the crowd, I'm like, wow, there's a lot of minorities here. There's women here, there's men here, there's everyone here, and sorry, where I where I blanked was the idea that you can't. You can't debate something. That's where that was the whole pd. I'm like ranting here so I can get you all excited because I was there so he has this effect on people, but the fact that you can't debate certain topic, the fact that you can debate whether or not we should use certain pronouns because they say, well, you're questioning my identity. You're questioning me as a person. My humanity. They turn it around and make it sound like you hate that person. And that's the thing is it's not like I agree with Peterson or I agree with the, you know, the students. I just want to hear both sides. That's all I'm asking for. Something. We can all make an informed conclusion, but they don't want you to hear both sides. They want you to hear their side and that is the only site you see what happened with Lindsay Shepherd as well, where she played a peterson debates where they're all sides and they don't want you to hear that. They only want you to hear their side. And that's where, that's one thing I hate the most is just the lack of discussion.

Speaker 1:          38:06          Yeah. So I'm glad you brought up Lindsey because that also is happening in Canada. That was at Wilfrid laurier university. Now there's a lawsuit that she's involved in and I suspect I read some of the initial brief. I mean, I think this thing is going to be a bloodbath diversity, um, but what does that say is happening in Canada in a larger way? I think you've kind of hit on this a little bit, like you guys are almost having like this, like trump hangover or something where, or even the black lives matter thing, like it didn't start in America as you said, race relations were different in Canada.

Speaker 2:          38:36          I would argue they're still great here. It doesn't for sure. Kevin Canadians are just nicer. Okay. Just generally you guys, you know, we've done two shows in Toronto and the shows were totally nice and pleasant, but like we've gone to some other cities where, and I find it's usually in the progressive cities, so it's been in San Francisco and it's been in Seattle and a couple of the others where the crowds are the craziest most rockets, which is what I like those because they kind of, they need his message. Toronto, you guys were very pleasant, very pleasant. Think we're getting to a point where we need his message. I think it's getting a little scary, especially with a trudeau our prime minister, he's kind of going to a lot of the social justice warrior and um, the fact that he's even, you know, talking to black lives matter Toronto, who know the leader, one of the leaders said she wants to kill a white man.

Speaker 2:          39:27          She tweeted that she wished she could kill all white men and the other one actually stole $300,000 from my student union, stole it and said that she on her last day, she filed her overtime and she's filed thousands of hours of overtime and said $300,000 worth of one of our entire budget of our student unions by a third and here's the best part of it. She files that. Obviously there's alerts that go off. You can't take that much money for what are your student union president? $300,000. Sure. There aren't that many hours in the day, but here's the thing. She claimed that the majority of those hours come from work that she does for the black community for like black lives matter. That doesn't count. No one is asking you that's not affiliated with the school. No one's asking you. Whatever you do at home has nothing to do with that.

Speaker 2:          40:13          I always. The school obviously said they wanted the money back. They try to sue her and they started a whole campaign saying, my university is anti black, and then they started to put posters up. They got gathered, a bunch of people saying that you're their only suing her because she's black. You stole $300,000. You took $300,000. Girl like, are you because you're a black, are you kidding me? Does that not even. Anyway, she, you know, they vandalized the student union. They have megaphones starts yelling, saying anti black racism happened to your hands. And it was just this whole ordeal. Like it's, Ugh, Gosh. Anyways, what have you found the best arguments to get people your age to wake up to some of this stuff? Like, I know obviously they're watching your videos, probably your, your prime way of doing it, but if you found simple arguments, simple phrases or whatever that you can use to get some people out of this.

Speaker 2:          41:03          Everything can be explained away through a social economic standpoint. A lot of the issues that the black community faces because they're poor, which is the same issues that poor white community space as well. And, um, I, I, you know, there examples of black Americans and Black Canadians that do, do well to do well and uh, you have to look at why they're doing well. Okay. So they have higher education, you know, there's, they're both parents at home. There were all these different factors to look at it and then it's like, oh, so it's not just the color, my skin, it's either choices or I make or the area I'm in, the surroundings I'm in or the school I went to rather than just, it's the color of my skin. Um, but I think you just have to break it down to that before a lot of people can understand where I'm coming from and why they think a certain way. Um, it's just, it's easy to just to say, well, it's because I'm black and I'm not doing as well. It's, no, there's, there's so many different ways to explain it.

Speaker 1:          41:56          How do you rub up all the stuff that they might say about you? Because I have enough friends that are black conservatives or, or are kind of liberal, whatever you want to call it, that the things that I see good that gets said about them all time. Every time Larry elder comes and does my show and I look on twitter, the things that. The things that's the suppose ID tolerant people, right? The progressives, the lefties that they say about this man who I know is being authentic. Well,

Speaker 2:          42:20          it's ridiculous. I mean I get a lot of hate comments where it's, you know, they'll call me coon. They say hate myself. I want to be white. All these different things. It's the one part is like me speaking this way or speaking, I guess I don't want to say proper English per se, but I'm trying to be white. I'm trying to be something I'm not and it's like, why are you fitting people a race in a group? You're just allowing white people just to say, well, black people are just dumb because it means saying we all act the same way and we should all think the same way. That means you can. Every black person can be explained with one statement. That's not fair. It let us all be individuals. In fact, you should be fighting for us to be individuals and have our own ideas.

Speaker 2:          42:56          Why are we trying to form groups? And then they wonder why, why there's all these like white supremacist groups forming up because you've already. It's a sites thing. You said there's our side and there's your side through like, okay, sure, we'll form a group I guess and go against you. Um, but yeah, I mean I don't, a lot of the hate comments are just useless. I ignore the epithets, but I do try to understand a lot of the criticism and again, it's just not understanding where I'm coming from. It's not, you know, getting their stocks from the right place, the root.com or onion is not somewhere to get your facts right, but that you compare those. But when I, um, you know, get into a detailed discussion with a lot of them, then they understand where I'm coming from and it's like there's this light that shines.

Speaker 2:          43:38          And they do that at my school a lot as well. At where someone that absolutely hates me, I spend a whole day talking to them and at the end I call it like it's really awful to use this conversion therapy or to say that we're not electrocuting no, but by the end of it it's like their minds are blown because they just believed everything. Black lives matter said everything the mainstream left media have said, so it's. I think it's just you just got to talk to them. They don't want to talk. They're stuck in an echo chamber. This

Speaker 1:          44:06          intersectionality in this combining of perceived depressions, something that will just sort of crap out under its own weight. So like for example, if you're going to keep saying, well black people should or this minority, whatever that minority is, should get easier entrance to this or access to this or whatever. What you're actually saying is while other people are going to have to be punished based on their immutable characteristics, we see this now. I mean, I see a massive happening with the Asian community right now in America because by every metric that we judge success, they are succeeding at extremely high levels because of hard work and education and commitment to family. But if you're going to start saying, well, we're going to have to take less of them because we have to take more of other people. You're actually setting these groups to hate each other. Yeah. That is so deep.

Speaker 2:          44:50          Exactly. And you're telling one group that they can't do it on their own. And um, there is some studies, I forgot who it was who wrote it, but it was called the mismatch theory, which is, um, a lot of the minority students are getting thrown in. Universities are not qualified, actually turn out worse when they come out. They don't get jobs because they don't have the actual skills that they needed to get in. But yeah, it creates this kind of tension. Why would you tell someone that, you know, there are more important just because of the color of your skin. It's going to piss other people off. Um, it's, I don't think that's a way to move forward. I don't think that's a way to progress, but yeah, and the whole intersectionality thing, it's, it's ridiculous. The Pride Parade, I guess in Toronto is an example of that. It's like my issues are more important. And then obviously the Lgbtq community, they all hated that and they were all very upset with it because it's like pride is one of the most inclusive events in the, in the city. Why are you trying to ruin it and say this is a black thing. It's an everybody thing. We're, we're all advocating for everyone here. So it's, it's, they're just going to go into ruined themselves that they keep adding.

Speaker 1:          45:49          So speaking of that, I saw the thing that you did, you were not happy when they put the black and brown stripes into the rainbow flag, which I also thought was completely ridiculous. The whole point is that this is for everybody. We're not looking at all your differences.

Speaker 2:          46:03          Racist. Yeah. But reverse segregation, I really don't get it. The white privilege conference advising university, that's reversed segregation and I actually gave them the benefit of the doubt. I'm like, I'm going to ignore the name, I'm going to actually try to see what they're trying to teach. And ultimately the end, the conclusion of this event was listen to people, listen to what people are saying. So anecdotes only listened to people's feelings. So it's like, that's not how you form a society. It's the majority were white women. They were just sitting there hearing black people tell them, just listen to our stories because we know and we experience it and you know you have to have a black spaces. In fact, there is someone that tweeted during the event saying, I'm a woman just rose her hand to speak while white splaining wait for the for later where we have our white corner so we can talk about, you know, art, what is this? What kind of society are we preparing herself for? It's literally reversed segregation, segregation in the true sense of the word. And I, yeah, I really don't. What,

Speaker 1:          47:03          what do you make of the guilty white allies? Those people, you know, when I've had a, I know you met Bret Weinstein from evergreen and heather, his wife, I'm one of the things that fascinated me most when he was going through the ordeal there was that he said he never feared the black students physically or the brown students or whatever it was. The, it was the white allies he said that had this sort of look in their eye, like they, the ones that could get violent and I've seen that, that look, what do you make of that data?

Speaker 2:          47:35          He treated because it's hard to. Because there, if you're not black then. I mean they're trying to explain it. If you're not black then you don't experience it, then you don't understand it. So as a white ally you have to just take everything, you know, an activist says to you as fat as this is what is happening. I'm one of the speakers actually, he did an interview for the Toronto Star and they asked him and that was like, okay, what? Where do you see white privilege in Toronto? And he said literally, I mean I'm paraphrasing, but he said when you walk into a store, black people or black people have to think about the fact that people are watching them. Okay, sure. I was like, fine, whatever. But apparently black people have to pay for items in one section before they can move to another section so they don't get accused of stealing.

Speaker 2:          48:18          That's his, his. He got a chance to tell us what white privilege is. And that was his example of white privilege. Is that happening? And no, I've never. It's never happened. I've worked retail for like the most of my life. What you're going to pay the kids section before you go to the men's section. Like what world is this guy living in my mind and another one did an article where it's how the outdoors is racist and how people feel like the, you know, skiing and hiking and everything is a white space and therefore black people don't want to go to it. And it's like, who you're saying it, you were the one that are making these claims. Why are we there? It's just more division. It's more like, it just, it pisses me off.

Speaker 1:          48:56          Yeah. You know what? Because you're visiting La for a couple of days, I don't have a ton of time, but maybe we could go on a quick hike and see what happens.

Speaker 2:          49:03          Black woman, but it just like, you're obviously don't care about the betterments of the black community because he wouldn't be talking about these non issues here in the stage. You can talk about, you know, uh, sorry, how old the education system works. You can talk about the war on drugs. You can talk about the prison system, but yet the amount of people they got to protest the Trayvon Martin shooting. If you can get that many people to protest the war on drugs, you can probably make a change. But no, they're going to focus on police shootings is one of the least things that are actually affecting black Americans. But yet that's what they want to put their focus on.

Speaker 1:          49:40          So how much of the root of that is just lazy thinking. Like it's easy to get people genned up about a shooting per se, and I'm not, I'm not diminishing that are wrong. Obviously it's easier to take all of the anecdotal stuff. The woman at the shopping center who this happened to you or that. Yeah, it's always easier to do that than to really be like, let's really look at the prison systems, which I would be for looking. Yeah. I would be figuring out ways that we can do better education to minority communities that have been neglected. All of those things, but those things aren't really sexy. They're not like the things that get people out on the streets for more than a day. It's the other stuff. So part of this is just human nature, right?

Speaker 2:          50:20          Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I, I can base all my arguments on anecdotes, but that doesn't like, that means nothing to me. I can say, oh well this one day I've lived in Toronto all my life and I've never experienced racism. I'm not going to use that as facts, but yeah, but it's so much easier to do so it's so much easier to play with the heartstrings and say like, this is what's really happening, but it's just, it's just sad that there are actual policies that can be changed or put in place that could actually uplift the black community, but you know, none of the people that are claimed to be the activist care and especially the celebrities, which really annoys me beyond seeing Jay z, all they do is talk about, you know, black rights and blah blah. Why don't you use your billion dollars to, you know, create some rehabilitation center for people that are getting out of prison.

Speaker 2:          51:01          Why don't you try to fight for the war on drugs? Like it's all these things where it's, it's. Yeah, it's, it's easy just to say, oh look, there's a shooting, you know, this is what black people experience every day and you know, white people are racist. The end. No, it's, there's, I don't know, it's easier for them to just to say, look at this anecdote and this shooting and that's what's affecting us. But there's so many other things that could be done. A little bit of my appearance, a university, New Hampshire when those kids were. Oh yeah, that one woman who, I don't think it was a student, I think she was either a mother of a student or, or 10 advisors. And when she kept saying, you know, these kids pointing to the black kids could get shot when they walk out of here. She's talking about a university of New Hampshire.

Speaker 2:          51:41          And it's like, I actually, that was one of the only moments where I didn't know what to say because it's so crazy to say that like, you're not going to be shot and you walk out of here. And I think I maybe said something to that effect. But like, it's like that's really dangerous, that line of thinking. I totally agree. And I was actually having a headline to a comedy club the other day and there's this guy on stage. He was like typical inner city black youth or whatever. And uh, he, after he had stopped, he came to sit at my table. Everyone was gone and he made a comment saying, wow, it was really hard to be a black woman in this country and this is again, this is Canada. I feel like there's no excuses for Canada. Like, get Outta here. And they asked him, okay, how?

Speaker 2:          52:21          And he's just like, I don't know, it's just, it's really hard to be a woman in black. I'm like, yeah, I get the whole woman thing because you know, men are physically bigger and blah blah blah. Um, but why is it hard for me to be black in, in Toronto specifically? And he was like, you know, cause, you know, it's just white privilege. I'm like, no, no, no. Give me two reasons. Give me concrete reasons could not come up with one because there isn't. You can't come up with when you have to use the anecdotes, you have to use the, you know, if you walk out the street, you're going to get shot. Why? What are the statistics of people that get shot by police? Oh seven get shot by police per year. And it's not recorded by race and it's also doesn't tell us if they're armed or unarmed, seven people and you're telling me you're more likely to walk out the door as a black person get shot. That's not an epidemic. It's an epidemic. The crime in black communities, that's an epidemic. But you want to ignore that and just talk about the other. Yeah. Anecdote that pull at the heartstrings and make people feel guilty and oh, it's a waste of time. It's such a waste of time. But what do your parents think about what you're doing? Well, they are conservative so they love it. So what makes you not conservative with. So if someone was to say you're, you're conservative. I watch your videos, talk about conservatism

Speaker 1:          53:26          is not that bad, blah, blah blah. Why would you not say you're sort of putting aside the exhaustion of labels.

Speaker 2:          53:33          Okay. Well I will say I'm fiscally conservative. So I guess I do believe in like lower taxes in some sense. I do believe in the free market. I do believe in, you know, less regulations, all that fun stuff. But at the same time, I do think that there should be some sort of social safety net and uh, you know, living in Canada where there is no, I'm sorry, free health, not free healthcare, universal healthcare and you know, at the universal education, the education system is amazing. The funding for the education system is amazing. It. So stuff like that where I think I'm a little bit more liberal where I do think the government should help in some way, but it's because I'm used to it. It's what I grew up with and I haven't really seen anything different and it works, works fine. So I guess that. And I'm pro choice. Um, so stuff like that where I really do stand firm in my liberal views and ideas and then, yeah, I'm fiscally conservative.

Speaker 1:          54:24          Yeah. Well we're pretty much aligned. Finally found somebody. Now we can go out hiking or we can start beating people. Exactly. I don't know what we're supposed to be. Once you find an ally, then you start attacking other people. I think that's how it works. Something like that. Where do you want to go with all this? I've seen, I've seen your channel grow, I think obviously, you know, having you here, it'll, it'll help boost your profile a little bit. You can go into politics. What are you going to do? Prime Minister of Canada, take out that Trudeau guy with his fancy socks. What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          54:53          Oh Gosh. Um,

Speaker 1:          54:55          or maybe maybe Peterson will do it, but you could probably be in his cabinet.

Speaker 2:          54:58          Yeah, definitely. Sorry. Well, I'm enjoying what I'm doing now and I'm quite surprised that people even enjoy watching my videos. It's like it's cool to do something you love and people like it as well. Like I really am having fun doing it and I think I would probably go into politics later in life. I mean I am doing political science. It has to be useful somewhere. I've been toying around with law, but again, I'm not sure if I really want to be in, you know, the whole. I don't know if I want to deal with law school, but, and I am starting actually a podcast with my boyfriend, which I will be uploading very soon. Nice. Yeah. Uh, the way we should tell people, still find out otherwise your boyfriend is white, right into it means you could have potentially children who look black. They might look white. Look, a little bit of both. You've talked about that a little bit. It doesn't really matter to you. No, of course not. No. Uh, yeah. My boyfriend being white has been used as like an attack against me saying like, wow, look at you. What did they say? Sleeping with the devil or something like that. And it's just,

Speaker 1:          56:02          it seems like a decent fella. He's a great guy playing Nintendo.

Speaker 2:          56:06          No, he's a great guy. But again, it's, it's the whole idea of why are you creating more a divisiveness and then saying you want equality. Why are you saying a black woman being with a white man is bad? And then say, wow, white people are mean to me. Like you either want equality or you don't. You either want individuality or you don't pick one. You can't have both. You can't. I'm sorry. But yeah. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm not 100 percent sure where exactly I will be in the next five years. I'm having fun with what I'm doing now. I work for the National Post, which I absolutely love. Um, and then I have the podcast coming, so that's what I'm going to do for now. And maybe I might get into politics, but. Oh, it's so messy. The fact that you even are go in that far right now.

Speaker 2:          56:48          You're doing it. Oh God. I hate to tell you. I can see it now. Exciting. I'll have somebody to support and care. You know what you get. You do something in Canada where you run and you become something. Mayors, something you want to do. I will consider moving all my tickets. I will give you, if you can pull it off, it will be a big freaking test. See what happens. Definitely. You think I do. Okay. There are white guy. Oh No, I'm sorry. You're done. You're done. You're done for it. You're going to have to start giving me like half of your page is because you know, racism and stuff. Yeah. But I think one thing that I would actually probably liked to do, which I probably will not be able to, but uh, to do a lot of work in inner city communities because I, I, I don't want to say I've lived through it, but I understand what's going on there.

Speaker 2:          57:36          I understand that, you know, there's a high crime understand that in some neighborhoods the schools aren't as good for Canada, it's a little different. But I'd like to do some work there where I can kind of tell them, hey, I got out and here's what I did to get out. And you can do it too. There's so many. There's opportunities there for you. Like if you were poor minority child right now, please just try your hardest at school, get an education. It's literally one of the greatest opportunities that you can have. And you're more likely. I mean, you're probably not a hundred percent grade, but you're more likely to be successful if you get an education. And that's the one thing a lot of black people are lacking is the education components. And um, you know, we don't really have like the war on drugs and everything, so it really is weird for me that in the inner cities of Toronto where there's still this very high crime, there's still this tension.

Speaker 2:          58:22          Um, but, you know, have you ever heard of the Woodson Center by any chance? It's a nonprofit organization that's located in DC, but I've been working with them for some time and they basically do the same thing. They go out to these neighborhoods and they help students and they have such a good success rate. They held them in high school because that's the other thing is that a lot of black kids are not even graduating high school. Of course they're going to go into crime if you're not even graduating high school. Um, so yeah, they work with a lot of students there. They have rehabilitation centers, they help, you know, a black, sorry, black Americans reintegrate into society. Like it's stuff like that where it's these root movements that I really liked to do. And I know it's a, it's a big dream, but I think that's where it would probably be happiest is where I can show people how it's done and help them and hopefully everyone can copy that and say, Oh, this is what we're supposed to do and all of that. But awesome. I love it and I have no doubt that you're going to do it. And you guys can follow this future member of Canadian parliament on her youtube channel right here. It's youtube.com/.
