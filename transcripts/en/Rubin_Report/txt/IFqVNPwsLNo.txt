Speaker 1:          00:00:02       We

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       spend a lot of time talking about the left around here, but this week we're going to be diving into the right. My guest is conservative radio talk show host, lawyer and writer Larry Elder. Larry has written several books on conservative principles with a focus on government and racial issues. Much of his work is very similar actually to the ideas we talk about here on the Rubin report, including religion, the role of government and personal responsibility. According to his biography, Larry uses facts and common sense to arrive at his conclusions. That sounds familiar right now. If I use those same precepts as a liberal, can we both be right at the same time? Can both be wrong? Is the answer somewhere in the middle? Well, that's exactly what we're going to try to find out. As I discussed with Don Lemon last week, the media talks so much about the left right divide in this country that it's easy to forget that there are decent people on both sides of the debate.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       This is one of the reasons I've taken the left to task so much on this show. The further off the deep end they go, the less we'll be able to find compromise with people we disagree with. Just because I may have different views on abortion than Republicans, doesn't mean that they hate all women. Just because I may have different views than Republicans on guns doesn't mean that there are a bunch of rednecks and just because Republicans aren't for legalizing marijuana doesn't mean they aren't fun to hang out with. All right, well that one might be true, but I think you see my point. Maybe the best way to start a conversation about political ideology is to actually define the terms. This is something I've done with a few guests so far because I often think we're all talking about different things while using the same words.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       Fear not. I have Google and according to the Oxford Dictionary, here's the definition of conservatism. Conservatism is the holding of conservative principles. The tendency to resist great or sudden change, especially in politics, adherence to traditional values and ideas sometimes opposed to liberalism. Alright, so I think we have a nice jumping off point there. Basically, conservatives aren't big on change and when they are, they want to go about it slowly. I think this concept has been conflated with the concept of right wing politics, so I even googled that. According to the concise Oxford Dictionary of politics in liberal democracies, the political right opposes socialism and social democracy, right wing parties include conservatives, Christian Democrats, classic liberals, nationalists, and the far right racists and fascist. You can see how these two concepts have morphed into the Republican Party. In America, we have an ideology that doesn't want to change the system to quickly coupled with a political affiliation that is focused on economics and some level of moral authority.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       Interestingly, classical liberals are also included in that group and the more and more I've been talking about this stuff, the more I've been considering myself in that category. I'm going to touch on that more in the next couple of weeks. Now that we've laid out some basic terms, I think we have a solid jumping off point to discuss all the issues of the day from abortion to economics, to foreign policy to guns. Can we find out where we agree instead of just yelling over each other? I think we can, but the only way is to be brave enough to talk to those we don't actually agree with. If we refuse to talk to those that we don't see eye to eye with, we'll just end up taking an eye for an eye.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       My guest this week is a lawyer, a writer, and host of the aptly named Larry Elder radio show. Larry, has it gone on a great day. Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. Yeah. Thanks for coming in. I've been trying to make this happen with you for awhile. Dodge darts and you forever caught up with me. I. I gotcha. I gotcha. You've been in this studio before. I have a guest hosted for Larry a couple times. Larry King or a king that's. That's a Larry Man. He has a thing and it's kind of for the full hour. Yeah, he can. He can only have people with the name. Larry, I guess those words. So that worked out for you. So there's a lot of stuff I want to talk about it and in, in the beginning of the show I set up that I am a liberal or conservative condolence. This time this show is over, we can move you to the center a little bit and maybe by the time the show's over weekend, it's not gonna that's not at that, but that's what it's all about.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       That's why I've wanted to have you on the show because I find there are some people in the public space that I disagree with, but that I'd like to sit down and talk about some of the ideas and I consider you in that, in that case. Um, but before we get to the politics, I liked the audience, know a little bit about the history of the people I'm talking about. So can you just, I know you were born in La, give me a little larry elder history. Born and raised in La. My Dad was a janitor. He cleaned toilets. Uh, uh, my dad was born in Athens, Georgia. Doesn't know who his mother, his father, his rather, um, uh, my name's elder was a name with some dude who's in his life the longest. Uh, my father was kicked out of his house and was 13 years old by his irresponsible grandmother and was on his own from that point on, on my mom.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       Grew up on a farm kind of aristocracy for, for a black woman. She, uh, owned the farm. They owned the farm. Anyway, my dad and my mom got together and moved to California in the forties. I have two brothers. Uh, I am, as you mentioned, a lawyer, uh, born and raised in La and went to college in the East Coast Law School in the Midwest, state in Ohio for about 17 years. Came back to la about 22 years ago. Got Into TV and radio and I've been doing it ever since. There you go. All right. So now we got. We got the meat of what do you do that you're not a practicing lawyer, right? Negative. No, I did it for two and a half, three years and that was it. I find a lot of people in the public space either were lawyers at one time or I know there's a ton of comedians that were lawyers.

Speaker 2:          00:05:32       What is it about lawyers? A lot of them want to get out. What's that about? I'm not sure that's true. Um, is just a real flexible thing to do. You learn how to reason. You learn about the law. You learned about the constitution. If you're a trial lawyer, you learn how to think on your feet and it lends itself to doing other things. But most people I know who went to law school, at least the ones I went to law school with a state and the law. Yeah. So was that a perfect segue to get you to be someone that talks for a living? Like instead of having to

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       litigate it in the courtroom, you could litigate it on air and bounce back and forth with people. And that's right. Although most lawyers are not trial lawyers. It's kind of the image of most lawyers is that their Glib and fast. Most lawyers sit behind a desk and fill out papers. There are tax lawyers or, or constitutional lawyers or contract lawyers or something like that. Only about 10 percent of lawyers, uh, ended up going to becoming litigated. And even a smaller number of those actually try cases. Yeah. Alright. So now let's talk about conservatism. Let's do it. So I've mostly been calling out the left on my show because I consider myself part of the left and I've seen the left sort of really go off the deep end to the left and I haven't been happy about it. So I haven't talked that much about the right.

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       I've had a couple of people on the right. So first off, uh, how would you define conservatism? What do you think that even means at this point in America in 2016? What is it considered? Well, I don't mind being called a conservative maturity. I don't pretend to be a four letter word, but I really call myself a libertarian a, I believe in article one, section eight of the constitution, which gives the federal government a small number of things to do. Dave meant money. Uh, put together an army. I'm a deal with the border is a handful of other things. That's it. A welfare, uh, health care, abortion, same sex marriage, Dr Sisto, suicide, all the social issues that the supreme court takes up in my view, they shouldn't take up in the first place. That should be done on a state by state basis. That's what I think most conservatives believe as well.

Speaker 3:          00:07:22       So I'm with you on a lot and I definitely have some libertarian beliefs myself. I think most people are libertarian. They just don't know it. The founding fathers were Libertarians, the founding fathers drafted a document that said our rights come from a power other than individuals and government doesn't give us our rights. We give government our rights and power and everything else should be left to the states and to individuals. So that's how the constitution would start it. That's how the country was started. And I think that's how most Americans really feel, uh, when they really think about it. Well, that's one of the funny things to me and why I've defended somebody like rand Paul, who's a lot of people would say as a liberal, I shouldn't be defending, he's libertarian, but he's a libertarian, so on issues such as a legalizing marijuana or gay marriage, a libertarian because you don't want the government in your bedroom, you shouldn't care about these issues.

Speaker 3:          00:08:08       And as a liberal, I want people to do what they want and marry who they want. So that's somewhere where a libertarian and the liberal can really sort of joined together, right? I think so. However you have people like Bill Maher running around calling himself a libertarian. Bill Maher is not a libertarian. He believes in higher taxes. He believes in a minimum wage. He supported a Ralph Nader for, for government who wants to take over businesses and have government run them. Uh, so a lot of people use it because it's the sexy kind of term and have no idea what it is. Right? So that's the economic side of it. So you, you're sort of, he's liberal on the social stuff and in, in a way as a conservative, you're, you're actually pretty liberal on the concern on the social stuff. Again, I believe that same sex marriage, doctor assisted suicide, all these kinds of things, abortion should be done on a state by state basis in California.

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       We had to, uh, um, opportunities to vote for or against a same sex marriage, a proposition 30 and another time when we voted on, I think it was called, um, uh, issue eight, measure eight. And in both cases I voted in favor of same sex marriage in both cases I was overruled. I have no problem with the idea that the majority of my fellow Americans, uh, or our fellow Californians did not agree with me. I don't believe that I then go to the Supreme Court and cram it down their throats of the other states. Right. Okay. So then that's, that's the state's rights issue and sort of. So you would say that the Supreme Court is legislating from the bench or something to that effect? Yeah, I wouldn't. Yeah. And that, so, so you're basically okay with what happened, you just don't like how it had. Correct. Yeah. So someone like Rand Paul, uh, because it sounds like you have a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:09:40       Do we are supporting? Not, no, I'm not. No, I don't. I don't, I don't like Rand Paul because of his position on foreign affairs and defense. A lot of libertarians and I don't think being a libertarian leads you to being an isolationist, although most libertarians are for reasons that I think are kind of confusing, but a rand Paul is one of those guys who attacked George W Bush for the Iraq war. I think we were justified in going there. I think that the reason for going there were legitimate and I think a lot of liberals are hypocritical on this issue to. You talked about how you, you chastise people on the left for being hypocrites. I'll give you one big one. The argument against the Iraq war is that George W dot Bush foolishly wanted to impose our values on another, uh, another culture, uh, had no idea what the aftermath would be if we get rid of this bad guy.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       Right. However, Obama comes into office, he joined with the British and the French in bombing Libya. Getting rid of Qaddafi. Why W he threatened us? No, they did. So for humanitarian, uh, civil rights reasons read recently at a debate was asked about why she did that. She said, well, uh, so they can have free elections. Where was the left? Same thing with regard to, to Egypt. We get rid of Mubarak. He was a thug, but they're all thugs. The Muslim Brotherhood comes in there, uh, and Obama backs them, um, and, and the country is worse than it was before. And then a.now backing the guy that took over after the genocide for reasons that escape me, Obama decided, saw it had to go. Yeah. Why these, these countries did not threaten us. The way, in my opinion, erected a Irak was a deal after the, after nine slash 11, 90 percent of the American people believe that we're going to get hit again.

Speaker 3:          00:11:14       Uh, and this guy was stealing from the oil for food program. He was, uh, he was, uh, uh, uh, interfering with our patrolling the southern didn't no fly zones. Uh, he had used chemical weapons on his own people we know that because it used them on the Iranians. They used them on the Kurds. Uh, he tried to assassinate George Herbert Walker Bush. Uh, he was a threat, uh, and like it or not, at least we had a legitimate reason for going there. And he got the backing of both the house and the Senate. Obama did, did, did Egypt, and he did Libya and he did a, uh, Syria without the backing of Congress. And yet the left didn't say a damn thing. Right. So, yeah. So I'm, I'm with you on the hypocrite part because I listen, I was, there's plenty of video. I was against the Libya thing because at the very least, at the very, very least, if we're going to have a military action, we should have congressional approval.

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       Right? So then the, instead of calling it a war, they called it a kinetic military action. And beyond that, uh, uh, Libya did not pose a threat to us. He had no WMD because he gave them up after we went into the war in Iraq. He was scared. Belief plus he gave up the WMD and not the United Nations. He gave it to us if they're under lock and key, uh, in Tennessee as we speak. So what was the rationale and where was the left? The same people yelling and screaming about George W dot Bush and Dick Cheney and neo-cons and, and nation building. Where were they? They didn't say anything. It's hypocritical. Yeah. Well, listen, we don't have congressional authorization right now. So I would assume by a lot of standards on the left, Obama is probably a gun to them, right? If they, if they're being consistent but they're not.

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       So. But what was the actual threat? I mean, so I'm with you on some of this in terms of that we all sort of pick our sides and then our. Our value suddenly changed depending on who's in power, but what, what do you think your principals you, you don't do that and I'd write it myself to be a principal. I, I consider myself to be principled as well, so I. everything that I've said in the past related to all this stuff still still stands up, but what was the actual threat from Iraq? Look, I know that that Saddam did horrible things and you've laid out a couple of them, but what? What was the actual threat? And George W dot Bush properly said that they were a grave and gathering danger after nine slash 11. Ninety percent of the American people thought we were going to get hit again and thought that he was going to be bigger than nine slash 11.

Speaker 3:          00:13:24       So George W Bush looks around and says, where are the threats? We were still technically at war against it. I was saying we went to war against him in 1991 and he promised to fully and thoroughly declare his, his chemical and biological weapons he failed to do so he violated resolution after resolution after resolution, and we feared that he would either use them himself or give them to a terrorist and use them against us and make 9:11, looked like a picnic. That was a threat. We gave him 15 months to turn over this stuff and he refused to do it. Uh, a Bush went to the ninth and it did turn out that there were no nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Actually, I disagree with that as well. I believe the weapons were there. We gave him 15 months to thoroughly declare what he did in that 15 months.

Speaker 3:          00:14:03       In my opinion, he got rid of it. And I'm not the only person that's said that. Dave the, um, the national intelligence director, our top spy, his name is James Clapper. He's an office right now under Obama, has publicly said he believes that Saddam Hussein did in fact have stockpile for WMD, got rid of them in the, during the 15 month run up to the war. The, uh, Israeli Mossad feels the same way. And there's several other American officials that have said that. So I don't believe George W Bush got the intelligence wrong. We have 16 intelligence agencies. All 16 said at the highest level of probability that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. Obama had the same CIA director who served under Bill Clinton, George Tenant. He said the likelihood that Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons and biological weapons was a slam dunk. And the same people that call up George W Bush a moron when he wanted him to go.

Speaker 3:          00:14:49       So all 16 of you guys say that he's this stuff and you say you've got to George. I just not feeling it, so I'm not going to do it, but he's a moron. So would you say that this is one of the cases that part of the problem, and I think this is a through line through everything we're going to discuss for the next hour, is that I don't know who to believe anymore. That's become a thing. So James Clapper, who you just mentioned, he's the same guy, the same CIA director who sat in front of Congress and said that we're not spying on Americans remember, and he was scratching the top of his head because as they say in Seinfeld, when you're lying, you touch the higher up you touch on your face and the bigger the lie is, and he's great. And he says, we're not wittingly spying on the American public.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       We now know that that wasn't what he said was, I gave the least untruthful answer I could give, but later on he admitted it. And so to me, as far as I'm concerned, he's. He's legitimately honest guy. Well I guess he gave the least honest answer. He least untruthful and least untruthful. But it wasn't I guess I guess. But it wasn't truthful. Well, it was classified. It was classified. He wasn't supposed to talk about it, but. All right, so without, without getting too caught up in the words though, but do you think that's part of the problem that we just don't know who to believe anymore? I don't believe our government officials. We barely believe the media. Well, I have my own issues with government, but my thing, my problem with the Iraq war is that Republicans failed to say what I've said and defended. Even Jeb Bush is not defended that properly.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       He was asked when he first started running. What do you think about the rack? Wah, Wah, Wah. But I, I mean, honestly, if you can't even defend what your brother did, how can other people do it? So I think Americans have forgotten why we went there at one time, 73 percent of the American people's support at this war. You have to remind people of why you've, why you've gone to war and remind people what the reasons are and people have forgotten it. Now they have this vague idea that George w Bush overreacted and, and went in there and depose somebody because he just didn't like him. Uh, and uh, that's why we were there and let's not do that anymore. That's kind of how people have given the cliff notes version of what happened and it's unfair. So what would you say to the people that would argue that isis wouldn't exist right now if we hadn't toppled sit down because he at least had for all the horrible things he was doing in the bath party.

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       We're doing terrible things and they were executing people and throwing gays off roofs and uh, you know, using mustard gas on the courage and all that stuff, but at least he was keeping a sort of lid on the actual craziness that we're seeing right now. Um, my, my problem with that is that we don't know what Saddam Hussein would have done had we not gone there, even though we didn't find the stockpiles. There were two people that George W Bush sent to find the stockpiles. One was named David k, the other was named chuck doll for both of them said we didn't find any stockpiles. We screwed up. However, this guy was going to reconstitute his WMD program and reconstitute his nuclear program. When the heat was off, so we would have had a dope deal with him. Anyway. The second thing I say is that President Obama pulled out all the truth because he ran in 2008 and said the Iraq war was a dumb war.

Speaker 3:          00:17:36       We never should've gone there. Over the advice of Hillary as secretary of state over the advice of his secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, over the advice of his former secretary of defense, Robert Gates, over the advice of the joint chiefs. He pulled out all the troops. He was warned, if you do this, there'll be a vacuum. He did it. Anyway. Ray Odierno is a member of the joint chiefs. He just retired and he gave a speech when he retired and he was asked if he. Does he believe that we should have left people there? He says, yes. Have we done so? I said, it could have been dealt with, so in my opinion, however you feel about it, when Obama walked in, inherited this mess, he should have made it better and not worse. He made it worse. So in a way you're, so you're sort of blaming both sides, right in that, in that, or I guess I would blame both sides.

Speaker 3:          00:18:18       I want put words in your mouth. I would blame both sides here and that we went to the wrong war and then by Obama leaving the way he did, even though most of the Americans very clearly didn't want to be there anymore and when he ran for president seven years ago that his whole thing was, we're going to get out as soon as possible, but that then created the breeding ground for this because we didn't leave in a in a sorta. I'll go halfway with you. We didn't go into the wrong war. Went to the right war for the right reasons. I think the intelligence was good and I think the problem was when Obama came in, he wanted to get out so quickly that he did not realize what the aftermath would be. And I'm not the only one who said this. Robert has written a book scathing attack, the most scathing attack on a sitting commander in chief by a former member of cabinet member I've ever read, and he even recently, just a few days ago, Dave said that Obama's national security and foreign policy advisors are dangerously naive.

Speaker 3:          00:19:08       They see the world through this prism that they want, which is why the Benghazi thing happened. The reason that mid godly thing happened as Obama's running in 2012 a GM is dead. A GM is alive. Osama bin Laden is dead and Qaeda is on the run. Therefore, Ben Gazi was not thoroughly defendant because they thought that the Libyans were happy with us because we got rid of Gaddafi. Yeah. Uh, and so, at least in my opinion, the Obama Administration sees the world through their prism of this ridiculous idea that if we are nicer to people and reach out with an unclenched fists, they will reach out in kind. The world doesn't work that way. We have bad people who hate us and we need to deal with it. Right? So I'm with you on that part for sure. Because look, if you think back to the big speech that Obama gave in Cairo, which was the, everyone said, this is the reset, this is the, we're going to be different.

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       We're going to try to deal with people in region less with more with discussion. I mean the Middle East especially, but most of the world we were in more of a precarious place now than I don't think any part of the world is better off with Obama in a. and I think that you look at polls now, George W Bush left office, uh, in the, in the low thirties. I don't think any president has been that unpopular in my lifetime. You look at polls now, more people like George W Bush didn't like Obama. Obama's rating is at 45 percent. Bill Clinton's at this juncture in the seventh year of his term, he was at 65 percent. Most American believer on the wrong track economically. And most Americans believe we're on the wrong track in terms of foreign policy. Yeah. Alright. So I don't want to get too lost in, in just foreign policy. So last thing on this is a lot of what you're saying sort of sounds like neoconservative stuff to me is there, can you be a libertarian and a neoconservative?

Speaker 3:          00:20:42       I mean, I know this is what you're getting to before. This is sort of why you don't like Ran Paul, but do those things seemed like they have nothing to do with each other and yet I know that there's a lot of people that do sort of get what you're, what you're saying. Well, the term neoconservatives and to me as a four letter word is a term that people invent to, to malign somebodies position. I see the world realistically. I think we have enemies. We need to deal with them. Uh, I did not believe, as you did just now pointed out that we should have gone to war in, in Libya. I don't believe in doing anything unless it's consistent with our national security interests. When Jimmy Carter, for example, uh, through the Shah of Iran under the bus in the seventies, what was that all about?

Speaker 3:          00:21:17       He did it because he wanted freedom. He wanted to liberate the people who are behind bars, the same people we now call terrorists. Uh, these are the ones that Obama force the shaw to let out of prison and they ultimately topple the regime. What's that all about? It's not our job to impose democracy. It's our job to make sure that countries are not our enemies. Our countries are doing things that are consistent with our own national security interest. That, that's my problem. Right? So you don't want to nation build, you want to do things that you consider sort of defensive posture. Correct. We went into a, a, a Haiti I think during Bill Clinton's administration because they were having difficulties, not our job. Uh, I want to get this right. So I'm gonna. Look at my notes for this. According to this, uh, you are black, is that correct?

Speaker 3:          00:22:02       That is correct. Not African American. That's not a term I like you. How come you don't like the term as ridiculous? I was born and raised in America. I've never been to Africa. Uh, how, why am I an African American? Most of my people that have been here longer than most of other other people in this room, uh, yet most people don't have a hyphen. Uh, you know, I'm an Italian American, Greek American, Romanian American. It's an absurd term. It's a term that Jesse Jackson almost single handedly cram, cram down the throats of our media. And after Jackson began to talk about why a black should have some connection to Africa, all of a sudden New York Times, La Times, all of the media began using that expression. It's the excellence. Yeah. I mean, I personally don't use the term African American that much because one time I had a guest on the show and I referred to her is African American.

Speaker 3:          00:22:46       She said, well, I'm actually Jamaican. So, you know what I mean. So I guess that that goes to your point. And I remember reading one time, Dave, somebody, uh, uh, was given a description of some suspect who had done some crime, was running away, uh, and uh, he was described as an African American. How do you know where he was from? Goodman from Africa coming from Jamaica, from Canada. So what are they going, what, what do you make of that when someone like [inaudible] I know you really rail against Jesse Jackson and, and these guys on the left that use, and I want to talk a lot about identity politics. So the guys that use these phrases, what are they going for? Their. Well, their goal, the goal is to tell black people that were victims that uh, discrimination and racism remain major problems in America when in fact they don't, uh, and uh, they want black people to vote for the Democratic Party.

Speaker 3:          00:23:31       The Democratic Party gets a 95 percent of the black vote. Uh, and the reason they get it is because blacks are convinced that the number one issue facing the country right now is social justice, racist, white cops, uh, discrimination, systemic racism, microaggression, whatever, a new word that come up with and as a bunch of nonsense. And number one problem domestically facing this country is a breakdown of the family. And uh, President Obama said it, I didn't have a black kid or kid, not just the black kid. A kid raised without a dad is five times more likely to be poor and commit crimes nine times more likely to drop out of school and 20 times more likely to end up in jail. So you're far more likely to end up in jail without having a dad than you are because of a white racist cop. Right? So, but you wouldn't not acknowledge that there are some systemic issues.

Speaker 3:          00:24:14       And give me an example. Tell me what you think the most instamatic racist issue is. What is it? Well, I would say that because black people in most cases, in many cases we're descendants of slaves. That racism as a, as an institution that in 2000 a certain amount of it just exists. Two thousand and 15. That gives me the most blatant racist example you can come up with right now. Um, I think you could probably find evidence that in general cops or the cops are more willing to shoot if the perpetrator is black. What's your date of Nyu? What's your basis for saying that last year will look. I know a lot of people would say, look what's going on. And I know what they would say, I'm talking about what the facts are. Nine hundred and 65 people were shot by cops last last year and killed four percent of them were white cops shooting unarmed blacks in, in Chicago in 2011, 21.

Speaker 3:          00:25:05       People were shot and killed by cops. Uh, in 2015 there were seven a in Chicago, which is a third black, a third white, and a third Hispanic. Seventy percent of the homicides are black on black, uh, about 40 per month, almost 500 in the per year last year in Chicago. And 75 percent of them are unsolved. Whereas the black lives matter on that, the idea that a racist white cop shooting unarmed black people is apparel to black people is bs, is complete and total bs. And, and the reason for these so-called activists saying this is the assumption that racism remains a major problem in America. The media, CNN, especially MSNBC runs down whenever a black cop shoots somebody, uh, and, and uh, and it's, uh, some, some march on Washington. It's ridiculous. A black people, half the homicides in this country are committed by and against black people. Last year there were 14,000 homicides.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       Not talking about suicide. I'm talking about homicides. Half of them were black. 90 six percent of them black on black. Of that 7,000. Where's the black on black lives matter. People on that. So there's where you would say that this is purely because of social justice, purely because they want ultimately for people to be angry enough to just keep voting democrat. That's right. And where's, where's the evidence of a lack of social justice when a black suspect is killed by a cop? Believe me, the media's on it. People are watching it. Uh, and uh, and justice will, will for the most part to occur in Baltimore where Freddie gray was killed. Freddie gray died in a van, I shouldn't say was killed. Died in a van. Yeah. You have a city that's a 45 percent. Black City Council is 100 percent Democrat. The majority of city council is black.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       The top cop at the time was with black. The number two cop with black, the majority of the command staff is black, the mayor is black, the age is black. Uh, and yet here we are talking about racism. I mean, it's, it's absurd. It's absurd. So it's funny, I find myself caught in between this a little bit as a liberal where I want to always try to defend the other. So in this case, the other being black people, I'm always sympathetic to that. And they, uh, yeah, yeah. At the same time I hear you laying out a pretty solid. Well, these are just the facts. I'll tell you something else too, that was just a study, a university of Washington, uh, and it turns out cops were more reluctant, more hesitant to pull the trigger against the blacks black suspect than a white suspect. Uh, probably because of the fear of being accused of racially profiling and the fear that the civil rights establish it was going to come down on him.

Speaker 3:          00:27:31       So if anything, uh, whites are more likely to be shot by a cop under, under certain circumstances than a, than a, than a black person. And in last 30 or 40 years, the number of percentage of suspects killed by cops who are black has declined. Seventy five percent. However, the percentage of whites killed by cops has flatlined. Yeah. And so if anything, people are more concerned about shooting black people for fear that they're going to be called racist. And almost all every one of these incidents, whether it's Eric Gardener in in New York who died because he was selling loosies and we resisted arrest, whether there's Tamir rice in Cleveland who hit, was twirling around the gun, whether it's Michael Brown in Ferguson who had just a committed and strong arm robbery. Almost every one of these incidents involve somebody resisting arrest. Why don't you just do what the police tell you?

Speaker 3:          00:28:16       My Dad said, when I get pulled over, had my hand at 10:00, have my hand at 2:00 say yes sir. No Sir. Make sure my paperwork is in order. And if I feel the cop is mistreating me, get a badge number and deal with it. Later on. If Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and Obama and the whole group of them told black people to do that, we'd have a lot fewer of these things to deal with in the first place. Yeah. All right. So, um, with the, uh, I'm hearing a lot of what you're saying in here. So as a black conservative then who now you've, you've laid out your case there, but you haven't laid out yours. I asked, I asked you to name the most important example of racism and you gave white cops going after black people and I, and I told you, gave you the facts for that.

Speaker 3:          00:28:55       So that's nonsense that you must have something else. What else does it, if you think racism remains a problem in America? Give it to. Well, I think it remains a problem. How do you not even tell me it may not be systemic in that we have. It's not like you're not being hired because you're black. There's no systemic reason, you know, legal reason that, that exists, that kind of thing. But I think that racism as a general, uh, I need some. I need some. I need some specifics that you gave me, the white cop thing. What else? Give me another example. What do you think is a problem? We'll, we'll, uh, as a black conservative telling me how to know you, how do you get people to come around? You're, you're the one who made the assertion that racism remains a major problem in America.

Speaker 3:          00:29:30       I asked you to give me an example. You gave me white cops going after blacks. I, as far as I'm concerned, you didn't hold it up very well. It was the other argument you have. What's the other thing? Well, I don't know that it's systemic in that in the sort of macro sense, I'm not an ad. I know that. I want to know what it is you're, you're talking. No, no, that, that's exactly what that's. Believe me, that's 100 percent. You're not getting into school bs that we have a race. We have affirmative action. So a black person with a, with an sat and a GPA of x, we'll, we'll get into a school faster and easier than a white person with an sat or a gpa of x. and if going to, going to school is a route to the middle class, you can make an argument that blacks have an easier route to middle to the middle class.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       If you're talking about a black poverty, um, the poorer you are, the more accessible loans and grants are for you. Uh, the, the, the, the problem, the biggest burden that black people have in my opinion, again, is the percentage of blacks, 75 percent of them that are raised without fathers, uh, and that has every other social negative consequences connected to it. Crime, uh, not being able to compete economically in the country, being more likely to be arrested. That's the number one problem facing the black community. And when I hear people telling me about systemic racism or unconscious racism, I always say, give me an example. And almost nobody can do it. So, so the family stuff. So I'll follow your logic there and family stuff. What can actually be done about that then? Because that's a big reverse. The welfare state, uh, in 18, 90, 1900, you look at census reports, a black kid, believe it or not, with slightly more likely to be born to a nuclear family than a white kid.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       Even during slavery, uh, a black kid was more likely to be born under a roof with his biological mother and biological father. Then today what's happened is we launched this so called war on poverty in the sixties were literally, Lyndon Johnson sent, people were knocking on doors and I lived in the sixties and people knocked on doors uprising. Women of their availability to welfare provided there was no man in the house. And we went from 25 percent of black being born outside of wedlock and 65 to 75 percent right now. And you look at how much money that we spent on welfare, uh, in the lines are parallel. It was a neutron bomb dropped on this country and not just in the black community, but on people in general. Uh, at one time, only about five percent of whites were born outside of wedlock. Now 25 percent of whites are born outside of wedlock.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       I was in college in 1970 and there was a report called the Moynihan report. Uh, the Negro family, a case for national action is written by liberal by a man who became a Democratic senator for from New York. And at the time 25 percent of black kids are born outside of wedlock. He said, my God, this number is, is horrific. If we don't do something about it, it could get even higher. Well, fast forward 25 percent of white kids and now born outside of wedlock. It is the number one problem in this country. And what we've done in my opinion, is we've economically incentivized women to marry the government and we've allowed men to abandoned their financial and more responsibility. And now we have this. So do you think the left has done this? Right? Okay. So do you think then that as a, as a black conservative, that the biggest issue is it's impossible to have this conversation, right?

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       Right. Like the stuff we're talking about right now is rarely discussed in the media. You know, people, you've written some books about it and people talk about it every now and again, but we rarely have this discussion because, and this is where I will agree with you that the left has made language such a problem and everyone's so trigger warnings and safe space that we're afraid that if you have this conversation, that somehow I'm going to come off racist. You know, that's not where we were, where we don't have the conversation. We don't have the conversation because the left within have to look in the mirror and go, Jesus h Christ, look at what I've done and they don't want to do this. I've had a radio show for almost 25 years. I've invited Jesse Jackson on 50 times 60 times. I've invited our sharpened on that. That number, a maxine waters, another loud mouth, black woman around here with running around talking about racism.

Speaker 3:          00:33:20       She won't come on my show either. They don't want to deal with these issues. Why? Let's have a conversation. If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong. Tell me how I'm wrong. Give me your data. Give me your facts. Tell me what you got, and I could quote the, the Brookings Institution, which is a liberal think tank and the Heritage Foundation, which is a conservative think tank and they will both tell you that there's a relationship between crime and bad schools, uh, and going to prison and not having a dad. So this is not just a liberal kind of thing or conservative kind of thing. It's a real world kind of thing and they don't want to have that conversation. I have never heard a reporter ask Obama about the connection between the rise of the single parent household and the rise of, of, of welfare spending. I've never heard anybody ask him that question.

Speaker 3:          00:34:00       Not one time. Yeah. And so as far as I'm concerned, is this, this, this, this, um, desire not to have this conversation for fear that then will cause you to rethink your assumptions. A psychologist would call that cognitive dissonance the, the, this, this anxiety that you feel when you have had your assumptions challenged and you don't want to do it. It's uncomfortable. Yeah. So how then would someone like you or someone that believes in what the things that you're talking about, how do you wrestle away a little bit of the narrative from the black lives matter folks, because obviously you tell them, I tell the true care about the same thing. Of course I do. I tell the truth. I talk about, uh, the number one cause of preventable death for young white men is car accidents. The number one cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide committed by other young black men.

Speaker 3:          00:34:45       I tell the truth, I give the facts and the facts are racist. Yeah. So facts or racist Hashtag facts are racist, right? So, uh, you know, I'm friends with, uh, another black conservative, David Webb, you probably know Sirius Xm and he's a Fox News contributor and I had been doing a progressive show awhile back and I was on with someone and they didn't know him personally, nor knew that I was friends with him and they kept saying he's the token black guy on Fox right now. I'm sure you get plenty of token boot licker, uncle Tom, sambo, sambo. Tom Coconut as in Brown on the outside, white on the inside, a Oreo same concept, a the antichrist, and you've got a hold of because they've got to maligned somebody like me. I am a bigger threat to their whole ideology than almost anybody else. A black guy who does not believe that he's a victim of black guy who believes in hard work and personal responsibility.

Speaker 3:          00:35:40       A black guy who doesn't believe in handouts. Black guy doesn't believe in the welfare state of black guy. He doesn't believe in affirmative action. I am the antithesis of everything they stand for and therefore I can't just be dealt with with facts and everybody with X. I've got to be maligned. I've got to be a castaway. I've got to be treated as as if I'm darth vader. That's what the left does. So That's interesting. And again, this is where I've really struggled with my guys on the left because in a way that is actually showing it's race. Of course it is. That's right. Because I don't have the same right to have an opinion. If somebody else. I've never heard rush limbaugh be called anti white because he criticizes hillary and the Left, but I criticize black left people and I'm and I'm, I'm anti-black.

Speaker 3:          00:36:21       It's bigotry. It's racism. Calling somebody. An uncle Tom is as offensive. It's calling somebody an inward lover. Yeah. So when it comes to, to the black community and politics. So I got you on a bunch of bunch of this stuff. The black community in a lot of ways isn't for some of the things that the Democratic Party is for, right? Because the black community a lot of times, and it has a lot to do with the church is more socially conservative. The only thing that that connects black people to the Democratic Party in my opinion, is this notion of social justice and this notion that racism remains a major problem in America. Look down the list of, of things that black people like and support. Blacks are more pro life than whites are. Blacks were more anti gay marriage, uh, than, than whites were. That's one of the reasons its proposition passed here in California is because of the way blacks and browns voted.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Again, I didn't vote that way, but it's the way a lot of blacks and browns did. Um, uh, blacks want to be wealthy. One of the reason Donald Trump is getting about 25 percent of black, which is five times by the way, the percentage that Mitt Romney got is because of Donald Trump's swagger and his, um, and his, uh, being proud that he's made money. Uh, and so and, and in the inner city, right? That's a really fascinating little piece right there because I never want one more quick one. This is important. The Democratic Party is completely beholden to the teacher's union and vice versa. Uh, the union is adamantly opposed to vouchers where the money follows the kid rather than the other way around. Inner city black women and fathers and their inner city, black, Brown women and Brown fathers want vouchers. They realized the schools suck. I went to crenshaw high school in south central right now, three percent.

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       That's not a typo. Three percent of kids can do math at grade level. I'm going to send my kid to that school because I don't have enough money to send my kid to a better school. It's, it's, it's an assault, a. there's a program called the DC hope scholarship program where every year, uh, parents who subscribed to the, to the program, it's four times as many people wanting to get in as there are seats, will give a kids about 10 to $12,000 to go to a non a DC government school. And every two years when it's over Obama and the Democrats climate try to shut it down. And the reason they don't is a bunch of black parents go to the streets, have a press conference, dark crying. And so all my kids doing better. I can't think of anything more damaging to a kid's future, is to send him to a school where it's a crip school where the kids are, are, are not learning where a lot of them are not learning because they don't care.

Speaker 3:          00:38:53       And where the whole level is now dumbed down to cater to that lowest common denominator in a class. And as a result, you have kids that have a poor sat scores and they otherwise would, if they had a chance to go somewhere else that challenged them. Um, and so inner city parents want vouchers. Young black people when they're told about the benefits of privatizing social security, uh, want to do it because 65 years old blacks die sooner than whites do. And when you die, all your contribution to social security go poof, as opposed to being able to distill it to your child. When black duck taught about this, young blacks want the opportunity to put their money into an account that they can control. So when they get 65 years old, they have real money. So privatizing social security vouchers, a abortion, same sex marriage, all of these issues, black are really not in lockstep with the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party has successfully, uh, convinced blacks that racism, this white cop, this is widespread, that man's out to get you and vote for us and we'll deal with it.

Speaker 3:          00:39:56       So how much of this is a messaging? Probably if I grant you all of that, right? How much of this is just a messaging problem by the Republicans because it seems to me, and I've said this several times, but someone like Tim Scott who is a black Republican senator from the south, right? He should be a hero, not only of the black community, but he should really be a hero of the left. Right? Because this is a successful black. Could be an American hero. He really should be. I mean, he should some, certainly at least at the very least be bigger in the national debate. Why isn't he a bigger surrogate for whoever he's going to support? I assume it will be a republican. Uh, why is this guy lost in, in the scheme of things? Well, it's the same reason that black vote 95 percent for the Democratic Party, he is considered to be a, an uncle Tom.

Speaker 3:          00:40:40       He's a Republican. He's a black Republican, a, he's a, he's a, he's some sort of Unicorn. I don't know what he is, that, that's how, that's how they feel. So then what do you do? What do you do as a Republican to break this narrative? You know, I got it. You told, tell the truth. I got it. You tell the truth, but obviously there has to be something bigger than messaging here because. Well, it telling me the numbers. 90, 95, it's an uphill fight. I mean, to me there is a access of indoctrination and you have the media, you have academia and you have Hollywood, uh, all of which tell black people that they're victims. Um, most professors are to the left. Um, the media certainly is off to the left and holly was to the left. And so you get up and you're indoctrinated all the time with things like social justice, inequality, uh, the man's out to get you a, we need a higher minimum wage.

Speaker 3:          00:41:27       You name the left wing, uh, a policy and, and you, and you pick it up through osmosis. That's why when we first started the conversation, I said, I hope to move you towards the center and you say, I hope to move you towards, uh, towards the, towards the center. And I said, it's not going to happen because. Because I'm there, there's nothing you can tell me I haven't heard. But I probably can say some things your audience hasn't heard a because La Times, New York Times, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, New York Times, uh, you name it, these are all to the left, whatever, left wing position, uh, you're going to hear it, you're going to hear a why, how and where, but, but the other position you won't hear unless you watch a Fox News or listen to talk radio and a lot of people won't do it if you make them, if you pay them.

Speaker 3:          00:42:11       Right. So I hope it's clear in our 40 minutes or so together so far when I say I'm on the left, I consider myself a classic liberal and that I stand for liberal principles. John Stuart mill type liberal. Exactly, exactly. That's, that's not a liberal. And, and I know in a lot of ways that that makes you a conservative. You're a Jack Kennedy, kind of a kind of Democrat. He cut taxes. He was a cold warrior. He will. He liked hunting. He liked the second amendment. So it doesn't really show you how stupid the words are. So what I did at the top of the no shows you how the Democratic Party has evolved to the left and abandoned principles. My mom was a, was a Democrat, my mom was a Republican, my dad was a republican all his life and my mom stopped voting for the Democratic Party and she said, as many people have said, I didn't leave the Democratic Party.

Speaker 3:          00:42:52       They left me. She didn't like welfare. She didn't like the idea of rewarding people just because you had a kid and they'd given you more money when you had an additional kids. She didn't like any of all of that and she started voting for George w Bush or last, uh, two, two election cycles. So it's really ironic that it's not messaging. It's the fact that the country and the country in general has gone to the left and the Democrats to the, to a greater degree than Republicans have gone to the left. The country has changed in part, in my opinion, because of immigration, including illegal immigration. People who are coming to the country illegally from third world countries like Mexico. They don't know what I'm talking about when I talk about limited government. They believe healthcare is a right. They're taught that in Mexico, they're taught that other places and they come here in America and they pull that lever for the Democratic Party, which is why, in my opinion, the left wants borders to be poorest because it changes the country, changed the electorate, it changes the demographics and all that.

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       The Democratic Party has not won the white vote since 1964. The more white people there are in the country, the worst Democrats do. The more left wing, the more people of color there are in the country, the best the left does. And so what incentive is there for them to, to police the borders? What incentive is there for them to shut down on sanctuary cities, uh, to, to stop catch and release? There isn't, in my opinion, there's been a very subtle and very diabolical changing or the mentality of this country by left wing people so that a state like California could never vote for Ronald Reagan as they did in the past, could never vote for Richard Nixon as they did in the past. You have New York and California just write them off and there's 10 or 12 states now that we fight over. Everything else has now written off. It's ridiculous. So at the top of the show, when I was laying out some of the principles that we're talking about here, I saw classical liberalism falling into the conservative category, as you just said.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       And it's funny because while I consider myself a classical liberal and we can lay out every liberal principle there is that I would defend. Uh, it's, it's scary to me because the. Because we get so caught up in words that, you know, oh, I don't want to be considered a conservative because I'm a liberal. It's a scary proposition, right? Well, again, it's, it's, it's about limited government personal responsibility as far as I'm concerned. What you've told me is that you are really a, somebody on my camp far more so than somebody on Bernie Sanders camp. Well, I'm liberal in that I'm for gay marriage and I don't mind if you smoke weed in your bedroom as a general rule. I do like lower taxes, but I think we could have a progressive tax at some level, so we probably disagree a little bit there. I do think you should if you keep making more and more and especially as you're getting into the dozens of millions and hundreds of millions. Yeah, we could have a progressive tax that would attack the taxes people more. I'm not necessarily for the 90 percent tax that, that Bernie wants. Uh, so I, you know, some of the economics.

Speaker 3:          00:45:31       I wonder, let me ask you, why is it that nobody gave Dick Cheney love? Because Cheney had a more progressive position on same sex marriage than Obama did when Obama was still. But we're changing, evolving. Cheney Cheney didn't have it until he was out of office. So that's, uh, you know, it's a little disingenuous. What he did, he still years before Obama said he was in favor of gay marriage, said, I'm in favor of allowing states to determine this. He said that years before that, while he was in office, though, I don't think that was while he was all I know was years before Obama because Obama became president 2008. He's not only said that he was in favor of traditional marriage. He said God was in the mix. All of a sudden years later, God is no longer mix four years ago. Then God got out of the mix.

Speaker 3:          00:46:14       But anyway, the point is that Dick Cheney said that he supported same sex marriage on a state by state basis. Well before the left, did well before Obama did well before Hillary did gotten olaf. So isn't actually well that I think would just go to. Because politicians are pandering. I mean that. I don't know that that makes Obama anymore of a liar than any other politician make. As much as they will just talk. I'm telling you, I'm paying, I'm talking about. I get you. I'm talking about why somebody didn't give it. Give it a couple of attaboys on that. I know that people on the left hate him, called him a neocon and believe he was whispering and George w Bush's ear and got Bush to do all sorts of bad things, but I would've, I would've thought on this issue since the left considered such, such an important issue. I don't, by the way, that they would not have given it a little bit of bit.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       What do you mean you don't consider same sex marriage to be that big of a deal? To me it's a give people equality and then let's not think about it anymore. That would.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       Fair enough. I'm just saying I, I think the number one issue in this country is self defense. Uh, and, and the number one domestic policy issue that, as I mentioned, is the destruction of the family. These other things, a same sex marriage, war on drugs, a global warming. I considered to be further down the list. So the war on drugs, you're, you're actually for legalizing drugs, right? I'm, I'm for the government getting out of it both federally and at the state level. Yeah. And that would be an interestingly, this may be a little boring for your, for your viewers, but, but um, uh, in the, in the earlier in the 20th century, we had the war against alcohol. The constitution was amended, the fight, the war against alcohol, and then it was amended again when we decided it didn't work. We've had, since Richard Nixon, this war on drugs, the constitution was never amended for that.

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       And I don't understand why people don't make the argument that it is illegal what the federal government is doing because in order to get rid of alcohol, Congress knew that they had to change the constitution, which they did. There's no power in article one, section eight that gives the federal government the authority to wage a war on alcohol or a war on, on, on drugs. But to do the one on alcohol, they changed the constitution and then rechanged it. But they never did that for the war on drugs. Yeah. So how much of that do you think goes to why the black family has been affected? I mean, when you think about the amount of black people, black men especially, and minorities in general that are in jail, we now have pro for profit jails and a huge percentage of these people are in jail because of drug offenses.

Speaker 3:          00:48:37       Well, not that many about 12 to 15 percent, but, but, but, but whatever. That seems pretty significant, whatever the percentage is, I think the war on drugs should be rethought and we should deal with it as a health problem and not a criminal justice problem, but the reason for the large number of black behind bars goes back to what I said earlier about the breakdown of the black family, uh, and not being taught the right kinds of values. Uh, and that has all sorts of other social consequences including, uh, a greater propensity to commit crime. Yeah. Um, all right, let's back up for a second because you quickly say something about Hollywood and I know I follow you on twitter and you rail against Hollywood. All I do. Basically your argument is that it's like kicking a puppy though. It's become, and I can tell you not.

Speaker 3:          00:49:17       It's not that difficult. Right. So, so just the other night, you know, you were, you were tweeting a little bit about the Golden Globes and the targets that your base was taking. Last night I saw you, uh, on CNN, Don Lemon, who I had on last week was on the show last week. He was talking about Tavis Smiley and you're not a fan of travis. I've known him a long time. He's a, he, he doesn't preach what he practices, what he is, a hardworking guy who came from Indiana with a big poor family and has done quite well with his life. And instead of telling people, bust your butt, do what I did. Work hard, stay focused. It's demands out to get you a social injustice. Racism, racism everywhere. It's nonsense. Hollywood is an easy target because these guys, the Golden Globes, they've got these fine clothing designer, a clothing and designed designer Tux and, and their jewelry.

Speaker 3:          00:50:02       They're all anti second amendment, but they're all protected by armed security guard. Uh, and um, how many of them, uh, applied into a Prius to get to and from the, uh, uh, the, the, the ceremony. I mean, you're saying very few. I think very, very few. They in big gas. Guzzling not a large number of limos. Yeah. And notice it. Notice there were several bill cosby jokes, I think three or four bill cosby rape jokes. Not One Bill Clinton rape joke. Poor quality. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, do you think, I mean, I'm a firm believer that a lot of them actually privately are supporting Republicans or at least their voting Republican. There is this idea that, okay, we're going to go on this. You can't say you can't say it out loud. Name One, a list. Young actor or actress who's an out of the closet Republican. Just one young, 20, 30 eastern.

Speaker 3:          00:50:52       You can do it once. Your Clint Eastwood, once your Kelsey grammer boy, does it count as you, right? No, no, but, but somebody in his twenties, thirties, Jennifer Lawrence, uh, age star, they want this guy to be somebody. They can't be 100 percent a left wing, but they will not say so because they know they won't get parts and you would say that's not necessarily because they believe those things as much as just the structures in place. It's bigotry in Hollywood that the open minded, empathetic people, they're fine as long as you don't say something that pisses them off. Yeah. And, and, uh, you say that you're gonna support, uh, uh, uh, Donald Trump, you won't work if you're 20 or 30 years old. You won't work. You're going to lose jobs. Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about your thoughts and think and think about that. These are, these are the people who are in charge of 80 percent of what we see on TV and on and in movies.

Speaker 3:          00:51:45       And if you come out and you're 20 or 30 years old and you're a rising star and you say, you know what? Listen to Larry elder's show the other day. I think, um, I'm going to vote Republican. Finished, done, done now. Now, what kind of power is that to influence the minds of young people to shape this country culturally, it is massive. There was a book called Primetime propaganda by a young man named Ben Shapiro. We're getting them on the show and uh, and because he looks so young and looks liberal, whatever that means, he was able to get on the record all these Hollywood producers, people that did golden girls, people that did cops and got them on the record saying, I would never hire a conservative. A conservative in this town will be screwed. A conservative in this town cannot make it. I intentionally put leftwing messages in my fair.

Speaker 3:          00:52:32       I try to influence culture this way, has them all saying this and has an on tape. And the book came out and it didn't make any difference. They didn't say, I'm sorry, I didn't say we ought to rethink our assumptions. He interviewed Fred Silverman, who at one time as the head of ABC, CBS, NBC has Fred Silverman on the record saying a conservative cannot make it in this town. Now, if Hollywood has a great impact on how we think on our culture and you have this Gestapo essentially shutting out people who are conservative, what does that say? It's scary to frightening to me. Yeah. Well, messaging messaging is everything, which actually brings this back to what you said about trump before, which I think is sort of fascinating that he's polling better with the black community is because he has this sense of swagger, which I think you could probably relate directly back to, you know, rap music and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       These guys aren't, they're not ashamed of their success and that. So in a weird way, trump is sort of doing the exact same the exact thing that you want, uh, to happen. I agree, but I think it was another big reason that trump is scoring with white people. Uh, one of the most underpolled things in this country is how black people are pissed off about illegal immigration. When I was younger, there was a movie that came out of the seventies called carwash, or Richard Pryor was in it, um, and George or George Carlin was in it. Yeah. And it was about a day in the life of this carwash in south central, not too far from where I grew up. Virtually all the employees were black. I defy you to go to a car wash and south central now and see any, any employee who's black illegal immigrants that come over and taking over this business, uh, and black people see it and they, and they realize it and they are angry about it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       Uh, and the Democratic Party, however, because of what I said earlier about trying to shift the electorate to the left, uh, has, in my opinion, thrown blacks under the bus on this issue. And a lot of blacks who are aware of it or not happy about it. And Donald Trump's position on immigration, uh, resonated with a lot of black people. The other thing about, about Donald trump that I think in general, not just black people, uh, is appealing to me anyway. And I'm not quite sure why some of my fellow Republicans are so adamantly opposed to Donald Trump. This guy, Dave can self fund. He doesn't need your money. Uh, Donald Trump was at a group called the Republican Jewish coalition and he was asked a question about does he feel that a Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel? His answers not important. He said something like, uh, I'm not sure I haven't thought it through.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       And he got booed and Donald trump looked up and he said, I don't need your money now. There's a guy named Nelson Sheldon Adelson in Las Vegas. He's a multibillionaire last election cycle. He gave Newt Gingrich 10 million a lot of money and a lot of people feel that, but for that, Newt Gingrich is a tackle and Mitt Romney and all the footage that he gave Democrats to use and the general election, Romney might have one. That's not the point. The point is he is a king maker. Um, and right now he is trying to decide whether he wants to give money to a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. He has Los Vegas business interests. I'm not mad at him for doing something to pursue his interests. But the point is, he expected his phone call to return to be returned. Donald trump can say, screw you to all these people, the people that get subsidized for milk, the people that get subsidies for sugar, the people that get subsidies for this ridiculous product known as ethanol, uh, the, the unions that keep Amtrak running.

Speaker 3:          00:55:50       Donald trump does not need their money. He does not have to take their phone call. So what's guy can really do what should be done for the American people, which is to get all the crony capitalism and all these so called special interests out of our government and get it down to the site. That oughta be Boeing gets money from the government. Google gets money from the government. Dutch royal gets money from the government. This is corporate welfare. And the reason that happens is because they give contribution to the politicians who in turn then do their bidding. Donald trump does not need their money. He is in a position to downsize the government in a way unlike any other politician

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       I've ever seen. Yeah. So there's the. I mean, there's a lot of irony there. You've, what you're really talking about is that's truly systemic political problems. Tell me about it, the money politics study, so that's, and that's. That should unite everybody across the board about how messed up our system should. I mean, right now a la is going to get to team two football teams, probably Oakland and San Diego and St Louis are all vying to come out here. By the way, all three of them used to play here. Rams used to play here, open up to play here, and the first a La chargers, one of the AFL teams started here and they moved to San Diego. Now they don't want to come back. Why? Because their respective cities won't give them hundreds of billions of dollars in tax subsidies. Why should a multibillionaire get millions of dollars from taxpayers who then in turn have to pay all this to go to the game and watch multimillionaire ballplayers be?

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       Well, that's like sitting corporate welfare, that's molesting city field where the mets play in New York, you know that it was funded by, partly by taxpayer money, but meanwhile the government's bailing out Citibank who has their name on the whole thing is reduced. So the trump thing, real quick, one of the things is in the first debate, the first republican debate about three months ago now, I thought the, the unmasking that he did was actually kind of amazing, even though I disagree with him on pretty much everything, but you know, when they asked him about going to Hillary's a daughter's wedding, right? Uh, he goes to Chelsea's wedding and he was like, yeah, I give them money. Show up the wedding. Yeah. I give money to everybody. I'm a business guy. I got it. I got to do what I gotta do. So in a weird way, even if you don't like.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       So for my, for my liberal friends and my friends had left, even if you hate the messaging and you know, all the Muslim stuff and all that, even if you hate all that, the unmasking of the system. And that's why I've also talked about how Bernie and trump have a lot in common because the core of what they're doing is the biggest threat to the system. Right, right. Bernie and trump have a lot in common in the sense that the establishment is scared to death of both of them. Uh, but, uh, Bernie will make things worse. Taking over large corporations will make things worse. Raising taxes on job creators will make things worse with Donald trump wants to do. I will make things better. All right. Well, uh, I barely got to any of the questions I have here, which is a testament to you, so I'm glad we've got to sit down.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       So let me end this thing and a little bit of the future where you think this country is going in the next year. Do you. So I sent. Are you supporting trump? I haven't taken a position on anybody yet, so I will support whoever the nominee is over Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Certainly, yeah. Do you view he'll, hillary and Bernie both sort of as equally, uh, equally equally as equally bad? I mean, I mean, when you've, when you've asked Hillary to give the difference, as Chris Matthews recently did, between a Democrat and a socialist, she couldn't do it. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the DNC, was asked the same question, she couldn't do it, uh, and Hillary has gone further to the left because she's threatened by Bernie Sanders. She's now come out by talking about a surcharge tax on, on, on millionaire. She didn't do that before and she's also coming out on the left now on gun.

Speaker 2:          00:59:19       She didn't want to do that before. So Bernie's pushed her to the left. So as far as I'm concerned, their positions are pretty much indistinguishable. Yeah. And again, this may go to show why the system is just broken because both sides in the primary process have to stake out these positions that they know that they're not going to govern by. Richard Nixon used to say when you want to win a presidency and the primary, you run to the right and then when you run into the general election, you run to the center. That's kind of how it works. And the primary season you have to run to your base and then kind of run to the standard different. Trying to get independence. That's just how it works. Yeah. All right, well listen, I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to you. I didn't expect we were going to agree on everything.

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       We didn't. That's fine. Maybe I learned a little something here. Maybe you learned a little bit. Maybe you learned a little something going on. So I see a glimmer in your eye. So if you move a little bit towards the center. Well I consider my has a classical liberal. I don't, I don't consider myself off the deep end left and maybe I just, I think in general a lot of people on the left are starting to realize how do you feel about vouchers? Uh, I think we should have vouchers. I think you should have access to God. How do you feel about affirmative action? How do you feel about giving a black person or a brown person? Additional points just because they're black and brown over some equally qualified white person. Are you happy with that? Unhappy. Don't care. Oh Man. Now I'm being interviewed.

Speaker 2:          01:00:27       All right. So yeah, I would say that I think at some time, at some point in America there was a reason that it really did make sense because because some of the more systemic stuff still exists today and today it probably doesn't make as much sense anymore. I think you would agree with me on that because that's pretty much what you just don't think it ever made anything, but that's exactly why I want to have these conversations and why especially I think that that liberals and Libertarians should realize that we're sort of in the center together and that there's a way to, there's a way to work together. So that's exactly why I wanted to do that. Fair enough. So, all right, so I thank my guest, Larry Elder. Uh, you can check out clips of the Larry elder's show and more are Larry's work@Larryelder.com.
