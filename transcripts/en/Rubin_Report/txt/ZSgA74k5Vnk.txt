Speaker 1:          00:00:05       So last Friday, the progressive website mother Jones included me in an article about a quote new extremist media industry that is further to the right than Breitbart in the piece. The author referred to me as quote far right sighting interviews I've done with Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos and lauren southern to backup his accusation. He Cherry picked these guests to fit his narrative, yet somehow miss the endless amount of liberals I've had on the show and some of the progressive's I've hosted as well, including Margaret Cho, Hilary Rosen, mark duplass, John Fugal sang and Michael Ian Black. The article also attack Patrion the crowd funding platform, which myself and my team's livelihood depends on for being tolerant of people with quote far right views such as mine though of course, nowhere did it include any of my purported far right views. Earlier in the week, Forbes called the Rubin report, a conservative talk show, but immediately retracted the statement when I contacted them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       Ironically, I've been saying for a while that defending my liberal beliefs is becoming a conservative position. Although I don't think being called a conservative is somehow a pejorative. It clearly isn't a proper descriptor for this show in which I posted people from across the political divide for Mother Jones to accuse me of being an extremist. Further to the right of Breitbart is obviously an inflammatory and demonstrably dishonest statement. I've been around many people over the last few years who've been unfairly maligned and I'm all too familiar with how this goes, whether it's Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Collin Moriarty, I Ayaan, Hirsi Ali or Bret Weinstein. Each attack is virtually never based on what these people have said, but is instead crafted out of Straw man arguments with the words racist and bigot tossed around like Andy. Suddenly the onus is on the people who aren't racists or bigots to disprove this accusation, usually slung by a misguided celebrity or a malicious newspaper or website.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       The move then is on the accused. Should they spend the time and energy defending themselves from accusations which aren't true, only to bring more attention to the accusations themselves or should they ignore them, hoping that the false claims will go away over time? I think there are solid arguments to be made for either tactic and it truly depends on the situation at hand and the person involved in this case involving me, I went on the attack, I decided this case was to agregious to ignore and I contacted the articles author via twitter, screenshotting pieces of his article and asking him to defend them. Of course he couldn't defend his own words. That's the thing with truth. It's hard to work around and eventually he made slight changes to the article like including a tweet of mine in which I defended myself from his claims and he removed the word far in front of the word right before referencing me in the article, putting the rest of the specifics of the article itself, I was happy to get a strong defense in public for many friends all over the political map.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       People like Joe Rogan, Collin Moriarity, Feisal site, all Matar, Bret Weinstein, Eric Weinstein, Michael Shermer, Peter Posey, and in many others offered strong defenses of me just as I've offered for others when I've seen them unfairly attacked. I even got a public defense from Donald Trump jr putting my friends in public allies aside though it's incredibly inspiring and humbling to see literally tens of thousands of people offer their voice when they feel you've been unjustly attacked. And that's the key to this whole thing. It's not me or Sam or Jordan or Brett that they fear. What they really fear is that all of you, we'll start saying what you think because there's strength in numbers. By Monday I wanted to put this whole story behind me. My dog had a health emergency, which actually put this whole thing into perspective. Uh, but I admit I did get sucked back into the story very briefly over the course of another twitter exchange.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       I got the writer of the piece, Josh Harkinson to publicly admit that I am not further right than Breitbart. Though of course he didn't change the title or have mother Jones issue any sort of public correction. One other interesting piece to all this is that the writer, Josh Harkinson is one of the 40 people that James Hodgkinson, the shooter of the Republican Baseball team last week in Virginia, followed on twitter. Now, I can't draw a direct link there, but we know that Hodgkinson was a far left lefty who was obviously driven to political extremes, so when this very same writer does a hatchet job on me calling me further, right than Breitbart, which is clearly a code for racist, I can't sit back there and take it. This is exactly why I've been saying you can't punch Nazis call everyone. You oppose a Nazi and a racist and then eventually you will see violence as the next logical step.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       It's not a crazy exercise to think that this is partially what drove James Hodgkinson. In hindsight. His attack on me was the next obvious step in where this whole collectivist movement is going. I've talked for a long time about how if you can't debate ideas, you use lies in buzzwords. Having a turned on me shouldn't have been a surprise, especially from a leftist site like mother Jones. Yet somehow it did still surprise me. Make no mistake. There is a think acquisition going on here and it can come for anyone at any time. If you ally yourself with people who value the movement, in this case a political movement over you as an individual, then eventually it is inevitable that they will come for you and if they don't come for you, your probably the one coming for them. This think was issued will come after anyone who bucks the trend and the stereotypes and dares think for themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:05:48       It's why they accused Ayaan Hirsi Ali of being anti Muslim. It's why they slander Bill Maher as being a racist. It's why they call Larry elder and uncle Tom and it's apparently they can brand me a far right extremist. Those who are a part of this thing, acquisition fear you thinking for yourself that you won't bow to their collectivists demands more than anything else. The way to beat this witch hunt is to be yourself and fight for what you believe you are the antidote that they fear most. I hope that next time you see me fighting back and getting some cover from my allies, it will inspire you to fight back specifically with words, not violence as well. Joining me on the show this week is one of my afro mentioned allies and a friend and author and professor Peter Boghossian, who's going to help me dissect some of the madness of 2017 and much more.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Joining me today is an author and a professor of philosophy at Portland State University and a man who strives to be a good human every day. Peter [inaudible], welcome back. It's great to be here. Thanks and thanks for the striving to be a good human. You'd never know it from what people have been saying about us. Well certainly about me, about you. You really been through the ringer in the last few days and I would love to get to that and talk about that. I suspect we can get to that, but strives to be a good human being. The reason I threw that in there, because that seems to me you were on the show about a year and a half ago. We had never met before that we've since become very good for her in front of me. Hit A, we hit it off instantly just like that and when you were on the show and we'll link to it down below so that people can see the initial sit down.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       Um, I felt that it was one of the episodes where so many of the things that I had been thinking about, about the left, about politics, about religion and so many of the things sort of all came to get whole. I actually, they really did and I felt I felt richer after. And I do often in some interviews, some interviews I feel dumber, but this was one way I felt richer and since we've become friends, but you do strive to be a pretty decent, I do. As you know, you said, how should I introduce you in the beginning? And I was thinking don't ask that. Normally the only reason I asked is because we're friends and I thought maybe there's some person, a little anecdote or something that you want to, and I really, I really just striving to be a good person. I think that that's one of the things that matter is that kindness, that compassion.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       I think we've so lost it and acrimonious and we're so hyper partisan where so and the college craziness and everything that's been going on and they at the attacks and the people will give you an opportunity to respond to those attacks and the negativity on social media. So yeah, I'm just trying to be a good guy and was trying to live a good life, a good life. So in the last couple of months you lost your dad. I did. That was the seminal event of one of the seminal events in my life. How do you stay a good person throughout that? Not that, not that losing someone's going to make you a bad person obviously, but you're still trying to work. You're still trying to be a public person and to and like how do you manage

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       not just going nutty. And in the course of that I had some health issues. I was in the emergency room three times the last few months I have Crohn's disease. So that that's not doing me any favors either. Without getting too deep. I mean, you were in the hospital today. Yeah, yeah. If you want me to tell it to people, stuff going on. But I think open about it and I think that that, that really does make every moment of your life precious. And when my, my dad died and my mom died, um, I dunno, it's a kind of a combination of feeling more circumspect. And I, and I've always had in the back of my mind, my parents have probation or what my dad think or my mom thing. And it's kind of really given me an opportunity to, I'm trying to frame it positively, it trying to given me me an opportunity to reflect on what they did for me in my life and try to do that for my kids.

Speaker 2:          00:09:49       But yeah, when living navigating that reality, when your parents have died, it's very intense. It's very, you know, even little things like you get in the car, he shot, he's getting the car and she'd call my dad or I call my mom and I don't do that anymore. And I think one of the, that's why I was thinking today, I don't like the idea that someone passed it. They, they're debt, they've died. There's a permanence to that and that language. And I am always taking to myself like, oh my mom would like that, my dad like that. And the real quick one, my, my mom died. Uh, it wasn't really into her funeral that I understood that she died, like really grokked it because someone fell asleep and her funeral. And I thought, God, my mom would think that's hilarious. She would love that. And then I realized like I could never tell her that I could never tell her anything again.

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       And those pillars in your life that you can't go to in times of joy in times of stress, you know, it was in the hospital for another time for my Crohn's disease. My Dad stayed up with me all night. He was there. And that part of my life is gone now. Yeah. So as a philosophy professor and as a well known and outspoken atheist, when, when you're challenged with something like the death of a parent, did any of your beliefs get challenged? I mean, is there a moment at right after your dad passed where you thought, man, I want to believe, or did you maybe have a dream that seemed different? You know, something like that because you know, you know my feelings on roof and I, and I'm not a believer in the traditional sense, and yet occasionally things happen that I go, what was that after my, my grandma passed too.

Speaker 2:          00:11:26       I was very close with, I'm sorry, I had some very vivid dreams that seem to me, she was telling me something. No, I'm not, I'm not saying I buy it for all of this, but it has some value to me. Did you have any of that or no? Have any of that? No. No. I was just incredibly bereaved and I was, uh, it mean it was just a shattering of a type of reality for me. And, but it also made me realize that it really is true, that every moment of life is precious. Just have to be so grateful. Go through life with a sort of gratitude for the experiences that you have. So when you hear someone like me that you know pretty well say, well, you know, my grandma passed away and then, I mean I can tell you about the dream. I was in her apartment, she looked amazing, she was like glowing and she was wearing all black and she had these like green neon streaks in her hair and she was like running in place really fast.

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       And she was telling me how excited she is and she has all these things to do. I mean it was, and it was vivid and powerful and whatever. And so when you hear me say something like that as, as a nonbeliever w, what do you think of that? I think it's totally normal and totally natural. I think different people grieve in different ways. And I think it was when my grandfather died, I had a similar experience. I, I, uh, have a hyper vivid dream about him. I think these moments in life, life, death, they're really, they give you a kind of clarity sometimes, but they also get, so here's, so for my dad, when, when he died and I was holding my dad's hand and his death and my mom seeing her, her death. So I was incredibly fortunate, you know, they saw me into the world and I saw them out of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       I was just irreconcilable. I mean I was just so, I was a complete mess. I was. And the woman who comes in and the social worker would have, you said, you know, normally we have grief counselors here and normally I would suggest to say, but in your case I really think you have to go see the grief counselor. Like I'm sending supersede the grief counselor in there is. And I think part of that was so hard for me is precisely because they don't have those metaphysical beliefs. Like it's the finality. Like that's it. So we'll see. So then did you have moments through these? So you didn't, I guess you're saying you really didn't have a moment where suddenly you've got, maybe I got this wrong or, or I want to believe in something that I can't prove, but [inaudible] really it's really that locked for you.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       Like, oh no, it's not locked. I just never bartered my hope for anything. You know, I never, I never as a great line. Oh yeah. Everybody was my hope for anything. That's true though. I mean I never, and then the, you go through the long run. I was living in his house. I was driving, his cars weren't as close because right after we did the event with Christina Hoff Summers, the next day that I went, I went out there to see him. But yeah, it was fortunate. And you know, one thing that people really don't want to talk about, I think the left and the right has their own blind spots. But parenting, I am absolutely convinced is a prophylactic to bad behavior, good parenting. And if you look at the data, kids are more likely to commit violent crimes if they're in a certain age group. I just read this and I was reading Math Thorton's manuscript above violence and if there are males and if there's no adult male president of the home and just as the left doesn't want to acknowledge that and talk about that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:40       So too does the right have particular blinders about structural inequality and such. But I think parenting and good parenting and being thoughtful and what that means. When I was the, when I was driving down here, the Uber driver told me that, um, I'm not going to mention what country she was from and I'm looking at 50,000 emails, these people and, and no, no. Can you pick a, give me the same hemisphere. Southeast Asia. Okay, fair. It was telling me that they come from a traditional family and I asked, why doesn't your, why don't your kids go to see your ex? And she said, well, he used to spank them. And I thought like, wow, I've never raised my hand to my children ever. I have raised my voice on occasion. I've never lost my temper. It doesn't speak to me. I think Denmark smacked me once or twice in an argument.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       And more than that. But that's the other thing. It's this idea about verbal violence. It's the idea. It's a complicated, but I think parenting, I think we've overlooked how important that is. Oh, one more thing. One thing, since we're talking about this and planning on talking about this, they have no plan here. The nurse said something really interesting to me. She said, I bet you he was a wonderful father to you. And I said, well, you say that to everybody. And she said, actually, no, I don't. I, I can tell by the way the kids treat their parents when they come to the hospital and this, it was so sad. So I would walk into this hospital every day and I would see all these people who were literally dying and they were alone and they had nobody. And it just made me what kind of a loneliness, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       Yeah. Is that the funny thing about not unbelief that you've so obviously had a transcendent experience, but it's all based in actually what happened. So a lot of times, I don't know,

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       like I had a father, he was a physical person. He lived in my home, he raised me. Oh, and this a thing. So I, I, so what did I do when my father died after you know, sobbing. And the first person I called was my childhood friend. Like the next person who had known me for the longest time and he cheered me up and it was good. Or he tried to, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       that's connected to the family thing. Don't you think? I've mentioned this a couple of times lately that I think now at 41 next week, I just started to really understand, thanks. I've started to understand why the family thing is so important and that I'm so proud that my parents had been married for 40 some odd years and I still go home to the same childhood home and my family friends are all still there. My, my best friend in the world is still the same guy that I met before kindergarten. We were worried that those connections have incredible value.

Speaker 2:          00:17:21       That's what the, you know, what is the meaning of life? Well, you know, whatever, you make the meaning life b. But Aristotle talks about that. And here's what I would throw out to you and to the audiences that you can have the richest, deepest, most rewarding friendships if you are a person of virtue and the person with whom you're friends with is a person of virtue. Aristotle says it's the highest form of friendship between two virtuous people and what does that entail? And it really does until it kind of Greek cop parrishcea speaking truth in the face of danger. So, and I've told you a few things and you've told me a few things, hey, I think you're wrong about this or have you. And if that is sufficient to decide that we're going to part ways, then either our friendship wasn't that strong and the first place.

Speaker 2:          00:18:05       Or I would like to think that we have the sort of relationship that we can be completely honest with each other. And even really I wouldn't spare your feelings about something frankly, which is what you and I exactly what true French. And then I would expect that you would expect that. I wouldn't spare your feelings and I would just say, hey look man, this is how it is. You did this and I have to say, and then whatever it was I was telling you about this right before we started. So without even saying this, the sex or name of the person certainly or anything like that. I got into a bit of a, an argument with a friend of mine, a public person just yesterday and we really got into it on the phone and I made it clear and I've done this a couple times lately, made it clear with people that even if we're apoplectically angry at each other, this is not going to end the friendship, at least for me.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       Awesome. And I feel very, that comes very easy for me to say that I, it really does. And I don't know why that's so hard for other people to do that. We're so now willing and maybe it is a social media thing in a short attention span thing or something like we're so willing to just shred things that we've had yet lends itself to a really interesting question. What would be, since we're talking personally, if I may, what would be a deal breaker for relationship? And I was at dinner with my family a few weeks ago and my son, you've met my son. Yeah, I junior kid almost always keep my family's names. And so far it started talking about one of the things you've learning about in school is gender and social constructs and sex changes. And he said to my wife, if dad decided to become a woman, would you still be married to him?

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       And my wife without an instance of hesitation said no. And both my children were flabbergasted, but they couldn't. They couldn't. And then they kept pressing her and she said basically, you know, this isn't what I signed up for and, and it just made me think. So what are the limits of friendship? Like what would the limits of friendship, I mean I can think of a few things. Well if you, if I found out that you murdered somebody, you're a cold blooded murderer or you had done something so duplicitous directly related to me too, or even even I would have made me even to someone else. Or I'm in Korea. Yeah, it doesn't have it. We couldn't make a scale like, but what if I started filling my pockets when you're in the kitchen with grapes and that I saw in the fray. Great. See, I told you you could have anything out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       I know, I know right now. The funny thing is we'd have a relationship. I didn't ask. I was, I take it anyway, so, so like what if I went into your bedroom when you were gone and went through your drugs like there, there are, there are. You know what those limits are, are different. But I would, I suggest that it really comes down to virtue and trust and those sorts of relationships give your life so much meaning and are so fulfilling and are so profound. They make for a life worth living. And Nat, I think what we need to put front and center in our lives and even that stuff on addiction is fascinating. Um, rice addiction medicine doctor. And she gave this really interesting presentation about how one of the, the reasons that people become and stay addicts and all the studies, and this is the art of my area of expertise, but basically these does these studies on rad parks and when rats are given wheels and fun thing or habit trails wherever wraps, like they're much less likely to choose narcotics then if they're not.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       And one of those things is these relationships that we develop and we nurture throughout our lives. And I guess I would like to be the sort of person for whom being a person of integrity and virtue and having those deeply fulfilling relationships enhances my life and my friendship. And then when you call me and you say, hey, this is up. Thanks for that, I appreciate you did this. And that was as a massive dick move. Thanks. I appreciate that. So I know we've talked about, we've definitely talked about this privately, but I think we may have talked about it last time also, but I think it'd be good to recharge if someone does exactly what you just said, find that virtuous life but needs to do it through belief but does the exact same thing. Do you think that that is somehow still an inherent problem with, with the proper, not the proper way to be a human, but just well, what's the problem then if somebody does that?

Speaker 2:          00:22:24       Uh, well there, there are two to two issues with that. One is what's the problem? Does that cause a problem with your relationship to somebody? So I have a friend who's, not only is he a hardcore Christian, he writes children's books trying to indoctrinate people into Christian. Phil Vischer, the guy from veggies, Veggie Tales, just be on very good friend of mine, Alex and such. So this shows you can be friends with some you can and, and I've confided in her about things and I trust him and I have told him in no uncertain terms, I think he's harboring a, not a misconception, but delusion about the nature of reality. And we've had a civil talk, no one threw fisticuffs Nolan. We talk about that in the context of our friendship, but that wasn't sufficient for him to end the Pie. Never had any idea where we were talking about the side that wasn't sufficient for him to withdraw from the friendship and the friendship.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       And that's a core belief. I mean that's an antithetical belief to what I've devoted my professional life is to helping people think clearly and critically and overthrow Dogma and an ideology and morally motivated reasoning. But I think the problem, the problem with that is it depends on what you want to have, what your relationship to truth wants to, what you think it should be. There would be something to me if, if somebody was friends with me and a genuine friend in a virtuous friend, only because they feared that if they would not do that, they would go to hell. There would be something suspect in that for me. But what or who wasn't that? What if they just, they just had some belief that, you know what I mean? Like whatever it is. Or they just had some belief that Karma prove our car. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:24:08       Okay. Karma is a great, yeah. So they just believed in Karma. What they're going to put out there is going to come back to them because of that they become the virtuous type of person that you aspire to be. But it's a, it's a, it's a great question. I think I've shifted my stance on that over the years, but I guess I'm having trouble with the question because I don't really think someone can truly be virtuous if they harbor beliefs based on a faulty epistemology. Right. So we could sort of get lost, but my definition of virtue then, let's just say that's the case. Uh, would the world would be better off in human flourishing, would be contributed to if more people had this false belief of view than if we resorted to this hub Sian state? Um, yeah. I, I guess the problem would be, uh, if they alone believe that and didn't try to institutionalize that, I think it would be, it would be less of a problem than I would have said even two or three years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       Yeah. And I think perhaps, and I'll watch the video again myself, I think you might've answered that a little bit differently and I'm, which shows a flexible mind. Do you ever fear that as, as a public person, you say things, you tweet, things you do, interviews, you go on podcasts, all those things that people are gonna be like, ah, you see he two years ago he said something else and it's like, they just want to get you so, so that, that should what we really need to understand. Yeah. So that should be a virtue. It should be a virtue that you change your mind. I will admit it's hard for me to admit, but it's true. It's so difficult when you're constantly under attack and constantly under siege to say it's, it's far more difficult. Not only to say I made a mistake, but like, look, I really thought about this and then you get, that's why I've stopped reading my twitter mentions or facebook and none of it, I don't read any of it anymore because it's just so filled with hate and rage.

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       And even if you look at the terms we use, the moral valence to terms have like flip flopping, flip flopping is a negative thing. Like you change your mind, but you should change your mind if your commander in chief and the situation on the ground changes, you didn't have access to that. Oh, he flip flop about troops in Iraq or bunk Guantanamo. Well, we live in a dynamic world where things are in flux and they change. But I have, I have found, I have definitely found that being that sort of person who's not willing to change my mind, but the open open admission of that on twitter or facebook has become more difficult as people ramp up their personal slanders and attacks. Yeah. So I'm, I'm very aware of that, that I'm dying to talk to you about this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       Diana talked to you about what's been going on with you. I've had some strange things going on. We'll get there in just one second. You also had another that sort of attack on you who sort of similar to what I had on me, but that, but I think you're really onto something there that I don't think it's, if someone, you know, sometimes people will say, well, you said this three years ago, I, you used to believe this. They'll look at some of my tweets when I was a far left progressive. Yeah. And look what used to make fun of white people for this. And I go, yeah, you're not proving me. What are you trying to prove? You're proving that yes, I evolved. He's changed your mind and you say, wow, this guy had tooken information and as a result isn't there, but you're rational people too. That's what, right. That's what you're supposed to do. But you're also right about the, the other point, which is that when you're under attack from people, when you feel like everything you're going to say is that then you stop having those nice moments of mayor culpas contrition. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       You know what else you stop doing, which is interesting. You stop asking questions and, and you might ask the questions yourself, but you, you don't want to articulate those questions or you don't want to articulate those rebuttals because you don't, you really don't want to receive 500 emails and shift through all of the telling you you're a shithead and you should go die and kill yourself and people write in your name and the walls is a Nazi. They see you stopped doing that. I mean, like give an example. I was this film I was in with Michael Shermer reasons to believe, and I made a comment about a pussy hats. These people having pussy ass and, and it makes it look like we, this is not the image you want to portray. And someone, I got an unbelievable amount of, of, uh, just crazy target about that. But one of the things I thought was, I almost said I came so close to saying, do you think Martin Luther King would have been more respected or less respected if he had a pussy hat on? I mean, it would've been the perfect thing to say, but I didn't say it because I didn't want hundreds of emails and tweets about me being a racist. So I think we're in a precarious situation right now. And I think Sam is getting this crazy amounts, asking questions, opening conversations. We need to have those conversations. We need, I need

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       to ask those questions. You're talking about Sam Harris just, yeah, Sam Ash, uh, had Charles Murray on even Gary Tobbs, the guy who the, the anti sugar guy. So what do you do then if you were in my position or in Santa this position when I see some articles written about balance and, well, Ruben talked to this guy or this guy or this gal and they think this and Ruben didn't ask them this and all this stuff. So Sam gets to this too, by the way. I mean, vox did a really hatchet job. It misrepresents what him and Charles Murray talked about, how long a hit pieces and write and and slate. Just wrote something about you were going to talk about the conceptual penis shortly and what happened with with salon, but all of those things they add up to us not having any more conversation because at some point it's just like, all right, well then I'll just yet

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       I'll just talk to, it's not that I'll talk to people that I agree with. I'll just talk to people who say nothing. That's right. Because then I've completely insulated myself. Right, and no, it'll really show. So this is, this is, I think what we need to do. I think we need to figure out everybody, James Lindsey actually gave me this idea and I think he's absolutely right, a coauthor of the conceptual penis, a social contract. We need to figure out whose voice matters. Certain people matter and in general this hate and vitriol comes from the least accomplished people who in need. There's a really nice niche in frame to talk about this there. They viewed, there's kind of an oversimplified but, but their slaves, their situation, reality is their slaves and they discharge these primal urges on people. It's like the Australians have this term tall poppy syndrome.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       When it's something gross, hi, you just cut it down. So as Ruben grows and subscribers and that's where if I could just cut reuben down, you know, fuck them. It's kind of that Nazi white supremacy, homophobia. So we gay marriage you Nazi homophobe right? I know it's overwhelming, but we have to figure out whose voices matter and then we need to, we need to have those friendships, a virtue. So when people come to us and say something, we can really listen. But the way to not do it is to look at, as you've said repeatedly to look at an egg on twitter. It's probably a 12 year old in their basement. We just can't take those voices seriously. All right. So sort of couched around everything we're talking about so far is, is sort of good and evil. That tactics that some people use to be involved in a conversation and the motives that we have, whether it be because you're a believer or a nonbeliever, anything else.

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       I've come to a place where I think right now in 2017 we're in a strange spot where the fascinating the institutions that used to help us keep some of this stuff in the lanes. What, what is acceptable, what's not acceptable, what's right and wrong, what's real and not real. Whether it's true or not, that these institutions are crumbling. And by that I mean that media is crumbling. Our political institutions seem to be crying gimmick institution. So that's the one I really want to get into with you. Um, all of these things are starting to crumble. It's partly because information has changed so much. I would argue that even worse than crumble, but what you would say they're, they're decimated already. No, no. I would argue that the academy, certain sections of the Academy of the sciences I think are doing very, very well. The humanities are in shambles.

Speaker 2:          00:32:08       Certain departments, anything tainted by Postmodernism, particularly gender studies, the conceptual penis. Okay. Let's pause for a sec. Okay. Let's just go to the conceptual penis as a social construct. As a social construct, right? You wrote a hoax paper with James Lindsey, right? And you got this publish and we thought it was extremely funny. I mean, I read it, it, it's, it's jaw droppingly ridiculous and argued for climate change, uh, being responsible. The conceptual penis. Yeah. And I thought it was really, it was a satire, sort of the main takeaway of it is that the penis is not really a real thing. It's just this sort of a morphis idea. And we threw in a lot of moral jargon. We throw in what we appeal to their moral sensibilities. Okay. So why Pete, you're an academic. Why would you write a hoax paper? Why would you mark the very institutions of which you are? Because I think that there are departments in the universities that are making a mockery of our institutions. So when you said crumbling, I don't think that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:33:09       Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       that's not the word. I would have used other words. It's accurate in a sense. But these people are fabricating not only their own knowledge bases, they're writing things in journals that they then site that becomes knowledge. They have their manufacturing ideas that are totally untethered to reality. This is how crazy this is. So, so look, I'm going to explain it. I'm gonna try explaining this. You reel me in if this is unclear, but this is idea is so crazy that anybody listening to this exam that can't possibly like this, this can't possibly be true. So this is the idea and then I'm going to give you, you're asking me what belief I'm going to give you an analog and theology. Okay. So what these people do is that they have moral intuitions based upon is thought basically. I'll get to that in a second. So what they do to justify this is they manufacture their own epistemology, their own way to know that justifies the conclusions that they have. So then they can go out and become activists. Now, quick detour. Yeah. One of the,

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:34:19       Biggest problems facing the left right now is anybody who calls out a bad idea is viewed as somebody on the right. We've got to stop that. I know a little something about, you know, a little something about this. Yeah, a lot about this. So let's, I'm going to give you an analogy in theology. So this Guy Alvin Plantinga, he's a Christian philosopher. So he has these beliefs, these, they're actually more than that. Their claims about reality and about Jesus being the son of God. So he realizes that there's no evidence they can take them there usually. So what does he do? He manufactured his own epistemology. He said, well, you know, we're going to say that there's this thing called the God center and the God center. Some people have it and it allows you to just as I apprehend the color red, so to do I apprehend God. So he makes an epistemology to justify these insane claims about the nature of reality. So just as he has done that

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       critical theory is that epistemology that is used, and I can explain that is complex. I'm afraid we're gonna lose people. We got a lot of terms we've got to throw out. It's very complicated. But what I would like to attempt to do in this segment is to link the madness on campuses right now to the intellectual engines driving that madness. And the make no mistake about it. These departments tainted by postmodernism are absolutely filled with zealots and morally motivated. Either ideologues, I'll do a little catch up so that in case anyone's missing anything. So first let's, let's talk about what is postmodernism. I know, I know, most knows that, but let's just, let's just do a couple of definitions. Quicks okay, so let's do the definition. So, okay, so the Frankfurt, Frankfurt school has this idea of, well that's even, go back for it. Let's go back to Karl Marx.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       Karl Marx was a philosopher. Ooh, here's a bonus question. Why did Hitler hate call marks? I feel like there's a good punchline. Well, it's not a joke. It's actually true cause he was a Jew. Jews touched where, but otherwise they are great guy. No, no, no. Um, uh, okay. So, so mark's Marxist economics and these people aren't Marxists. They're more Marxian would be a better term marks. Economics looks at the world in terms of economical pressure, their oppressor classes, et cetera. So they have, and then we'll get to the idea of postmodern postmodernism. Very, it's as simple and complicated should they've taken this idea of these Marxian notions of oppressor classes and looked at them in terms of gender and race and for example, the patriarchy. And then they have hierarchically prioritized people within that list. So the Patriarchy is white, heterosexual, cisgendered, which is a thing males.

Speaker 2:          00:37:19       And they want it at the top of this. We're a bank. I am. Absolutely. But that's the other thing they do just like religion, they have their own defense mechanisms and that's what they say. Well you can't criticize it because you're a CIS gendered, white, heterosexual male and and is the ultimate irony of this. That is prejudice. That is prejudging. Ah, okay. I, I then sit here and go, wait a minute. Okay. Aigner but cozy in a white, straight CIS gendered male. So we judge you based on your immutable characteristic. Okay. So this is indispensable to talk about. So you are using words based upon normal, ordinary definition. I'll give you an example some more. It's like, so when you use racism, it's the way I use most people who aren't in, haven't been indoctrinated by gender studies and the postmodern left. It's the idea that you do not judge people particularly negatively, but you don't make judgments about people based upon an immutable characteristic like their skin color.

Speaker 2:          00:38:19       But they've changed that definition to make it systemic racism. They've changed that definite definition to put in, um, a power vector, that hierarchical power vector that only flows one way. So for example, and this blacks cannot be racist whites, so they have snuck, it's very sneaky. They've taken a normal word, added a, a, a, a moral component to it and change the definition of a word. It, it, you know, here's some, if I may give you some more examples, like, um, equality. Equality is a good thing, but they've shifted from a quality to equity. Now what does equity mean? Equity means where we need a certain number of people, representative of the general population of 17% African Americans. We need to have 17% but the problem is that that, that they also want to take in to account historical discrimination and a kind of reparations for that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:16       So those numbers are even higher. So it's, I think it can be summarized in Ruth Bader Ginsburg's quip or joke or whatever it is. How many few females, Supreme Court justices do you think there should be nine. So it's not just right, it's not just that we want equal representation, we want more because of past injustices. Go ahead. Because this is this get, we got to talk about deconstruction. We got to talk about violence. We can talk about why all these things. When you understand them from this mindset, they're all coming from the same school of thought effected by critical theory. That's why the most inelegant, let's define critical theory. Yeah. So critical theory is this idea that you, um, that traditional power dynamics and traditional, and this is oversimplified, but it's a general idea from which we can have a starting point for a conversation. See, that's again, I thought to myself, I'm going to get 500 emails and just trying to, and it makes me again, it, it makes me self sensor and then I'm like come on.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       Yeah, okay. That's a real, that's a real, I don't want to get lost in that. That is a real thing. I mean I find it for myself to know is I tried to talk broadly about things because I want to communicate big ideas and hopefully people will then read some books or watched some other videos or follow some other people on twitter or whatever. And then even if you talk about, well he, he, yeah, he wept over that. Right? Or he didn't know that. So why didn't you talk about the Frankfurt school like quick you didn't mention Horkheimer wants, are doing over. All these guys are let guys know. And you know, just, you just get to a point where all of that stuff just centering essentially. It just, it's not dementia is the message. It's not good for you. It's not good for conversations. It's not good for, okay. So anyway, that's why I mentioned the think was efficient and I think that was an acquisition right now if you think for yourself and you are not afraid to buck the trend, they will come to get you. It's exactly, we're talking about so critical theory. So it's the idea

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       that um, the, it's basically a Marxist idea. It's the idea that there are these entrenched power structures and entrenched power dynamics. And one of the things that we need to do is we need to recognize these and then we need to overthrow the, we need to deconstruct these traditional hierarchies to make society more. That's the thing. More equitable, more fair, more what did it, what is it? It's complicated. So these kids protesting at evergreen or have, they don't just x Niello just get this idea that they just gonna it just does it. No, they get this. These are coming out of specific departments in the university and when they're asked, why do you do this? So what is this? They they talk, well my professor said this and then this is the, the insane part that gets back to the conceptual penis again. That these people have their own lines of literature.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       That is the, these are intellectual cesspools to have that's going to be talking about, no, so they have their tags that they have manufactured what they think. That's why they have to like with cultural appropriation, they have to import ideas like power because it isn't it, the whole thing is made up. It's completely fabricated because they want to use, they want to overthrow these traditional hierarchies. So these kids get this idea from their professors who then get promoted and tenure because they publish in journals and their stuff is almost never cited by anybody. But yet that's how you rise up. And then what happens is you have a whole Canon of knowledge and you go out and teach people and then you have diversity training and, and the, the shame of this whole thing is that there is legitimacy to white power. There is legitimacy to some of this stuff, but the way that it's metastasized almost doesn't allow any kind of liberation.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       It does almost the exact opposite of what they want to do because it gets you people like trump. But one more thing I would say. Yeah, but, but then what happens is it goes to colleges of education and then they start teaching. And I think I told you my son has in his geography has geography, civics. I can't remember. I'm looking at stuff he doesn't, they've never even opened a map. They've never opened a map. They've never in civics class, how many Supreme Court justices? Legislative branch, how many said none of that stuff. But he knows everything about the black panthers. But he knows everything about the civil rights. The civil rights movement is extremely important. Wonderful stuff. But it should not. We need to look, I'm looking at him at, we need kids need to know what countries above Canada. Anyway, all of this stuff gets back to certain departments in the university that are pumping out nonsense that are indoctrinating people and exactly like a religion, they have their own defensive structures there.

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       You know, being offended as the new thing I inclusion is another word that they've changed the meaning of. So there was a direct line between is this company, is this clear so far? I'm with you to me. Yeah. Okay. So there's a judge with the audience. Okay. So cause if it's not clear, something needs to be unpacked. So they want to overthrow these traditional and they've manufactured their own base of scholarship to do so. So how would you, that's why it's worse than crumbling because at least if something crumbles, something worse didn't take its place. Like if in a lot like it's like a having an alarm clock that rings randomly. So it's worse than just having an alarm clock that doesn't work. It's, they're pumping out fabricated nonsense. It's totally untethered to reality in the moment you call these people out on it. They don't believe in dialogue in any way they deal.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       They'll slander you. The write your name on the bathroom wall, they'll scream at you. So the only thing to do is you've got to hoax some you, you, you got to have a nontraditional way to deal with people who are so fundamentally irrational that they're going to have a conversation and that led you to writing this hoax and turning this thing on its head. All right there, there was so much there I want to get to. So first of all, what's the connection with the religious mind that people have? Wonderful, this strikes me as the new religion politics but, but this leftist postmodern marks and stuff that this is the new religion. They, they mon hundred bakemark everyone else for their beliefs, but they have a belief that is so tethered to their own being that if you challenge it in any way they outcome, well they'll hate you.

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       But they'll also outkast anyone 100% correct. And so what do you say about that? So that is an awesome question. So Lindsay and I wrote him on every now and wrote and wrote a paper again, uh, privileges the original sin for the left. So, but there is one fundamental difference. You're, you're having schermer and prager come into the studio and debate and it's going to be civilized. No one's going to punch each other. They have fundamental, actually very fundamental, just moral disagreements. And one of them prager blends that you cannot have morality without God. And shermer believes the complete opposite. So this is powerful stuff, right? They've agreed and they're going to have a dialogue about that. And I'm not going to score, I don't know if it's a debate. I, I, I don't really, I'm not a fan of Beta. Having a conversation is much better.

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       But so, so you have the same mechanisms in the, in this new secular religion, you have privilege, which is a type of original sin. You have blasphemy laws, which are political correctness. We're really clear that. So would you say the privileges, the originals, and that's like saying Jesus died for your sins, basically. Like you're, if you were born white and especially CIS gendered heterosexual, that Shit that you are, that you are the, there's nothing you can ditch. Yeah. To. And this is the part that except bow, this is the part that's the mind blow. And this is the part that makes me unbelievably sympathetic to Christians in particular as opposed to other religions. That's really changed my mind significantly. Christians have a redemption narrative. These people have no redemption narrative. If you're a privileged, that's it. You're fucked. Like you, there is no redemption for you.

Speaker 2:          00:47:28       You can bow down for us. Yeah. So there, there's something about being able to be redeemed that these people don't have. And that's why you see these vitriolic attacks. They're merciless on other people on the left eating other people on the left, the old, the old bras, you know, the snake that eats itself. Yeah. So, okay. Yeah. So yeah, so it is a new secular religion and they have, maybe we have modules in our brain, I don't know. And maybe it's covariant there with culture. There are things in the culture and act in our brain. And we have the same thing we have in Jonathan hightest. It talked about three of purity versus saying to maybe we have, you know, ways of interpreting reality, but make no mistake, this is a secular religion. And when you call out the emperor having no clothes, you dad is that you have committed,

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       you are in trouble. Right. Which I think has a bit to do have the, the recent hatchet jobs that have been done on me and you, so sleep basically wrote a piece about you after this whole thing, right? And it really was kind of strong madding what you did, but the attacks were also kind of personal. And that's

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       always is an interesting, you know, in salon goes after me or you asleep cause after me or you or Sam, whoever Harris, who, wherever they go after there was a kind of Pr Animus. There's a kind of personal attack that is not just a, an engagement of the, hey look, you know, you did this, this is why it's not right. Right, right. You know it's not, oh yeah, maybe it was funny, but you're wrong about this and here's why. Oh, deeply personal attack on someone. So I called them on the phone. I think I emailed them at least one toy few times and I said, look, you guys wrote this about me. I would like an opportunity to respond to this. Nothing. Then I went on twitter and I said, hey, can I please have an opportunity to just, well you know he won't sleep. I don't know the exact wording was but can I, I'd like an opportunity. Nothing. I would like an arbitrary, I don't know. Maybe that's a new thing in journalism. Like you just write hit pieces on someone and then you don't give him an office.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       I think Hayes, I think it is. I think what's starting to happen is that because journal isn't, because mainstream journalism is crumbling. Yeah. I still use that, that adjective there and, and nobody cares about CNN anymore. Right. And even the New York Times I think has, has gone in a really terrible direction cause they love a lot of the ideas that you're talking about. But since the institutions are crumbling, well now everybody just picks their website that they can try. Those websites are funded by all sorts of different things. And if you've got an editor who has bought in to your postmodern bullshit in this case, well you know, you can say whatever the hell you want about Peter, Dave, or whoever else and you're going to get backing. So for this whole craziness that happened with me and mother Jones says truth, truth has been removed from that.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       Right, right. Which has been removed from that and to, for them for this editor. So they, the title of the thing was about the, the new extremist further to the right. We have to talk about that. So we have to talk about that. I have to be out of your mind or, or, or just a lie are of the highest order to think that of me. You can, yeah. You can criticize me for all you want. I, I address criticism. I hear if people think I don't ask the right, it's not just that he's a terrible journalist. He has a religious mindset. Like, this is a religion to these people. So that, so that's the interesting thing. So then I went on the full on, I mean I was like, you know what? You picked the wrong person to fuck with. Right. And I went on the absolute attack.

Speaker 1:          00:50:44       I was defended publicly by you Brogan and a whole slew of other people to the tens of thousands of retweets and things of that. And then V to I guess two days ago, he was writing about how noah, he doesn't believe I'm an extremist, but he doesn't, you know, there's no public correction. They do slight things at the end of the article that no one's gonna ever see wikipedia that is still run with the real thing. Exactly. Goes, I tagged the editor, this woman, Clara Jeffery and all of the, in all the tweets, she never responds. She's never gotten this much twitter attraction, but they don't feel a need to because they know that their monster is just going to keep moving forward. And that's what I'm trying to figure out the antidote. So just to be clear, you and so what did he say about your show? The title and you can look at it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       Maybe it still is pinned tweet right now though I suspect he's either deleted it or removed it all together was something about the rise of the new extremism or the newest extremists that are further to the right than Breitbart. Then he includes me in that where he refers to me as far right, right. Then eventually change that to just write which the right left thing doesn't even make any sense anymore. I can put all that aside. As I mentioned at the top, Forbes called this a conservative show last week. I've said to you, I think you were the first one I ever said it to, that defending my liberal principles is becoming a conservative position. So all of these labels are starting to make no sense and that's just part of the what's happened here and that sort of thing. So a couple of things here.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       If you had an itemized checklist, if you could just write your beliefs down and you check you and I would both overwhelmingly fall into the liberal camp, not the left camp. Right. And that's why I've been saying liberal is not left. Dad is a crane. It's from state complaint. But just to be clear for you, so without naming the person who wrote the article, the guy who wrote the article that would make, yeah, Josh Harkinson. Okay. Is Josh invited on your show? Yeah, I invited him immediately. I said No. Is he still invited on your show? And he wrote something started like first I said, come on my show, I'll give you the first 10 minutes without talking. He didn't respond to that. Then today, finally days later I respond to it again and say, or the day we're taping, this is off of when we're airing it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       But today I wrote, you know, will you come on the show? You Hack. So then I was being a little more heavy handed and you're old. I won't come on cause you called me a name. I mean how many wouldn't come? So the hack thing was just an excuse, just to be completely clear. You said I was going to sit here for 10 minutes or so. You'd come on, you can sit here and 10 minutes I will sit here and I wasn't anything outside of the editor too, by the way. She's welcome to come on and all that. But, but in an odd way, maybe that, and someone pointed this out to me on twitter, one of the strange, odd, same voices said, Dave, that was to be the worst thing you could do. Because what you're doing is you're encouraging more people to do things like urging people to say crazy things about you.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       You then get in a huff puff and you gotta defend yourself and now what's the next thing? Now you got to, you got to sit and take it on your own show, which is so completely against the ideas that you care about. Like I don't want my life to be that. You know what I mean? And that's why my left to me that either. Yeah. So it's a, it's an odd punish. It is. And yet you don't want to just ignore it. It's against human nature to be attacked and to just sit down and take. That's why we talked before about you have to figure out whose voices matter. Yeah. And, and I mean I don't know anything about this guy, but does his voice mattered to you? I mean is this guy's opinion no hit, he's utterly irrelevant to me. But he wrote a piece in a publication that has saw so, so the publication has some relevance.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       And by the way, this guy, as I mentioned at the top also, he was one of 40 people that the Virginia Gop Baseball Games shooter followed. So we know that that guy was, was riled up by a lot of the political stuff he was reading. Cause you could just look at his facebook and all that to see that and how much he hated Republicans, whatever. So if you're calling me an extremist there, there's a cost now that ideas and intentions matter, which is why I think you can attack the hell out of ideas and you and you not can, you should, but there's a need. You should be instigating violence and, and there in lies the rub. How do you feel now about all this now that it's been a day behind you and him? Did you, do you feel angry when it happened on Friday?

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       I was, I was livid. I was in New York City and I was walking in the middle of Time Square. So I'm in Times Square, the craziest place on earth. Like, you know, stimulation via bananas and whatever, and I'm just flicking off twitter and I'm calling people and like I'm going to destroy them and everything else. And uh, you know, some people said to me, this is the very definition of libel because it's the mantras really untrue. He's attacking your income source because of the reference to Patriot on all these other things. I don't want to sue the guy, uh, by, by the way, I've been on the record as saying I am for libel and I'm a free speech absolutist, but there are laws that we have related to liable. That's a secondary thing. Uh, but then on, on Monday, uh, when it calmed down, when I got home from New York on Sunday night, you know this cause you're, you're in my house right now.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       I came home and my dog was staggering around Emma. She's 13. I love, love, love this dog with every fiber of my being. She uh, she was a rescue from Hurricane Katrina. I've had her for 11 years and she was staggering and she was having trouble standing and she looked confused and her eyes are darting around and then I spent the night and we had to bring her as she stayed at the, at the animal hospital over night. We just got her back today and she has some issues that we're hopefully going can work on, but it completely put everything in perspective. That animal is more important to me than this bullshit. Right. Without question. It doesn't mean I'm not going to get riled up. But my love of this animal farts, what we talked about before about relationships in, and you have really, I have two too,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       create a crazy dogs. But those relationships matter and in that sense they, they not superseded, not override, but it made you refocus on what mattered. Like you could be doing all this stuff like that thing and private Ryan, that scene where the guy's like saying, are we going to do this? We this and he gets a bullet in the head. You know, like now you have a sick animal, you know, like your, your dog is sick and you love your dog. And I dunno, I guess it's interesting. I don't know whether or not having him on would be your mistake or not because it would encourage other people to do the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       Yeah. Well I know it would because it's a feeding frenzy. We know how these guys operate. We've seen this before with many things in college. Yeah. What do you think his motivation was? I mean, I know you can't, what is the motivation? Because I believe that it's exactly what you're talking about, that it's this religious, uh, you were it, what was the word you use there? Was this religious, quasi religious or moral motivated? A secular religion. Security. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's this secular religion that they so believe. So I veered off the path for these guys. It doesn't matter that I'm gay, married, doesn't matter that I'm pro pot. It doesn't matter that I'm pro choice. It doesn't matter that I'm for euthanasia to check us all the way down. And one side is religious and this is why I talk about the left more because on the right, even though they know all of those things, I still get invited places.

Speaker 1:          00:57:49       I get put on prager u videos. I get invited to college kids that want to talk to me. They put aside all the different, I was at a libertarian, uh, students for liberty thing. I said, I'm for single payer healthcare. Libertarians don't like that. They booed me, but then laughed. We laughed about it and I kind of mock them for boomi. Guys were the tolerant ones on guys and they got it. I don't get any invites the other way. So that's why I think that phrase is so perfect because this is the new religion. It is the new religion. Why do you think you don't get msnbc doesn't have you on, I don't know. I can't beg him. I was on Fox last week. Greg Gutfeld, which I think is a great guy. He was going to come on in here really doing good stuff. We disagree on some stuff. Okay. Big Dam up, but I can't beg them. Why does, why does Fox put on Ion and MSNBC? Does he see that? I mean, they've got such a wonderful question that demand that we should demand answers to that. Did you see last week that the hearings last week a hawk, what's his name? The actor that plays Hulk? Uh, the actor that Plays Hall Company helped me here.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       Mark refollow. Oh yeah. He said, the thing about, you know, MSNBC is hiring these white conservatives. And it's so interesting because he's judging people's political opinions on their skin color number one. Now he's a white guy who plays a green guy so that there's something occurring. You know, you must, as a philosophy professor mustard up, there's gotta be some deep shit there. But even putting that aside, if they started hiring a bunch of black conservatives, he wouldn't be happy about that either because he would accuse them of being uncle toms or something. We can party. It's like Clarence Thomas, you know, we need more Supreme Court justices there a bike too. Like would you rather have more

Speaker 2:          00:59:23       Clarence Thomas is on the Supreme Court or would you rather have more white liberals on the Supreme Court? So what do you think is the antidote to this? Because I've been trying to push the ideas of classical liberalism. As you know, I believe that the individual is the only antidote to this. If you relentlessly stand for the individual, you will always stand for our differences. You will always be tolerant of our differences because you will realize that your different than the next guy. You won't look at somebody and prejudge them based on color or say I have to treat them like are some animal because they have this level of uh, oppression where the other that, okay, so you put, you put your finger on the problem. So let's talk about the opposite problem. Intersectionality is the problem. We haven't talked about that, but that there is grievance jockeying. Gad said the oppression, Olympics, etc.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       We we need the opposite of Internet intersectionality and we need union [inaudible] and there's a line of literature called a superordinate identities. So let's unpack that real quick. Have you seen the Heineken commercial? Yes. It's incredible. It's amazing. It's, it's everything that I've tried to do here. Okay, so that's what we need. We don't need, can you just lay it out real quick for you? We'll lay out the heineken cholesterol. They just basically get people together who you'd think have nothing to do with each other or should we write political enemies or personal enemies and they sit down over a drink and do it and they do it well then they, they, they're not sex. No, no. They do some task, right. There's some hard task and then at the end they say, do you want to have a beer? And they say, and then they talk as an example of a, of, of a union ality as opposed to intersectionality.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       We're not grieving. We're not trying to find out who has the most strikes against them, who's the most depressed and then they get the most, um, they get the rights to talk. The blm, uh, can, uh, over over can talk to the pride Martin March or what have you, what we need to do is, or the shooting in Virginia right now, we need to appeal to larger identities and we need to coalition build and I see the left over and over again continuing to dig down in identity politics, continuing to, uh, use intersectionality to find the most marginalized and oppressed groups and then to attempt to change either the nature of words either or, and the structure of the rule sets and our institutions to privilege these folks. John Rawls had this whole thing, salt, but I think superordinate identities, finding identities and things that we have in common and working to build coalitions and I, and I think if we, if the left continues to do that, we'll either get another four years of trump or that other lunatic pants.

Speaker 2:          01:02:10       It, right. It's, we need to build identities. It's funny that you describe it that way because you're, you're talking about postmodernism, you're talking about cultural, Marxism, all this stuff. And yet so people will go, well Pete, Pete must be right. It must be on the right. It must be some sort of evil conservative or whatever. And yet you're not. No, and I do more I think, by the way, I don't want to use conservative. As I said this chapter, I don't want to use it as a pejorative. I mean, so that's the thing I don't feel at home. I no longer, and maybe it's cause I'm oddly situated there, that's another word they love. I'm oddly situated in the academy and Portland new, which is very left to center anyway. Even though the overwhelming majority of my beliefs I would call self identify as a classical liberal.

Speaker 2:          01:02:51       I no longer feel at home with anything to do with things that are even broadly the left. And you and other people have called for the new center. I think that might be what we need. I certainly don't feel at home in the right. And again, in terms of that checklist of beliefs they have. So I feel that I'm efficient cause I kind of feel like when I lived in Albuquerque I feel that I'm wandering, not wondering. I feel that I've, I don't have a home and I don't feel comfortable anywhere, but one of the consequences of not feeling comfortable is when you meet people who share those beliefs, you have a kind of ideological kinship. You have a kind of, wow, we're really on the out chair right there. We're, we're really trying to figure this out. We're really trying to make some, we try to live a good life. We're trying to be decent. People were trying to make decisions on the base of evidence and yeah, we changed our minds and, but we're not at home and the right, we're not at home on the left were being excoriated on the, on the left for calling out, never make calling out somebody bullshit, a right wing thing.

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       The moment you've done that, you're, you're, you're, you've become a farce, a caricature of yourself. It's a farce. You know, it's so interesting you've hit on so many things because I love what we're doing here because it's, we're talking about the sort of these broad issues, but then also how they are directly related to us as people and that's what I think really matters. And even, you know, just a week ago or so, and I think it was in Philadelphia, they unveiled their new gay pride rainbow flag, but now it has a black and brown color bar, you know, to new color bars to represent people of color. And this is the height of absurdity. The rainbow flag represented all gay people, White Gay people, Asian Gay people, Muslim gay people, the Jewish gay people, et Cetera, et cetera. There was no racial connotation to it. And the gay community, at least from what I can tell, this is pretty good on, on most race issues you see more couples I think that are racially different or diverse or all that stuff. But now because they had to bow to whatever that, I don't know if it was directly related to black lives matter or whatever, but because they had to bow to them, they've literally ruined the rainbow. The rainbow is we know what the rainbow is now they're telling us the rainbow is inherently part of the patriarchy or you're a racist.

Speaker 2:          01:05:03       There anything, I didn't end up but, but here's the personal part.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       So I thought all of this, obviously I don't think I'm blowing anyone's mind when I say this. They understand what I think. But I didn't even want to tweet about it cause I didn't even feel like getting involved on this one. It's like I got to pick my battles and if I was gonna say, well, someone's using you're racist. You don't want a black bar and a brown bar on that. But my point would be there was no racial kind of tissue. You're now making it racist and guess what? Somebody's years from now he's going to have some other thing that they want to put on there and they're going to have to make sure they're more oppressive than you. And this is the endless snake eating itself. Something just within that, you know, I'm taking about emily being sick. I think that's one of the things that people don't see when they attack you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       I think that's one of the things that people don't like. You're just a guy living in your life. You've got a dog, you've got a husband you're trying to make through the day, like everybody else. And I think people need to take a step back and realize that we're actually people like Dave Rubin is a guy and he's a good guy and he likes Heineken or, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I'm a Ford Guy. More footwear, we're flawed people. And if you have a a problem with somebody, it's much better. And it's not necessarily the tone of the criticism. Uh, and I, you know, I feel, I feel weird saying, well, I to start doing attack, Dave Rubin, what? I don't think, you're not saying don't attack me. I want to do whatever they want to do anyway. But I think that you would get more mileage and more attention if those criticisms were devoid of personal attacks.

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       And you said, Reuben said this, this is why I think it's wrong and you lay it out. Well, that's what I said before when people would attack me and said, well, Dave, you didn't ask this question. Are you asked the question the wrong way or you you, you know my policy on interviewing as I like to give rope to let people, hey look, I just asked you a lot of really broad questions. If you didn't know where you were talking about, you would have hung yourself. I in this instance, I don't think you did, but I've had guests that I think do, but those I, those are criticisms I'm more than happy to address and I, I hope that five years from now I'm so much of a better interviewer that I look back on this and think this is shit. I want to be better.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       I want to be that. But if you're, if you're going a jumping off point is this guy's a right wing extremist, well then we're, we're not going to really do this, but I think what we've done here for the hour is pretty good. We're going to wrap this thing cause we're, we're going to dinner with some friends cause we don't, we didn't make up this friendship thing were no, it's a legitimate, no, it wasn't an artifact of a say. Yeah. You want to get drunk or what? Probably yeah, probably. I'm only supposed cause my diamond a low sugar diet is interesting. So I'm only supposed to drink Pinot grigio now. So I've been drinking a ton of that. So, uh, I think that's our, I like the red, but it was a pleasure as always. And we have to do these more than once a year because I think it's a good, it's a good catch up and it's a good, uh, I have no problem.

Speaker 1:          01:07:51       You grading whether I've moved forward or or, or breast or whatever. I think it would be a fun thing. Yeah. And, and who knows where our ideas are going to go. Who knows how our beliefs will change when we're confronted button new evidence. But here's what we do know. If either one of us thinks that we've gone off the rails or that we've made a mistake, we're going to call it out to the other one and we're going to do so in the context of a friendship. Well said for more on Peter Boghossian orb, and he doesn't mind which way you say it. A follow him on the twitter, although he may not check as mentioned to that much at Peterborough. Roseann.
