Speaker 1:          00:01          All right, let's talk about college and education this week. Perhaps the best way to dive into this discussion is to first tell you guys a bit about my own personal experience. I went to public school in Long Island from kindergarten through high school and then onto binghamton university. New York actually has a pretty great college system for decades and since I was a resident, tuition was discounted to just a fraction of what most colleges costs. Now I got a solid education at an affordable public school and have used my degree in political science to do exactly what you all tuned in to see me do now. It was my education that led me to guiding conversations about important topics with interesting people. I will spend a lot of time in college smoking pot and listening to fish. Uh, but that's another story for another time. This show has been devoted to discussing ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:49          That very concept is rooted in a good education in which you can question what you believe. This is the number one reason to go to college, to learn how to think critically. When we talk about a battle of ideas, you can only have that battle when people know what their ideas are actually based on when we talk about free speech, you can only really talk about knowing why free speech is important and what happens to societies that don't have it. When we talk about the dysfunction of our political process, you can really only understand it if you know the basic tenants of how it was designed to work in the first place and when we talk about the complex issues facing the Middle East, you can really only understand them if you know the history of the countries and the people living there. I didn't learn all of these things in college, but the foundation of having my ideas challenged and learning new things absolutely was built.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Their learning is something I try to do on this show each week and it's why I have no problem telling you guys. I don't know everything and I don't have all the answers. At this very moment. The American education system and our colleges in particular are under total assault from the backwards forces on the left who don't want open discussion and would rather stifle ideas they don't like such as critiquing a certain religion or questioning the motives of the social justice movement because of the authoritarian crusade to shelter young people from ideas that might challenge them. We've created safe spaces where we once had rigorous debate. We now issue trigger warnings where we once were brave enough to hear ideas that would make us uncomfortable. The attack on the honest debate has gotten so bad. It is now hard to tell if this intellectual affliction is coming from the students or from the faculty between the professor calling for muscle to remove press from a demonstration at the University of Missouri to students demanding the dean be fired at Yale for defending the freedom of expression to my former guests, Milo yiannopoulos being shouted down while talking about free speech at rutgers just two weeks ago.

Speaker 1:          02:46          The tentacles of intolerance are taking root at colleges all across America, and it's the ideas which take root today. That will be the ideas that lead us into the future. That's the real risk here. We must be willing to exercise our free speech more thoughtfully than to only use it to prevent other people from exercising. There's we have a right to free speech in this country. Not a right to not be offended. My guests, just last week, Ben Shapiro just had a speech about conservatism at cal State University, canceled after leftist activist protested his presence on campus. The school president said that Ben would be invited back, but as part of a panel, when more diverse views can be heard, well that concept doesn't sound terrible in and of itself. Let's really understand what happened here. When the authoritarians be they on the left or on the right, when they like your views, you can speak freely and there's no need for counter voices.

Speaker 1:          03:41          When they don't like your views, well you will be screamed at or outright canceled. This is dangerous and it's happening more and more every day. I sat here for over an hour with Ben and although I didn't agree with him on an array of topics, I listened and I learned from the response we got on the episode, so did many of you, even if all you learned was that you completely disagree with him. That's what conversation is all about and it's that precious space where you learn to think on your own, which is exactly what the point of higher education is supposed to be. College is the single most important place where ideas must be challenged. As I say all the time, let the battle of ideas happen and the good ones will eventually win by slandering opponents, demanding professors be fired and canceling speaking events. These college kids are unwittingly strengthening ideas that will one day silence of them.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Eventually the day will come when they want to say something that's considered unpopular and they will then be subjected to the same practices that they themselves are propagating right now. The second they leave the safety of their college quad and are hit with the harsh reality of the real world. They'll be ill prepared to deal with anyone who doesn't share their myopic view of how things should be to help me dissect this crisis and that's exactly what it is, is Professor Gad said, God is an author, professor and evolutionary behavioral scientists at the John Molson School of business at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. God is also a fearless defender of free speech and an outspoken advocate of free expression in an academic climate that doesn't look too kindly on these things. These days. We're going to dive deep into what has happened at college campuses all over the world and why free speech must be defended at all costs.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Once again, get in your safe space. You've been triggered war, and let's exercise some of that free speech while we still have it set as a professor, author, Youtube Creator, defender of free speech and secular ideas known as the godfather and he's spreading the sad truth. I think you're going to spread a little of it right here. Thank you so much for having me again. So I'm very excited to talk to you. I say that to all my guests because I'm always excited to talk to people, but I particularly mean it today because you joined me for the first test show a all the way back in August. Uh, people think that

Speaker 2:          05:58          Sam Harris was the first guest, but technically Gad sad was the first repeat guest. So you now are the first. You were the first guest, you were the first repeat guest and, and you're doing so much cool stuff in this space. This, this sort of, uh, what, what do we want to call ourselves now? What space are we in? Fighters have good ideas. I like that. Fighters have good ideas. All right, so I want to get into, uh, the work that you do. I want to talk about your books. I want to talk about your tweets and I want to talk about your youtube channel, but I saw you do an interview with astronaut Omani. Uh, which was really, really fascinating. Talk about your history. So you were born in Lebanon and I'm going to let you take it away. Sam was born in Lebanon, a 19, late 1964.

Speaker 2:          06:42          So now everybody knows my age. There you go. Um, lived there for 11 years and then the civil war broke out in the mid seventies. It became very, very difficult to be Jewish in Lebanon. Uh, and so we really had to leave under imminent threat of execution in Lebanon. Everybody carries an internal ID card, very much like a passport, but for, for the country itself. And on that ID card is stated very clearly what your religion is. And so if you are stopped at particular roadblocks by militia who were not sympathetic to you being Jewish, it wasn't going to turn out well. And as you might imagine, most of the militia at that point, you know, you wouldn't have cleared those roadblocks. And so we really needed to leave. And so we left Lebanon, um, the day that we left Lebanon and we cleared the airspace of A.

Speaker 2:          07:32          Well, Lebanon, the, as the captain had mentioned that, uh, my wife and my wife, my mother takes out a star of David, puts it around my neck and says, now you don't have to hide who you are. Okay, so let's, let's back up before we get to your escape because of, for your escape. There was some pretty amazing stuff that happens. So your parents were kidnapped by PLO. Terrorists later. Okay. So we, we emigrated to Canada and late 75 then for the next four years, my parents kept going back and forth from Montreal to Lebanon. They really couldn't extricate themselves fully from their previous life in Lebanon and on one of those trips in 1980, there were kidnapped by a photo. Yeah. You had a guest, but no relation, no relation, no relation, but Fatah is sort of now it's considered the moderate version. The moderate to Hamas.

Speaker 2:          08:24          Moderate in the Middle East is a very attentive term. Sure. And so they were kidnapped. They disappeared for a, I think it was eight days at the time that it was happening when my siblings are much older than me, we're trying to find a way to rescue them or even know if they're still alive. I had been lied to. I was told that they had some financial problems. That's why there was so much upheaval in the house. So during those eight days or my parents had disappeared, I didn't know that they were potentially dead. What they were finally rescued. They were rescued actually because my mother's best friend at the time, her name was, uh, was the personal dresser of half as an asset. And so through those connections we were able to pinpoint which militia group had them. And I guess was he the president of a president of Syria, the president of Syria, Syria.

Speaker 2:          09:17          And then through him I think a Yasser Arafat got involved and finally they found them. They were with a group led by Don. I'm going on my memory here from when I was 15. Uh, and then, uh, they were rescued. And I think one of the things that you might remember from the story with, uh, my discussion with Astro, uh, when my parents were eventually rescued, uh, my father had a severe injury from having been beaten with a coalition of cove and he had a temporary stroke paralysis in his face, which eventually subsided. And in my mother's case, I remember that one of the things that had really disturbed me as a 15 year old young male was whether she had been raped. And I remember that shortly after they were rescued and came back to Montreal. I asked her, the only time I've ever brought up the subject and she said that while they repeatedly threatened her psychologically would rape, that they hadn't raped her.

Speaker 2:          10:16          And I don't know if that's true or not, we just sort of dropped the subject and never raised it again. Yeah. So I don't know that you can know the answer to this, but what were, what were they trying to get out of your brain? What was the advantage of, of taking x pats that were now Canadians and kidnapping? Yeah. Great. Actually, it's one of the seven deadly sins of greed, one of the, uh, the owner of a building where my father had a store in the lobby was trying to low ball my father to sell the store and thinking that of course as Jews they weren't a very precarious situation. He had hired these militia to try to extract from them a confession that they were Israeli spies and the only thing and then if they would then execute them as Israeli spies somehow magically he could get that sore.

Speaker 2:          11:04          Luckily for my parents, of course they didn't confess to that because they're not Israeli spies and that's what kept them alive for those eight days because there was an ulterior motive to get them to sign those confessions. Wow, that's really incredible. So now I know why I jumped ahead with the story about your parents because what happened to you getting out of Lebanon I thought was fascinating. So you were talking about going through the checkpoints and being in a car. Yes. And you have a very foggy memory of. Exactly. So I remember very, very well actually we had hired PLO militia. I mean, you think about the guys that you see today, the Isis guys, how they look? Well, I've, that's what I grew up with now. Those guys were contracted to drive us to the airport, uh, precisely because by close to the baby with international airport, there were a lot of militia checkpoints of Palestinians and there was no way you're going to get through that if, if they weren't sympathetic to, to you.

Speaker 2:          11:56          So, but of course they could take you and they can take it to the ditch and shoot you so you don't really know what's going to happen. So I remember being picked up by these guys. I remember getting to the airport and then the story would end up on the plane, but everything in between I have zero recollection of that. And I once asked my parents what happened and she said that, uh, as we were going through different neighborhoods that would have been hostile to Palestinian militia, for example, Christian groups, everybody was engaging one another very much like a Rambo movie. We were at the bottom of the floor of the car, sort of being hidden. All of that. I have zero recollection of that. Yeah. It's so fascinating because it shows you how complex the entire situation with Lebanon and the Palestinians and the Israelis is because you had, you had Palestinian militia people being paid off to help Jews escaped Lebanon because of their civil war.

Speaker 2:          12:50          I mean, it really. If you, if you map this whole thing, people will go, this makes no sense. Well, I have, I've actually written about this, that, you know, Muslims were trying to kill us and Muslims saved us. Right? So you can sort of have a blanket statement, you know, all Muslims, right? That's an. Oh, so you don't believe in all Muslims are bad. Okay. Go ahead. That outright they're getting. Because we don't want you. He misquoted. So you must feel a sort of very strange when a right now, you know, Hezbollah is sort of taking over Lebanon and they're fighting in Syria and that's your home country and it's teetering on democracy or it's democracy I should say, is teetering. Uh, how do you feel about Lebanon now? And you might be with you. I do so much. I, you know, my, I have two children, uh, so between my wife and I, we speak five languages, so I speak French, English, Arabic and Hebrew.

Speaker 2:          13:39          She speaks English, French and Armenian, and yet our children only speak French and English because by virtue of living in Montreal and I really regret the fact that we don't have the opportunity to take our children back to Lebanon, for example, one year visiting professorship at American University of Beirut, you know, dumped them in that context. They could come back fluent Arabic speaker, speaker. Could you do it? Is there because because of the political situation or you know, and in Beirut, if you make a left turn here than there is an isis recruitment center perhaps. You mean you don't know who's the Nice Guy, who's the bad guy, right? It won't take much for people to find out. Number one, that I'm Jewish, number two, that I've written quite forcefully about some of these issues. It's very easy for you to disappear in the trunk of a car.

Speaker 2:          14:24          Right? So I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable given the current situation. Cigarettes now I've been told I have a lot of friends that have said, look, we can guarantee your security come back and so on. Can you really? So, so I'd rather not. And certainly not when I have young children. Right. So before the civil war, and I know you were, you were 12 when it happened, so you were pretty young. 11, 11. Do you, what, what was it like to be Jewish? There was actually. Okay. So that's, that's a very issue because oftentimes people will say, oh, but Jews were treated very nicely. I mean, yes, nicely in the sense that they aren't daily decapitations the square and central square, right? You could go about your business, but everything is nice until the decapitations happen, right? So, uh, you were tolerated, right? I mean, people knew you were Jewish.

Speaker 2:          15:11          They didn't necessarily bother you everyday, but antisemitism pervades the fabric of every possible element of society in those regions. Now that doesn't mean that everybody's an antisemite, but you know, you just be quiet, don't, don't signal your belongingness to this group. Be understated. Yeah. And then once the civil war happened, sort of the rules were just changed, right? Is that, is that what it was? Basically you guys felt that whatever side wins this thing, we're finished. I mean, there, there were Jews that were killed and it would have only been a matter of time where somebody would have found us and killed us. So it really was under imminent threat of execution. I mean, we either get out or that. Yeah. So I know that a certain amount of people will be watching this and we'll say, well wait, I don't understand because God is a extremely outspoken atheist, but he's here repeated several times that you're Jewish.

Speaker 2:          16:01          How do you reconcile that? Because I've met a few people on it, had Ali Rizvi who's an atheist Muslim and we talked about how he reconciles it. Uh, and there's been a couple of other people where we, the way I reconcile it for myself, how do you reconcile that? So the way I would answer that is that Judaism, or to be Jewish as a multifaceted identity, there's a cultural element. There is a historical element, there is a shared context history, there's just the shared history, shared lineage, uh, one of which is adherence to a set of religious doctrines. And so I could choose to ignore those doctrines and still say I do belong to a group of people, uh, that can be traced back in this manner through genealogy. Right. And so in that sense, I'm very Jewish, uh, but in the religious element, I'm not at all Jewish.

Speaker 2:          16:51          Yeah. Do you think you don't get a certain cred of being from the Middle East because of that? Because there is a sense and we're going to sit down and we followed the gosh a little bit later, but you know, I've known him online for over a year. I just, because he said that he had Palestinian ancestry, I just assumed he was Muslim. I didn't know until we met two weeks ago I had dinner that his family actually was Christian and that was just a silly and sloppy thinking on my part. But do you feel that you sort of don't get some of the credit of being a real middle easterner? I mean, it depends on who you're speaking, I guess from the people on the left that I spend so much time, you know, once I break down the break, break down with the flawless Arabic than those kinds of concerns go away.

Speaker 2:          17:30          Right. Because it's, it's, it's quite impressive for somebody to accuse you of that. And then when your mother. I mean everything about us as Arabic. I mean, yes, we happen to be Jewish, but I mean, you know, culturally we're were Arabic, right, with Arab Jews. So it's very difficult for people to levy that charge. Although I have interesting a personal anecdote. When I was a graduate student, a doctoral student at Cornell, uh, I became friends with a lot of Arabic students, uh, as what typically happened because I have more in common with them than I might have with the Jewish guy from Poland. Right, right. Sure. Uh, and so at one point, one of these guys who had gone for coffee, he said to me, you know, I really, I really liked again. I said, well, why do you say that as though you're so surprised?

Speaker 2:          18:13          It was, well, you know, because, well, you know, because you're Jewish, but you know, but you're not a Jew Jew. Right, right. I said, no, no, I'm a Ju Ju Ju Ju. He goes, no, come on. You know what I mean? You're not a Jew. So in that case, what he was saying is you're not really the archetype of what I imagined a Jew to be you really Arabic and so it's the opposite of what you asked. I think all of this is so fascinating. The reason I like talking about it, it's very similar to what I was discussing with Tara Fatah few days ago. That identity is so malleable actually. It's so, not necessarily your religion or your history or even your ethnicity or where you were born in nationality because it's all of those things. And I guess that's why I hate identity politics so much because I realize that most people are like, you are like me, that pick and choose what to believe in and that secular values ultimately are the things that should move us forward as a society.

Speaker 2:          19:06          Speaking of identity politics, uh, and privileged scores, I should mention that. I know you're privileged now. I've lost some points because my skin is a bit lighter that summer, but I've made sure to put on a bit of weight so that I could gain on the fattism score. So it an in a homeostatic mechanism whereby maintain my victimology score at a certain point. Right. But the but the fat thing is way lower on the list than the other thing. I'll bring it back and then the religion things up here, depending on what religion is. Such a, people should be walking around with cards and you just hand it to him and be like, well here's my shit. And mother underprivileged. I did a thing on buzzfeed the other day about privilege. Did you see this one? But I didn't say they did it. How privileged are you?

Speaker 2:          19:48          And I got a 42 out of hundreds that I wasn't privileged at all. Now it's it pretty great. I'm not really. I thought I'm going to, I got to tell people about. I'm off the charts on that one. Yeah, you'd be, you'd get a negative sick. I'm fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. So I wanted to get some of your history out of the way, but let's talk about what you're doing now. Um, so you are a professor and you do research on your own and all that. We've got your book, the consuming instincts as signed copy for you decided already signed that and if I see it on Ebay as a means for you to try to fund your Malibu House, I'll be upset. No, no, don't worry about the Malibu House. I'm working on it in other, other ways. Um, so tell me a little bit about what brought you to the world of academic.

Speaker 2:          20:31          So I've always known, I mean there were two things that I was really good at and interested in soccer and studying books. Uh, I was certainly going quite a, my soccer career was going quite well, but then I had some serious injuries and other circumstances that don't allow me to pursue that. And so that accelerated my move to academia and so I always do. I mean, I didn't even take any breaks between my degrees. I just went through, it's through, through my phd, it's straight to professorship because I never imagined doing anything else, uh, in terms of the work that I do, if that's what we talk about. Uh, so what I, what I do is I basically Mary evolutionary psychology and biology to the study of consumer behavior. So the idea being that what makes us consumed the way that we are is ultimately rooted in some evolutionary mechanisms.

Speaker 2:          21:19          Why is it that men are the ones who are most likely to succumb to the pornographic addiction? Uh, what, uh, how do women's hormones throughout their menstrual cycles affect their behaviors as consumers? And so I look at these biological underpinnings specifically in the consumer setting. So do you think that most behaviors, most human behaviors are linked back to genetics more than anything else? I know you've talked about this. Yes, yes. Yeah. And it's the nature versus nurture argument and things like that. But would you say that's really where the stuff we're made of? I mean, certainly there are biological imperatives. That's our part of our shared, you know, human nature, but there's always an interaction between our genes and our environment and the. I always love to use a cake metaphor, so if you take the ingredients in a cake, the, the, the baking soda and the flour, the sugar, the eggs, they're each separate ingredients.

Speaker 2:          22:10          Then you put them altogether, you make a cake. If I were to tell you now point to the exit point of the sugar, you wouldn't be able to. It's an inextricable mix and so much of who we are as an inextricable. It makes of our nature and nurture. The problem with most social scientists has been over the past hundred years is that they have doggedly refuse to accept that biology matters and so their position has always been, yeah, yeah. Evolutionary theory is relevant to explain the behavior of the dog and the mosquito and the zebra, but don't use their. Apply it to human behavior. We transcend our biology. What makes us human is that we are cultural animals and that's silly. Well, I mean if you were just to look at people being gay, would that be an argument against that as well? Right, because when they buy that logic, they would say you could override it or something like that.

Speaker 2:          22:53          That's right. Exactly. Of course, that's one example, but there's a Zillion, right? I mean, I mean it, it. It behooves one to understand how serious academics could genuinely believe that biology doesn't carry much importance when it comes to understanding human affairs, but it really originally started from a very good place. A lot of miscreants use evolutionary theory for nefarious goals. Right? Hitler misused that. A eugenesis misused as a social class elitists in Britain and said, hey, the upper classes are better than the lower classes. Who cares if the little classes dot, hey, that's the Darwinian of course had nothing to do with Darwinian theory, but because of all these cretins misuse, evolutionary theory, social sciences said, okay, well let's create a new understanding of human nature where biology is no longer relevant and hopefully there won't be these types of abuses, but that's silly. I mean, you have to route your science and logic and reason.

Speaker 2:          23:46          Yeah, so my whole a direct message at the top of the show is talking about academia and sort of the ideas that are, that are working in colleges and mostly that are not working and the free speech problems we're having, which were hugely here in America, but I know it's happening in Canada too, and it's happening all across Europe right now. Um, and you're, you're right in the thick of that because you are outspoken. That's what, why we connected in the first place. I saw this guy on twitter and I was like, wow, this guy gets it and he's not afraid to say it. So, um, what, what do you think the general atmosphere or, or talk about for your experience, what's the general? So you might have seen it. I recently delivered a lecture on political correctness and the thought police and I gave many of these examples, which if, if they weren't true, you would think it's straight out of the onion.

Speaker 2:          24:33          I mean, it's really just an impossible to imagine that the fulcrum has, has swung so much towards lunacy. Uh, I think we have to fight it. I mean, the reality is that most academics, uh, I hate to keep repeating this point, but are afraid of their shadows. They're careerists, uh, to the extent that the general environment is, you have to coddle the, the students. You have to infantilize them. Don't you dare say something that might offend them, then they perpetuate the problem. But if enough people stand up courageously and say, look, this is not right. As my five. I've had this discussion recently here with some college students, uh, and I, I explained to them that it's not to your benefit, uh, to have professors be terrified to speak to you. There's a, there's a great article that I can't remember the name of the professor who wrote it, basically said, uh, my students terrify me.

Speaker 2:          25:25          That's not a good thing. I mean, if you're a student, you don't want to hear that right? You want professors will challenge you. Who, who gets you to move from your positions. If we are afraid to utter a one syllable that might somehow, uh, necessitate you going into a safe space, it shatters the possibility for dialogue. Yeah. So when you say that to students, I'm going to guess that on an individual level, if you're sitting across from them, they probably do get that they probably don't understand it, but that when you get them in a group and the group think star, that that's where it becomes dangerous. So mom, so how do you combat that patiently by demonstrating through evidence that this is ultimately suboptimal and it will only hurt your growth? Right? I mean, people learn by engaging the diversity of ideas. I mean, that's what learning is about.

Speaker 2:          26:12          And so, and I explained to them that I'm very open to somebody coming to see me and saying, look, I've experienced this in this trauma and therefore I need this particular, uh, you know, acquiescence and fine. I mean, I'm an, I'm an empathetic person. I'll take that into account. But to have, for example, a trigger warning that is sufficiently vague that it covers every possible thing that might trigger somebody. That's not a good idea. Right, so let's dig into the trigger warning thing a little bit. So there there would be trigger warnings. For example, if you were teaching a course and you were going to discuss rape, they would a certain amount of people that that like these ideas would want you to issue a trigger warning so that in case someone that was in the class had been raped or their mother had been raped or their sister had been raped or whatever it is, they would, they would receive notice before discussing it.

Speaker 2:          27:02          I know that doesn't sound terrible in and of itself, but it's, it's the pervasiveness of it, right? It's the way that it then sort of shelters you from really dealing with as well. And the reality is that it's not restricted to a few examples such as rate becomes everything. It's everything. As a matter of fact, I, I, I took, I took it upon me to actually generates a list of topics that have been suggested as possible. Topics that would be worthy of a trigger warning. And actually I covered that in my, in my lecture, and basically those topics that I generated would pretty much cover anything that anybody could ever talk about soccer. That'd be then, I mean, yeah, I don't know how it could be, but yeah. And yet here we are, we're, where do you think this started? Because that's the part that I find really interesting and I did discuss it a little bit with Tarek.

Speaker 2:          27:52          Um, where did this idea that you have to be protected come from and how did it proliferate so quickly? Well, I think it comes from different sources, but political correctness is really the, the, the, the impetus of all of these subsequent movements, right? The idea that there are certain things that you should not say. And then we take this idea and then we say, well, there are certain things that you shouldn't say it because it makes people feel uncomfortable or it hurts them or triggers a past trauma. And so it becomes the way that I've described that there's a, and it's a speculum hypothesis right now, but it's certainly worth testing is a phenomenon known as Munchhausen's syndrome. Uh, which basically says, uh, uh, a woman, typically it's a woman who suffered from this disorder, uh, we'll try to feign an illness to 10 garner sympathy.

Speaker 2:          28:41          Then there's Bush Munchausen Syndrome by proxy where you harm your child or your pet or your elderly parents to try to then garner sympathy. But I think this type of crying for safe space is sort of this growth tests, collective Munchhausen Syndrome, right? Where people get attention by constantly screaming victim hood. And so it becomes a very alluring way to navigate through the world. I always get attention by saying that I'm offended, I'm hurt. I'm, well, I escaped execution. I could still watch a military movie I want from now on, whenever I walk around in any city, you shut down all movie theaters, that's military because I was going to be executed in Lebanon to do it. God, I mean, it's really nuts when you, when you, especially when you lay out like a great metaphor like that. It's like this is because we could all do this and that's why every, what do they call it?

Speaker 2:          29:34          You know, it's just like the afflicted Olympics or the oppression and the oppression Olympics. It's like, it will never stop. Yeah. And I see this now as, as a disease that's running rampant and that's why I talk about it so much. I can't imagine that this will continue as I already see a lot of academics write to me privately, uh, saying to me they don't yet have the courage to come on board publicly, but they say, you know, thank you for speaking out. Thank you for being a voice of reason. This has empowered me to try to be a bit more open. And I think all it takes is for a flicker to start. And then eventually I think the tide will shift back. I think. Yeah. Well that's nice to hear that they're privately do that. But do you get pushback from professors that think a gads pushing this too much?

Speaker 2:          30:20          I don't get it to my face because I'm, I'm, I'm a formidable guy to go against other ones. You better come with all your guns if you're going to do this stuff with me. Yeah. So usually it doesn't happen directly, but I will hear from, from sources that such and such person is upset that I'm taking these positions. So I know that there are groups that are upset with me, but they don't necessarily come to my face and say. Right. So this is a great argument for tenure, right? I mean if you have tenure rights. Oh yeah. Since 1990 $9. Ninety nine. So when you got tenure, did that change at that moment? Did they, what did they do? The hand your paper. How does it work? They, they, you kneel down and. Well, it's actually a committee. It goes through several layers. And then finally use, receive a letter saying that you've been granted tenure.

Speaker 2:          31:03          Yeah. Uh, the process of applying for it as you basically give your whole dose here to demonstrate that you're worthy of that honor. W, what are the protections you actually get for tenure? I mean, they just can't fire you just like that, but there must be some Grazia. What if they run out of money? If the university closes? Only if your department would have to be closed for financial reasons, then that would be ground for them closing the department. The fact that you a tenured wouldn't protect you, but the purpose of tenure is really to make sure that, let's suppose I'm doing work on evolutionary psychology and the Dean as a young Earth creationists who thinks that evolution is a Zionist hoax. Yeah, right. Well, he or she can't come to me and say, Hey, you better stop this evolution stuff because it offends me and it makes our university look bad and I'll fire you.

Speaker 2:          31:49          Right? So tenure is a means by which you ensure that a good ideas are able to be pursued because oftentimes most of the important ideas or dangerous ideas, they're ideas that go against the orthodoxy. They're ideas that are considered critical at the time. Right? Think of Galileo, think of socrates, right? And so the, the idea oftentimes and in political discourse, politicians will say, oh, we've got to get rid of tenure because all these facts, professors sit around doing nothing. Yeah, that's, that's basically them saying that they're idiots because it's admitting they're not doing their job. Tenure is there to make sure that you could pinch pursued dangerous ideas. Now regarding my specific context, even when I didn't have tenure, I was outspoken. Maybe not necessarily about trigger warnings because there wasn't. Right? But in other words, I never modulator that my behavior maybe to a fault.

Speaker 2:          32:42          Maybe I'm not enough of a careerist I just, I don't care. Uh, the, the pursuit of truth for me is greater than any careerist considerations. Yeah. Well, I love that and I know that to be true from you and that's why your channel has been picking up steam and while you're talking to so many great people, and I think part of it really is because of exactly what you wrote about in this book, that you're approaching the political topics that we're talking about and the religious topics from a scientific place. I sense that that really is the bedrock of what you do as a scientist. That's what you're trying to quantify and qualify all of this stuff. Exactly. And I saw your interview with Bill Warner, who is also a scientist and a, an uh, you know, he studied all of the religions, right? He said he studied with Moms, he studied the Qur'an and he studied with rabbis and Jerusalem, the Old Testament, all that.

Speaker 2:          33:31          And, and I thought he said something very similar that as he's looking at these things as a scientist, not as a sociologist. Exactly. And do you think that's really the healthiest way to listen? And actually that's one of the reasons why. I mean, of course I receive negative comments from people and hate mail and so on. But given the types of positions I take, they're actually quite, quite few of them precisely because I approach it in the manner that I do. Right. So whenever I take a position, I make sure that it is documented as it would be if I were submitting a paper to a scientific journal. Right. So my, my evidentiary threshold is set so high that it becomes difficult to break it down and therefore people can accuse me of hate speech and this and that because everything is backed up. And the case of Bill Warner, for the viewers who may not know this, he basically applied the tools of content analysis to then quantify the amount of hate that is found in different different religious texts so we don't have to have a vacuous discussion about whether Islam is peaceful or not, whether the Old Testament is peaceful or not.

Speaker 2:          34:39          I can actually use the tools of science in this case called a content analysis to quantify how much hate there is in this book. And, and that becomes unassailable well. So with the assailable part b though, that what's in the book is only only matters depending on the amount of people that act on it. Right? So that's not, that's not unassailable in its in its scientific method, but that's what the real issue is, right? The real issue is not what's in all these books as much as how many people are acting on it. But that sounded almost Reza Aslan, which to me didn't get me out of that because residence I fully. I mean, look, we know these books are all nuts, right? Because they're all filled by, written by men thousands of years ago, but it's not really what's in them as much as how people act on them.

Speaker 2:          35:22          So, so Reza Aslan basically used the, uh, the worst thing anyone's ever said to me, my, my deep apologies. Reza Aslan basically use the, a BS argument from postmodernism to say, you put your meaning exactly. So you know, who are we to judge whether kill, kill, kill means that kill, kill, kill could mean a stroke with kindness and correct. Right? No, it doesn't. Okay. Yeah. A language has accepted beaning and no amount of postmodern gymnastics is going to alter that. Right? So I guess what I think what I was saying is that if you looked at the three books, and I think by most accounts that the old testament's probably the most violent of them, but no one would really acting on the violence of that. So that doesn't discount that it says some horrible stuff, but if nobody's acting on it then it's sort of irrelevant.

Speaker 2:          36:12          So I hope, I hope that's not how postmodern, because I know, I know that exact quote from him and it sounds like pure, so we could get into the theological discussion. I mean, one of the, for example, if in the Old Testament says killed the alumni alumna kites a while they don't exist anymore. So even if I was desperate to act on that, Edx I wouldn't be able to. On the other hand, if a, another religious book has a, the following tenant killed the nonbelievers wherever you find them. That is actionable today. Uh, so, so no, the argument that. Well, it depends who acts on it. That's not true. There's very plus we don't have many people today that act on Deuteronomy. Well that, that was my point, that it depends on who's acting on it, but that doesn't change the specifics. Exactly. That are, that are in the tech.

Speaker 2:          36:58          Fair enough. Do you find that as an academic and as a social scientist and all that, that it's exhausting talking about religion because you don't believe in it so that, you know what I mean? Like you're trying to add something rational. This is what I feel. I'm constantly trying to rationalize things that cannot be rationalized anymore. It actually also in your discussion with Bill Warner, he said one of the interesting things about the current is you can almost rationalize anything because you can say something's really great. Yeah. So can you explain to a little bit? Yeah. So the idea is so people don't know that, uh, the Koran has what's called abrogated versus so, uh, God might have decided through the revelations to say, uh, there's no compulsion in religion. And then later God is allowed to change his mind and say, killed, you know, don't be so tolerant.

Speaker 2:          37:48          Right? Right. Well, how could it be that a and not a can coexist? Well, through dual logic that can be allowed in the way you do that as through abrogation, which basically means that when you have two techs that contradict one another, the later texts texts supersedes the previous one. So when people typically quote the gentle passages from the Koran, that's the Meccan period, those passages have actually been abrogated. They've been made null and void. So now in some cases, the people who who, who quote those passages know this and they are actually being duplicitous and other cases they're unaware of this aggregation mechanism. All right, so let's just talk about Reza for a minute since you brought him up. And he and he, because he's become such a player in this space and CNNS even giving him a show all about belief, which sounds just horrific.

Speaker 2:          38:35          Um, when he plays those games, you know, right. You know that he knows this, he knows about what you just described and yet he's doing this. So what do we do with these players? You know, what do we do with? It's a great question because I don't know. What has endgame is. I mean, as it is, it that he's engaging in self deception as we know humans are very adept at doing. There's actually some very interesting evolutionary arguments for why people engage in self deception. You want me to take off? Let's go there. Okay. So, so the argument for the evolution of self deception is that when you and I are chatting a, we're engaging, if you like an Imac, a valiant battle, I'd like to get you to do what I want, but I don't want you to know that I'm doing this right.

Speaker 2:          39:14          So when I'm lying to you, they are typically markers and made that you're trying to pick up to see if I'm being duplicitous or not. The way that I shut off those markers as by first convincing myself that I'm not lying. In other words, by engaging in self deception, I shut off the mechanisms that you might otherwise read in me that I'm lying. Interesting. So, but is that a fully conscious decision on the part of the person that's doing it as an evolutionary mechanism that's been built into us now? So, uh, you know, signed on Seinfeld, there's a classic episode where George Costanza says to Jerry, I might get the quote wrong. Remember Jerry, it's not alive if you believe it. Yeah. Uh, actually talked about this in one of my earlier books. Uh, well that's, that's the idea. So, so I don't know, in [inaudible] case whether he truly believes the, the just the endless tsunami of nonsense that he produces or whether it's just a duplicitous attempt.

Speaker 2:          40:08          He, you know, this is the way by which I've become very famous. This is the way by which I get a lot of attention because I'm sort of the Brown guy from Iran who could appear moderate and so on, and I'm going to stick to that niche because it's got me a lot of fame. So I can't tell which of these two possibilities he's under. You know, it's so interesting because when I hear you say that, it clearly comes from a place where you're trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, right? You just went out of your way to not say this guy is a duplicitous liar or whatever. And you know, Sam Harris says how intentions matter. Right? And you're trying to say, well maybe his intentions are good. So that would be a reason to fiddle with some of this stuff. I sent that all the people that, that we argue with all the time, they would not give us any of those passes and that to me shows you where this battle really is happening right there.

Speaker 2:          40:59          There's, there's kind of a, an immediate reflex to label anybody who's in our space, you know, a Nazi and Hitler and Himmler, right? That's right. Yeah, I agree. Uh, I mean I've been fortunate. Again, knock on wood, I haven't had too much of this stuff. Maybe because I am quite measured in how I speak and maybe because I come from that background, it gives me a layer of protection which maybe Sam can't have. I'm not exactly sure, but I've been fortunate in that sense. Right. So to what my question that started this whole thing, using scientific method to discuss texts, not this text. What religious texts that aren't necessarily based in rationality or in secular values, do you find it exhausting? I mean, having, right? Like are, do you find yourself spending a lot of time deciphering things that we shouldn't be worried about anymore?

Speaker 2:          41:52          We don't worry about what scientists thought 3000 years ago. So why are we worried about what religious people thought? $3,000. It's extraordinary, right? Because if, if you take a belief that someone holds and you don't cloak it under the robe of religion, then this would be tantamount to the guy being schizophrenia and let's commit them to a mental hospital. Right? But we can give a good example of that because I think that's a really great point. Uh, okay. So, uh, this profit has gone on a winged horse somewhere. Yeah. If I say that, hey, you know, I believe that, uh, Dave Ruben, yesterday, I saw him on a winged horse going to happen, then we're good mushrooms. Then I would call a, my clinical psychologists or psychiatrists, friends and say, hey, let's try to commit Dave Rubin to a psychiatric hospital. On the other hand, if I say the exact same thing, but it is cloaked under a religious narrative, don't you dare criticize that narrative, right?

Speaker 2:          42:52          So the exact same statement is either a form of lunacy or perfectly acceptable religion depending on whether it is protected by religion. And that's grotesque, right? I mean, why is your belief in whatever narrative you choose to believe somehow sacrosanct and I can't touch it. Yeah, so when it comes to religion and obviously we've spent a lot of time talking about this and I've had mostly people that are anti religion, but just last week I had an ultra orthodox, ultra Orthodox, but Orthodox Jew, Ben, she mentioned thought made some pretty cogent arguments separating religion from politics even though I didn't agree with him on a lot of it, but I thought he did an interesting, you know, he wasn't trying to govern. I sense from a place of religion, which I could at least respect that, but what do you make of the general feeling that, you know, you watch the superbowl in the second last superbowl and they thank God these are people who spend their entire lives training to become machines of athleticism and the team that lost also but also pray to the same guy, but somehow God really was for the cardinals.

Speaker 2:          43:56          So he hates the trailblazers. I'm mixing sports. You make sport that I really got it. I really do not support support of that, but I'm, I'm, I'm trying to think of A. Yeah, so, but, but to me that what that shows is not a belief in God per se, as much as it shows almost a narcissistic disorder, the Lord of the universe. And I mean if only people would have a sense of the vastness of the universe, uniquely cares about a point guard who's about to make a three point closing shot and if he makes it. Oh Lord Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Really be invested in your, uh, career stats. Yeah. And by the way, we can also take examples. It would be like, you know, if you jerked off or something and then felt guilty after because God was watching you. It's like he's watching you do that.

Speaker 2:          44:46          He's watching basketball. Better things to do. I mean really if without even more like, I know there's a certain mocking tone here, but without even mocking it, if you, if you really believed in this, wouldn't you believe that God would be doing something else? Creating another universe. You know what I mean? Really. Otherwise it seems so silly. He's quite pedantic, but I'll give you. I did A. Actually, it's in this book where I, I, I, I played this following a mental game. Suppose you had a Martian who came to earth and he's shopping for the one true religion, and so he asks a bunch of questions. Am I allowed to wear leather shoes? Can I have a tattoo? Am I allowed to be to have homosexual relations? I mean, you think from the most mundane to the most a metaphysical questions. I demonstrated that for every possible question that you can generate, I could identify two religions that prescribe the exact opposite thing to that same question.

Speaker 2:          45:43          I mean, if that doesn't serve as a devastating blow to the whole scam of religion, nothing was. Right, right? Let's put it another way. There are 10,000 documented religions in the world. You, I bet you 10,000 now here. What I mean is different than nominations of Christianity with countless different religions, right? Right. So there are 10,000 of them. The only thing that they typically have in common is that each of them says that I'm the true religion. The other 9,999 are false. Credible. That sounds a bit fishy to me. Right. And also that they are all designed differently. I find that when I'm, when we're debating a lot of this stuff, um, you know, especially with we've gotten almost 40 minutes and haven't said regressive, so I'm finally going to say the word progressive and regressive left, that they always want everything to be equally as bad except some religions want people to convert into them.

Speaker 2:          46:31          Some don't, right? That would show that, not that it's necessarily better, but it would show that certain people don't want to spread their ideas as much as other people, but there is a need on the left to go. Everything's bad. And once you do that, you're actually saying nothing. Right. I've actually used that same argument, but in the end, under the context of an academic setting. So there's, there's a concept known as a meme. Are you familiar with that? Of course. So this is from Richard Dawkins, right? Well, Richard Dawkins argues that religion is a Mima plex. That's a collection of memes and memes spread very much. Like how viruses spread or how genes propagate and populations well, or or how meme spread on twitter. Right? Exactly. So to go to your point about religions, some religions that the content of their memes are inherently infectious. In other words, the transmissibility of that religion is much greater.

Speaker 2:          47:22          So in Judaism, the fact that you you don't proselytize is precisely the reason why they are 13, 14, 15 million Jews depending on how you count, right? And the whole entire universe world, they are $50, million Jews on the other hand and a religion where you're allowed to proselytize and there are other things that you can do all. So for example, it takes very little to get into the religion. In Islam, for example, right in Judaism, if you truly wish to convert according to the strict tenants, you can't just sort of say one sentence and we'll welcome to the right of the Jewish clan, right? You actually have to go through a very costly process. So there are all sorts of mechanisms that you could study in the context of, of a religion that demonstrate why one spreads and another one doesn't. Right. And by the way, using the example that you just mentioned, it's also a lot to get out of Judaism because they not a Jew anymore, nobody cares.

Speaker 2:          48:12          But if you were to get out of Islam, we know this with the PA states all over the world, you might get killed on, but to kill means to correct. So you're just sounded right. So, okay, we take all of this. We, we get it. You think that this mode of thinking is, is not great for the world and, and all of that. You want to use things from a scientific place. So when I had Peter Goes, you know, and he wrote a book called a manual for creating atheists. Yes. And I read it and I thought it was really great book and I've, I've tried to use some of those, uh, practices when I've talked to people about this stuff and I asked him, does he think that like what's the difference? At the end of the day, if someone holds some of these beliefs but isn't doing anything nefarious and isn't pushing these ideas on anyone, do you still think it's bad?

Speaker 2:          48:55          And he basically said yes, because he, he said, uh, I'm not quoting him exactly, but that you're diluting yourself and that's not really what the point of being human is. What would you say in that case if someone just picked some beliefs? It's nominal. Nobody cares, you know, and you're not oppressing someone or making women dress a certain way. Right? So, I don't know, it depends if I want to be pragmatic or a purist, if I want to be pragmatic, I say you don't believe whatever you want as long as you don't impose your beliefs on third parties that I don't care. So that's the pragmatic part. If I were to be a purist, right? Uh, the pursuit of truth matters than I would agree then with Peter that to believe in these types of fairytales is actually injurious to the human spirit. Right? So that in and of itself, even if it's not propagating violence or something on someone else, that it's against the sort of human nature or something like that.

Speaker 2:          49:48          And if anything, I mean, and, and many atheists have talked about this, a, there is a wonder that you can access without needing religion. What religion does in a sense is it is, it, is, it covers the capacity. I mean, I can go and see a beautiful landscape and be transcendent, transcendent by the experience without needing Booga Booga to, to, for me to actually experience that. Right? So it actually cheapens life to always have to contextualize it within the context of a big data in the sky. That's interesting. I think I've told this story on the show once before, but I want ate pot brownies and I was going to see air force one with friends and it was sold out. So we moved, we went and saw contact. Did you see contact? This is what the costs are. And it was written. It was Carl Sagan is only fiction book.

Speaker 2:          50:37          Uh, and um, I didn't know what the movie was at all. I had no idea what we were walking into. I don't know if you remember, but the opening scene was this incredible panorama of the universe. And I ate these pop around, he's, I was basically like tripping out of my mind and the whole movie just blew my mind apart. I was like, this is amazing. I ended up reading a whole bunch of Charles Dickens books and all that and it sort of led me to a lot of the things that I think now, but the movie ends, she has this sort of a, not that satisfying experience because she can't prove that what happened to her actually happened and the movie ends with her just looking out on a sunset. And that's exactly what you're saying, that there are ways to, I suppose, feel connected and feel a part of this thing that don't necessarily standing up and sitting a lot at a.

Speaker 2:          51:24          actually that was one of the starting points that got me away from religion. We were sitting at a synagogue, a again Avraham in Beirut. Okay. Uh, and I asked my father, you know, I'm confused. When do we stand up when we sit down? And he's like, you don't shut up. Just the fact that he said that really upsets me because already as I don't remember how old I was, maybe five, six, seven, uh, that left a hole in me. Well, what'd you mean? Why am I standing up and sitting down? They give me an explanation. So the fact that there was sort of this, this dogmatism a is probably the starting point of what led me astray from religion, but to come back to atheism, I've written an article in psychology today blog where I talked about carpet den, right? Seizing the day. And that atheism is really consistent with that ethos, right of living in the moment, right?

Speaker 2:          52:15          There are no do overs, there is no eternal life. It's now is the relationship that I formed. Now it's the, it's the knowledge that I helped spread. Now it's the goodness that I can impart to the world. And so that actually makes it a much more a wonderful experience to realize that you have a very short, limited time. Now, of course it's very scary, right? I mean, you and I want this party to go on forever and that's why I think actually that religion will never a sister exist. We'll never eradicate it because we will never resolve the problem of our existential angst. Right? So when you say the word eradicate there, I know that the, the, the, the progressives who have launched this huge assault on new atheist, they sort of came up with this term new atheist and I guess originally it had to do with a hitchins and Sam and Daniel Dennett I think, and who is the fourth?

Speaker 2:          53:05          I think there was a fourth in there, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins talking, sorry, but the idea that these people, these new atheists, they're not just atheist to believe whatever the hell they want to believe. They want to destroy religion and I think they spread this meme as a way of silencing people who would critique that. That to me is all they've done here because I have now I know many, many atheists. I know no atheist that is trying to use violence or intimidation in any way to stop anyone from believing anything. Sure. They may critique you, they may ridicule you, should they be quiet, but why should they be quiet now? Shove your religion. I mean, all day long. I should, I should be quiet. And my non belief why, I mean, I'm not suggesting that you should ever be and polite. I mean you can be nice and you can be polite about it, but I have to be quiet.

Speaker 2:          53:52          I was quiet when I was living as a Jew in Lebanon. I didn't want to be quiet anymore. So that's. So, that's really interesting. So that the, all it is, when they say new atheist, all they mean really is an atheist who speaking up. And that's what, that's what they hate more than any of you seen some of my, a satirical traits of our new atheism. I'm sure I've said, uh, I, I used to weigh 200 pounds, then I put on 10 pounds. I'm now a new atheist. I used to have this skin tone. Then I went on vacation. I became the new atheists is a term that's complete nonsense. Yeah. Um, alright. So we're going to do a little more of the, uh, the regressive stuff when we sit down with Lalo and a little bit, but I'm just curious for you personally as you've been part of this discussion.

Speaker 2:          54:37          And again, we just sat down for the first time in August, so we only met about eight months ago. I probably only knew of you on twitter for maybe three, four months before that. As you've become part of this. I'm curious how much of it, how much of it consumes you actually like that? Because I know how personal this is to me. I know that I have trouble shutting it off sometimes at night and I don't mean just my phone, I mean just the thought process and feeling that, that there is something big going on here that were part of a. How big does it feel to you? It's a very big. And often, I mean I would say that the last six months I've spent maybe 50 percent of my time working on these types of issues as opposed to say Mike sort of classic scientific career.

Speaker 2:          55:18          Precisely because I, if you like, I defined my role more broadly than just as somebody who's a professor, right? I mean, I can engage the public in the battle of ideas and, and frankly I'm quite disappointed in many of my colleagues who don't think that way, right? I mean, nobody is contesting the fact that it's really important to do your great basic science. I mean, that's what you are, you're a professor, you're a scientist, but if you've got the capacity to reason, then it is, it is important for you to also participate in battles of ideas that are outside your very limited, uh, lab studies. Right? And so in that sense, I actually have been quite consumed by some of the issues you're saying now where I sometimes regrets my participation is when I don't know when to stop aging some ass who's constantly hounding me.

Speaker 2:          56:07          Now in many cases I'm able to disengage, but in a few times they kind of, they trigger you in some way and then you engage this person and you realize you just wasted an hour and a half speaking to somebody who was in his underwear and his mom's basement. Okay. Yeah. All right, well I'm going to dive more into that with you and allow a little bit. Um, all right, so look, we could talk forever and this is my second interview in a row where I haven't even picked up my, my notes once. Um, but because I started by talking about college and that's what you just brought this to you. Um, what, what's the hope Gimme Gimme the point for some of this turning now I guess we can talk about this stuff and we see it that there is this now movement growing of people that aren't afraid of speaking and all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          56:44          How do you as a professor, a fuel that you can win this and did you feel it right? It's, it's precisely and empowering every single individual to engage the debate. Right? I receive endless private messages from people whom I've never met them. I'll never see again. So you don't just because I watch how you behave and how much you've got to lose professionally and if not also personally, I mean in terms of threats and so on. Uh, this has gotten me the courage to speak out against some of my regressive friends on facebook and I just spent three hours taken on these guys and I wouldn't have done it had I not seen your courage. So basically all you're trying to do is to empower people to feel as though they can make a difference. And by having enough of that, because think about it, the regressive left is quite, uh, an invested in this fight and all you need to do is stand up and offer a counterpoint and get enough people to do it.

Speaker 2:          57:41          Truth is on our side, we will win. Yeah. So that's what enrages them more than anything else to wrap this up. That's what enrages them, is that they've been sort of unchecked example all the time. Right? Like, because they were. Because the right in a lot of respects has gone off the deep end so that there was no rational argument to be had. Now here come us and it's like, oh, we're going to have some rational arguments, but they have been doing the whole cries of racism, not a monopoly. Yeah. And there's a new company that's offering another product. They're not happy. Yeah. What we're going to beat and with better ideas. What do you say? We will. Let's do it. Alright. Well it was a pleasure talking to you of course. And for more of guides that you can follow them on twitter at Dad's. That uh, his youtube channel is in the description below and there's something big coming. We were going to be working together pretty soon. We're going to discuss that with Lalo. Thanks for watching. And we'll do it again next week.
