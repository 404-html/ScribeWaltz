Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I'm going to be sitting down with Tommy Robinson this week to say, Tommy, he's a controversial figure, would be putting it mildly. You only have to glance it is twitter mentions to see how some see him as a modern day hero defending Western society while others see him as a racist thug. Thankfully I don't get all my information from twitter and neither should you. Tommy is the cofounder of the English Defense League, a movement that opposes Islam, Islam and Sharia law in the UK. He left the edl a few years ago after connecting with my [inaudible] is Quilliam Foundation because he felt the edl had become too extreme. Now, Tommy is part of Paquita UK, a subset of the bigger European paquita movement, which has the stated goal of preventing the Islamification of our countries. Basically, Tommy thinks that the UK and now all of Europe are in route to becoming Islamic nations. Time. He reached out to me about two months ago to see about being a guest on the show before I said yes, I actually had to do a bit of soul searching.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       As you guys know, I'm beyond fed up with the regressive left's labeling of everyone a bigot or a racist, but in Tommy's case, are they actually right and if the regressives are, why should I even talk to someone with racist views? There's no doubt. Tommy spends most of his time talking about the dangers of Islam. He certainly isn't hiding that, but are his motives actually based in bigotry? It wasn't just those questions that had me unsure whether to talk to him though there was actually something else at work and something that really exposes the rot that the regressives are causing in our society. Part of me was actually afraid that if I spoke to Tommy, regardless of whether he really is a bigot or not, that I also would be labeled a bigot. Let me repeat that. I feared that just by having a conversation with someone just by hearing their views on this show as I do every week, that I would then get one of those awful labels that people throw around thrown on me.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       After a couple of days of thinking about it, I realized that not only did I have to do the interview with Tommy, but my fear was the exact reason that I had to do it. The chilling effect that words like bigoted and racist have are not just on the person and who they are aimed, but they're also used to stop other people from talking to them. The less we talk, the more the authoritarians can move in with easy answers. Once I really wrapped myself around that, it was a no brainer like all my guests, all at Tommy's ideas be heard and you the audience will be the judge. Ironically, if the left had been more honest about the dangers of Islam, Islam all along, I would feel less of a need to have conversations like this, but they refuse to. So here we are. If his ideas are good, then let them spread.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       If they aren't, then let them be beat by better ideas. As my former guests, Douglas Murray said on Sam Harris' podcast a few weeks ago, it's too late to be willing to be blackmailed by people who are fundamentally insincere in their insults. That's exactly how I feel about labels or pretty much any of the other nonsense coming from people who would rather stifled debate than have it. This past weekend. I rewatched one of my all time favorite movies, v for Vendetta and powerful speech to London. He says, and where once you had the freedom to object to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing you're conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those more responsible than others and they will be held accountable, but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look in the mirror. I think it's getting high time that we all look in the mirror and decide what we believe. My guest this week is an author, activist, and former leader of the English defense league is also no stranger to controversy. Tommy Robinson, welcome to the show.

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       All right man, so I want to start with this, which is what I lead the show off with, which is that I struggled with the decision to even have you on the show because I see what people say about you and half of it is this guy is going to save the Western world and then half of it is he's a bigot. He's a racist and plenty other stuff, uh, in line with that. So first off, do you get that often? Do you get that people are sometimes afraid to talk to you?

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Um, yes. And there's a reason for that. You will be targeted as high as anyone else that speaks to me. Oh Great. By a campaign, you will trust me. You will. I've just been asked last night it was released on ongoing to be addressing this, the Hindu leadership of the UK. I've been invited to an event to discuss multiculturalism. They've been targeted, they're getting attacked now. I expect that when I turn up, if they're not forced or pressurized into canceling, which is what's happened with university after university, after university with schools, anyone that asked me to speak, even tv shows in the UK, there's a conservative effort to silence what I'm saying and to attack anyone that gives me a platform to say it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       Yeah. Well, as I mentioned that the top, that was really what my deciding factor was to talk to you because I'm so sick of everyone being labeled bigoted and racist and all that. That if I'm afraid to talk to you then that that is almost a bigger problem than bigotry and racism, so that's why we have to do this, I think.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Yeah. You're, you're in a minority that I so thank you. All right. Well, most people put their reputations or their careers or what things are that before free speech in the UK.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Yeah. Well, somehow I still have this belief that if I talk about free speech that it'll actually be good for my career. We shall, but why? Why don't we start with this? Let's just start with the most obvious piece of meat. Are you bigoted against Muslims?

Speaker 2:          00:06:05       Go to separate Muslims. Whenever I, whenever I speak, I try to set up separate Muslims from Islam. I have an opinion on Islam in the same way Islam has an opinion on me. Islam is bigoted towards Muslims. I'm not every Muslim, of course, every, every Muslim is not bigoted. Um, if you, if you've read my book that some of the best meet people I've met in my life growing up on Muslims, I don't have a problem with Muslim, but I do have a problem with the way Islam is influencing my country. I have a problem with the hatred that is incited from it. And um, and we're fearful of what the future holds.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Right? So just to be clear, and this is what I've spent a lot of the time on the show talking about. You're making a distinction between Islam, meaning the doctrine, the set of ideas that are in books, a between that and between the people that may or may not be using these ideas. And as you said, you've met plenty of Muslim people that you liked a lot and you're making that distinction.

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       I'll make that distinction in a similar way to the fact that, look, if I was a critic of Scientology, I would not be getting called a racist. I would not be getting called any of the things that I am just because it happens that the majority of Muslims are not white on, beaten down and attacked with this racist stick. Which is ridiculous because Islam is an idea. It's an idea that should be criticize and it's my God given right to criticize it. I don't incite hate against any individual Muslims. I've never ever there. I let the English Defense League for over six years. Um, I've never been done for any racism, any extremism, any insightful speeches. In fact, if people at the height of leading the English Defense League when there was, um, when our soldier leaving, he was beheaded in the streets of London are very next demonstration. I started my speech off by saying that there are 600 Muslims who served in the British armed forces that if you attack a Muslim woman or you get spare Muslim woman, you're.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       You're an absolute coward and I tried to get the distinction between some things are morally just and I think my campaign is morally just and righteous and other things, a cowardly attack in houses of worship, whether they be Christian or Muslim is cowardly. So from. I've done that from day one. In fact, as far as the organization goes, we've been a moderate voice in this in this, but we can put completely attacked as extremists or hateful and insight and hate. Literally just this week I've gone where we're having a demonstration in the city of Birmingham, which is Britain's second biggest city, has it, has a large Muslim population that has a lot of problems there. And I met a Muslim counselor and this is the. This is where the problem comes in. And I said to him, if an organization is completely peaceful and there's no violence, there's no alcohol. Do they have a right to come to this city? And criticized as well, and he said no, and that's where we're at. And I said, why not? He said, because criticizing Islam insights. Hey, I said, telling the truth can't incite hey, and, and that's where we've been beaten down so much because so many. And He, he's a counselor for the Labor Party, which is a mainstream political party. So many people are against free speech when it comes to Islam.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       Yeah. Well as my audience knows, I mean this is really where the left has failed. And from everything that I'm hearing from my friends in the UK and across most of Europe, sadly most of western Europe, the left is failing everywhere. Uh, and the more that the voices of Liberals are silenced, the more that the far right is going to be strengthened. A, you're probably somewhat of an example of that. So before we get into all the specifics and everything that's going on today, can you just tell me a little bit of your history growing up when you became politically active? That kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       So I grew up in a town called Luton. Um, so one of the most multicultural towns in Europe when I was born in 1982, there was one mosque. Now there's an excess of 30. We have approximately 50,000 Muslims. We've had just last week for Muslims from my hometown. One which went, went to my school, had been charged with terrorism, another young, another Muslim who was a white convert. Just again this, this week has been charged with insight and support for Isis. My hometown was the launch pad for the seven seven attack on London. London's underground, the fertilizer bomb plot. Um, the stock counting bomber. Some of you may remember the stock bomber. He was radicalized in my hometown. He lived two doors away from my army. So Amazon Redeem Omar, Omar Bakri Abu Hamza with the hook, their head office and their organizations base was in my town. So I, what's going on in their town?

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       What's going on in that sound is, um, we've had, it's been the epicenter and the, and the home of radical Islam. And there'd been allowed with unchallenged by councils or government or police for 30 years to plan, orchestrate, and radicalize an entire community. And we've filled in my hometown after September the 11th in America when I come out to my shops the next week, we had magnificent noname posters everywhere. We had posters glorifying the 19 suicide bombers. Um, the in the local college. They celebrate it every year after that, outside in our town center, there was a celebration parade for the Muslims who, who, who murdered on September 11th. That's where I live. So I've grown up from a very young age and I have, I have many of these, what we call liberals in the UK, they're not really liberals, but or those on the left who condemn me, they shout at me that they.

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       And they know nothing about the life I've lived. I think, oh, to the life I've lived that have not seen what we've seen. They don't live with the effects. And when we talk about multiculturalism in the UK, we have our political leaders. David Cameron has come out and said, multiculturalism has failed. Angela Merkel said years ago, multiculturalism has failed. What they're actually saying, what they're actually saying. This Islams failed because in my hometown and my group of friends, the majority of them come from immigrant backgrounds, whether it be Saint Lucian, Italian, Bulgarian, Jamaican, Indian, and everyone gets on fine. And that, and my town has been divided, not through, not through racial lines ever. We don't have the racial problem. I don't know if you believe you may have in the US, but we don't have a racial problem that we have a religious tensions and the religious line drawn through the communities.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       Right. So when you saw this growing up, uh, you know, you're not, you're not that old, right? You're in your mid thirties. When did your sort of awakening a appear? When did you say, okay, this is something that I'd have to talk about and attach myself to?

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       So my, my, my awakening was, um, the Beslan school massacre 2000 and 2004, I believe it was. What it was was that I'd watch this group, this group, how measure dean, I'd watch them grow and and when I say watch them, one of the man who's convicted this week, who was an ex member of their organization, a white ginger convert would ebe room Hansen, his name is Roger. Really? I watched him convert. I'd watched him become radical. I'd seen some of my own friends who had converted in prison and changed yet, so I'd seeing it or seeing this group and then I watched an interview after the Beslan massacre where this group was saying in my hometown that if it happened to an English school, it would be justified. And I also knew that that group openly converting and recruiting in my town center where my family go. Where were y'all go? They were openly recruiting on the streets every single Saturday to send people to fight for the Taliban against our armed forces. And that was it for me. That was 2004. I organized my first demonstration. I was aged 21 years old and I organize a demonstration called bandaloop and Taliban,

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       so it's hard to believe that. So they're actually recruiting in a town in England for the Taliban. We know that a lot of Isis fighters are coming from England. They're coming from all of western Europe basically going through Turkey right into Syria. What does law enforcement do about that? It sounds like not much, right?

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       I do nothing. I do nothing. So what I did when I organize this demonstration, I actually made leaflets over 10 years ago now and in those leaflets, what we're going back 12 years, so this was before people had heard of homegrown terrorism in the UK before people have heard of these organizations and in the leaflets I made a point that our daughters and our sisters are being groomed, which we now know as an epidemic called grooming, which is where groups of Muslim men would get young girls and their gang raped them and it's become an epidemic across the UK, but it's been going on for 30 years. No one's ever spoke about it now. Twelve years ago I made a leaflet which went on the front page and one national news of my local newspaper saying whites and blacks are being religiously target. Our women are being pimped and sexually abused and prostituted by Muslim gangs. I named the Muslim gangs. I named the extremist organizations. Um, and I stood in the town center and read, read this leaflet out wherever I said that we demand that the police act with demand that the council's act, um, there was no action after that. In fact, all that happened was I was targeted. I was targeted by Muslim gangs.

Speaker 1:          00:15:25       Can some of the blame here be blamed on something related to, to British society that maybe we don't have here in America, America for all our faults and we have plenty of racial problems and all kinds of stuff. We've done the melting pot pretty well. Everyone is come here no matter where they're from. And pretty much mixed in bringing their traditions and then, and then becoming American. It sounds like from the emails I'm getting from Denmark and Sweden and all this, that something has happened in Europe, but I guess specifically in the UK where for whatever reason, the Muslim population just hasn't integrated the way that other immigrant populations have been. Some of that be on the fault of the UK and not just the Muslim population.

Speaker 2:          00:16:08       Yes it can. Yes. It can be on the, with multiculturalists who encouraged all these people to come here, told them that their culture was equal to us, told them that they can go back into their own communities. They can live as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq and Pakistan. Um, and as soon as anyone like ourselves try to scratch beneath the surface to say, well, let's see where we differ culturally. Let's see where our opinions differ. Then we've been screened down as racist. And the reality is we need to understand, and you say it's worked relatively well in, in, in America. You have nowhere near the percent of Muslims in comparison to Europe and it and it will not work well in America. And that's the, that's the bone. And you need to realize is that you need to learn from what's happening over here because you're going to face the same problems. If you're ever uneducated Somalians coming in uncontrollable numbers, you will face exactly the same problems I've. I've grown up with a loop. If you allow, if you allow Saudi Arabia, you allow guitar, you allow around, you allow them footholds in your country with Salafist or what hobbies mosques. You allow them to build schools and teach these children hatred. You will in the next generation. The experience in the height I experienced growing up.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       So what do you think a town like yours where it. This has been growing for a long time as you're saying what should be done at this point? I mean these people are citizens of the UK. So what should be done to fight these ideas? Not the people, but to fight these ideas that are spreading.

Speaker 2:          00:17:32       What, what, what shouldn't be done is my local counsel spend 188,000 pounds of tax payers money given, given to the Salafist mosque. I'm not a master. Causes us huge problem that that's a mos that went off set, went in into it. They found books in the children's school library for how to handsome fee. Um, we shouldn't be funding them. We also should not be allowed in Saudi Arabia or Qatar to fund these addresses are popping up left, right, and center. We should be tough on, on, on so many issues. We, we, it's knowing where to start really. And I think towns that haven't had the problems at Luton have had, should be looking to our town looking at the infiltration. What we've seen is the way the Muslims control themselves and the way they vote. Then our local council no longer care about us. They don't care because we don't keep them in power. The Labor party are kept in power every year in Luton by 30 to $50,000 remotes. So we become irrelevant and that's spoke bank politics and we don't vote based on someone's ethnicity or we don't vote on base somewhere. Someone's religion, but the Muslim community do. That's all they vote.

Speaker 1:          00:18:42       Yeah. So, you know, even as I'm talking to you, I have this feeling because I'm a liberal, I have this feeling of, you know, is he exaggerating this like, is this, how big is this problem? You know, I follow you on twitter, you tweet videos all day long, have, you know, women being attacked either in the UK or in Germany or wherever, and sometimes I have trouble sort of figuring out how much of this is actually happening all over the place. How big are the problem is versus is it just this micro problem? Uh, and I guess I guess your answer would be, well, if it's a micro problem in my town, but it's, it's spreading into this big macro thing.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       The problem is bigger than anyone can comprehend. And that's why the political leaders, that's why police forces, that's why it's now a fact in the UK that police, social workers councils conspired to hide these tracks for, for decades.

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       Can go into that a little bit because there's been a couple, a couple controversies about that.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Yeah. So, so there, there's been a rover and rapport before this Robin, Rapport Ppp. We used to, people used to say I was lying or inciting hate, and I choose to say it because it happened to my cousin, the similar sorts of crimes and we knew what the police reaction was then, so there was a robin report and in depth report into one little small town in the north of England in that small town, there's a population of male Muslims that are aged, aged between 18 to 40. There's about 3000 now in that town. They identified 1,400 young English girl who had been beaten, prostituted, and right in unbelievable numbers. Some of the goals right? 30 Times in one night and when they've done this big report, what they've found in the report actually was the council knew full well. The head of the police knew the Muslim community knew everyone knew this was happening, but the reason why they'd done nothing was through the fear of being branded as racists.

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       That's how powerful political correctness is. Now two, are there circumstances in this report where the. When the police turned up and there was a young girl who was 11 years old and she's been in a derelict house by five Muslim men now when the police turned up, they arrested the girl for being drunk and disorderly. I let you've got to read the report that you've got to read the report and also there's another circumstance where the go the go. Two of the girls who were taken and these girls were missing for days at 12 years old, 13 years old, 14 years old. They're going to miss him for dates. Two of the girls were taken, so the dads went to get the girls back. The goals were inside the house. The dads have gone to the Muslim's house to get them back. When the police turned up, the police arrested the English girls, dads, they left the goat, and so these sort of things, which one of your view is that they sound unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:21:24       They sound unbelievable actually. They're in a government report. This is going on across our whole entire country. This isn't just going on in our country is going on in Holland. It's gone on across Europe. Look at, look at what's happening in Sweden and this is comes from a mindset and a culture and an ideology that teaches them that Muslim Muslim, not just more women are inferior but not non Muslim women like ours, that dirt. Not that that's not all Muslims because some Muslims I've grown up with would be as disgusted as we are, but what? There is a problem if you look at the statistics for these not paedophilia because the majority of pedophiles in the UK are white, which you'd expect from a 90 percent white country. This is a new, a new epidemic that men share young children with their brothers, their cousins, their work colleagues that the level, the viewing of it within the community or within the group is not viewed in a similar way to how we would if it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       If a member of our community. He said, I've got this young 12 year old girl that you'd fill them in, but this is something very, very different and it's new to the country and what we're seeing now. We've seen it with Cologne again, with on New Year's Eve is now been putting people's faces more than ever and we feel. I feel I've got two young daughters. I've got two young doors. We have to. I was just speaking before about a professor who, who Angela Merkel's given a speech this week in a university and the professor has stood up and he's heckled her and he said, I'm scared. I have children. I have children. What, what, what, what? What future are you bringing to our children? This is an experiment you know nothing about and that's the reality of it and it's not an experiment. We know nothing about. We know what's going to happen. We know what's going to happen from case studies. Luton town is a blueprint for the rest of the UK. It's a blueprint for the rest of Europe. It's a blueprint for America. What's happening here? It's happening everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       Yeah. It's incredibly chilling, listening to you, and again, that's why. That's why I wanted to talk to you and try to get a sense of the size of this whole thing. I saw a video this week. Did you see this? A 16 year old girl posted a video from Germany talking about how she went to her local supermarket and she saw these guys staring her and they were migraines and they were. She really be was a afraid for her life. She posted a 20 minute video on facebook, which she clearly delineated. She said, I have nothing against Muslim people. She said, I have friends that are Muslim. All of that stuff. She said, these people, these specific people that are coming now, there's something different and from what I understand, the video was taken down and she was at least temporarily suspended from facebook so that that really shows you how perverse the political correctness has got. If now facebook is in on it too.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       Oh, facebook's completely. Everyone keeps getting suspended for posting videos or pictures of the reality and the truth. That young girl, my. That angers me so much more than I can even express when I watched that and I could well up in my eyes and thinking, she's not free to walk to our shops in Germany in 2016. Why is she not free? Because hordes of hoards of Muslim men are coming in from a completely different culture, a completely different view on women are completely different that we have to understand their mindset and what gets me is that I'm all for helping refugees. These are not refugees. Sixty percent, 60 percent this week. The EU commissioner has come out and said they're economic migrants. Sixty percent. Angela Merkel was open those borders to one and a half million last year. There is going to be a flood in the next coming years of tens of millions of Muslims come into come into Europe, come into our continent where that go and her feeling is just going to be natural to everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       Everybody's going to be feeling and we shouldn't feel fearful. When our in our own homes and towns and we do all we had, all I ever hear about is Islamophobia. All we ever hear about is that Muslim women are scared. I'm not being funny, but no one's raped Muslim women. No one is gang rape in Muslim women. No young Muslim goals were attacked on New Year's Eve. No Muslim has had their heads hate cut off in the street. No, this is not happening to Muslims and, and that's, and that's where when we look at the target, and I had a meeting this week with lead it, with a leading of a seek, a safe organization. You should talk to him. He, he can give you a real in depth of what's going on from a sales perspective. He deals with hundreds and hundreds of young children who have been taken from their families by Muslim gangs.

Speaker 2:          00:26:05       Um, and in the most recent one when I went with a radio presenter and the radio presenter said, where's got nothing to do with religion? And he said, well actually everything they're saying to the girls while rape is about religion is a religion or race or I can go through the court cases where there was a smiley, Smiley and rape gang down in Bristol in the UK. And he actually said it was his religious duty to do this. This is really. And these are not what we're saying is what they're saying. They're saying, you white trash, you whitefield will gut you like a pig. All of these comments are being made to these young English girls and all everyone wants to get around. The fact is, oh, everyone's or everyone does it. No, not 90 percent. The 90 percent of the convictions, the street gang grooming, our Muslim men have a population of four percent.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       Well, you know, I really am starting to see this as almost a disease of the mind of people on the left because even if even if everything you were saying was being magnified by 20 percent, 50 percent, let's say you're, you're totally doubling the, the severity of all of this. It's still a problem. And every time I hear my friends on the left talk about it, they'll immediately say, well, you know, Christianity, there were the crusades or the Catholic Church has covered up molesting children for hundreds of years. All these things. No one's denying those things, right? And some of those things are still happening right now, but that doesn't mean that what you're talking about isn't a problem. So my question to you is, when in the UK did the left go off the deep end,

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       you say, what will I keep trying to say? And I've tried to save for six years now this is not a left wing or right wing issue because people will automatically pigeonhole myself as right wing or no, actually that's a lie. I'm pigeon holed as far. Right, right. Or Am I ugly? Um, whereas the majority of people who have supported my organization over the years, many of them would have been left wing Labor votes. Um, so

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       to be clear, the reason they'd be left wing is because they're for women's rights, right. And they're probably for gay rights and, and they're generally for minorities. So they should fit on the left. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       that'd been pushed and forced to the right. And that's because the left in the UK politically rely and have basically the Labour party in the UK, they're, they're, they're loyal vote bank used to be working class people like myself. Yeah. In, in England we have a very classist system. I don't think you've experienced the same in America, but we have a very classist system. We have the bottom and the top and you have what is fundamentally, usually conservative people were very wealthy and working class people are usually quite poor or not, or not quite poor, but Paul and proud anyway, but what we. What we then see is that as, as as working class people started doing better, they would then aspire to be conservative because they get more money. Yeah. Right. So then it seems that the Labor Party, you just completely give up on this, on this section of the community, and they went straight for which Tony Blair is.

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       That government has have admitted, bring in in loyal votes, which were immigrants which have now become Muslims. There's one speech where you can. Anyone can watch it. It's his name. So He'd met Malik and he's a. He was a Labor MP for Jews, Brie. And in his speech, he clearly tells us, Satan, in 2001 we had one Muslim MP in 2004, we had free freedom is an MP in 2008 we had eight Ms Dot mmps. And in between saying each thing he says, inshallah, inshallah and up. And he says, we've been 15 years in this country. The majority of Mps will be Muslim and then or the crowd, which is a thousand or cheer and clap. And then he says in, within 30 years the prime minister of this nation will share our faith. Now again, or say, don't listen to what I'm saying. There's plenty of Muslims.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       And when he says this as a representative for the Labor Party, this is the problem. When you mix religion with politics, which is now happening, just it goes like this. Now actually, um, we have the Labor Party, which is the leading left wing organization. When they have their meetings in Muslim, predominantly cities, they segregate the odd audiences. They segregate the audience is men and women in law, in with Sharia. This is a party that's supposed to stand up for women that's supposed to stand up for gay people's rights. And that's why I'm, I have our contempt and disgust with what the, what the Labor Party and the left have now become. But that doesn't mean all left wing people because Islam is something that should concern and especially the literal interpretations of it shouldn't concern everybody on the left and every liberal should be screaming from the rooftops or what's happening.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       I know, believe me, believe me, I wish they were so just as long as we're going on the political side of this. You were part of the British National Party for a while, I think about 10 years ago. And you left because you thought they were going too far, right? You thought they were becoming racist and that caused you to leave.

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       Correct. So what happened was that, that was when, when I spoke about the pendulum school massacre, which when I was 21, I started looking online to find who's talking about these things. And there was only one group talking about and they were called the British national Pi. Um, I joined the British National Party on a 12 month. They had a meeting, so I went along to the meeting and I joined in that meeting in my hometown. They then set up a second meeting where we were going to bring. Our friends were not turned up with my friends to the second meeting. They said he can't come in, he can't come in. It was the black lines with these English lads. Yeah, they're my best friends. So they said they can't come in. So I said, what do you mean they can't come in? And they saw non non white people can't join the British National Party.

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       Now I was 21 years old, never involved in politics, never an interest in policy. So I didn't realize then that the leader of this organization is named Nick Griffin. I didn't realize he was a holocaust denier or didn't realize that I didn't realize that he used to be leader of the National Front and RC organization. And so from that, which there was a leaked membership list, which is how people know I as a member, but I didn't rejoin the next three years. That was my flirtation with the British National Party was done. Or then in 2009, about five years later, I sat the English Defense League. I set that up based on my own principles, which, where anyone can join. We actually went onto have a Sikh division I lesbian and gay division, a Jewish division. Um, and anyone that's affected by these problems because I've, I've grown up in a town where I don't care about other cultures. I don't care about. I don't care if you're gay, I don't care if you're straight. None of that bothers me. My problem is with this radical, this radical ideology, which is going to cause us all serious problem. So it's up. But like did leave the English Defense League as well? Yes. I left in 2013. I left because I found that a lot more time. The majority of my time actually it was not spent trying to tackle the issues it was spent trying to keep backward inbred far right Nazis out of the movement.

Speaker 1:          00:32:57       Right. So that's a really interesting point and I think it's sort of illuminates your story a lot, so to be clear you left one party because they didn't want black people basically in their party. And then when you started the edl where you had plenty of people from all walks of life joining you, you ended up leaving that too because it went too far. Right? So when people paint you as this ultra right nationalist, whether they agree with all the other stuff you're saying or not, that just. It just isn't true from any estimation that I can see

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       anyone. Anyone can spend five minutes on Google, you can go to these ultra right wing Nazi nationalist organizations and see what they think of me. I get just as many death threats from them. I'm known as the real far away. See what happens is I get called fire, right? The real far right in the UK. I'm a Zionist. Do that. That's why from the real Pharma, of course, of course. Yeah, of course.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       So real quick though on when you left, the edl that was facilitated by Quilliam, which is marginalizes organization that's trying to foster coexistence. I've had my jacket on. I, I hugely admire him. Can you just real quick explain how he helped facilitate you getting out?

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       I was leaving. I was leaving the organization anyway, so I was leaving. I'd made the decision I was leaving. I then met, imagine the was and I'd known of their organization and some of the work that done anyway. I'm, if I'm honest, it benefit me and it benefited him at that time and I'm, that's just me being completely honest. I, I, then I then spent some time with Quilliam who are seen as reformist Muslims. What, what I realized it was the many of them are, if they're honest, are apostates. Um, they don't follow the teachings of Islam, which is why they're saying able to say what they do, but then because of that

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       softening the blow, so to speak, they're not coming out right and saying we don't believe in this. They're saying we're trying to reform it just because that's a little more palatable, sort of.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       Yeah, but then their target that I actually hate it more than me. They're actually hated more than me by Muslims and then the more time I spent. Look, I met Majeed. I'm a Sama, has a summer seminar, still site is one of the most sincere and decent men I've met in my life, but they. They're not being entirely honest with the public about where we're at. I've done some training in there and I was taught that when we talk about Islam missed so that the acceptable word now is that we're against Islam is we're against Islamism, which if so then what they said is Islamist ideology and they wrote a graph and through this chart and it was punishment for adultery, a punishment for homosexuality. Oh, the older backward ideas that come out of it. But, and they said that 90 percent of mosques in the UK are propagating this.

Speaker 2:          00:35:47       Not Ninety percent of the Muslims in the mosque, but 90 percent of the mosque because who's funding and controlling them and the hierarchy and the teachers. And the mom's 90 percent of whom can't speak English, Iva, they're 90 percent of the Masa propagate and Islamist ideology and they. They had Islamist ideology under folks Islam and then they had true Islam, which I said 10 percent work, but obviously I have a huge problem with this because if 90 percent of propagating this in the UK, that's true Islam, I get what you're trying to do and I wish you. I wish you every success in trying to change this, but we've had 1400 years of history that shows it hasn't changed. You're fighting a battle now where, and I asked him when the last time I saw a Sama, Sandra, I said, how many people have you converted to your liberal form of Islam this week? Because while you've been doing that, radical extremists in prisons across this country and Taoist tools across this country are probably converted thousands.

Speaker 1:          00:36:40       Yeah, and I want to get to the prison part and a little bit because you've had some completely insane experiences in prison, but just to wrap this part up, the interesting piece here is that although you're not working with my jihad now you guys in your own way, you're both apostates to your community. He's considered, you know, I see all the horrible things that people call him, porch monkey and terrible things coming out of the Muslim community saying about him and coming from white people on the left, which they'd be considered racist if they said it about about a black person of course, but in a way you both are now sort of outcasts and that kind of brings you together. Which to me, that's where the real conversation is. Whether you work with him or kill him ever again. That's, that's the lane that this has to go down.

Speaker 2:          00:37:26       The conversation is, but this isn't a time for conversation. It's like it's. If we could rely on Muslims to solve this problem. If I'm at the opinion now, we can't. Unfortunately. I think I spent two years float in there with different groups and talking to every moderate Muslim I'm introduced to just tomorrow night in the UK. There's a BBC radio four program and I went last week because we're going and I traveled round me in Muslim leaders again and when I met this account or extremism, counter terrorism hailed as the most moderate of Muslims you can get. When I sat down with him, I said, will you please condemn punishment for apostasy in the Islamic states? Whether that be in Saudi Arabia just anywhere in the world, please condemn it, wouldn't do it. I said, you can't even condemn that. Someone has the freedom to think you can't even do that.

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       He goes, well, we're not there. I said it. That's not hard. It's not difficult if you want people to be punished for thinking a different way or you don't, and this is another Muslim that's hailed as the most moderate and to be honest, if I can't say I've met one of other match in the West other than some of the Muslims in Quilliam, other than that, older and older Muslims I've met and I've. I've pushed them on questions. I found that once I scratched onto beneath the surface, actually they hold some quite a point of views. They do and if it was time for, if Muslims could solve this problem, then the combined military force around in 50 to 100,000 isis soldiers or Isis Millan's is up to $5,000,000 combined military force and they've done nothing and they're not going to. So we, we have, we have to do things now. We have to enforce laws. We have to push agendas that are going to make sure that we're secure and to make sure that we are not just secure but stable in the future and we can't rely on Muslims to do.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       Okay, so you bring up some of what's going on with the prison system in the UK. You've been to prison a couple times. Actually, I think about two weeks ago. You might've been in prison for a day or something. Is that right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       I'm almost arrested. I've been arrested and charged again. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       Yeah. So I don't want to get too much into the things that you've been arrested for. Some of them sound like extremely jumped a trumped up charges. This is a lot of what your book is about, but can you talk a little bit about what your experience was like in prison and how powerful the ideas of Islamism are actually spreading in the prison system?

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       Sorry, from the first time I went to custody in 2004, 2005 things have moved forward very quickly within the prison system, so to say. Then the next time that I went back into prison was um, 2010 for actually illegally enter enter in America, but that was, um, 2010. And what I've witnessed each time I've been in custody would terrify anyone. And I honestly say that if you could see the maximum security prisons that were the most dangerous prisoners and most dangerous men in the UK are being used as ics training camps, training camps, the white labs, the black glass, everyone is converting, everyone has a big huge bed. It is the biggest gang in the system. And it's something that the authorities have not got grip off. They can't control the mom, God bless them. Some of them are, are trying, um, but they're seen as student. He has to. So the moms, people are not taking their Shahada and converting to Islam in the mosque on Friday. They're, they're doing on the wing, on the prisoners wings. They run their own mosques.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       So this is going to sound sort of amateurish because I've never been to prison. But when you've been there, what, like how is it that these ideas spread? Why is it that the prison system is allowing, and I know this, this is in the United States, do with, there's all kinds of crazy religious stuff that goes on in prisons and drug deals and all, you know, it's all nuts. But what is going on that that they are even allowing these ideas, bread,

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       they call it, stop them. I can't stop. It's say Islam forms of Providence. I probably heard you mess with one Muslim. You mess with every Muslim. So in some instances Islam is being used within the prison system, used for power control and money is something that anyone can attach themselves to. And and that's what's happened. But it's also been orchestrated and organized to you see in in British prisons where if a Muslim gets another non-muslims convert outside, sources are sending them in money. Yeah. To. And also if you know the ideology of Islam, it's the pathway to heaven. For them, it's the pathway to heaven is to spread Islam, to spread dour and to convert prisoners. But what you're seeing then is some of the most dangerous and extreme people in the UK are converting to Islam. And it also gives, when I say it's powerful, we look in the UK, we've lost our identity through political correctness and for years and years of being beaten down.

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       English people have lost their community. We don't have the community feeling that the Muslim community have and when you've lost your identity and your tour time and time again, or you're told Time and time again that your identity and your culture and your history is not good, and then and then comes along this, this powerful, powerful community that will stick together and we and you'll never be on your own and it gives them everything they had been searching for. You have to remember a lot of people who are in the prison system have been wrong their whole life from a very young age. They. They've done a lot of wrong as well, but there's a reason many of them and chose that path. They've started with nothing. They've had nothing. They've got nothing. Islam gives them a course. It gives them something to fight for.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       It gives them something to concentrate on it and it all. I've seen a lot in my life, but what I saw happening in the prison system, I don't know how we're gonna deal with it. I think steps we can take. If you look at the statistics in French prisons that have a population of, I believe seven percent Muslim, 70 percent of the prisoners on Muslim in the UK. I spoke to prison officers who said that in one week they had 60 conversions because a Muslim gang had come into the prison and just started beating an attack and everybody to convert and then before you know it, everyone just converse for the, for the easy time because if you're in trouble when you want protection, you convert.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       So when you were in jail, speaking of being beaten, you were beaten basically to a pulp, right? I mean all your teeth knocked out and really some horrible stuff, but you'd never converted. So how did you even, or I guess just talk about the violence that you were subjected to first.

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       So I was in the UK prison system. They have laws and rules that they have to follow. They have a duty of care for every prisoner. Now what they did when against every single one. So I'm under no doubt. In fact, if I, if I taught when I was taken to woodhill here was a maximum security prison in the UK, the houses, some of the country's most feared and dangerous terrorists. I was in prison for a financial irregularity on a form for that, for that offense. You go to an open prison where you go home. I was taken to a maximum security category, a prison. I was Po, Po, po in my cell, and that very first day when my daughter first I opened it, it was an ex world marine commando who's a British, the British military, and he said, when they come to get you from cell, do not leave this cell, and I went, what?

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       He goes, you're life depends on it. Don't leave this cell, and then 10 minutes late he's come with two other prison officers and said, come on. You're going to be with. Obviously I'll say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not. I'm not leaving this cell because I didn't leave the so I didn't get arrested, so I'll get further charge, but I'm arrested and then. And then I go to see Miss Lisa. The next day and I have a meeting with my solicitor about what's happening when they take me back after the meeting and they opened up a waiting room and as soon as I look in the waiting room, I see the big huge beard of a white, a white convert on putting into the room of about eight people in it and I'm violently attacked and the door's locked. The door was locked by the prison officers, the doors locked and I'm left to be bit by Libyan and then not just that, but I was arrested again for fine.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       They said, but that's just one experience in the prison system. To be honest. I'm lucky and I believe that people were pulling strings in order to have me killed. Now I think even that they are scratching their heads to how I walked out and that's just one experience that's happened. Time and time. Mind you said, I spent a day the other week in custody. Again, this was. This was quite recent, just probably six months ago. I was coming to the end of my license period with the authorities where they have you on a control order. I wasn't allowed to contact people who are in the organization are used to, used to. And this was for a mortgage, a so called mortgage for it. Anyone who reads, reads, reads the story of what happened. We'll see what it was all about. But I was um, I was taken from the last eight days so it lost its or put back in prison.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       I was taken to a prison called Peterborough where I said at the stars, so there's got days left. I dice, I'm going to get killed. Yeah, just put me in, put me in isolation. I don't care if you don't open the door for eight days. The idea is let me go home. I'll come out with myself and I've talked to prison officer again. I said, look, we know what's going to happen here. And they've said, oh, we'll have a word. And then I prisoners come up to me what an English prison. And he, he put his hand over his mouth. He said, you're going to get done with Baltimore now in prison, in prison. They put boiling water with sugar and it takes you, it will take your face off. So I'm looking, I've got two minutes to think. I said who's going to do it?

Speaker 2:          00:46:45       And he said, the lag behind the door has put the money up because he'd paid money to have me her. Now the lag behind the standing next to the door was doing 28 years in prison for a murder where they can't, a man's nose, eyes, ears off, making odium. Now there was four of them in for that murder. I'm in eight days. I am known as someone who, who has, uh, I've had, uh, Al Shabaab have named me to be killed. I've had six government ultimate mornings sign that there is intelligence. I'm going to be murdered by Muslims. And here I am doing eight days house with Muslim murderers. Sorry. And then, um, so my mind's going quick. I already know that. I've asked the principal far to segregate me. So there is no luck there. I look across, I know I do what I had to do and before he has a chance to turn around with his comp, I strike him and then and then the prison, old older screws.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       The prison officers come and jump in. Now. I went before the prison governor for that offense where I explain myself. I said, look, you put me in this position where I've got. I have to defend myself. They decided to take no further action. I was then I was released from prison or they went on a holiday with my wife and children. I landed back at home at Luton airport at midnight and the police were waiting for me. They arrested me in front of my kids and they arrested me for the, for attacking the Somalia and prisoner who was going to do me a boy. The more they then made a decision in October last year to have no further action, so they said, we're not taking any further action. I then recently, just two weeks ago, I launched a Poquito UK, which is a new organization to have street demonstrations and two days later they come and they come and rearrested me for the offense that they'd already dropped.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       This is a lot of what your book is about and it's sort of this endless cycle that you've been part of. Um, and I know we could talk about the prison stuff forever because you're just scratching the surface of it, but let's talk about Paquita a little bit. So I think you just got back from Germany. You were doing something with them in Germany,

Speaker 2:          00:48:43       is that right? Yeah, I'll just come back last night. So I went to Copenhagen First, um, where I bought British journalist with us. So we went to Copenhagen to sort of launch Paquita in Denmark and to ask the people to stand with us on the sixth of February because on the sixth of February we're planning demonstrations in 14 countries. Now this is the first time a coalition like this has been formed and it's only been made possible by the people, by the commitment, and the people have dressed and their leadership have looked back mountain and the other. The other is interesting because for the last year, every single Monday for 52 weeks, they have taken to the streets in their tens of thousands of times. The, the, the demonstration. I just went through this Monday, there was well over 10 to 15,000 people there in a completely peaceful and civilized manner to express their, their concern, free passive resistance. So what's happening?

Speaker 1:          00:49:35       So just to be clear, when, when this, uh, this mass attack happened in Cologne just a couple of weeks ago, at the beginning of the year, uh, it seemed like the police were not there. People did not know who to turn to. A women were literally were being raped and attacked and all of that stuff. And then there were some demonstrations a couple of days later, I think in Colona and some other cities. And suddenly there were a lot of police to police the people that were there to protest the violence that happened to the women. Something really backwards here.

Speaker 2:          00:50:07       Oh, is there at that demonstration? I. I know exactly what it is. When you, when you get large disturbances of Muslims, the police do stairway. They. Because if they go in with their bands, if they go in and try and please the streets provoke a riot and that riot will spread and they know that so that we've seen that many times when we hang up here, I can send you a video after video, which actually shows the police running away in the UK. Now they don't run away from us. They knock your teeth out and knock your head off before they run away. When it comes to, they're told to police the communities differently. Now on New Year's Eve, the head of the police actually asked his superiors. He asked for an extra hundred police officers. He was refused. And then what we saw was these massive attacks and these mass rapes of of German women. And you're right there no one to turn to. And only traveled out there for the next demonstration. And Lo and behold, you've got thousands of police officers. You've got water cannons and I'm German people were attacked with water cannons by the police.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       So is the situation in Germany particularly precarious even though you mostly focused in the UK because that's where you're from. I've heard a lot of people say that in Germany because of the guilt related to the Holocaust that they, they feel as a nation a certain amount of guilt. So when, when these migrants and uh, all these people want to come there, they feel an extra need, uh, to help them. And because of that, that's why Merkel let in the whatever it is, I think it's one point 2 million people and that even when they do violent acts as a society, they're more condoning of it because they know that their ancestors have done some pretty horrible stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       Well, this generation of Germans seem to be living with and suffering from guilt from Hitler. The next generation of Germans will suffer and live with guilt from. And so that's what I need to wake up to. This generation. Have nothing to feel guilty about. They have a beautiful country, a beautiful culture, the envy of the world, and they're beautiful people, so civilized and decent people and they have nothing to feel good. We also, so what? What this is is underestimation of, of the culture and ideology. They're allowing it. That's what it is like if everyone's all make him humanity responses, we must help these people but not help them. If it involves the destruction of your culture and your and your country, not help them at the cost or the expense of young German goes that and I'm all for helping refugees. I just don't think they should be helped in Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       I think they should be helped in the Middle East. I think that we should be leading the way in funding and military support to make sure that there are buffer zones, but I don't think they're important and to be honest, by important one point 2 million this, is she making any impact on the suffering of of refugees across the Middle East because there's tens of millions. Whatever option is there bring bring the whole of Syria into Europe. It solves nothing is nothing and what she's actually done by doing this, this, she's opened up the flood gates and we will now see absolute stampedes of of tens of millions over the next five years.

Speaker 1:          00:53:11       Well, I've also read a bunch on how it's not just about the violence, but also just the actual system, the systems that are in place. The social systems. You know, I was reading something this morning about how all of these people that are coming from Syria, they, all, a huge percent of them have really bad teeth. Their teeth are really bad now they're going to get free dental coverage and it's going to cost something. I sleep with something like a billion euros or something, but they're not going to pay for it, so the average German taxpayer is going to have, have to pay for it and then that right there, when their taxes go up, then naturally they're going to be more resentful of these people. So it's, it's hitting people in the, at the economic level and at the violent level. It just seems like a terrible mix. A society.

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       It's going to hit them everywhere. I believe 80 percent of them can't read or write. I believe the many of the real refugees that have come from Syria are going to be suffering from PTSD, post traumatic stress, stress disorder. Um, they're going to need counseling. They're going to need help. There's so many problems that will come from this and we say one point 2 million, but they were allowed to bring their families after for years. Right? And they're loud and they're allowed their EU passports. So that one point two will become six or eight. It doesn't have the infrastructure. I'm simply. But what Angela Merkel was fully aware of is that they won't stay in Germany. They're going to come to countries like mine. She knows. She knows. And in fact, just last week, the German government have come out and said, we've lost 600,000 refugee. We've lost them asylum seekers. We have lost them. They're not where they said they weren't. They've got now 600,000. How many of them are rapists? How many Isis fighters? How many are criminals? We have no idea. No idea at all.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       So let me ask you this, because a lot of this, you know, at some level you hear the people throwing around the term Trojan horse a lot and a lot of it sort of sounds like a conspiracy that there has been this organized effort to just influx all these people. And I think I've seen even in some of the videos that you've tweeted when you see just like hundreds or thousands of migrants crossing, it does seem like it's 80 or 90 percent men. Men that are 20 or 30 and you don't see a lot of women. You see occasionally you'll see some women in some children, but it does seem like a lot of men. But to go that route, it sounds like a conspiracy theory to go and say, oh, this is. There's an intentional plan to flood Europe with these people to ultimately take over. But I suspect by the 15 minutes we've spent together, you don't think it's much of a conspiracy.

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       That can be no other reason. Anyone with any common sense and intelligence or brain can kind of look at what's happening and know it's not going to be good for Europe where anyone can look up what's happening to Angela Merkel made comments such as, um, immigrants are more prone to violence and extremism than the non immigrant. She, she said that years ago she's also made comments saying that multiculturalism has failed. They've already failed in integrate millions of Muslims. So why is she bringing in millions more? What reason? If anyone can else can give a reason. And how are these millions?

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       Well, what do you think? What do you think actually, what do you think is going on in her head then? If everything you've said here is true? Angola, Merkel, she was just time. Woman of the year, right? I mean this is a, this is a bright lady, right? So what about

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       under Angela Merkel has no children that she cares not for the future of our country or our people. That's truthfully what I feel. I don't think she cares about, about the future of her people. And at the same time, you have this, this, as you said, people holding up on a pedestal at first, at first, wherever it was for, I can't say it was through ill intention because I think they know that everyone knows full well what this is going to do to Europe and we know full well what's going to happen and what you're seeing is actually the only countries in Europe that are freely speaking honestly, are the countries that don't have a I a high percentage of Muslims. It's Poland, it's hungry, it's Czech Republic, Slovakia. They are political leaders are coming out and saying what needs to be said now if you look at the UK is former political leaders.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       If you look at Sir William Gladstone, he held the Koran above his head. He in parliament and he said that Islam, there's this Koran is a violent and a curse book and we will never be have peace on this earth. So long as we have this book. Winston Churchill said, the individual Muslims will show amazing characteristics, but the backwardness of Islam has the power to bring Europe back to the dark ages. Now there are two world leaders, we have statues that the whole world loved, and if they were around today, they will be called bigots and extremists and that simply for telling the truth, my prime minister, prime minister, says that Islam is a religion of peace and the facts speak very different to that. And at the moment the problem we have is that by telling the truth, which even if people don't like the truth, we have to be honest. I

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       so think when people say Islam is a religion of peace or Christianity's originally piece or Judaism is a religion of peace, it's a moot point. Uh, religion is because of religion is only a set of ideas. All the religion is, is what it's adherence do, right? It's a religion of peace that that means nothing. That an idea is what people do with it. So I find those statements like that just don't add anything to the conversation.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       No. And we hear them after every terrorist attack, every single terrorist. That's what, that's what we, that's what we talked. And in fact, it's not what we're talking about. I'll give it to other circumstances. Now as a parent, as that, I was studying the biography of Mohammed and I'm sat at home and I'm preparing for a debate and my daughter who is eight years old, she walked past me and said, [inaudible], I don't, I never taught my children. They think my kids never heard of the English Defense League. Yeah. I lived two very separate lives and I, I want to protect them for as long as possible from understanding these politics. Daughter walked past and said, Mohammed, peace be upon him. And I looked and I said, what did you just say and why did you just say that? And she said, well, it's taught at school. You have to say peace be upon him.

Speaker 2:          00:59:08       Said peace be upon him. And then, and that was one incident. Then another incident about a mosque. And then when I took my children to look at another school, um, one of the things that, one of the things they had to do was put the different religious buildings with the different religious words. Yeah. The only one my daughter could do the religions of the world was his mom. Because what's happening now in the national curriculum in the UK is that Islam is the favorite religion. Islam is what's being pushed and propagates all of our youth and children and they're brainwashing either mind if they want to talk about Mohammed, tell the truth, tell us about the man or he was not a man of peace. Some of the things he'd done with some such immoral thing.

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       No, he killed a lot of people. That's a fact.

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       It's a fact, but they're not teaching that. They're teaching this. This is great man. This great man, Mohammed, that we must all respect and say, peace be upon him. That's what they're teaching. Eight year old English go children. So then by the time that next generation come out at the schools, there been brainwashed into this mindset and as soon as your parents even. I've seen it across the country, parents who have not wanted their children to be taught these things and then branded as racist as well. I moved for the truth being taught to my kids, but then I haven't even spoke to my children if I haven't spoke to our children about Islam. Are All one school talking to him about it?

Speaker 1:          01:00:26       Well, that's one of the strange things and I think we see this a little bit in America where they'll say, well, we need to learn more about Islam because of this. And to me it's like we should not be learning more about Islam. We should not be learning more about Christianity. We should not be learning more about Judaism or mormonism or jainism or any of them. What we should be learning about our secular values. We should be learning about the things that tie us together. Not all the little differences that are just gonna split us.

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       I, I'm completely in agreement. It's just a fundamental problem. I always say that I believe in secular schools. I think we should have secular schools, but they're not. I don't believe we should also, um, I don't believe that shouldn't pose, pose a problem for, for safe schools or schools or Christian schools because because they're not causing us the problems that we face. These huge problems that we face currently are caused by Islam. They're inspired by Islam. And if they want to sit in schools and talk about Mohammed, they need to tell them that he, he, he raped a child, he married a child, he committed murder, that they didn't need to tell the truth and they're not. So then we have this complete ward down educational system that is lying to the next generation of youth in the UK.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       Yeah. Um, all right. Well we have to wrap up and I feel like there's so much more we could talk about and hopefully with the way I prefaced this whole episode, people will learn about you and they can make the decisions, you know, whether they think you're a racist or whether they think you're preaching the truth or somewhere in between. Uh, but just to wrap up, um, give me something that you think, give me some hope here. Give me some hope. I mean, you're working with piggy now. It doesn't sound like a hate organization to me. So give me some hope for an ability to turn some of this around. And first and coexistence

Speaker 2:          01:02:07       Europe is you can end up hugely the people of Europe. You have just seen a declaration called the fortress Europe, which is called the product declaration, which for in different countries now have assigned to you on the sixth of February for the first time there's going to be demonstrations in England, in Holland and Denmark in Germany, and the Czech Republic in Poland all simultaneously at the same time. This is the star of a friendship and partnership has been not just Europe, actually, Australia also marching with us. We hope that by the next time we have America, we have Canada, we have India, we have the world because this is a worldwide problem we have to face. And um, yeah, there is hope and they'll always be hope because to be honest, I know whole heartedly that our love for freedom and democracy will always outweigh their, their, their hatred for Sharia.

Speaker 1:          01:02:56       Yeah. Alright, well listen, it was really interesting talking to you and I'm sure we'll, we'll keep talking, but I was going to send people to Amazon to buy your book, but Amazon took your book off, didn't they?

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       They took it off and put it back up three times.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       Right? So I'm not sure if it's up right now, but they can definitely get your book at Tommy Robinson Dot Co dot UK, and they can get the kindle version at least in America yet on Amazon. Yeah. Uh, all right. Well it was a pleasure talking to you and uh, you know, it's difficult stuff, but that's why we have to have these conversations. So I thank you for coming on.
