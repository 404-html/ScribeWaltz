Speaker 1:          00:04          Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:37          Norwegian say knowing further, extroverted enthusiasm.

Speaker 1:          00:43          That's pretty sweet. Coming out to that, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's for sure. Alright, so here's what we're going to do. I want to go through some of the big questions that I've come up with during the last five or six months on the road with you, which you've just been an incredible, truly life changing time for me. Uh, and then we're going to end with Oslo as best question. You've got 45 minutes and you will see. All right, so first off, so first off, every single night you are different and I think tonight perhaps different, more different than any night so far. How the hell do you do it? I honestly don't know. I, you know, I usually go back in the green room with you for a little bit before and about 10 minutes, 10 minutes before showtime. I walk out of there and you say you need to think for a little bit and then you somehow do an hour and a half summing up everything you think in a different way on any given night.

Speaker 3:          01:39          Well, there's some Atlanta that technically, you know, the first thing is, is that something I tell my students, you know, if, if you want to write an essay, you need a problem because the essay is an attempt to solve a problem. So first of all you need a problem and then second, if you're going to devote time to the problem, then it should be like, it should be a problem. That is your problem. At least a piece of it should be, you know, I have students all the time and they come up to me and they say, tell me what I should write my essay about. And they're often very annoyed that I haven't, you know, you didn't give us a topic. It's like, yes, that's because the topic is the difficult part of the assignment, right? To specify the problem. That's the difficult part of the assignment.

Speaker 3:          02:28          In fact, when you're trying to, when you're trying to address a complex, let's say domain of suffering, the diagnosis, which is the problem formulation is the crucial cognitive step. So if you want to write, you need a problem and and if you want to write truthfully then you need a problem that's yours and if you want to write in a focused and aimed manner then you unite your thinking around the problem. And so one thing I always do before when I sit backstage is I think, okay, what's the problem for tonight? You know, and the problem for tonight was victim. So it's one statements like, okay, let's explore the concept of victim and go down as far as we possibly can. Okay. So then, well then I would say my, I have my knowledge organized in a idiosyncratic manner and that's a consequence of having spent.

Speaker 3:          03:32          When I wrote, wrote my first book, which was maps of meaning, I wrote every day for three hours for 15 years and I vowed when I started that I was going to make that. What would you say that the highest duty that I had, nothing was going to come before that. And there's a certain amount of cruelty in that because it meant that, you know, if my wife came into my office than I would bark at her and if my kids came into my office like a junkyard dogs surrounded by barbed wire, it's like because you can always not, right? It's not that important that day and there might be more pressing concerns and they're probably including people who would just like to have something to do with you for awhile or do something nicer, have a problem fixed. It's like, no, go away. I've got three hours.

Speaker 3:          04:27          And so I see I, I, I, I was a thief and I took that from my life. And so I spent a very long time writing and thinking about the hardest problem that I could conceptualize. And that was the relationship between the individual and the atrocity committed in the service of totalitarian possession. It was the worst problem I could think of. How so? I look to see what the worst thing people could do under the worst circumstances was and tried to figure out why that happened. That was step one and step two was having come to some determination about how it might happen then and having learned something that I had suspected all along, which was that that capacity was part of the individual, right. Me as well as everyone else to determine if there was a mode of acting in the world that would restrict that possibility so that it would no longer manifests itself and so I spent however many hours, $45,000 thinking about that and that's not right because that's how much time I spent writing about it most of that time because I have a very obsessive mind in some sense our lock on a problem.

Speaker 3:          05:55          I can't let it go or can't let me go. I didn't know which way to think about it and so it wasn't only that I was writing for three hours a day. I was thinking about it all the time. Right from the time I woke up until the time I went to sleep and I was reading about it obsessively. You know, I read a tremendous amount when I was in graduate school and so the reason I'm telling you all of that is to answer this question is, but then I spent 30 years lecturing about it and you know, I started out with my lectures fairly structured because I was still wrestling with the ideas, but I tried over the years to reduce the amount of scaffolding safety wire netting that was underneath me while I was lecturing until I got to the point where I didn't need to do anything other than sit for 10 minutes and think, okay, what's the problem?

Speaker 3:          06:45          Where am I going? I'm exploring a solution. I'm not necessarily putting forward a pre constructed solution like it'll be in the universe of solutions I've considered, but I'd like to get it sharper and clearer. So I got to the point where I could go from the problem through the story using all these things that I had already talked about a new and so then I can sequence them. And I think the closest analogy I can think of is jazz improvisation. It's something like that. You know, an expert musician has a tremendous number of hubs, habits, deeply ingrained like an athlete, same thing that, that, that are part and parcel built into to, to him or her. And so I have that and so then I can come out and think, okay, well a little of this and little of that, and that's new. It's like each of these ideas is a personality of sorts and you can let them have a dialogue in real time and see where it goes.

Speaker 3:          07:43          And that's the story, right? That's what a great author does when he writes a book, as he puts out some characters and then he lets the characters do whatever they would do and that reveals the story. And so I kind of do that. I let the ideas do what they're going to do and see how they fight and compete with one another and, and, and then that's see what people wanted. Lectures, assuming that this is a lecture and it probably isn't, it's probably more like a strange sort of dialogue with the audience. What people want in a forum like this is they want to see thought inaction, right? They don't want to see something that's already crystallized and and dad, which is why I did read the last time I was here, although I do that rarely, they want to see something. They want to see what they want to see.

Speaker 3:          08:35          Technically speaking is something if you thought about metaphysically as they want to see the logos, inaction. That's really what people always want to see and I mean that philosophically and so the real time part of it, the fact that it's not a contrived performances out actually crucial to its success and also what keeps me engaged. Like it's. I don't know how these damn lectures are going to go when I come out here. I think, okay, victim, man, that's a big problem. Okay, well we could, we could address it with this and then we could use this and I can play those together and we can see how that goes and then perhaps I'll be able to draw a rousing conclusion because it's hard to bring that to the point at the end, you know, successfully to something I've got better at over the tour, which is quite fun, but I never don't know if it's gonna work. And so I'm on edge when I come out on stage, I think, oh my God, I've got a big problem here and I've got a sorted out in 70 minutes and there's all these people here. So, and, and, and, and that makes it really tense for me in an exciting way. It's an exhilarating, you know, it's an exhilarating challenge, but that also makes it alive because I could easily fail so.

Speaker 3:          09:54          Well. So that's how it's lots of practice. And, and then the final thing is I don't talk about problems that don't matter to me, they matter, this victim thing that matters. It's important fundamental. And so every night I come out and I think, okay, well what's the fundamental problem for tonight? And it's a problem that affects me as far as deep down as much as I can go, you know? And so yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:23          Do you know the point in life when you became a serious person? And I mean, I mean that in the best sense of it because when people asked me what it's like to be on tour with you, I always say, well, he takes life seriously and it's making me take life more seriously. And I think it's making these people take life more seriously. Do you remember the moment that that happened?

Speaker 3:          10:42          Yes. Can you tell me that moment? Yes, I can. Yeah. So it was in I think 19, 83. And this is a strange story. Um, I came home from a party, a university party, and I wasn't in the best mood. I've always had a certain proclivity towards depression, which I've recently discovered is probably an autoimmune problem in any case. Um, I'd gone to this party and I'd had a lot to drink because I like to drink. And um,

Speaker 3:          11:25          I didn't know, I wasn't happy with something that happened at the party, wasn't happy with the way I behave. I mean, that's not uncommon, right? If you, if like to drink then you're not happy with the way he behaved. Those things just go together. And so, but there was, it was deeper than that. It wasn't just that I was unhappy with the way the party had gone, but I was deeply dissatisfied with how I was oriented in life. Like I felt that I felt that there was a, it was a nihilism, I suppose that was, that was gnawing at me and this was not long after I'd stopped. I'd worked for Socialist Party in Canada for a while when I was a kid. And this wasn't long after I stopped doing that. And so I kind of lost my moorings and um, you know, the Christianity that my mother practiced in particular, I had abandon that when I was like 13.

Speaker 3:          12:14          And so I didn't have any structured orient me at all. And so I was experimenting a little bit with artistic production at this point. Not a lot, but a bit. And so I took out this canvas from my, my closet and I sat down and I sketched out this picture and I just let my imagination roam. And what came out was, it was a crucifixion and there was a, I drew a picture of Christ on the, on the crucifixion, but with a very judgemental face, very angry face, and with a snake wrapped around his waist. And it was really harsh picture. It was like an expressionist picture. And not that I have the talent of an expressionist, but, but, but that's what it was. And I thought, I mean, I, I wasn't thinking, I didn't think that I was thinking in religious terms at that point at all.

Speaker 3:          13:07          And you know, I was an absolutely sporadic church goer. And, and uh, I was absolutely shocked by this picture. I thought, what, what, where the hell did this come from? What did that possibly me, you know, I, it took me years to figure out what it meant. I mean, really good one, one thing. So I'll tell you part of what it meant. So Carl Jung said something very interesting about the structure of the New Testament. He said that the Gospel, Christ is fundamentally, although not entirely fundamentally a figure of compassion, but the ideal is not only compassion, the ideal is also a judge because an ideal is a judge. You know, let's say you have an ideal law, it's a judge because you don't live up to it, and so your ideal is always looking at you like you're not what you should be. And the higher the ideal, the more judgmental the judge.

Speaker 3:          14:03          Well, that's why he thought the book of revelation first of all emerged in the as an unconscious revelation, which because Christ comes back at the end of time, so, so the story goes as the ultimate judge and virtually no one is judged acceptable while why? Well, because by the highest possible see speaking psychologically, you can biologically for that matter, the idea of Christ is the instantiation of the ideal. As such, that's what it is. Now, it might be more than that, but that's what it is. It's, it's whatever a human being would be. If a human being was perfect and it's an effort of our collective imagination to represent that symbolically, which we do with cathedrals, for example, we paint the image of Christ against the dome that represents eternity itself. That's the ideal. Now you might say, well, I don't believe in the ideal. It's like you're missing the point.

Speaker 3:          15:03          You're missing the point and so so that ideal is a judge and the farther you are away from that ideal, the harsher the judge, and so the snake was part of that because the thing is is that if you're low enough and the ideal is high enough, the ideal itself is so judgmental and so detached for you that it starts to look to you like your enemy. And so that was the painting and it was like, and I was asking a question. That was the thing that I was asking the question. I was asking like what would I have to do to set this? What would I have to do to set the situation that I'm in? Right? And so then I drew this picture and the picture. How had the had the answer? I mean, artistic production always has the answer. That's where the answers come from, you know, and so that was a manifestation of imagination.

Speaker 3:          15:51          It was, it was part of me attempting in its symbolic mode of personified thinking to deliver a message. And so I swore that night that I was going to do whatever it took to set myself, right, period, whatever. And I was dead serious about that. And so that was the, that was the moment. And then I don't know what I did with that picture. I, I hid it in my closet because I was so freaked out by it. I thought, what the Hell is this? It's like some schizophrenia nightmare. It's like underneath the covers with that thing. But that was the, that. And that was, it wasn't long after that that I wrote the first essay that eventually turned into this maps of meaning book. It was a poem to begin with actually, that that was how it came about first. So that's when I decided to be, to straighten myself out regardless of, to straighten myself out. That's what I was going to do. So,

Speaker 1:          16:51          so I think this is our 13th show in Europe. We've got a couple more over the next couple of days and now it sounds like we're extending for another 30 or 40 probably in the spring. I mean this thing has just grown and grown and grown a. are you shocked at the amount of people that live in western societies here in Norway? Especially when we were in Sweden a couple of days ago, but all the countries that we've been in that live in free societies yet art completely afraid to say what they think is absolutely shocking.

Speaker 3:          17:22          Thank you. I think the most. I think what I've been most shocked about in all of that is what's happened in the UK with the police starting to prosecute people for crimes of offensiveness. That's just. And I think that's probably partly because I'm an. I mean, I see that as broadly reflective of, of something that's happening in the West in general, but it's particularly shocking and appalling to me as a, as a western know because obviously counted that was part of the British empire and when I grew up, like there was a pretty tight affinity still in western Canada with the British empire. I mean our, our maps where the dominion of Canada was still pink, you know, it was still part of the British empire. We Sang God save the Queen Constantly at public gatherings. That's gone by the wayside. And so, and you know, I've always regarded British common law and the British parliamentary tradition as well. One of it perhaps the highest achievement of western civilization. I mean, you could argue about that, but it's, it's in the top 10, let's say. And then to see the Brits who also have this phenomenal sense of humor, this ability to say anything, no matter how outrageous about anyone and to include themselves in the joke, right? Which is such an elegant way of expressing comedic freedom to see them going down this road is just, it just, it's, it's, it's what is it exactly. While it's deeply saddening, that's for sure. And,

Speaker 2:          19:00          and

Speaker 3:          19:02          what's horrifying and it's not exactly the right word. I don't know what the word for it is there certainly sorrow that's associated with a disbelief. It's also

Speaker 2:          19:10          at, at,

Speaker 3:          19:12          at watching that happen in what I still think is the central core of the idea of individual sovereignty and freedom as expressed across the western world. And so, and then there's similar manifestations of that everywhere else, but the police per prosecuting people for you know, asking people to turn in their neighbors if they say something offensive. And that's happening in the UK. Yeah. Literally what we saw that, that somebody sent me posters, pictures of posters in the Scottish subway, in the metro, in the tube, you know, saying inviting people to inform on their neighbors for being offensive. It's like what the hell, what, what? So I knew this was coming because. Because I knew we brought our first hate speech laws in Canada back in the 19 eighties. We were after this character named Ernst Zandel, who is a particularly despicable piece of work, hard hat wearing right wing antisemitism Holocaust denier, you know, he had it all that guy, um, and you know, it was his shenanigans, careless malevolent shenanigans that entice Canadians into producing hate speech legislation. I thought, no, that's, that's not good. It's not good. You're making a big mistake. We're going to pay for this. It's going to unfold over a long time.

Speaker 3:          20:44          Who defines hate

Speaker 2:          20:47          the crucial

Speaker 3:          20:48          issue. It's not like it's a scientific category to judgment. And the answer is those whom you least want to have the power to define it because they're the ones that will take that power to themselves. And if you think that isn't gonna Affect what you get to say, well you've got another thing coming. So I think it's, I think it's going to pay for it and hopefully, hopefully we'll wake up and push back before we have to pay too high a price. We're going to pay for it. So yeah, and we're going to deserve to pay for it too. He's talking to you

Speaker 4:          21:36          last night, last night

Speaker 3:          21:38          it was on this British show called question time, which is very famous British show and there was a, um, a woman parliamentarian. They're from Ireland who was pretty bright. I liked listening to her, but I'm the host asked me about this character named count. Dang, Kyla, I don't know if you know about him. I'm his girlfriend. He's a comedian. Well, he thinks he's a comedian and. Well, but you know, there are lots of Comedians who think they're comedians that aren't funny and I'm not saying he's not funny because other people think that he's a comedian too. But he presents himself as a comedian. Count Danky law. I mean that's actually a joke, that name and his girlfriend had a pug and I liked count danky him because he hated that pug and I'm not very fond of pugs. I think they're hideous little creatures and, and, and, and you know, I don't really hate them if a bug comes along then all pet it and everything, but

Speaker 5:          22:38          it's just sort of like the, the, this little rat like dog with these bugs. If you hit it on the back of the head, the eyes will pop out and so because they've been so genetically mishandled and so, I don't know, man. It's just, you do realize we're putting this on youtube and you're just done. You're unleashing a whole new world to hate to bug people. I know, I know. I know, but whatever,

Speaker 3:          23:03          whatever. So you can have your plugin, you can love it. My Dad had this dog that was so damn hideous and useless that it was just a miracle and he loved it to death and so, and you know, that's fine, that's fine, but. And there's kind of an ironic attitude in the dismissal of pugs and Daniella didn't like his girlfriend's pug and so he thought he'd play a mean trick or a mean slash funny trick and teach it to do a hail Hitler salute.

Speaker 5:          23:27          I actually thought it was quite funny. It's like I don't, look, I don't see that as glorifying Hitler hits up Pug for God's sake. It wasn't, uh, it wasn't a, what do you call those Doberman, you know, it was a pub. It's like teaching a rat to do a hail Hitler salute. I love that this has come down to the breed of dogs with you. These things matter in terms of,

Speaker 3:          23:52          I love the way they're represented, you know, and then, you know, he, he taught it to, it's so horrible. He and I'm gonna be so killed for this. He taught it to do it's little salute when he said gas the Jews, which is not funny, you know, except it's horribly funny,

Speaker 5:          24:11          you know, that's the thing. Well look, and so yeah, you laugh. That's right. Because you're all horrible and you know, and you know perfectly well that it's horribly funny and you know, we need, we need

Speaker 3:          24:30          to be able to be horribly funny because life is horrible and we. And we need to be able to find. We need to be able to allow people the freedom to find the ability to transcend that horror with comedy and a mark of a free society is that con comedians can be just exactly what the R is, which there are people who push the edge of what's acceptable. If you're a brilliant comedian, you get right to the edge, right? New dance there. And the audience is thinking, Sarah Silvermans a good example of that. You know, because you can just see her. She's gone all politically correct recently, but when she was in her heyday, you could just see Sarah, she's so smart. You'd see you're sitting there and she'd think of something just spectacularly evil and horrible. And she think, oh, and then she say it, you know, and everyone would just crack up because like the darkest part of their soul had once thought something like that. And she dared to Audi read 10. And by honoring it she also simultaneously transcended it, you know? And that's the beauty of comedy and, and, and well. So anyways, they, they went after, Dang Kyla and nailed him legally. And I thought that's an that's in Great Britain as well. And last night, so they brought this up one on question time and you know the, the Irish woman who said she went off on a talk about how terrible Kristallnacht wasn't, what an awful thing Auschwitz and the Holocaust was. It's like, well,

Speaker 3:          26:03          you're not that morally virtuous to notice that know. You know what I mean? It's like. And it didn't have anything to do with the topic at hand. It's like, yet you wouldn't say that you noticed that unless you were implying that there are people around you including this count. Dang, can I. Who didn't notice that? Okay. It had nothing to do with whether he should have been prosecuted for his stupid joke. And then you can say, well, you could say it was a stupid joke, which it certainly was. You could say that it was a hateful joke, which I don't agree with by the way. But you could say that. And I think you could. You could make a credible case for that. But then to say that because you think that the Holocaust bad, he should be criminally prosecuted. It's like, nope, sorry man, you've crossed the line and there's no excuse for it.

Speaker 3:          26:51          And so that's part of what's worrisome about the state of discourse in the free West. That same thing, comedians won't go to university campuses, same thing. You don't get to be funny. So if you can't be funny than you're not free, you know the gesture and the king's courts, the only person who gets to tell the truth. And if the king is such a tyrant that he kills his gesture, then you know that the evil king is in charge. And so when we can't tolerate our comedians, it's like, well, there you go. They're the canaries in the coal mine as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 2:          27:26          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          27:40          My wife that I wouldn't hit any hornets with any Hornet's nest with sticks for like a day. And now I just hit a big hornet's nest with this.

Speaker 1:          27:49          So sorry Tammy. She's here somewhere. Yeah, give it up for Jordan's wife, by the way. She's been on this entire time.

Speaker 2:          27:56          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          28:05          All right, so let's at David's fault. Yeah, let, let's shift gears a little bit. What has been the best part

Speaker 3:          28:12          of this adventure of this tour for you personally?

Speaker 2:          28:18          Oh, well,

Speaker 3:          28:20          the best part happens all the time. The best part I think. I think I told this story tonight though. I'm not sure because I talked to a bunch of journalists today, so can't remember when I told this story, but this guy came up to me last night. He was kind of a pierced guy, rough looking guy and uh, but he's probably in his late twenties, maybe early thirties. He said, uh,

Speaker 2:          28:45          I've,

Speaker 3:          28:46          I've been smoking drug free for nine months. And I said, hey, good work man. Because he looked pretty pleased about that. I said, well, you know, hopefully that's a lot better. And he said it's a lot better. And I said, well, good for you for sticking it out and I hope you can continue it. And I meant that because I didn't mean good for you and hope you can stick it out. And he knew I meant that because he wouldn't have bloody well told me that to begin with, he didn't think that that was going to be the response. And then he said, I got nine of my mates to do the same thing. Yeah. I thought right on, man, that's great. And then you know, this. I was in Birmingham two nights ago and I walked out of the hotel and this kid working class kid came up to me, you know, just out of the blue.

Speaker 3:          29:27          And he said, thank you very much for elevating my vision. I thought, hey look, it's really good thing to be able to go around the world and to have people stop you on the street and say things like that to you. It's like that's as good as it gets. You know? And people are telling me stories like all the time they come up and they say, well you've watched this thing. It happens all the time. People come up and they tell me some way that their house was out of order, you know, they are hopeless and, and nihilistic and drinking too much and watching too much pornography and procrastinating too much and being not serious with the relationship and not getting along with their parents and you know, not formulating a vision and not growing up and, you know, there's just endless ways that you can descend into a kind of, what would you call it, a kind of Grungy, filthy carpet infested hell and, and so, and then they say, look, I've been watching your lectures and I've developed a plan for my life and I've been trying to be more responsible and I've been really turned to tell the truth.

Speaker 3:          30:32          And I mended my relationship with my father and I got married to my girlfriend and now I have a flat and I quit doing drugs and I've just tripled my salary in the last year. And um, and I didn't commit suicide like I was going to six months ago. I think I have, I don't know, out of 150 people that I talked to each night, I would say probably over the course of the lecture series, there's probably 10 people like that and night who tell me that and so see, because I believe what I said tonight, I believe that the individual is sovereign and that individual sovereignty is the cornerstone of reality itself and it's the cornerstone of the state and it's the cornerstone of reality itself. I truly believe that to be the case, that every time I hear someone say, look, I've got my act together.

Speaker 3:          31:23          I think that's one more weight on. You know, if the scales are always tilting towards good or towards evil, then every time someone decides to straighten themselves up, they put a mate. They take a major weight off the evil side and they put it on the good side and it's not trivial and I believe that that's what the redemption of the world depends on. It's not political. It happens at the level of the individual. Just like the descent into totalitarian catastrophe occurs when people abandon their sovereign responsibility, which I think is the most accurate way of diagnosing what happened in the 20th century. So whenever someone comes up to me and says, I was not doing so well, and here's three ways where I've really put my life together, we have a little 15 second party and we both know why, and so that's, that's as good as it gets. And so that's happening constantly and I feel generally speaking that these events are like their celebrations of that and so interesting to watch. The media missed this completely. It's like they don't have the conceptual. What would you say? They don't have the conceptual tools to understand that something might be happening that's worthy of note outside the purely conventional confines of, of you know that the stultifying and dol political discourse, but it doesn't matter. It might be nice if it didn't happen. It doesn't fundamentally mattered because I'm a psychologist. I decided a long time ago that the individual was the right level of analysis and so it's an absolute.

Speaker 3:          33:04          It's, it's not a pleasure. It's not the right way of thinking about it.

Speaker 3:          33:11          What's rule seven? Do. What is meaningful? Note what is expedient. This is the most deeply meaningful thing that I can envision doing. So that's great. It's great. It's hard. Great is hard when something great happens, that's hard, right? It's not a. it's not something trivial, but it's doesn't matter because because it's great and so every time someone says to me, I'm better. I'm getting along with my father. I married my girlfriend. We're going to have a child. We were going to have children. Now we're going to have children. I think that's one more. So that's great man.

Speaker 2:          33:56          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          34:07          Tell the audience a little bit about Jordan Peterson having fun. We did serious Jordan Peterson Peterson doing for fun.

Speaker 3:          34:19          I stumped him actually. It's not like I don't. It's like most of what I've always done for fun in my life has been to play, you know, and so when I had little kids, I played with them all the time and my kids are grown up and I play with them all the time and my daughter is so playful. Despite her rather catastrophic life up to this point, she's much better, but is that every single thing she says when she's not delivering? Oh, like, uh, when she's not focused on talking to people about a serious topic, everything she says is a joke, you know, when my son is ridiculously Tz and playful and so and so, that's fun. And when they were little kids, we just played all the time. And so I really liked that and most of the people who've been my close friends have been people like that.

Speaker 3:          35:16          They're there. They play with their speech all the time, which is why I think I get along with Comedians, you know, it's like, it's partly why we travel well together. And John Now my tour manager, who's a great guy, very, very useful. He's also a comedian and Rogan's a comedian and so many of the people that I got along with her comedians and, and, and the best interviews on how to beat with comedians because there's that element of play. So I really like that on this tour. There's not a lot of fun. I wouldn't say we had a good time when we went to the comedy club in Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City. That was, that was fun. That was 45 minutes of fun and I had some fun at Cambridge. I had. I had some fun in it.

Speaker 1:          35:56          Just to be clear, I brought Jordan up as the surprise guest. I did about our standup and then I brought Jordan up and we did. We sort of did stand up together. We just kind of riff for about 45 minutes and people were. Yeah, it was fun. They were thrilled and they love seeing you laugh.

Speaker 3:          36:10          I was at the Cambridge Union just a couple of days ago and I was in a fairly high spirited mood and I had a fair bit of fun with the students there. It was still serious, but you know what I really like what the times in my life that I've had the best time is when I'm sitting around with a variety of people who are very amusing and all they're trying to do is to outwit each other with something absurd and funny and it was really a part of, I don't know if it's a part of, of Scandinavian culture or not, but in, in, in, in the West where I grew up, which is a working class culture. I mean most of what my friends and I did with regards to conversation was like half winded up, up, up, up men upmanship. I guess that's what it is.

Speaker 3:          36:56          Your goal was to say something funnier than the person just before you said. And so it was competitive humor and I really, really liked that a lot. And so when I'm able that's great relief, but this tour, like it's very tightly scheduled, crazily tightly scheduled. And tammy and I decided at the beginning that because it was such an absurd opportunity that it was a working tour, you know, and that we were going to subordinate everything to making sure that these shows went as well as they possibly could and that we would take whatever refuge in amusement we could, you know, where we could steal it. And we've had some of that. I mean the last time we were in Oslo, we walked up to the sculpture gardens and so that was really cool and we walked down the boulevard and we only had about an hour and a half to take a look around the city, but it was a nice hour and a half, you know, the sun was out and we enjoyed ourselves. And so that's rule 12, right? Pet a cat on the street when, when you see one, when you encountered one and you take your joy where you can get it and you don't complain if it's not happening perhaps as often as it should, especially when you're given like we have been this absolutely improbable adventure and we'll have time. Hopefully God willing, knock on wood with some luck for some more fun in the future.

Speaker 1:          38:30          That's actually quite a segue to my next question, which is because you about stories so much in the importance of stories. Does the Jordan Peterson story had a happy ending and does that even matter or what do you think that the ending of the Jordan Peterson story is?

Speaker 3:          38:52          Alright, don't have any idea. Um, you know, when I was from the time I was about 20, I kind of had a sense of what would happen to me. I had some sense of it, but only it really only extended until I was about my age 50, something like that. And I didn't know what would. I didn't have a vision for after that.

Speaker 2:          39:20          And

Speaker 3:          39:23          See, I thought when I wrote, wrote maps of meaning, I remember telling one of my, my peers, I said, I think everyone will think the way that I think in this book in 50 years. And he said, well that's a pretty grandiose claim. I guess that that was it. Something like, well, fair enough, you know, but, but, but by the same token, I wasn't taking, I wasn't taking credit for the ideas, like I was taking some credit for clarifying them. The ideas were already there. They're everywhere. Those ideas, but clarifying the miss something and so I knew that when I was working on in maps of meaning was at the center of things in some sense and that manifested itself in my teaching career because, well I taught at Harvard for six years and the course there which was based on my book was very, very popular and, and students regarding to this life changing in the same thing happened at the University of Toronto.

Speaker 3:          40:27          And so I knew that that power was in those ideas, but I don't see my future very clearly from here on, in, you know, over the next year I'm going to do more of what I do it. I want to return to the exodus to exit this. I like doing those biblical lectures. I thought that was useful and important. So I want to do that. But my vision kinds of kind of runs out in December of 2019 and I don't know what, because all of this is so unlikely, you know, our thought for the last two years, every single day I thought, well this is going to come to an end. Like this is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. It's cad continued but it is continuing. And so I have no idea how. How do you predict something like that? I mean, for the longest time I thought that as this wave grew, the probability that I would end up like a surfer smashed on the beach was the highest probability and I still probably think that that's the highest probability outcome. But, but I'm not as apprehensive about that now as I was because in some sense, assuming I don't do anything spectacularly stupid, like defend count. Dang Kyla on Dave Rubin.

Speaker 2:          41:58          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          42:06          Well, who would like to that? Who would have liked to have taken me out, have thrown the worst that they could throw at me? As far as I can tell. I mean, my, my, my cardinal day in terms of vilification and it's quite a contest by the way because there were many days like that was the day where I was simultaneously accused by eight an all right magazine of being a Jewish shill and accused by a, a Jewish magazine of being tantamount to Hitler himself. I thought, well, that pretty much does it. It's like the Nazis hate me because I'm a Jewish shill and the, and well, this particular Jewish publication, you know, compared me to Hitler, and I thought, well, that's it. There's. Where else do you go after that? We're going to call me mom. It's like, it still already. He didn't. That's just not that much past Hitler. And so you know, and so I'm not that concerned that in the absence of some fatal stupidity on my part, which certainly could still happen because we have that proclivity for fatal stupidity within all of us. I'm not too concerned that I'm going to be taken out by my ideological opponents, but by the same token, this is a pretty unwieldy and unprecedented situation to be in. And so I'm, I'm not under any illusions about its stability or safety. So who knows, man.

Speaker 1:          43:35          Well I'll stick with you as long as you'll keep me. So, so far so good. All right. So I promised you guys that I was going to take what I thought was the best question from you guys. And there were, there were hundreds of them. I was reading through them during the lecture, but I thought this was the best we got out of Oslo. Will you move to as low and run for Prime Minister of Norway?

Speaker 2:          44:00          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          44:14          Well first you probably want someone who can speak Norwegian. Um, and second, more seriously, um,

Speaker 3:          44:27          throughout my life I've considered a political career and certainly when I was young, very seriously, that was my ambition till I was about 18. But, um, yeah, started when I ran for an executive position in the Socialist Party in my home province when I was 14. And so that was the first large scale public speech I gave to about 700 people. Wait, can everyone pause for one second? Try to picture 14 year old socialist Jordan Peterson that, that's an incredible image to me. What was that kid like? Me Kinda, you know, I, I speak to a crowd. Then speech was very successful. Um, I lost the position by 13 votes out of 700, something like that. And you know, I had the audience under. I had the audience. No. So you know, there's certain things about you that remained constant. Hopefully I know more than I did then, you know, that's to be devoted hope for. I've stopped

Speaker 3:          45:48          actively pursuing a political career when I was 18 and the reason for that was because I became more interested in something else, which is what I was talking about tonight because it turned out that the political problems that I was interested in were, were deep enough arguably not to be political because they were really, for some reason I was very interested in totalitarianism, right from the time I was like an adolescent. I don't know why exactly who the hell knows why you get interested in what your interests in some problem. You know, this is a thing that's useful to know about life, you know, all of you have problems that bothering you and you think, well, I don't want it to have a problem and fair enough, but like there's a whole lot of problems you could have that could bother you because there's lots of things wrong with the world and you can be obsessed by like a million problems, right? Because there's just problems everywhere, but you're not some problems grab you. Why?

Speaker 3:          46:58          It's a mystery history of the autonomy of being in some sense, problem grabs you and it will let you go. It's like that's suffering in that, but that's your problem and you know in that problem might be your destiny. I think that's right, is in the problems that grip you are the portal to your destiny and and so. Well then you can accept them. It's like, what are you going to have? No problems could good luck with that. So you've got your problems. One of the things you learn as a therapist, as you don't interfere with people's problems, and what I mean by that is this. Let's say you come to me and we have a discussion about what's going wrong in your life, and I listened because I want you to explain what the problems are because what do I know about your life?

Speaker 3:          47:48          It's like I need to listen so that I can hear what your problem is and not rush to a conclusion and then I want to listen while you generate a solution. Now I'm going to help by asking questions and help you explore it, but if I. let's say you lay out your problem and I think, hey, I know what would fix that, and then I just say to you, well, you know, here's the solution. Well first of all, you're going to be very annoyed about that because I just took your problem and it was up to you to wrestle with that problem and come up with a solution and then to have a little self congratulatory burst of pleasure at your own intuitive genius that you could solve your problem and then then you're motivated because you've come up with a solution. Maybe you go implement it right and so

Speaker 4:          48:40          well.

Speaker 3:          48:42          So my problem became something that wasn't political and so I pursued that and so I'm not going to pursue a political career and I've also decided to. I didn't know this, but I don't have the temperament for it. I couldn't do it. I find the adversarial interviews that I'm in, for example, they take me like it takes me three days to recover from one of those, what it does because I don't like that motive discourse. And if your political, you're in that mode of discourse all the time and I'm not cut out for it. I got not a particularly combative person by nature. I'm a person who's terrified about leaving monsters under the rug

Speaker 4:          49:29          ignored,

Speaker 3:          49:31          but that is not the same thing. And it's not like I enjoy the process of calling them out and hashing them through, but I think well better get out them while they're small. So, so, so no, I'm not coming to Norway. That's the answer to that question.

Speaker 1:          49:50          All right, well on that note, I've said this to you privately before, but I may as well say publicly since we're putting this up on the youtube, this what we're doing here, this started as a professional joy for me, but it has become a personal joy that I can't explain. I am better than when we started. Like I know what it's like to be these people that taking these ideas in and changing and uh, and I'm better and it's. And it's because of the work that you've put into your life that you've helped give to all of us. So, uh, I want to thank you for that. And on that note, I've never ended a show like this before, but I'm going to get out of the way and I need you guys to go bananas for Dr Jordan Peterson.

Speaker 2:          50:28          Thank you guys. Thanks amy.
