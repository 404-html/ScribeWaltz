Speaker 1:          00:05          Joining me as an evolutionary biologist, formerly of Evergreen State University who is now a professional professor in exile, Heather. Hi and welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you for having today's professor in exile. I believe that is in your twitter bio. It is. I believe it is in your husband, Bret Weinstein's twitter bio. Yeah. We generated it together. Is that going to be the title of the Co authored a book when the dust settles on all of this stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:30          Oh, I don't know. I think both of us are both eager to leave the evergreen story behind, but still heartbroken that an institution that we loved and still believe in the educational model that it offered and still believe in the students who got great education was there for many decades. We would love to see it resurrected, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Yeah. All right, so this is. It's a little crazy to me that this is the first time that we've met because obviously our, our circles have been sort of a closing in on each other for for quite some time. So when, when the whole evergreen thing happened and I only want to spend a little bit of time at the top talking about it and then I want to do all sorts of evolutionary biology stuff and the other, the other things that you're really passionate about, the story, obviously it was more focused on Brett and then he was sort of thrust into the media and all that, but this was a direct attack on you as well in the end, as you said, the institution that you loved and all that. Can you just give me any sort of recap or just pieces of it that maybe we don't know that well or just your perspective on what was happening there?

Speaker 2:          01:36          Well, um, as, as briefly as I can, leaving out many, many relevant pieces, we got a new president and the new president very quickly got rid of a provost who was going to get in his way and spoke publicly about his desire to turn evergreen into a social justice college. I was actually on the record early in George Church's tenure at the point that the protests broke out a year ago. Now, uh, he had been president for about two years and a year before that had broken out in equity, uh, uh, a desire to bring equity and inclusion to the forefront, which is, which is cohorts. It's dog whistles for the people on the far left who are actually interested in a reversal of power, not an end to oppression, but an actual reversal of historical oppression.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Did you guys recognize those things as dog whistles at the time? Because as Brett said, at the time he considers himself, or at least at that time did consider himself deeply progressive. You just said to me right before we started, you still consider yourself progressive. Yep. So did you realize those buzzwords and what they actually meant at the time?

Speaker 2:          02:47          Absolutely. I mean, Brett, actually I was on sabbatical the year most of the year before this breakout is part of why I was disappeared from the story I said as I went on to sabbatical, but I will continue to read everything you want to send out to these lists, but I'm not engaging. I'm doing my own work now. So about a year, actually a year to the day before the protest broke out, the first announcement of the new plan came, came live, and then, and there, and for the next year, Brett was, I was a little bit a couple of other people were a little bit standing up and saying, this doesn't smell right. This, this feels like this is actually about something that we're not talking about. And furthermore, if we're actually interested in improving the fate of various demographic groups, these processes are not going to be the way to accomplish them. So we were saying that Brett mostly was saying that a few others of us were saying it.

Speaker 2:          03:44          And um, was there any, um, sort of understanding of that point of view privately? Yes. Privately, yes. People were scared and when in fact, when Brett used the phrase culture of fear on campus, what came back at him was you have to prove that there's a culture of fear or else there's not one. And you know, show me the people who aren't standing up or else I will know that they don't exist, which is baffling. It's, it is obviously unimprovable an unprovable statement to say there's a culture of fear and I'm not going to out the people who have come to me and told me they're scared because I actually am going to honor their privacy, but if, if everyone who would come to us privately and said, this is nuts and it's got to stop, had stood up, it would have been a totally different outcome.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Well that's the culture of fear summed up right there. Right. So, um, okay. So without rehashing the whole thing, can you just tell me a little, just a little bit about sort of how your life has changed throughout this and sort of, you know, look, you and Brett, you guys did settle. It wasn't for a ton of money, at least in my humble estimation, but I think you probably want it to just put some of this behind you, but you guys are professors in exile you if you have kids and family and all that stuff and just sort of sum up kind of where you're at at the moment.

Speaker 2:          05:03          Yeah. So when we had, we'd been living in Olympia for 15 years. Um, the, the college was an amazing place to really do a deep dive in community with students. And so you know, Brad and I had done one and I had done several long study abroad trips and Panama and in Ecuador with pretty large groups of undergraduates taking them through the Amazon. They're galapagos. We spent time in the field in Washington state, in the San Juans and eastern Washington. You're took people places where not only were we studying evolutionary biology and animal behavior and field techniques and Statistics and philosophy of science, but also coming to know each other such that after, after you break bread with people for days and you play ultimate with them and sit around a campfire, you come to understand that when they disagree with you, it's not inherently coming from a place of hatred or personal.

Speaker 2:          05:57          And so that trust that we were able to create in our classrooms, which both of us love to doing, allowed us to effectively then rip the intellectual rug out from under people when they made claims that weren't falsifiable or couldn't be. You couldn't be justified once you started to ask them what the assumptions were there underlying their claims. That was, that was an amazing gift. And I don't know that really almost any other educational model out there allows for that because it required the time to build community with students, which was, which was wonderful. So yes, we lost two tenure track jobs along with your health insurance and our retirement plans and all of that and have two kids still in school. So that's alarming. But some of what we were doing in the classroom, we have begun to do on larger stages. And that is promising. It seems clear that the world is interested in hearing how to understand systems from an evolutionary perspective. I knew that was true from the 25 or 50 students that I had doing the deep dive for, you know, every quarter, every year for years. Uh, it's not that surprising, but it is heartening to see that that is the response of many, many people out there

Speaker 1:          07:09          in a weird way. Does it almost feel right then that this happened? I mean, I know it's kind of sucky and again with the salaries in tenure track positions and all that, but that the message that you guys are talking about seems so relevant right now. You guys are now doing more public speaking gigs. I'm, I'm dragging bread onstage with me to do stand up. I mean all sorts of crazy things are presenting themselves and then the sort of the rise of this new alliance of whether you want to call it intellectual dark web or whatever you want to call it at this point, but there, there is this sort of interesting crew of people with a lot of different feelings on a lot of different issues with all sorts of different disciplines coming together. And maybe if you guys were still at university in a traditional sense, you wouldn't be able to be dealt in the way that

Speaker 2:          07:52          you are now. I think that's possible. I think there is both a way in which having gone through the looking glass, having gone through the direct, you know, to borrow a phrase from the far left, but the lived experience of actually being at the center of a mob at the center of riots and then watching as the world, the mainstream media and others tried to do a public relations spin on it and tell a totally different story to live that and to watch the institution that you love to become totally disloyal to you and to watch many people whom you respected, um, hide. You can't unsee that it's valuable. And the fact that we're sitting here talking together and that many of us and you know the intellectual, dark web and in this, in this bigger group are, are speaking and saying actually the culture of fear that is society wide is real.

Speaker 2:          08:48          And so I'll say the first time I met my students after the November 2016 election after trump was elected, evergreen, so very left place, Olympia is a very left place. Pretty much everyone on campus had that glazed eyes. Slack, Jawed Lux that people in most progressive enclaves will be familiar with from that time, from those few days, right. Myself included, even though I was no hillary fan, but I didn't see that outcome coming and I certainly didn't vote for trump. I, um, we got to class and my co faculty, whom I admired greatly, I just proceeded with her lecture on horse evolution and I'm looking around the classroom going, no one here cares about horses the day to day. Um, so she ended up at early and we had lab a couple of hours later and before she let them go, I said, hold on, if anyone wants to stay, this is no longer class, but if anyone wants to stay, I would be happy to lead a conversation about what just happened, what just happened to our country.

Speaker 2:          09:50          And about 40 of our 50 students stayed and skip their lunch hour. And then we went right to anatomy lab that afternoon from, from this conversation. And what I said to them was, do not for a minute believe that racists and sexist elected trump. Think about how many times you have had to censor yourself on this campus when you had an opinion that was even slightly different from the accepted Dogma and that conversation not only brought life to the realm, but afterwards I had several students come up to me, some of them in tears telling me stories about one of them had lost a job on campus for speaking in opinion that was not accepted. One of them had an another story of another friend who lost a job. Others talked about their self censorship and I'm that and all of these people again were four left. Not that it should matter, but these weren't even people who are conservatives or who held conservative views so that that is the larger culture of fear that is hardly restricted to evergreen, but is society wide that we're, that we're speaking about and that people are responding to because in at Google, at starbucks, in cubicles, in campuses, but far be on campuses across the country and across the weird country is at least this is a problem. Well, the irony too

Speaker 1:          11:10          me is that I think that all that I'm doing is talking about these things often with people who have a much better pedigree than I do, but by me talking about it, it's giving room for other people to talk about it and that's all that they want. Well, you're, you're, you are also so

Speaker 2:          11:25          providing ways into the conversation. I think so. There are a lot of people when confronted with. You're not allowed to think that say, Oh God, I'm not actually sure how to respond. I haven't. I don't know. I don't, I don't have the linguistic skills. I don't have the analytics behind me. I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. And so just listening to you and to Sam Harris and the Jordan Peterson into Brett and to Eric and to me and to many, many others I believe begins to give people a sense of not only is this doable, these are good, reasonable, smart people who are being respectful in what they're saying, but also it's not just tools. It's actually like phrase it, you know, this is what you can say. These are the things that sort of things that you can say in response that are still respectful and don't reject the humanity of the person on the other side, but do reject the argument. It's interesting. It almost shows that

Speaker 1:          12:19          were you guys obviously were doing so well at a university level. That's exactly what's needed at a societal level. Now talking about the language, the language to get these ideas across is is so important. I wonder is there a evolutionary explanation for a little bit of what has happened here with the left, like the way they've sort of closed off ranks and then purge everyone because it's just as I sit here with you, it's like the idea that you and Brett wouldn't be enough of whatever it is that they want is so bananas and yet it is true.

Speaker 2:          12:51          So is there some way that you can explain that coming from the discipline you come from? Well there's. I think this is not going to be a particularly deep point, but it's, it's basic ingroup outgroup dynamics and we will always. We will not get rid of of tribal thinking. We will not get rid of our sense of, you know, you and I are aligned, right? That's, that's a good thing. There's a way in which there's a kind of tribalism there even though we just met for the first time today and you know, and we definitely have political differences for sure. Which we can talk about if we want. Yeah, right. So, but, but that isn't the main thing. Like we, we're aligned and I, you know, I feel walking in here like you've got my back and you've got my back and um, I think people especially raised without much experience with the physical world and raised often in situations where they're being given a number of pharmaceuticals early on that are disrupting development, arrive at what should be the cusp of adulthood and aren't sure how to navigate, aren't sure how to navigate the waters.

Speaker 2:          13:57          And so when told, Oh, if you just agree with everything, if you just become an idea log and go in lock step with us, you can be with us. So you know, identity politics is appealing because it provides an instant in group if you will only subjugate yourself and your identity. Politics on this side, b gets it. Anti politics on this side of course, because anyone who shows up here and is told no, you don't have enough of what the progressive stack tells us you made, either you can totally subjugate yourself or go over there and we'll of course we're going to get a rise over here and back and forth

Speaker 1:          14:27          when people criticize us, whoever this is for not focusing on that identity politics enough, the one that, the secondary one that you're talking about here, which is the identity politics of the right, which is either which is based in actual racism or, or you know, there's a white ethno state or ideas that are. So the antithesis of the American experiment is to me they're, they're ridiculous and have no real real world traction. It's almost like we've this boogeyman because we need it long since been displayed. No, no. Almost no one thinks that way anymore. Sorry. No. Well, so what's your, what's your best argument against that? When people say, well, you're not focusing on that enough because because everyone wants everything to be equal all the time. If you're focusing on the identity politics of the left, which clearly many of us see as. I mean, I truly see it. I've been saying, listen, I really believe this. I view it as the greatest existential threat to western democracy that there is. I believe that if there's something that would cause us to be on the streets like killing each other, I think it's that we're. We'll have broken off and all of the commonalities will will disappear, but what? What do you think is the best argument for what? You're not focusing on that one enough because I see that a lot now, right?

Speaker 2:          15:35          I think. I think two things. One, it's not as big a group, right? The, the white nationalists, the extent that they exist and they do are better armed by and large than than the far left, but numerically they just don't exist in the same numbers and they don't have the kind of play. They don't have the kind of cultural reach that the far left does. And so that's the second. Well, I guess there's three points. A secondary point then is everyone can walk white nationalists that is completely acceptable and in fact demanded that you do when those sorts of ideas come up in conversation. Whereas the stuff on the far left, increasingly it is demanded that you not. So there is, that's the key right there. So like we are saying, no, actually we must, we must disagree with this just as much as we should.

Speaker 2:          16:24          Just as much as culturally we now know it's a norm to disagree with what's on the right we, the far right. It should become a cultural norm to disagree with frankly the cryptic racism and sexism and everything else that's happening on the far left. It is, it comes packaged as if it's anti racist, anti sexist and all, it's just, it's racist and sexist against the other group. It's a flipping of the tables of oppression. So I would say the third point is, for me anyway, as someone who has been on the left my whole life, uh, this has changed, this experience is going through the looking glass in the last year has not changed my values, but it has changed what I understand about how people are using language to make other people out to be things they're not. So, you know, I no longer believe in a massive outright for instance. Right. Um, and you know, the boogeyman that are out there that you're not supposed to do things like talk to Fox News. Sorry. No, actually we should all be exposing ourselves to, to the media across the entire range. And for me on the left, it's actually my job much more so than to go after people who I have nothing in common with, to go after the people who claim to have values that are similar to mine. But I see that they are actually achieving goals that are different.

Speaker 1:          17:46          Yeah. And that's why I love this conversation and don't get tired of it because we're all in on it at different levels. We all have different realizations at different times along the timeline and it's like for me, that's where I free for two years. I kept saying I'm of the left and that's why I want to fix this. I don't think realistically anymore I can honestly say that I think I have more in common certainly with Libertarians and I find it. I find an intellectual openness with conservatives that I just don't find anymore. On this other side, and I know there's. Again, I know there's some people you just spoke at Heterodox, a Heterodox, Jonathan hates been on the show. I think he's doing wonderful work. There's obviously people like Brett and like Eric and and Steven pinker and plenty and Sam and plenty of other that exists still as sort of a same left, but I see that just being whittled and whittled and whittled away and that doesn't mean that it's not worth taking it. Maybe it means it's the most worthy fight, but I just see it as like an increasingly untenable position to hold.

Speaker 2:          18:45          I think. I think there are actually many, many, many people out there who are not, who don't have public platforms, who are waiting, who've been waiting for this, who are watching your. Most of these people would consider the songs themselves Democrats, as I always did. I don't, I don't want to identify as a Democrat anymore given what they know, stand for a. But most I think that and this, you know, as evidenced by my inbox. So it's anecdotal, but it's a lot of anecdotes and you know, and also my twitter feed a that there are a massive number of people out there who are on the left who have values on the left and who find no one out there who was making sense except now. Yeah. And it, it has taken. It has taken this to, you have this fever pitch that we have arrived at a for a number of people. I really think and like I said, you know Google starbucks, but it's not just those big stories. There are people writing to me and to Brett from just average workplaces saying, I'm in fear for my job because I cannot speak anything that doesn't fit the dogma. We just hired an equity advisor. We just hired an inclusion advisor and it's, and it's hateful. It's hateful rhetoric that we are being told to adopt. This is what's happening across corporate America now. Of course most Americans are not going to appreciate that.

Speaker 1:          20:13          Yeah. It's like it existed at the universities for a long time and finally it started bubbling out of there and those kids took those ideas and started entering the workforce. That's why it's so weird. You know, people say you're all, you're focusing on college students too much and it's like, do realize they get out of college usually, right. If they're supposed to. So tell me a little bit more about sort of what you're doing now. I know you just spoke at Heterodox and uh, or let's start. Let's start with that

Speaker 2:          20:36          heterodox. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the Heterodox Academy's first conference, uh, they and fire are really at the forefront institutionally of defending viewpoint diversity on campuses. A fire from sort of more of a legal perspective and Heterodox at the faculty administrative perspective and it was point. It was an intense conferences. The only conference I've ever been to where I thought they should have been longer. I wanted to go longer. It was a daisy. All academics in the audience as well, or do they open that up? I think. I think there were probably non-academics there. I know that there were a lot of journalists there. Uh, and most everyone I met were students or faculty or Admin or journalists. So I don't know. I don't know what the, what the entry rules were, but you know, the panels were as, as Jonathan Heit at the end of the day, I, I, Jonathan Count only three people who are on the panels of I guess 28 people who might be conservative.

Speaker 2:          21:34          So he himself pointed out, you know, we're striving for viewpoint diversity, but the fact is it's an uphill battle, you know, we're not going to get just, just like we shouldn't expect a 50 slash 50 sex ratio amongst software software engineers between men and women were we're not going to get a 50 slash 50 ratio of liberals and conservatives on college campuses. It's not necessarily the kind of work that conservatives flocked to in the same numbers as liberals do. So I think we need to be careful about imagining what, what equity would look like as in all of these arguments. At an ideal level, why would it be that conservatives would be less inclined to be doing academics? I guess it depends on what our definition of conservative is. One of stereotype that comes to mind that I may regret saying is that a liberal types take some odd pride and not caring about making a good living, making good money in faculty positions tend to tend to fit that right?

Speaker 2:          22:34          Certainly Evergreen did. Um, so, you know, if you, if what if one of your primary goals is not only to make a good living for yourself, but potentially to leap out of the living you're making and you know, really hit it big, you're unlikely to do that in academia. Uh, so there's a, there's a sort of a risk aversion. I think I'm to the prospect of making it big financially that academics tend to have that maybe, maybe conservatives would be less likely to, to go that way. Do you think it could also be the conservatives were just self selecting out, like they realized the hostile atmosphere. So they were just like, why would I do this? Absolutely. That is one of the explanations for sure. And um, you know, certainly in some fields, you know, an engineered the, the less human focus, the field, the more conservatives there are, we know this.

Speaker 2:          23:26          So in engineering, for instance, in the physical sciences, mostly people don't speak their politics on college campuses if they are on the right because they're not welcome there. Uh, but, uh, but those fields do have higher representations of conservatives than liberals. But most of the social sciences and humanities, uh, we're all always tended liberal but are even more so, I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but even more so now than they ever have been. And that's a problem to have, you know, take, you have to have a field that is trying to understand the nature of humans, any of the social sciences, psychology or anthropology or sociology to be entirely limited to people on the left side of the political spectrum. Maybe you're missing something in your explanation of what humans are if you don't have anyone who's willing to speak to a different political position. So when I've talked

Speaker 1:          24:19          to Jordan Peterson, who you referenced and my friend Peter, but goes in and a couple other people who are professors, um, you probably know Pete, right? Yeah. Um, I think a lot of their argument is based around that, you know, gender studies and these sort of, these sort of new fueled basically have a completely separate set of standards that have been. It had virtually nothing to do with any of the standards that you as an evolutionary biologist had to, had to and have to prescribe to, to do your work. Is that really the crux of it? Sort of at the institutional level at schools

Speaker 2:          24:56          I, that is at least one of the first site that, that I have seen as well, that there are many new fields, many of which end in the word studies, uh, like gender studies that are there. They're made up. They are based in postmodernism and not just, not just postmodernism because at its base originally there, there's some stuff of value there, believe it or not, but the new manifestations in critical theory and such are, are basically free of any fact checking apparatus. So they are, they are anti science, anti enlightenment, and, and they're quite willing to say things like reason is a tool.

Speaker 1:          25:37          Patriarchy. This is the new one. This sort of popping up in the last six months. Right?

Speaker 2:          25:41          And I mean, you, you just have to know you're dealing with people who are not going to be playing in good faith and willing to have an. Actually, you know, viable argument at the point that they say that, uh, so it's, that there has been capture, you know, pretty pretty solid capture and a few of the more traditional fields. I'm not entirely, in fact, I met several people at Heterodox, um, who are sociologists who are fighting this from within, but sociology is one of the captured fields, anthropology, geography and cultural anthropology in particular, so that the fact that it is that there are fields that students can go into and basically never be exposed to the idea of you're going to generate as many possible explanations for the thing that you've observed as possible. We're going to do hypothesis generation first and then we're going to try to figure out what would have to be true if any, if each of those individual hypotheses were true and then we're going to try to figure out how to test between them. That's the scientific method and it's inefficient. It sometimes gets things wrong, but it is the only tool we have to over time get to a better and better understanding of the universe. And there's, there's no, there's no method over in gender studies.

Speaker 1:          27:00          Yeah. So how have you seen that way of thinking leak into the harder sciences because this seems to be the next frontier.

Speaker 2:          27:09          Yeah. Um, there are, there are some schools now that when positions come open in, um, in science disciplines. So for most schools, this wasn't sure at Evergreen, but at most schools through the hiring apparatus within, uh, within department. So you know, someone in physics retires and physics gets to the society, the Physics Faculty and Department Chair and such get to decide what kind of physicists they're going to hire next. Somehow increasingly science educators are being as being hired rather than scientists themselves. And science educator is a code word for people coming out of Ed schools and education schools have, have this pathogen very, very badly. So I'm science educators being hired into positions that should have been scientists means that now you have a weakening of scientific voice and scientific method in science departments. You have A. I mean even was it just recently nature, I think published one of the two big science journals published.

Speaker 2:          28:14          I don't know if it was a letter or an article arguing that one of the primary things that science needs to be focusing on is increasing diversity. So you have two problems with this. What are your measures of diversity? It's the stuff that you can see on first pass. This is immutable characteristics and has nothing to do with actually all the other kinds of diversity that are interesting and that you know and that we can change things like political belief and you know, some things that we can't change, but things like being on the autism spectrum or you know, even like, you know, colorblindness or dyslexia or lefthand and is all of which provide your brain without us ever being conscious of it. Some different way of approaching the world and that kind of diversity in a group of people, ads, ads, actual intrigue and nuanced to conversations.

Speaker 1:          29:02          And then I'm a lefty with a little dyslexia. Actually. I'm a lefty too.

Speaker 2:          29:07          Yep. So, you know, lefty is like, you know, like many other members of these groups with. I happened to happen at other lefty one because I've, I've done some research on it. Lefties are overrepresented at, you know, in the National Academy of Sciences and a mental institution.

Speaker 1:          29:21          You've got this really big spread. Well now I can see that there's really two options for your future. That's right. Alright, let's talk about consciousness a little bit. I just had Sam Harrison, we, we've talked about it quite extensively. I think you have some thoughts on consciousness, the nature of consciousness. Indeed.

Speaker 2:          29:39          Yeah. I mean it's probably do this right. We would need to agree on a definition that I'm not sure that that's any definition that we choose will immediately antagonized some amount of your audience. This is like defining, defining truth, which seems to be tough these days. Yes, exactly. Um, so maybe, maybe rather than that, um, are humans the only conscious beings on this planet? I don't think so, but we are the most conscious. We are the most fully conscious and we have better access to our own consciousness obviously. Then we have access to the consciousness of say, dolphins or elephants or other apes or maybe a wolves. Any of these long lived social organisms with long childhoods and generational overlap who lived sometimes with three generations together at a time, so there's transmission of cultural information, organisms that have theory of mind and can imagine can put themselves in the other individual's position and think, what do they think is going on right now?

Speaker 2:          30:43          Even though I understand that that's a different thing than what I think is going on right now, which we now know that certain monkeys and apes exactly do that. Yes, theory of mind. There's a beautiful book called Baboon Metaphysics by the husband and wife, team Chaney and Seyfarth that basically explores theory of mind and baboons. Uh, and, you know, it's not the only one. They're, they're not the only spaces, but, you know, how do we as humans find our consciousness best? You know, there, there are ways that we can hack into what is sometimes been called flow states or um, you know, that's, that's the most common one. But yeah, we can do so through, well through deep conversation, um, through meditation, through music, some sometimes through producing it, but sometimes through experiencing, especially live music, dance for some people, Hallucinogens, sex, sport, you know, intense physical or physiological or emotional experience in which we are just moving with others usually.

Speaker 2:          31:50          And you know, there are those of us like myself, you know, very strong introvert who will find so my deepest flow states, you know, access to consciousness alone, you're alone in the Amazon when I could sit and watch monkeys and write that for me. That's one of them. But sport is also. So when I talked about this with Sam, the way he was defining it, which I think is sort of similar to what you're saying here, it strikes me as just like an extreme ability to maintain present in the moment that that really sort of when a basketball player. So if we use the sport analogy, like a basketball player when they're in the zone, you know, and Jordan scores 20 points in five minutes and he just, he, he said, well, everything I threw up just went in like that. They hit that level of consciousness or for you to be outside enough out of yourself to be able to write in that perfect moment or, or whatever it is that it.

Speaker 2:          32:38          Oh, it always seems about present more than anything else. To me, there is a kind of, um, time stopping both time stopping and disappearing on you at the same time, which I think is part of why entheogenic hallucinogens can, can capture that as well because their sense of time just disappearing on you is, is remarkable. Um, so you, you both don't care about time and time passes usually in ways that seemed quicker than you were expecting them to, uh, with, with a sport or um, or right meditation that, yeah, that's not one that I do. But um, you know, Sam has a lot to say about that. Of course. Um, yeah, I remember when I was doing mushrooms at least sort of in college age, somewhat consistently, maybe every six months or something. I would always want the clocks to be covered. Yes. Because I hated the numbers are no good.

Speaker 2:          33:32          I did. I definitely did one trip like five hours in a mirror, forget that, but I always wanted the clocks to be covered because the idea that time was passing while I was in this state was, was very scary to me. Yeah, that's scary. Or just I just wanted nothing to do with it. I guess maybe it doesn't matter what that distinction is, you know, scary or just not interested. Right. But, um, so it's, it's very different than the kinds of consciousness enhancing activities that we can engage in, including hallucinogens are very different if you're inside in a room like this where you have no access to what is going on climate illogically or weather-wise outside as opposed to if you, if you are out and you can watch as the sunsets and as the moon comes up and you can think again, oh, right, it's a, it's a, it's a waxing moon.

Speaker 2:          34:19          It'll be full in four days and um, or you know, or you're at a coast and you can watch the tides and think about the shifting time. So for me, thinking about time that is clearly being brought as clearly being revealed by the planet we're on as opposed to coming at me through a clock is more meaningful and I'm willing, I'm willing to think about time in that way, but definitely not through clocks when I'm, when I'm writing hallucinogen sport, any of that. Right. And yet we have all of these devices now that our men our time that are meant to take our attention that are literally designed this way. Do you sense we're on so that there's actually a digital assault on consciousness because maybe that really does explain so many of the other problems we're having in society right now. It's, it's one of the key pieces for sure.

Speaker 2:          35:11          And I think that phrase is brilliant at digital assault on consciousness. This is something. I'm Tristan Harris who I don't know, but I've got them on the show. Yeah. Talks talks about a lot and you know, he, he has been, he has been ringing the alarm bell for years about the algorithms that are being put into our devices that are, that are creating addicts out of us. But more broadly, you know, the digital assault on consciousness is, there's not, there is, it's increasingly hard to find a space where you're just actually free and clear. And this is, you know, this is part of what I do for myself and what I used to do for my students was take them to places, not only that we're remote and where they could explore nature, but where there was no cell signal where there was no internet. So you know, the deepest part of the Amazon that I took students to.

Speaker 2:          35:59          There's just, there's no email, there's no internet, there's no Wifi. We are a plane ride over the Andes and then a boat ride and then a truck ride and then another five hours down, a tributary of the Amazon to a place with no roads, no airstrips, nothing. And boy does time feel different and you know, you're sleeping in little cabins that are screened. And so you wake up when the insects and the birds and the monkeys wake up and they start talking at you. They're not talking to you the document themselves, but you getting a sense of the rhythms of the planet that we're on can return people, I think to a real sense of self and also to a sense of what they value, what their passions are. And this is a big thing I think is missing in many of the. To return to what we were talking about earlier.

Speaker 2:          36:47          You know, the, the far left activists, the, the control left mostly I think lack another passion. And I've said before I, you know, the prediction I would make is that you have very few rock climbers or scares among the radical left activists. People who have something that they can engage in that frees them from time and devices from, from a response to time. I need to be here then, or this my thing just pinged me. I need to look at it, uh, are better able to center themselves to find their own consciousness and discover who, who they are and what they want to be in the world. What does that say about the self? Do you think? To me, there's something there about like if you really believe in the self and your and the individually and your ability to overcome things, you don't need all of these external processes to help define the world because you're sort of defining it yourself.

Speaker 2:          37:42          I, I agree and I think I do think for me self sufficiency is one of my highest values personally and I have a. I have a very hard time understanding anyone who says, Oh, if you leave me on my own, I wouldn't know what to do. Like I, I just, I just don't get this. I don't get why you would. Maybe it's a lefty thing. I'd be fine. I'm like, what? Why would. Why would you broadcast to the world that you would be helpless? This doesn't make any sense to me, but you know, there, there are plenty of situations where I wouldn't know what to do and I would know what to do in situations that most people wouldn't just because of where I've traveled and where I've lived, but the idea that self sufficiency require the idea that you want to be self sufficient requires a concept of self, I think is is important here.

Speaker 2:          38:28          Yeah. Maybe just maybe that. Yeah, and if you give that up, well then boy, you're giving up a lot. You give up so much. And the devices as, as heroin, as Tristan Harris has argued, are addicting us. It's no accident. We're, you know, we, we should not view ourselves actually as weak. We, when we get addicted to the things we should wean ourselves. We should as much as possible to provide ourselves zones, periods of time when we have no access to those things. And so we are actually free and clear to let our minds do what they will because when, when we, when they have access to our brands, they are designed to addict us. So using, using the discipline that you're an expert in, is it possible that we're in a unique position right now because of technology that our brains are actually evolving now evolving or I guess devolving depending on which way you look at it at an extraordinarily high pace or, or something like that, you know, the, the rate of change across almost every sector in the economy and in human experience right now is higher than it's ever been.

Speaker 2:          39:43          Could you say that about any moment in history maybe, but the rate of change itself is changing as well. So that's the important distinction, right? Um, and what is going on with technology is completely untested. And so this is, this is a place where, you know, why, why am I so certain that I'm still on the left, even though most of the people who say they're on the left publicly, I don't have any interest in continuing to talk to them because they don't seem to be making any sense. I look at systems that are involved, that are, that are in stable state because they've evolved over millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years. And my instinct is don't mess with that until you really, really understand what you're doing. And so for instance, I, unlike many scientists and not feeding my children gmos, I give them and myself organic food and when we meet, which we do a lot of, I want that meat to have been fed the grass, if it's the food of its ancestors, what or what exactly is the harm?

Speaker 2:          40:45          We now know a little bit of this but 20 years ago if you would ask me what's the harm and feeding cows grants. So I have no idea, but I know that messing with a system that was working is more likely to interfere with something in that animal then not why, you know, why would you mess if you could not, and of course their economic reasons to mess. But um, the, the, don't mess with systems that are working until you really have a solid understanding of what the, what the effects are going to be. The use of the precautionary principle pretty widely is what puts me pretty far on the left, but systems that we've created that are evolutionary, but people don't know that we need to regulate in order to get them under control because nuclear energy isn't gonna regulate itself and habitat loss throughout most of the world is not going to regulate itself. So there are some problems that we've created and that are bigger than individuals can do anything about. And you know, that's why I'm not a libertarian.

Speaker 1:          41:44          Yeah. Right. And this is. This is where I think we have. Oh, I get it. Like I don't know that if you just leave everybody to do whatever the hell they want all the time, that everybody isn't going to be doing all sorts of awful things. I think generally the market does fix some of that, but I get what you're saying. Like these systems are I suppose often precarious in nature too, to the point where anything can be tilted one way or the other and then we've got bigger problems. Right? So how do we, how do we fix some of this stuff? How do we, how do we actually scale this back? I mean, I get it, you know, most of my artists will get. Okay, well we have to keep talking about it. Should we have to wake more people up? Sure. But what can you do using the knowledge you have in the study you've done?

Speaker 2:          42:24          I have less. I have less insight right now at least to answer in this amount of time for the adult systems. Um, but I think I have a fair amount of clarity on what we should do, should be doing with children and with parenting. We're really, really not doing a, which is,

Speaker 1:          42:43          when you say the adult systems, you mean like economic system?

Speaker 2:          42:45          Well, it's just like, and, and more specifically, how do you get adults who were already who they are to behave differently. Um, it's, it's less clear to me what we can do and so we'll show them for the purpose of, and you know, and the CIS. Yes. Also also, it's true that I have, um, that I'm not going to wade into, for instance, what we should do a better economic system here. Now with you, I might do it later, but yeah, um, but with regard to, for instance, you know, most, most people I think have never thought about what childhood is and if you don't have children yourself and you're an adult, okay, maybe you don't have to. Maybe it doesn't matter. Like maybe it just doesn't matter to you, but if you're a parent, you need to think about why it is that we have literally the longest childhood relative to lifespan of any organism on the planet.

Speaker 2:          43:37          This is a feature. This is a way for us to learn how to become humans. We are not, and this is, this is a point that Brett has made very often. We're not blank slates, but we are the blanket slates of any organisms on the planet. We, we are more software than hardware. And so what we're doing for these first, I don't know, 11 to 25 years of our lives right now into the forties. I think it depends, but depending on culture, you know, when do you start calling yourself an adult in the room? That's what we're doing is learning how to be human. And we're learning how to be human by direct exposure. We're supposed to be learning how to be human through instruction, direct instruction by our parents, through observing our parents, through observing our siblings, through interacting with, including fighting with our siblings and having them smack us down both sometimes literally, but definitely metaphorically when we do stupid things.

Speaker 2:          44:30          And um, better yet, if our parents have lots of adult friends around and they have lots of kids and there's a whole mess of humanity that we are learning from. And then we're also in that very long developmental period supposed to be learning from direct physical experience of the world. So the example I like to go to here is, um, you know, the, the roadrunner cartoons when Wiley Coyote scoots is way off a cliff and he doesn't fall until he realizes there's nothing below him. It's funny, right? Like it's really funny. But of course it's funny because we know the gravity doesn't really work that way. Increasingly. I suspect that a lot of kids and now into the Ihn and, and some of the younger millennials kind of art, sure. Like they were protected so much by their helicopter parents and they were behind screens rather than having real experience and to the extent that they played sport, it was totally regulated and overseen by adults and they didn't have any free time to go and get themselves into trouble and maybe even like burn something down or hurt themselves or break an arm or whatever it is and learn from it that they arrive at the cusp of what should have been adulthood.

Speaker 2:          45:43          Totally unclear on what that supposed to mean. Does this absolutely to you because as I'm hearing you say that this is the bell going off in my head, man, I've been on tour where Peterson for the last six weeks. Everything that you just said there is basically what he is saying. He is trying to. I sent that what he's trying to do at the most personal level. Yeah. He talks about society as a whole, but at the most personal level he's trying to retool young people. It's not even retool. He's trying to give them the tools in the first place that they clearly should have gotten before. Yeah, so that's what's so fascinating to me because it's like, how did this happen? Right? How did, how did this happen? And we can point to, we can point to pharmaceuticals being given to kids to make boys less boy like, and to some degree to make girls less girl like, you know, give great, let's give speed to boys.

Speaker 2:          46:35          So they'll sit and face forward and learn what. So they'll calm down, calm down and not do rough and tumble play. And I mean that's insane. And at the same time, let's give antianxiety meds to girls and SSR rise. And um, and you know, just just the model of schooling is ridiculous. You know, we have, we have schools that have gotten rid of recess because recess is dangerous and everyone who's ever been in school, even if like me, you happen to have been a good fit for the model of schools that you were in, which I think is pretty rare actually knows that you also need to have time to get out there and play and move your body and experience it and not have it being overseen by some adult who's decided in advance what isn't, is not safe for you to experience. So, you know, one of the things I used to say to my students in advance, we did a lot of team building, like actual team building and planning with them in advance that these long study abroad trips, we would have spent weeks together on campus in advance of going on these trips.

Speaker 2:          47:35          Um, but what I wanted to do before we left was established with them. What's your relationship with risk? How do you, how do you view yourself, your relationship with the risk? And we would do this in round lake and I would answer the question to, you know, I would say to them, actually I happen to love risk. I will, I'm the leader on this trip, but I will keep all of you safe. But then I'm going to go do things like I am going to walk alone in the forest a lot and do things because it happens to be one of the ways that I find my consciousness that I, that I find my truest self and I don't expect any of you to do that also. But you need to be comfortable with the fact that your leader is going to be doing that sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          48:14          And one of the other things that we would talk about was, you know, what's your relationship with comfort? You're going to be uncomfortable. You don't have to, you know, just because you can say in advance you're okay with the bugs and the mud and the not having a phone doesn't mean you actually will be when you're faced with it. But maybe most important is we are going to leave ourselves open to serendipity. I cannot tell you everything that we're going to do or learn on this trip. If I could, what would be the point of going we're going to go and some interesting things are going to happen. I've, I've had a couple of near death experiences on these trips. I didn't want them. My didn't know and you know, I was, I was a learning experience where there is a learning experience and frankly on the most recent one on a, on a boat in the galapagos with eight students in which the only thing that didn't survive was the boat, but it was, it was really touch and go.

Speaker 2:          49:07          I mean, I really did almost die. Those eight students and I are friends for life. Right? You know, there's, there's some of them that I'm not an active contact with, but I, I know where they are and that you know, that bonds you and no, I'm not going to pitch a trip with Andrew might die. That's not what the goal is, but the idea that it could happen and you should have the tools on board, the physical tools, psychological tools, the emotional tools, the intellectual tools to figure out in real time as your boat is being flipped by a 15 foot wave and now you're trapped under it. What do you do with that? A uniquely Evergreen type of teaching? Was that something that you and Brett really, that was a unique name, their knee kind of teaching and then this last trip, Brett was there with me as well.

Speaker 2:          49:55          There was, there was a way in which I think what we, what I said about childhood, which I, you know, my interest originally in evolution was about the evolution of parental care and territoriality and social systems and sexual selection and long before I ever had kids myself long before I wanted kids, but I thought, you know, one sprint and I did have kids and I'm watching these amazing creatures began to grow up. Okay, let's think then about what, what is the best way to do this? And we could put them a little boxes and make absolutely sure that they survive till the age of 18 and then we open up the boxes and we let them out and they have basically no chance of being adults or even of knowing how to be adults or we could expose them to ever greater risk having first made absolutely sure that they know that they are loved and that we have their backs and that we will do anything to come in and get them and to protect them if we can, but that they are going to start going out into the world pretty early, you know, biking it too.

Speaker 2:          51:02          And you know, we took him to the Amazon at seven and nine the first time. And you know, something could have gone wrong and I don't know. I've known parents who lost kids and I don't know how you survive that, but you need to be willing to take risks such that when your kids do hit 18 or 20 or whatever, you know that they're actually already on their way to being adults. And that is gonna require backing off and letting them do some of their learning on their own and knowing that that's going to result in some harm coming to them and it's going to be physical harm, it's going to be psychological harm, it's going to be intellectual harm, but frankly the lack of any kind of harm that a lot of kids are experiencing is part of why they're now saying speeches, violence, right? I mean that's, that's part of how we get there.

Speaker 1:          51:48          If some of this, an extension of the success of the West in a way. Because if you take the set of kids who however old they are, let's say we go from. Although now there's a lot of studies that are showing that young, the generation younger than millennials is actually leaning more conservative. But let's say we take 16 to 30 roughly. So generation y ish that you see that most of their parents were baby boomers who were the most successful, at least financially generation ever. Most of the baby boomers, parents all went to war and you know, lived through depression and all sorts of. But that because the baby boomer is basically where the biggest middle class and because there was such upward mobility, they had it so well, they kind of got their eye off the ball, started focusing on things that didn't matter as much, protecting kids from things that a kid would have used to have to have done. And that is sort of what led us here. So it's almost like an economic backing for what ended up happening psychologically.

Speaker 2:          52:45          Yeah, I think. I think that's apt. You know, there are so many things feeding into this and yes, the wealth of America Post World War Two, uh, and the fact that those are most of the parents of the generation that seems the most confused, I think definitely there's a causal link there. Yeah. And then you toss in the Internet and you toss on the Internet, right? Um, which, you know, we can't go back obviously, uh, but, but we need to understand that it's an evolutionary system and then it's going to run away from us and that we are all prone to be addicted to dopamine hits. We were going to the quick, the quick likes rather than, you know, even even. Okay. So take internet out of the picture for a moment if you don't know what you do for physical activity. I bike you play basketball.

Speaker 2:          53:39          Okay. So maybe with basketball it's going to be different for me. I liked video games too. Is that better? I, no, that's probably the opposite. Probably the opposite. So I used to play a lot of ultimate frisbee and you could. Oh, like anytime there was a pickup game, like I, I, I'm, I'm there. I was playing five, six times a week for awhile and then I ruptured my Achilles tendon playing on an Oregon beach with students a few years ago. I'm not doing that anymore. Um, but biking, which I love and I find meditative. I have a very hard time convincing myself to get on my bike even though while I'm doing it, I love it. And after I do it, I feel better and I'm more productive and a more creative and I just am more in love with life, but it's a pain in the ass and it's a little bit physically uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          54:27          And you know, all of these things are true. We, we prioritize the, the pleasure of now over even something that for me, I know not, it's not even that I'm going to feel better after I did it. I actually love the activity itself. But getting over that sort of activation energy to do the thing. And I suspect that sport, like actual team sports is a little bit different, a little different. Like you're ready to go, you're ready to go. Like, oh, people are there, I'm ready. I'm like, let's go to the gym. I would like into that. Like I know that when I work out I like doing it and I feel great after it. But it's like, oh, I got to get in my car. I got to drive over there. I got a bark and blah blah blah. It feels like a chore.

Speaker 2:          55:04          Yeah, but you yet, you know, it's good. And yet, so we're always fighting our nature sort of we are now. Exactly. We're always fighting her nature and it shouldn't surprise us that we're going to need to fight our nature with regard to responding to the Internet and responding to, especially especially the little computers we carry around in our pockets and you know, learning to restrict our access to those training ourselves to restrict their access to those. And I think anyone with the ability to train themselves to meditate or to do anything on a regular basis should, should be able to train themselves that same way with regard to devices. All right, well we've done about an hour here and I was going to demand that you come back because I know, I know we can do way more of this unfortunate just because my schedule is so nuts at the moment.

Speaker 2:          55:49          We have to kind of stop. But can you give me one more thing that you're just really excited about right now that you've been thinking about or working on or anything else that's really just giving you a little bit, uh, a little bit of juice at the moment while you're in this interesting space for yourself? No. Um, there are a number of things I guess. Um, there's a, there's a piece I wrote a number of years ago that is supposed to be out in the literary magazine just about now, ish about, haven't been mugged at knife point and Quito at one of these on one of these study abroad trips which prompt and I was with three students. Is Quito the capital of Ecuador. Oh, okay. So it was, it was the very, it was before the first day of one of my six week study abroad trips.

Speaker 2:          56:29          So 20 students just made. Brent wasn't there on this one. Um, and the experience in which, you know, we'd been, we'd been to get the three students that I have been together all day. We come to the top of the stairs and suddenly two guys with with knives run around the corner and pin me and my female student up against a wall and do this sort of knife dance in front of us and then relieve. I didn't have anything on me because I know how to walk around Latin American cities and one of my students didn't, but two of my students had all of their stuff taken off of them, including this really nice dslr that Michelle and my student had and they run off and the next thing I realize I am on one of these guys in the middle of the street pulling on the backpack. He's stolen from another one of my students.

Speaker 2:          57:19          Another one of my students has chased down the other guy and thought how did that happen and why is everything now so loud and so colorful? And I thought back immediately thought, wow, the entire experience that I just had was somehow in black and white and was without sound. And so, I mean, it's an interesting long story that, that I basically explored in this essay by going into and doing a dive into the literature on the nature of memory, on the nature of sensory memory in particular and what it is that we can and cannot perceive in the moment, what our brains take in, why time seems to slow down. So just to go back to our early conversation about time, why 10 time seems to slow down in periods of intensity. It's not that it time slows down, but basically our frame rate increases and not only our frame rate increases, but the amount that we remember and you know, move into short term memory.

Speaker 2:          58:14          And then in this case into longterm memory increases. So this is, this is one of the things that I've been thinking about lately is sort of how, how memory and the senses and in fact, how all of us are a little bit of synesthesia. It's, are experiencing our world in ways that, that we don't usually have language for. Not that it was the purpose of the story, but how did this all end? It ended. We got, we got the stuff back, we got the stuff back, and as soon as the student, Jeremy and I gave Tracy these guys and got the stuff back. Then the police showed up, then doppler it up from the end and the whole were watching. It was. It was remarkable actually. It was totally. There was no one on this walk. We'd send no one. These two guys run up to US Magus runoff. We give chase and then the entire neighborhood comes alive. Suddenly there were hundreds of people there, like, where were you guys?

Speaker 1:          59:08          There's some sort of study to be done on that. Well, I'm sure they've done studies on that. You know when people see the bad thing happening, but nobody calls the police and all that kind of stuff. Well listen, it's been an absolute pleasure. I'm so glad that we finally got to do this in person and we will do it again. You guys can follow heather on the twitter. She does tweet a decent amount, but not a unhealthy addicted amount. I would say it's at heather. He hiding.
