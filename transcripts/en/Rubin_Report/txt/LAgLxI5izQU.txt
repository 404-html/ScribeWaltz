Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Joining me today is British author, journalist and political commentator Douglas Murray. He is also the associate director of the Henry Jackson Society and associate editor of the spectator. Douglas, welcome to the Rubin report. Very good to be with him to see you in person. I don't know how we haven't done this in person yet. They haven't been in La. It's. Yeah. What in God's name are you doing? Living anywhere else besides la? Uh, well it's, it's actually not my favorite bit of America. I have to say I find it slightly unscented and routines because also because I don't drive. So La is sort of hell because you can't walk anywhere. Well I know you're not making that up because you were stuck on a plane for about four hours last night. You arrived at like 2:00 AM. Then we tried to send a car to get you this morning. That took some time if it's me being difficult.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       No, I actually, I used to watch the three films before the plane even took off last night. She's New York. Anything good? No awful films. They're all bad or mad? Almost always bad. Do you feel you're at your intellectual best right now because you didn't get much sleep? The you're ready to do that defends our mangers. You want to be. Well, I've got some pretty rigorous questions right here. Uh, but I think that's an interesting way to kick off because you are somebody that, you know, everything that I, that I see you. Right. And the events that you speak at and, and the talks that you've given all that stuff, I mean you have to be at your intellectual best pretty much all the time. Uh, I don't know if you feel you always are, but, but what kind of pressure does that put you under just to be, to be one of the people that, you know, you have to have a cohesive set of thoughts and be able to defend them all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       I'm not sure you have to have the keys, but I tell you what I mean. I don't admire or envy politicians for having to have the thing of having to turn up, say the right thing. Never be off message and all that sort of thing. I kind of feel, you know, I'm a writer, I can, I can have bad days, uh, I can change my mind on things. I can nuance things, texture things or I can be garbled one day and um, you know, nobody says, oh my God, he's a total train wreck. I don't know. I don't know if they did. Oh, when we care. But. Well, it's funny you say that because right before we started we were talking about social media a little bit when you were saying how you don't respond that often or, or paying that much attention to that. I'm not on Facebook, I'm on twitter. I use twitter as a way to communicate to the few people who can, you know, anything I write or appear on. Um, but I don't talk to the world as it were. Um, I don't think it's doable. I think it drives people mad. Seeing some of the least, you know, Bernard really promising minds. My generation slightly wracked by social media. Yeah. Um, you know, you wouldn't, you wouldn't seek out people to shout at you in the street, so you wouldn't. If they did say, come

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       over here, say this more regular basis and do it when I wake up and turn over in the morning and turning my phone on. Yeah. So I do think that people have to find a sort of reasonable way to live in this strange, strange world, which is even stranger in our hail is now.

Speaker 3:          00:03:16       Yeah. Well it's, it's much stranger in La and we are going for dinner tonight. I'm going to show you how we can get, you know, what's weird in La. I'm gonna I'm gonna show you tonight. Um, tell me a little bit. So we've done this once before and it was about two years ago and I had just started doing an interview show and we, we talked about a lot of the problems that we both had with the left and the rise of Islam in some of that we're going to cover here. Uh, but I thought maybe we could just talk about a little bit about your history first and what kind of brought you to be one of the, one of the few people that is so outspoken on some of these issues. What, what made you care about the free speech stuff about what's happening in the west, all of this stuff, when did that really spark in you?

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       Um, it's hard. I mean, these things are easier to recognize other people than they are in yourself. Um, I've written about a lot of different things in my life. I started writing very young. I became a, became a published author as it were. I wrote my first book when I was 18, came out when I was 19 or 20 I think. And um, that was on literature, um, and, or literally figure. And then I started writing about politics and the one thing which, uh, uh, somebody once said to me about me as well that I thought it was probably somewhere near the truth was that somebody once said that I had a very low tolerance threshold for lies. And I think there is something in that. I, I, I genuinely, maybe it all wear out at some point, but I'm just overdose as it were on lies.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       But I, I just, I find, um, I, I don't like being told lies and I don't like it about historical things. That's my first book is partly about, I think it has sort of set of historical misunderstandings that had happened in relation to the figure I was writing about and I wanted to correct them. And then in politics, of course, if you have a low tolerance for lies, maybe it's just not the right area. So that was my next question. Maybe you picked it, not because I got into surfing or something I didn't know, but, but, but policy, politics and political lives, um, uh, galvanizes me. And I suppose the other thing is that I'm not a political, not, I'm not, I don't really care who's running in that district for which party and which, you know, party they voted for four years ago. Now I sort of thing is interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:05:28       It's not what I spend my life feeling particularly oppressed or, you know, enamored with. But I do. Um, I do think that if you care about the culture in the widest sense as I do, then you've got to be interested in politics, uh, you, you, you've got to take some attitude towards it and they say in order that you further your political goals or something if you want to do that, you should really be a politician. But I think in order to try to safe guard coach, I mean, I mean, I don't even mean the coats. I mean really to safeguard the practice of culture and then that's what politics seems to me to be very largely for. Um, I'm quite interested in taxation and not very interested in it. I just want the circumstances to be right for the culture to thrive.

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       Yeah. So when people say, Oh, you know, I'm not a political person or something like that, I, I hate that phrase because it really. What are you actually saying? You're like, you're either pretending that you're above it or you somehow don't need it. And yet politics, you're right. It's about creating the conditions so that you can do all of the other things you care.

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       I think what people, what a lot of people mean when they say that is, um, I'm not a party person, I'm not gonna bore on about the Labor Party Organ Soda Party of the Democrats or Republicans. I think that's what what people mean, but in any case, a lot of people who said that sometime ago don't see that anymore. In fact, that maybe the more they said in the past they weren't a politics person, the more now the shrieking and jibberish and storming.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       Yeah. Do you think there's a danger in that? So we had all these people that, you know, whatever, that whatever that meant to them, they weren't politics people, but now everybody's shrieking and screaming and everyone's in the part of it that you just said, that doesn't really do it for you. That piece of the day to day race horse stuff. And that's why I try to focus on the philosophical stuff because [inaudible] who's running for this or all of that stuff. Yes, it's important at some level, but it's the bigger picture stuff that I think really matters.

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       Yes. And, uh, you know, to a great extent in your country and your mind, uh, there is a type of person now who I think has got politics all the wrong way around. I mean, maybe it is, as I say, people who didn't pay much attention to it in the past, but there are people who are now, I think putting onto politics. I'm an amount of weight that it can't bear. Yeah. It's about their entire existence as it were. And I wouldn't want that to be the case, uh, at all. I mean, I, uh, you know, I had with a colleague sometime ago, sort of informal competition of the Conservative Party won the 2015 election in Britain. Had An informal competition to say, now what's the nuttiest thing anyone's said? And the best was his woman at the Guardian who wrote a column saying that basically she cried herself to sleep every night and she woke up in the morning crying and she, sometimes she stopped crying. She woke up because you thought, oh my God, I've had a nightmare. No, it's true. And then she burst into tears again. That person shouldn't really be in the community, it should, they, but if I, I, you know, I have views. I was on here, I want to win and at any one time which party I'd vote for, but, but I cannot imagine any scenario in which I became such a jittering wreck that I just wept all the time or because she might not have been telling the truth. Is this con or thought it wise to say to people, that's the state I'm in.

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       Right, right. Well, it shows

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       her victimhood. She's such a victim. She can't sleep the best is when you see the Huffington post or one of these pieces probably in the Guardian to where it's not just them that are carrying their children. Waking Up, having nightmares about trump. My three year old's having a nightmare about drumming. What can I, what should I tell my three year old? But now he's asking about trump. And again, I know I tend to go to sleep. You know, it's so funny, I, I tweeted this out a couple months ago, but when we're in the middle of the election, uh, you know, all these articles are getting ready to kick kick how trump is affecting kids. This one thing. So I asked, I asked my, my, at the time, I think he was five or six, my nephew, I said, what do you, what do you know about Donald Trump?

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       He looks at me, he's like, he has bad hair and a red tie. And I was like, that's what again, that's what a kid would think. Alright. So I want to talk about your book, but I thought before we get into that, I want to do a little bit more on just sort of language in general and the free speech thing. So when you come to America, because we have some extra protections for now, at least on free speech that you guys across Europe don't have. Do you feel an extra degree of freedom? You don't strike me as someone that ever bites your tongue, but when you come here and know that we have such a great free or do you see something a little different here perhaps? I think you do. I mean, I, I think you just got to separate out between the, what your legal rights are as it were and what the actual practice is these days.

Speaker 2:          00:10:21       Yes. Legally. I mean I'm, there's nothing I say that it's illegal in Britain or Europe. Um, uh, and so I don't particularly feel, you know, and he sort of freer to say anything here because there's nothing I would say here that I wouldn't say there and vice versa. Um, it's true that the, the having a, an amendment to our constitution that she writes this in the law is a useful thing to have a, we of course don't even have a constitution in Britain which has its own advantages and problems. But, uh, but I think these things have to be slightly divorced from the reality of the practice as is at the moment and at the moment, I think your probably in a worse situation than we are in Britain or Europe in relation to speech, um, mainly because of a generation of people who are growing up and the most privileged generation in history who, um, seemed to think that speech is violence and that in response to violence you should be violent. And if you make that leap, then the response or somebody speaking is the them and a or shutting down or to burn a building or to get them killed or whatever you want. And I see that all the time, all over the place.

Speaker 2:          00:11:37       Somebody I know in Holland who died just a couple weeks ago, a lot of people in the press have him demonizing him and his house was attacked two nights ago in Amsterdam. And uh, there's lots of that going on. Loads of loads of target selection. Um, and uh, and I think, I think all this is very, very worried, but I do think that in general, you, you seem in America to make terrible generalization, to be slightly further down the road of certain manias about this. Um, it seems to embed itself more this idea of being wounded or even hurt by, by, by words and, and. Yeah, and you've got all of the saw stuff slightly worse I think.

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       Yeah. Do you think that may be just that in and of itself could be just a cultural thing that Americans kind of scream about things more? We're a little more hysterical. You guys are a little more polite.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       I was asking a friend in New York about this the other day. Uh, it's, I wonder whether the, you know, that thing that you always hear in America, this is the most important election of our lifetime. Every single one. And it's always, I mean, by the way, I'm, I'm fascinated by the language hyperventilation in this country. And I was fascinated by that moment before the last election. My Bill Maher said, look, we called, uh, um, senator mccain, the massage. And so we were just doing it, try to get him, and we were like, no, it wasn't. And then we did. They tell on him and then we realized he wasn't really. Romney wasn't really misogynist, but now this guy is. So I'm fascinated by this thing of basically a lot of sort of chickens coming home to roost in some ways you, you kept running the language down and now you're in this position. But I said to this friend in America the other day, maybe the, the, the as it were, the hyperventilation of politics is one of the ways in which you keep your democracy fresh. We maybe you have to live with that pitch. I mean, I wouldn't particularly want to live at it myself all the time, but perhaps the kind of this is always the most important moment ever is important for this democracy. Maybe it's better than sort of doesn't really matter or never going to be as good as that. Again,

Speaker 3:          00:13:45       that's a real. I'm going to ruminate on that a little bit because I think you can argue it both ways. I think. I mean it's what you're saying. I can see a problem with that level of hysteria all the time. And you're right when, when Bill Maher said that, oh yeah, yeah. The left was saying all these horrible things about mccain. We did it about mccain. We did about romy. This is the real one. Well, you've cried wolf to the point now that. What did you expect to happen in an odd way? Is that a, is that a pro trump argument? Strangely, like he was of course what was going to happen here. You know what I mean? Like you tried it with you try to have some decent sorta center right people, but of course you're going to get this then,

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       right. Maybe, maybe I'm, I'm, I'm resistant myself to the, um, to introducing Donald Trump told me any discussion almost always derails after, um, after almost everything that happens in the UK in recent, the last year or so, say, well, how will this affect Donald Trump? Get stopped talking about to say allow other things in the world to exist as well.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       So you're saying when, I think you're mayor of London was saying, we don't want trump to come here, you'd be okay if trump showed up.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Right. I think that's just saying that Donald Trump has made an official visit to Paris. Yeah. He's made official visits to Germany to a toilet. So quite a lot of allied countries by now. I think. Yeah, I think it's outrageous and I think people should protest if they want to protest. But um, uh, and I remember the protests against George W dot Bush when he came to London and during his presidency and there was some very, very vehement protests. Um, but I don't mind people protesting, of course it's a right, but I just, I think this attempt to say, I mean our most important ally and particularly an important time in our national history in Britain when we need to be re reforming our alliances and renewing them to say f off to the president of your closest allies seems to me to be very, very unwise as well as rude.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       Yeah. Is it one of those things where it's just, it's just the easy answer, you know, just all that I'm here with a will, it shows how good we are. Don't let him hear, but actually what you do, you're actually do damage to probably the most important relationship that these countries have. Some.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       I mean when the mayor of London says we don't want him in London. Yeah. Well while he's in Paris in Berlin, like what have you achieved the best you will, you'll damage among other things, the economic relations between Britain and America. So Nice work, Mr. Nice work.

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       Right? Right. Uh, all right, so we're almost, we're almost at your book. So I thought this is the good transition here. I was listening to, I think it was, you're not your last discussion with Sam Harris, maybe the one before that. And you were guys were talking about language and sort of the slow erosion of what's happening in the west and the rise of Islam. A lot of the, the key stuff that we all kind of talk about and you were talking about how we're going to be arguing about gender pronouns as all of our rights are going to be taken away from us. You said it far more eloquently and with some better adjectives. Uh, but I thought it was a really interesting point that our, our eye is not on the prize in that we're not focusing on what's really important and we're worried about things that are not to say trans gender rights aren't important, but they're not the big picture stuff. How important is all of that? Focusing on the right things?

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       I think it's crucial. I mean, um, and people can be interested in whatever they like, but I also have the right to tell him I think they're wasting their lives. I'm agender pronouns. All of this sort of thing. These, this is there is, by the way, behind all this, something very strange. I started to notice, um, that, uh, all of the fascinating things about this, one of the ones that interest me most is why you get this, this, this introduction to almost every discussion is if we as human beings are sorta solvable things, I find this fascinating. Most of the Trans stuff is you identify that you're the wrong gender at an early stage. By the way. I'm very suspicious about all that. But, um, I think can think of a lot of a feminine young men who shouldn't have drugs even encouraged towards them.

Speaker 3:          00:18:06       Yeah. When you say that you mean you're suspicious of, of the way we're treating them or have the sort of psychological

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       psych, the psychological thing in general, but let's say in a case when somebody actually does genuinely feel that they are in the wrong body and that there is just this awful thing in it. As in so many other discussions at moment of. And if you mix that you, um, be on, you'll be right. And um, I think, no, no, no. Once you sort that out, you'll face all the same problems everyone else faces in their lives. And maybe some new ones, but, um, this, this is, I hear this in the race discussion in America. I hear it in the gay discussion in America, in, in a whole set of them. It's as if it's as if, if we get the formula right, I said, I, I just think this is a fascinating mistake. Um, I don't think we live our lives as solved or solvable beings and um, and we are, we are engaged as me in ticketing in this society, in America in this strange attempt to sort of get it the minute shy, right? And apart from being deeply navel gazing, it seems likely to me that, that we may be missing all the really important things that are going on. I will have this sort of haunting view always that we all feel like we've really sorted out every aspect of Lgbtq rights just as China becomes the most important power in the world. Very interesting.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       Right. Interesting. I think it's a fascinating piece because I was gonna ask. I was going to talk a little bit more about this at the end, but you're gay and I, I asked you in our last interview right at the end, by that fact alone, how much does that give you an extra sensitivity to all of the other things that you're talking about? You have a vested interest. You and I, and I think all of us, I think all humans altogether have a vested interest in keeping the West arrived. But I think as a gay person, it's particularly important that the last places of tolerance in western thought are kept alive.

Speaker 2:          00:20:20       Yes. I have to say my own case. That's not particularly a galvanizing thing. I have to say. Um, I mean I think being gay is kind of boring as a subject in a way because certainly for my generation, I mean we sort of came out, came out and buy your $20. Who wants to keep going on about that a little bit and that, why people did before. But um, you is not a career or life as it were and just being a gay, I mean, not a full time occupation.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Only so many of us can be in reality TV know there's only so many fashion gigs on Bravo and um, I, so I've never,

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       never. It's never particularly influenced by politics and in fact, I may have said this to you before, but I'm, I'm, I'm generally very opposed to the idea of politics being about what am I, myself and how can I get the world to most accommodate itself towards me. Um, I think it's a mistake having politics should be a search for some kind of truth or the best arrangement that allows the truth to occur. And you know, your own involvement in either your uncomfort in it is of importance, but it, I mean, I wouldn't want somebody to say I'm totally into this because I'm fighting for myself. And that's it. In fact, by the way, sorry, since you mentioned it on some of this stuff, on the Islam stuff, for instance, actually the first warning sign to me was not a treatment of gays was dreamed of Jews, which I became sort of increasingly noticing there was a problem a couple of decades ago now. But, um, and it was that,

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       how are you, how are you seeing in British system? I was, I was worried about it because

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       started to notice that there were things that were being said that I thought wouldn't come around again and uh, I'm not Jewish myself, but you can, you can notice these things and um, and not need to as it were, have a personal vested interest in, in it, you know, and I mean, as opposed to one other thing I'd say about is I, I generally think, I mean, the atomization of society into groups with different interests is one of the things that's causing the, all this mess in America at the moment. Um, I don't see why the job of gays should be just to sort of fight for the gays and the job of the Jews would be a fight for the Jews and, and so on and so forth. Uh, I think, I think the idea was sort of looking out for each other's shortly, the point in a republic. And yet that point seems to be lost,

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       right? So is that where this, this intersectional crew has really lost it because they are sort of getting what you're saying that we should be looking out for each other that should bring all of these minority groups together, except instead of that they're vying for most depressed,

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       uh, and most ridiculous and most hyperventilating and all of that. But the intersectionality people, I mean the two big things, one is they are the prime culprits of this thing, of the myth of Solvability, the myth of humans eligibility. If we just, if we get the Rubik's cube right and okay, the Games get that and then we get the traumas and then the people to hand them the nonbinary in this and

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       exactly think exactly the same and speak in exactly the preferential order that we're loud speaking. It will all be fine. Whereas my view is you'll still have every single problem of the world ahead of you. You'll still have to work out what your foreign policy is. A whole load of stuff is coming. But. So that's, that's the first thing. But the second thing is they are obviously apart

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       in American society. I don't think that's too much of an exaggeration because they started at the universities and it's trickling across everything else and I've been having really interesting conversations with people about this in recent years in Europe as well as in America and one of the things I'm sort of slightly confident about here in America is it you do have an answer to it and it's an answer you've had before. You know, the problem of the identity politics thing is we're already starting to see a the apart from being wrong in itself and I think morally suspicious. I'm selfish. You can't stop what you're going to create on it. You can't have racial rights for every group and racial pride rights, every group and always hold back white, you know, pride, whatever. You just, you just can't. At some point it's going to break. You can't keep bashing heterosexual men and not expect at some point that there's going to be some kind of response.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       So if everyone's allowed their group apart from the majority or whatever, then at some point that's going to get nasty and I can see it coming so clearly. We see it now and it's already started and um, the thing is that in America you had the answer to this, which is what Tocqueville a mentioned. It's the deal of being in the republic is you don't do that. You, you deal with each other face to face to face as a citizens. You don't, you don't do it as just people coming to hawk, something in the marketplace, but face to faces, individual citizens in the republic. And this, this is the only way out. Um, but I think there will obviously be some mania before you get back there again. You know, it's funny, you get the, may you get back mainly business our may, uh, you know, it's funny the way I do the show, I try not to talk about individual people too much because I'd always rather focus on the ideas.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       But as you're saying this, I'm thinking of something very specifically that Linda Sarsour who I'm sure you're. No, I spent an evening with us also in Brooklyn. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Can I, I'd tell you, we got on roaring. Lee and I sent some territory that was a bit of sexual tension in the room and uh, avoidable, but no, the, uh, uh, the fact is actually she, um, we're asked to debate the CROC fandom word Islamophobia at the Brooklyn Art Museum. And I like a challenge and uh, um, I think our mutual friend, lion has. Jada was also meant to be there, but I, but, uh, oh, um, various things happened. The garland shooting happened and it was decided that it wasn't safe a yarn. I still did it and things. But uh, yeah, the whole thing that they started off with the other side sort of giggling about the fact that they couldn't even turn up, you know, it was all using it against her and as I ions afraid of anybody

Speaker 2:          00:26:45       and yeah. And I say yes. I encountered him before she became, as it were, infamous, and I thought she was a very nasty, very bitter, very on America. And actually, um, uh, I just say that because she, she knows like all demagogues, how to introduce herself and introduced herself to sort of proud brooklynite, proud American and a proud Palestinian, et cetera, et cetera. And I thought an interesting order, but it was clear that she sort of really hated America or at least hates America that exists currently because it was me that ended up having to explain to the audience that for instance, the New York police don't just go around persecuting Muslims, you know, it just willful misrepresentation of, of the American authorities at every turn. So I thought she was very dishonest, very unpleasant. And, but I mean I've come across her type all my life.

Speaker 3:          00:27:36       Yeah. And the only reason I mentioned her is because of what you said previously, which really was about assimilation, that the whole point of America is to assimilate. I don't know if you saw that speech she gave about two months ago where she called for a g high and then suddenly the left was defending the word gi and the white supremacists in the White House and all that. But I thought the key part of it put jihad aside, put white supremacy aside. The key part was when she said, we're not here to assimilate thought what a, that is the antithesis of the American project, this amazing melting pot that we have where we've done for the most part, multicultural, right. Multiculturalism, right? Where Europe has failed in a lot of ways. And she was saying, no, no, no, absolutely. And I thought that was more dangerous than the others. Absolutely. Of course. I mean, yeah, as you say about him, he put aside. Yeah. The fantastical idea of what she was suggesting was, you know, you sort of have a, a jihad by kind of going and just really in a struggling. And I'm just struggling in front of this Israeli. I'm having a timeline. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:37       Um, that, uh, yeah. This is, this is what I recognize is the night we met. I mean, she really doesn't like this country, by the way. I mean, we will have a problem by that. It was what you, what you do about that. Um, uh, it seems to me she's a sort of very rabid sectarian sort of Palestinian nationalist who happens to live in Brooklyn. I'm a, but I mean really what you do about it is that people identified that recognize it and called it out 40. It was what it is and they just aren't very many people to do that. So I mean, you know, we all take sort of baby steps on this. Don't we know is you say, you know, you end up with a left or defending this and actually why don't you just say, look, she's not speaking as a critic of our society who wants to sort of mildly improve it. She's speaking as an opponent of our society because she doesn't like it. Now I've encountered this, I say all my life and my opponents and the very close enemies I've made in Britain and across Europe, a certain type of person of that ilk who clearly as an opponent of the society, they don't like it. And of course, among other things, or you can do is point a to point out then is to say, you know, amazing

Speaker 3:          00:29:50       your hair really, isn't it amazing? Yeah. And that's the catch 22 of what we've got in the west, right, where we're going to have to let in all sorts of voices. That's, that's the beauty of this thing. And it also creates a little bit of the brand. All right, let's talk about your book. First off, I love the title, the strange death of Europe. I thought using the adjective strange was particularly interesting. Why didn't you choose the word strange, not slow or a series of other things that you could have used first is,

Speaker 2:          00:30:22       which not many readers will get to a slightly known history textbook. I've got strange death of liberal England, which described the decline of the Liberal Party in the early part of the 20th century. But there's no sort of, isn't needed it, it was. No, it. Although there is a slight similarity. Um, yeah. Is a really a viral thing. Is, is just. It is odd. I mean it's, it's a curious way to go. Um, and I think if you'd have said to anyone have one or two generations ago, this will be what Europe's issues would be in the 21st century that basically it couldn't, couldn't find any way not to just allow the world to walk in and join them that, um, that, those generations would have been surprised. And uh, so yes it is, it is strange. It's a night, but I tried to explain why and I, and in order to explain it, I tried to explain it from not just from the, you know, the sort of firsthand accounts and the statistics and all that sort of thing, but, but the deeper philosophical reasons why this is happening, I think that's lots of books do bits of that, but I want to just say, look, this is the whole overall picture.

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       This is, this is what we're actually living through and this is why.

Speaker 3:          00:31:36       Yeah. So the subtitle is immigration identity and Islam. Uh, does that order have any meaning to you in the way you phrase those? It,

Speaker 2:          00:31:47       Kelly? I mean, it, it centers on the 2015 migration crisis when Angela Merkel opened the doors of Europe and, um, couldn't really find a way to shut them again. Um, but they'd already been open for a long time as I explained. I'm no, I mean it's, uh, these, these are the three massive things that, uh, that, uh, that are preoccupying I think not just Europe, Europeans at the moment, the immigration crisis, whether publics of Europe just wanted to stop all across the continent. All the polls all show the same thing. The public wanted to slow down or stop. Uh, so that's the immigration better at the, uh, identity bit of it is a very, very painful thing. Which, you know, people aren't very good at talking about. Maybe I'm not very good at talking about it, but I think it's just their underlying everything. What is this thing?

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       What is it a European who, who can be European? Can anyone be a. and is Europe a home for the people who've been in Europe or is it for anyone in the world he wants to move in and call it home is a very, very big question. These are big. And then the third one of that is the Islam, but which I mentioned because it's obviously the sharp has specified. There's a, you can have somebody move in. I know you can have a Nigerian Christian move into a, um, a bit of the south of England and uh, they will have issues I bring as everyone does. They will have their own ideas as everyone does their own culture that they've walked in from and everyone does. Um, but, uh, it would be the person of another background for another community and another faith who would be coming in with the issues that are really starting to northern Europe.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       We, um, we find this very hard to talk about and uh, it, it, it's getting easier very, very slowly. But, you know, our big worry is we've not been great on the integration. All of our leaders say this, all the European politicians admit this now, but the bit that is worrying us is Islam bit because I think there's now a general awareness that may be this is the bit we can't digest or we're finding it unusually difficult to digest and incorporate A. I don't say it's impossible by the way. I just think for all sorts of reasons. It's proving very hard in May in the years ahead proved far worse.

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       So I know that you often make the distinction like most educated people, you make the distinction between Islam as a set of ideas, as any religion is simply a set of ideas versus Muslim as as possible. In this case, do you think that there is something unique? I mean this is always what triggers my friends on the left. If you say that there is something unique about the set of ideas of Islam that is different than the set of ideas. If we just take the big three monotheistic once that is different than the set of ideas of Judaism or Christianity or at least how their practice I think is the more operative part because you can look through all the books and there's plenty of bad stuff in the old testament. Okay. Um, do you at the, at the end of this, do you believe that it's just incompatible that this set of ideas is incompatible with the set of ideas that the west is trying to preserve?

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       I think, I think unreformed Islam presents a very significant values challenge and it's probably not reconcilable if, if we have, as it were, the Islam of, uh, most Muslim countries, it's very hard to see how that's doable. Um, uh, I think all of this is very painful, isn't it? Because first of all, we live in any case in an age of relativism already were for perfectly good reasons. Sometimes, you know, we sort of pretend there's all sorts of the same, you know, like I, I might be a Muslim, you know, you might be a Christian, she does yoga and it all comes out in the wash. Pretty much the same and I just think that to begin with, that's obviously not true. I mean it's very strange to, to want to concentrate on everything other than the premises and origins of a belief structure. Um, and as I've often said, stop me if I've said this to you before, but I mean, you know, there are all sorts of problems in the Christian religion and in Christian history, but as I've often said, you know what, I'm just carrying out the thought experiment that instead of getting up at the sermon on the mount and saying, you know, love they neighbor and you know, forgive me, we're endlessly.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       Jesus had said, if your brother offends you, chop his head off. Would Christianity's history have been more bloody or less bloody. I think we'd all agree it's going to be more and find the job behind the tree. Yeah, if Jesus had gone, but if Jesus had gone into the whole like, fine, you know, the behind the train slaughter him, um, whatever the context, right? And then there would be even more Christian antisemitism and then there has been historically. So I just think these things matter and all this is very, very painful for reasons that I go in during some depth in the book, which is that in recent years we, in countries like Britain and I think in America have had the luxury of sort of describing ourselves in terms of, among other things have been universal, but what we have, it should also be universal.

Speaker 2:          00:37:13       Now this is a very big, this is always a debate within liberalism of course is liberalism, something we have or something we, as it were, expound and, and, and, and expand. Um, and in recent years I think that a certain moroseness has landed across Europe, among other things, uh, because of a growing awareness. Maybe what we have is very unusual and that we have become disassociated from the roots in which, what we enjoy a group and this, this is a problem. There's a, uh, German uh, uh, legal ferris, I quote in the book, who puts this as one of the central conundrum for Europe. Is it possible? Is it possible that the thing we're enjoying and living through a can survive without the connection to its roots? And I, I believe that the roots of the West and of Europe in particular fairly clear and it's a combination of things.

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       It's the inheritance from ancient Greece and ancient Rome. It's obviously the inheritance of the Christian civilization that washed through the, throughout the continent. And then the refining fire, the enlightenments and skepticism and all these things. And of course we would go on endlessly about the other things that have added to it. But broadly speaking, that is what made Europe Europe and what made a European a European. They breathe this, this, uh, um, but, but, but the sort of the last man at the end of that, which I fear modern Europeans are, is, is in this strange position of I'm finding it hard to even identify where he and she has coming from, let alone being able to return to those roots and nurture them. Because we all have, I have, I'm sure you have a conflicted set of views about this, um, you know, is it necessary for other people to believe those of us who had, who, who have sometimes been tempted to hope that, for instance, skepticism is enough constantly a depressed by the discovery that for instance, somebody may be a free thinker about God and that's it for free thinking point of view. Yeah. From then on it's tribal away and um, you know, we're all, we're all living through this, but it's for Europe. I think that the combination of a historically unprecedented move into people in the continent at the same time that this sort of breakdown of what we are ourselves is going on is a, is a fatal, fatal thing.

Speaker 3:          00:39:48       So there's a lot there that I want to hit. But I was what you said right at the beginning, which is that if Islam, if unreformed or not allowed to reform. So I think that's particularly interesting for the space that you and I sort of exist in because I've many allies who are reformers. I'm not just so I have allies that are ex Muslim, I have allies that are Muslim and many, many people that I've interviewed that you know, but they're are treated horribly, horribly and there and every time they're allowed to get a platform or it's actually by the evil conservatives were all the things that people who don't like me, you'll say about me or say about you or any of that stuff that makes the job a good jillion times harder.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       I say in the book towards the end when I tried to rouse myself some prognostications about all this, that this is the worst possible sign. I'm not just that the people that we might talk about in these terms are so few and between us, you and I might have them in our phone books. Not just that, but who were the ones that are most under, under pressure and under risk. They really are the, they're the good guys to say that this is a tragedy for Islam is obvious, but he's always been my view that we should try to avoid making ourselves a casualty of Islams, civil, internal strife. And, uh, I think we haven't done that. I think we've spent recent decades almost deliberately running towards the fight. Didn't need to involve us so that the tragedy of Islam becomes the tragedy of the West as well.

Speaker 2:          00:41:24       I hope this could be avoided, but I think it calmed. And I think that as I say, the worst possible sign for the future is that it's a, you know, having dabbled summit in Germany who lives under protection measure no wise who comes in for the grief in the UK. It's a young cle who followed the Dutch integration ideal more than anyone who ends up having to leave Holland. These are very, very bad signs, you know, you can still live openly as a, you know, Hammer has military commander in London. Your life's fine. You'll be celebrated in some ways, right? I mean this is a huge trump. All right, so let's, let's knock out each one of these words. We've sort of hit that I think a bit of each one already on the immigration front when you said that Merkel just opened the doors.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       I see a lot of different stuff written about her that she either intentionally, you know, you get sort of the conspiracy people that she wanted to destroy Europe or she hates her own country and all this stuff. I try not to impune everyone's motives, but when this happened in 2015 and there was this combination of refugees and immigrants and migrants and nobody could figure out what was happening and we saw videos of people just thousands of people just running across borders and all of this stuff and an odd amount of them that seemed to be men in their twenties and not women and children and all that, which implies that they're often migrants looking for work and figures in the front takes. The majority of the people became in 2015 have no right to be in Europe, which is, which is fascinating. And somehow, even if you say that you'll be labeled whatever, but what do you think her intention was in 2015?

Speaker 2:          00:42:59       This is why I tried to go back to the beginning, not just with history but also with the philosophy on this. Um, I don't impute, you know, terrible motives to her. I think she was blackmailed by history, was facing a truly terrible humanitarian crisis, which was undoubtedly going on and I said this in the face and I travel around and speak to many, many migrants from all over the world. I've been to many of the countries they fled from, but I also go to speak to them in the countries that they arrive into and speak to them in the camps and certainly have met and listened to more migrants. And I think any of my critics, um, but, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's easy to, uh, uh, to exaggerate the ease of the situation that she faced or the ease of the solution to it.

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       And, and I think that shouldn't be done. It was a genuine crisis. It remains a genuine crisis and the biggest imaginable moral question. Um, so we also know that at the moment that she made the decision in 2015 to basically suspend all border controls. Uh, I suggested in my book, but since my book has come out, it's already now being confirmed by somebody who was with her at the time that what happened and in particular was somebody said to Merkel, we cannot have German border guards repelling migrants and the photos go around the world, right? So this is just condemned because of history. It's what is what a one friends for us, because the second career of adult Hitler, it's an ugly way of looking at it, but it's, it's not entirely implausible. Uh, this is, this is just, this is another go around this terrible, terrible history and past.

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       But, uh, you know, it's not conspiracy. I show in the book how much. It's more what we call in England, cockup. I've always tended towards a cookout view of history because if you see politics up close as I have done quite a bit throughout my life, um, you know, that it's not really people pursuing grant sort of schemes. Really. It's people who haven't done the job before because you can't and there is no qualification that gets you in position beforehand. Um, and trying to deal with not longterm things, but tomorrow morning's headlines and media reaction the next day. And they, they, they, they drowned below the surface of this babble. That's how politics happens these days.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       Right? Which is not the way that both sides talk about politics they wanted, they want to make it seem like the other side has constantly this grand plan and everything's going according to plan. Or as I said in the book,

Speaker 2:          00:45:41       the um, every single thing we thought would happen didn't happen. And nothing that has happened was expected. I'd go back to the fifties, you know, the guest workers who were the first people who came in after the war of first migrant waves into Europe from Turkey and elsewhere as Merkel herself said in 2010, we expected them to go home. Incredible mockup. Yeah. Uh, but then we expect them to go ahead and then it didn't. Of course, they, they wanted having tasted first world economics and among other things they wanted to bring their families. And of course, and if you have your families, you have children and you enter the schooling system and then you'll need healthcare and then you'll need it isn't element,

Speaker 3:          00:46:21       especially if the state's giving you a lot of those things.

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       And uh, and that's why we are where we are, where we are, where, um, where, uh, you know, the 2011 census identified people who call themselves white British on the sensors as a minority in London, minority in 23 out of 33 London burroughs. It's why all the demographic projections from across the continent, um, show Europeans, uh, I think not to overstate it, losing the place they had to call home or at least becoming a minority in it. And this, you know, there are some people talk about that in the, in the sort of language of a, Haha, the empire strikes back, now you're getting a taste of it. You went round the world and now the world's come to you. And uh, among other things, I warn those people, just be careful of that language, the language of punishment. Because if the language of that is, as it were, the punishment for colonialism, then down the road you'll create a movement will say, well, we managed to end colonialism.

Speaker 3:          00:47:21       Yeah. And then they'll come for you to no matter no matter what you do. So with that being said, so the identity part then is, is really inextricably linked to this. When you see the sort of what seems to be the rising white identity and movement or European identitarian movement or, or whatever, what do you, what do you make of it? Do you view it purely as the natural reaction to this? Is there anything legitimate out of that? Are there parts that are not racist or is it truly based in racist?

Speaker 2:          00:47:51       I'm, I'm very, very worried about this moment. I have to say very, very worried. Um, if you have people saying, I'm proud of the color of my skin because it's just skin color. Of course there'll be some people who'll do the opposite. I am. Somebody said to me the other day and then it's, the question is, are you proud of being white? And I said, no, of course not. Why would I be proud of pigmentation? But I then turned around and said, no, but I'm, if you asked me if I am proud of my coach, I would say of course, but it's something else. And that I, I, um, it's not really about pride and the couch, I, I, some years ago I wrote a piece about this for book the Prime Minister Gordon Brown was editing on Britishness. And I said, I didn't think of these things in terms of patriotism.

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       I think it would, in terms of gratitude. I feel gratitude before I've been lucky enough to be born into A. I'd love it if other people who wanted to be part of it became a part of it. And I think they can and I think it shouldn't be and can't be racially exclusionary. I mean it's madness, but it's a madness. It seems to me that some people will be falling into by being pushed and by being ignorant and, and other things. But you know, I come back to this thing, there will be some people who will, and I've, I've found this a lot in conversations across the continent in the last year or two, there will be people who will grab a bit of the identity thing for themselves, for tactical reasons. We will get to this goal and we'll use a dishonest tactic just like you're using it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:29       Yeah. And there'll be other people who will say, no, it's not just a tactic is what I, it's what I feel is what I believe. Um, I just strongly urge people not to go down that route, strongly urge them not to go down the route of identifying by an accident or skin pigmentation. But to say if you, if you want to talk in terms of values and in terms of civilization and of culture, you cannot make it exclusionary like that. But the point about this is it's you, that, that can only be that it's the, as it were, white young guy who's told that you've also got to tell it to the angry young black demagogue who's telling people have their own skin color to isolate and congregate around around race. It's got, it's got everyone's got to, you know, to, to make the deal as it were on this, um, but I just am filled with, with, you know, concerned about this

Speaker 3:          00:50:37       and that probably has a little something to do with the word strange because it seems to me that it's possible that the ship has already sailed on this perhaps more in Europe than in America because you guys had an integration problem already from, which is finally being acknowledged now. But then you also have this new set of people. So even if everything was fantastic with all the people that were there and all the integration before 2015, what do you even do with just the new set of problem?

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       Let me give you an example. By the way, the, um, uh, in Scotland there's a exists small amount now, but a Catholic Protestant mainly centered around football supporting Celtic Rangers. Uh, we, they go by a religious affiliation still still. Yeah. That's because of a movement of Catholics from Ireland and Scotland a long time ago. Yeah. Let me give you another example. I had a very dear friend who died recently who was a brilliant, very, very brave man, uncle Shawn Callahan, who was a double agent within the IRA, the troubles. And He, uh, he got up to the top of the IRA command and he was informing all the time to the Irish state and saved many, many lives. Was an extraordinary, extraordinary man. Uh, I wrote an obituary for him and others of his friends did one of the most negative. In fact, one of the only negative pieces of our short was in the Boston Globe who referred to him as a, as a, as a grass, as somebody who, after you've come out and written his memoir, came to Hawk them around America.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       Not just selling a book on writing but hawking a book. Why would that appear in the Boston Globe only because a very long time ago, a large number of people from Ireland arrived in this country and settled in Boston and held onto their Irish identity and some of them have held on to a belief that the IRA, a murderess, murderess sectarian gang, whereas where their people. So all these centuries later, um, uh, the attitude and the Boston Globe, when a man who risked his life to save many, many other people's lives dies and he's to attack him basically as a grass and a snitch. Okay. That's the movement of Catholic Irish people into America who on earth, things that when you bring the entire developing world into Europe, including very, very large numbers of young men from the Muslim world, that this is going to be sorted out by next February. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:18       You know, or you know, roughly this time next year. So does this show, you know, I use the phrase lazy thinking a lot, but maybe that's not the right way. It shows an inability to think, you know, what you said about Merkel in 2010. It's like, well, we thought they were going to leave. That's not lazy thinking. That's man. Did you even think. I mean, you know, it's pretty good in Germany, you know, if you let people in. Is there ever been a self imposed group of people that left a western country to go back to Iraq? I don't think so. Very uncommon know

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       of course, once people, once people realize that the economics works better in Europe, doesn't in sub Saharan Africa, of course, of course they come, but we. I mean we're, we're just so torn about this and I think we have to rouse ourselves to more than moroseness. We're talking about it. It seems to me because we were not sure why on the. I'm pretty sure why, but as counselors, we're not entirely sure why it should be our right to keep anyone out. I'm not here. There's obviously an American. America has a different issue. Of course it's an American. It's legitimate to say America is a nation of immigrants. It's not legitimate to say that about Britain. It just isn't. Hasn't been delivered late 20th century. A Nation of immigrants and they're very, very static population. Even the Norman Conquest, the thousand years ago shifted the population by about five percent in the UK. So, um, I understand that in America, the whole thing to do with immigration is a bit harder. People feel they're talking not about them, but about you or me and in Europe, that, that, that is a bit of the case. Now, there are people who talk in those terms, but there's also. There's also just this additional thing of, by what? Right? By what? Right? Would I be allowed to say? Anyone can come. Now, I think there are all sorts of ways you argue the law

Speaker 3:          00:55:15       matter shouldn't matter. The difference between legal and illegal is everything. Look, I'm not a Canadian. Why is that? Because we have a border. That means that a Canadian has to obey the laws of Canada and I have to obey the laws of the United States. People think that even in of itself, but that's somehow controversial.

Speaker 1:          00:55:32       We, by the way, what a beautiful thing. It's just been watching Justin Trudeau have to face. It's so easy for politicians in Europe. We've seen a lot, you've seen it here in America. Canadians have seen it. It's so easy to grandstand or this let them in a open the doors because when the effects happen, hopefully you'll be out of power and you'll be retired somewhere in a nice area with lots of people like you, which was your dirty little secret. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:56:00       He'll move to New Zealand or something. Isn't that where they all moving in New Zealand?

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       Um, but, but yeah, Trudeau is on the qb sort of berated and morally grandstanding. And then of course when there's movement of people from America across the Canadian border, uh, they start to get worried. A Bill Gates, by the way, at the beginning of the migrant crisis, said, gee, that America should take in the same proportion of migrants that year as Germany to Germany took in an extra two percent of its population in one year alone. Uh, uh, and Bill Gates said we should take in the same numbers in, in Germany. It has Germany did in, in America. Uh, well, interesting enough. Only a couple of months ago, Bill Gates, I did a reverse ferret on that. Actually, no, he said he certainly in a set of remarks that if Germany continues like this, it's going to destroy it. Well, imagine if Bill Gates, instead of being the world's richest man had been in charge of anything, uh, uh, then you'd have gone through what Germany is going through and it would have vastly outlasted him as this will outlast Merkel and all of us.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       So the issue, it seems to me the two things that I can point out, one is demanding with our political leaders in particular, think through things beyond the two year electoral cycle or the four year electoral cycle, or more importantly, just more of a morning's headlines. You might have a bad mornings news. It's a lot better than fucking up your country. It's a lot better. It really is. And the second thing about this is we have to develop the ability to have an adult discussion about these things that recognizes it's not between, you know, your, for the migrants. I'm against them or you know, uh, um, your Churchill, I'm Hitler, your chamberlain, your Hitler. Just to have the discussion on recognizing these are different opinions about our future and the and the, you know, I say toward the end of the book that we have the tools for doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:58:04       Aristotle showed us a long time ago, this is just a competition between virtues. Angola, Merkel very understandably felt the human virtue of mercy to be merciful towards people who are trying to come and I say yes, but there is another virtue competing with that which is the virtue of justice, not just justice for the people of the world wanting to come and have a better life, but justice for the peoples of Europe. If you have the discussion on those terms between competing virtues, not doing good and evil right and wrong. Churchill, Hitler, me, good. You not see, then you might be able to get somewhere and Mr Gresham, but it's as if we've sort of wounded ourselves before even starting at the start line. So as to people that try to engage in that. I think that's what we consistently try to do. And I see you debating all sorts of people from every walk of life. Yeah, I have a promiscuous debating debate. It basically everywhere, everyone, some people are like, you know, now in prison, not because I had debated and so much they were prosecuting it, but I mean, you know, I've debated lots of people who I'm sure you've sent a couple of people to mental institutions for after they've had to deal with your wit that it's not that. I mean, I definitely, if, if somebody is, is, uh, out in the general public

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       and has a platform and they wanted to be, I've always had the view, yes. That's not sale debate anyone by the way. Sometimes people go, oh yeah, you wouldn't debate me.

Speaker 3:          00:59:31       I think you've got to twitter followers and you're nuts. Blue Fox on twitter. You're like, Xena, warrior princess. No, that woman, she really wants to debate. I'm alright. I think, I think we got a nice holistic piece of this year. Um, so I wanted to shift altogether to end this on a, on a, something somewhat on lifting, uplifting as someone that does all this, that you speak about this stuff. You deeply care about this stuff. I, you know, I worry about this stuff constantly be wowed me staring off into nothing in the middle of the day and I'm literally worried about the fate of the Western world. You know, I, I wish I was playing video games again as much as I used to, but yeah, I lost you on the video game thing. Yeah. But what, what do you do for fun? What do you do to just forget all this stuff and just enjoy yourself and be human?

Speaker 2:          01:00:24       Oh Gosh, I.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       well, I know you don't like this type of question because this is.

Speaker 2:          01:00:28       Well, I'm, I'm careful about private matters. Um, I, I'm very happily in a relationship with many years. A lot of my family. I've got wonderful friends. I see them a lot. Um, I to relax. I mean, I read, I read all the time, uh, and not just good, it's enjoyable, but because it's just, I'm just endlessly learning and thinking and so it's just so stimulating sometimes when you have that thing of what I described as catching up with true, you'd always known was there, um, the thrill of recognition that you get from reading that I think is harder to find in video games or television. All right, so, you know, so I do a lot of reading

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       as I'll shift this a little then. So what would you say more importantly than that, to the, to the person that's watching this, the type of email that I get all the time, the person that is just a regular person, you know, working a regular job that sees these problems, that hears you, that is not a bigot and is not a racist, but he's genuinely afraid of doing what you do every which is say what you think that they're genuinely afraid of. Just putting their thoughts out there, be it on social media or be it. It's getting to the point where they're afraid to talk to their own spouses about what, what, what could you say to somebody to give them a little bit of a boost on that?

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       I tell you what, the, the, the water's not as cold as people say. It really isn't. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, it's, it's hard. This one isn't it? Because if you, there has been a lot of focus on the negatives. Certainly some of the things we're talking about today in recent years and there's a sort of growing feeling of actually wanting to previous recent inferior as a google guy is a demonstration. The more that stuff

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       happens, the more that people keep down. Um, and um, it's very hard to. I mean, you can't be brave for other people. You can't tell other people, you know, speak up. But, uh, I think we can encourage each other to. I mean, um, you know, sometimes people approach me in a sort of just want to not use. Must be pretty hard for you to live good. No, it's great. I'm like, I have cocktails. My friends, I, I go to concerts, I read things I want, I enjoy the music, I love and, and I travel where I live and I go all over the world and we're not going to get any extra security tonight already. I hope we're going to beverly hills. I think we'll probably be friends. We pick a fight with anyone today, but no, I am A. I mean it's either you sit up and there's a sort of exaggerate.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       Yeah, that's why I'm asking you this question because I do think it's partly in people's mind. You start speaking then you realize. Yeah, I mean somebody said some bad stuff about me, but I'm still here. Yeah, exactly. So people, some are quite a lot of the time, young journalists and things saying you, I'd really like to write this but you know, I don't know. And all this sort of thing and you know, get this. Let just, just see and just write it. And um, I mean no one ever awarded somebody for a career in journalism the way they said nothing over. There are some writers in New York Times you could, you could say, but um, uh, you know, you just just, just do it. And if it does, what? I'm very lucky in that I've spent my career saying what I think and being able to earn a living precariously but successfully and uh, I feel like I can write for almost any of the newspapers I want to write for and almost all of them will have me.

Speaker 1:          01:04:08       And uh, I love writing for the range of them and I'm very lucky to do this, but it's not like I'm, it's not like that's rare. I mean, I mean it's, it's still legal to say what you think and um, and so I, I just hate it when people say, I really admire you for saying what you're thinking here, what the hell do you do? And, um, but he said it's only that we all, we all get used to the idea and just, sorry, just one other thing, which is just about you. But I find myself more and more tolerant of people's opinions, just more and more tolerant of it. I mean, I see, I see people driving themselves mad and I just sort of thing. I mean there are some things like if somebody, you know, I discovered they were into, you know, kitty fiddling or something and I'd have something to say to them, but pretty much, you know, on politics and all sorts of other things I find myself like, oh, that's interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       Why do you think that? And um, and you know, it's fascinating and who would want to keep all of that down and um, you know, as long as we agree on the parameters, as long as we agree that, you know, we don't shoot on the beach hut, which is obviously up for negotiation, it seems at the moment. But as long as we don't do that, then what's the problem? Just just speak. They don't expect somebody else to do it for you. I don't, don't, don't siphon it off like it's a wing of government, like the free speech center. This is for you to do for us to do for everyone.

Speaker 3:          01:05:39       That's how you ended interview. Douglas Murray is on the twitter. He is. I've just been informed via the teleprompter. You're a thousand followers away from 100,000, is that right? No. You're monitoring this constantly. Yeah. Must have these. I think we can get you there. Should I do something like if I get 100,000 followers, I'll do something. What would you do? I tend to know who received. Discussing. Well, this guys head over. Greg's right for more on Douglas. Follow him on twitter. He doesn't care that much, but I want the man to get to 100,000. It's Douglas. Kay Marie. Thanks.
