Speaker 1:          00:00:05       In case you've been hiding under a rock or if you just don't have twitter, bless your heart. Kanye West made his return to the platform and proceeded to crack the Internet with seven dirty words, which would've put even George Carlin to shame. Last Saturday. Kanye tweeted, I love the way candace owens thinks. If you don't know candice. Oh, and she's a black conservative woman who originally went under the Youtube Moniker, red pill, black candace caught fire online around the summer of 2017, and my interview with her in which we discussed her evolution from a lefty to a conservative, is one of the moments that really put her on the map. It was the first time that she had been able to explain herself in her own words in a long form conversational setting. I don't want to rehash the whole thing right now, but candace is no stranger to controversy and you may remember that infamous debate that I had with candice and Blair white late last year.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       The whole thing was a debacle. I make no bones about it, but hashtag save. Dave trended on twitter to who might've complained 2018 has already been a huge year for candice as she was hired as communications director for turning point USA, the largest conservative college group in America. Since then, she's been touring the country with Charlie Kirk, talking to young people, particularly young black people as why they should embrace the victim mentality rather than the victim mentality. This is included directly attacking the black lives matter movement as well as democratic policies, which candice argues has decimated the black family and the black community. Just last week, candice, Charlie and I spoke at Berkeley to a wild crowd. I'm proud to say that we had agreements and we had disagreements and even though our styles are different, no doubt, candice certainly goes for the juggler more than I do.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       I always enjoyed doing events with her and seeing her evolve politically. Something I know a bit about myself. She's learning as she goes and as she said to me in our interview, if I had swallowed the red pill, then she had snorted it. Beyond any of the politics though, candice is a friend and our differences don't define us. They actually bring us together. All right. Back to Connie for a second. Beyond the headlines, I don't know a ton about him, although I'm obviously aware enough to recognize what a transcending cultural figure he is. Not only is he hugely successful in the music world, he has a hugely successful fashion line and he's married to Kim Kardashians who has her own empire. You may not like the guy for whatever reason, but make no mistake. He is an absolute mogul. I may not like or even respect the influence that celebrities have over culture these days, but Kanye is truly someone who can move people's minds with what he raps or with what he tweets.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       This is exactly what happened with these seven words. Immediately after Connie's tweet in supportive candice, the Internet went ablaze twitter moments. Lead story was about Kanye support for far right. Candice Owens. Candice was called Anti Gay and racist. Something I'm still confused about as she's had dinner here with me and my husband at our home where her antiganey has never seemed to leak out as racist. There's nothing like a white lefty telling a black person who doesn't think as they demand that they do, that the black person is the actual racist against their own race. Irony is truly dead. Folks. On Monday this week, Kanye refused to back down despite hysterics from the media. He tweeted out a bunch of videos by another form of Rubin report. Guess bestselling author and Dober creators, Scott Adams. In essence, these videos were Scott talking about what a free thinker Kanye is. That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       Next thing you know, the usual suspects like buzzfeed media at the daily beast and others were labeling Scott Adams as far right. We've seen the script a million times before with anyone who dare challenge leftist Orthodoxy, be it candice Scott Column, Moriarity, Jordan Peterson, or even little old me when mainstream media has moved so far left that this wide collection of people are all smeared with the same charges of far right racism. You know that the overton window hasn't just shifted, it's shattered. The authors of these pieces aren't journalists, they're activists, or as candace says, they are a journalist there hitman. To recap, we have a new player in Kansas who is fearlessly saying how she believes that the Democrats have used the black community for decades and that the victimhood mentality of the left is the root of this problem. This by the way, is similar to what plenty of other conservatives have been saying for years, and yes, this includes even black conservatives like my former guests, Larry elder and Thomas Soul.

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       The voices of black conservatives and others espousing similar ideas has been largely ignored by the mainstream media. However, and that is exactly why everyone is freaking out about his tweets. He just gave oxygen to a set of ideas that the Democrats and the mainstream media don't want you to hear, and since they've controlled the narrative for so long, they've relied on the usual smears of racism, homophobia, and bigotry. Instead of strengthening their own ideas. Your ideas get fat and lazy when you don't have to work them out because you've owned the narrative for so long. This is where the modern left finds itself right now. If Kansas, his views are far right, then that means that about 40 percent of America, if not more, falls into that category. I do want to address a different lurking danger here. However, I know candace and I believe her to be forthright and passionate as she figures this all out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       I obviously don't know Kanye nor any of his political beliefs, so we have an interesting match here where candice is now the rocket and Kanye is the jet fuel. If candice doesn't do the intellectual work to really figure out what she believes and why she believes it all the while being under the insane microscope of the media that's going to be praying for her to fail, well then the rocket will be faulty and this experiment will blow up. What if Kanye says something absolutely crazy tomorrow, which is not only possible, it's probable or something that's counter to everything else that can just believes he's been known to stir the pot, and I can only assume that something like that will happen either intentionally or by mistake. Does her rocket ship run out of fuel in midflight? Where does that leave this incredible momentum over the past year when I've talked to people like Eric and Bret Weinstein, Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Larry Elder, Thomas Soul, and many others.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       What I'm most impressed by is how complete their outlook on politics and more broadly on life is they don't jump from conclusion to conclusion. Depending on the political climate. They try to really understand what they fundamentally think. So as new issues arise, they're responses are complete rather than conflicted. This is something I've really tried to incorporate into my thinking and something that I know many of you are trying to do as well. This will also be. Candice is challenged now and I think she's up to it, but only she could decide that for herself. It blows my mind that every conversation we have in this room seems to become more and more relevant as time goes by. For All I know, we'll have Kanye in that guest seat soon enough, whether he is just rocket fuel to boost ideas or is he the rocket ship that will get us to the solutions remains to be seen but make no mistake. The issues around free speech, political correctness, and the uncomfortable truths that might be the answers to those questions have just been leveled up. Are the players ready for the next level? We'll soon find out

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       joining me today as a national security expert, the best selling author of defeating Jihad, and a former. I'll be at brief strategists to president trump, Dr Sebastian Gorka. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me, David. I'm happy to have you here. Sara. First off that voice, you have a very. Have you ever done any voice over work at all? Um, it's don't tell anybody, but it's my dream. What I wrote, defeating Jihad. I asked about the audio book. I said, I'm going to get to do the audio book right by publishers. You couldn't do the prologue. Then we'll get a pro. I was crushed. So the next book coming out in June. Why we fight? I'm sorry if you're listening to margie. I'm doing so. I really can't believe that. So first off, we have already spent a good amount of time talking about star wars, so very impressed.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       Your Green Room and that post. I'd never seen that in the quarry posted before on the LP, so I'm impressed. That is the original 1977 poster. I wonder, do you think, because we're obviously going to talk a lot about national security and foreign policy and all that, do you think any of your thoughts related to foreign policy had anything to do with Star Wars? Because I do think at some level some of the way I view the world has been shaped by some of the Lore and all the. I'm not sure if it's causing effect but. But absolutely in terms of good and evil. I mean totally. I mean, the first three movies are about good versus evil before they become this social justice warrior absurdity. So yeah, sure. I mean, but as much being the son

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       of people who lived on the Nazi and then communist dictatorship that these things kind of flow together so

Speaker 4:          00:09:02       or is and growing up under the child with people who escaped from dictatorship. Right. There you go. All right, so you are in California because you were talking to a couple conservative groups here in California. People don't believe that conservative groups could exist in California, but I mentioned to you before we just had governor John Casick on, he was talking with Arnold Schwartzenegger at some conservative groups here in California. So are, it seems like something is happening in California.

Speaker 3:          00:09:30       I don't live here, but I come in and out to do these events. Uh, something's happening. So something clearly is happening. Um, the energy I felt, uh, the, uh, the events here is like the energy I feel at events in Virginia, um, or, or elsewhere, like Texas. And there's a commonality. Whoever you speak to, they keep mentioning the same things. They talk about the gas tax, they talk about sanctuary cities, they talk about the burden on businesses. When you, when you get these things repeated enough times, you realize something is happening in California. Who knows where it'll go, but this isn't the state I used to say, you know, the People's republic just last forever. I'm not so sure.

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       Really. So do you think this could be something that could happen as soon as our next, our gubernatorial election that's coming up now? Or do you think this is sort of longterm? Maybe presidential election, 20 slash 20 or

Speaker 3:          00:10:26       all I'll say is the following with the election of Donald J dot trump to president. The political rule book has been shredded, burnt, buried under a Donald Trump jumped up and down on it. It's gone. So, so any past expectations, any trendlines are irrelevant. I mean I traveled with the president to. We flew on Air Force One to Youngstown, Ohio back in June. And the Steel Valley, right? This is the heart of a blue collar Democrat, manual laborers. And we, we, we arrived at the stadium and the president was in the back. I was doing selfies with the crowd, the crowd selfie. I've seen many crowds. What does it cost me that they want to sell for? Yeah, sure. Why not? Um, so I got to engage with these people and I realized that in this stage you move on at 20, 25,000 people. Everybody was either a former registered Democrat, their parents or grandparents were all democrats. And then what happens when the president or when the first lady Melania comes out of the stage, it erupts. The building erupts with chance with USA drain the swamp. And this is Democrat territory now, if that can happen in young stoner, youngstown, Ohio, who knows what can happen in California. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:11:48       Yeah. So I want to talk a little bit about your history and your parents and growing up that I just mentioned, but as long as we're on the, on the first part of the trump portion of this, let's just keep doing that. I heard you at the turning point usa a event in December. Give a speech, which I really thought was wonderful and you described trump as the icebreaker and what I've been saying around here is that I view him as the bull in the China shop. We wanted a panther to knock over a few things, but we got the bowl and I think that it's really the same analogy that we're using there. Um, so can you just further on that one?

Speaker 3:          00:12:20       So, um, the United States was covered for at least 30 years in this massive permafrost layer of ice, which is political correctness and it had frozen over the media, education, politics, all of it. Uh, to the extent that by the Obama administration, federal government was telling you who could use which bathrooms. So just insanity. Um, and then along comes a guy who, the first day I met him in summer of June 15 in his office in trump tower, the first thing I knew about this man is he's the Kryptonite of political correctness. I mean, he couldn't care less about, well, the New York Times or CNN says about a given issue. So along comes this man, layer of ice frozen over the country, Fam slams into it like an ice breaker and smashes through the ice. So he breaks a pathway for, for the nation to, to open up that silane.

Speaker 3:          00:13:09       And, and my argument to conservative audiences is that this is great. This is monumental. It wasn't going to be the path that could never have one. It had to be the bull, it had to be the icebreaker. But if you know your physics of icebreaking, you can send that, you know, thousands of tons worth of shipping there with its tungsten hall rides up on the ice slices through it. But if you don't have the flotilla behind it, that comes up and keeps that passageway open, what actually happens in real life? You suddenly one ship in breaks apart almost instantaneously. The ice comes around the bow and read knits itself right around the ship and reseals. So this is the moment in the conservative movement where we have to get serious about what does it mean to be a conservative in the 21st century? What's the role of government? How does national security look? Uh, so on and so forth. Uh, Donald Trump is the catalyst now we have to do the heavy lifting of ideology and politics and policy.

Speaker 4:          00:14:04       Yeah. Do you think he will years from now when we look back, be anything other than the catalysts? Like how do you, how do you consider his ideas compared to traditionally conservative ideas because just in the last couple months after signing the Omni bus thing, you know, right now when we're taking, we're taping this a few days before we're going to air it, but there's a big mess in Syria. We're not sure if there's going to be more intervention or not. He seems to be doing some things that are probably a little more big government than perhaps you want or, or certainly then his base seems to want. So where do you think he fits actually between catalyst and the enabler and the

Speaker 3:          00:14:36       flotilla? So first things first. I hate labels personally. I, I think labels is lazy thinking. Um, and in the case of Donald Trump, that irrelevant and they have no application, uh, uh, credit. Monica, Monica Crowley, my friend with this, the weekend after

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       the election was David Horowitz is a, was it a restoration weekend in Florida, which was either going to be awake or the party that was, and Monica gave a great speech in which he said, look, everybody misunderstands who this man is. He was never an ideological candidate because you simply cannot put him in a box because of what he does, whether it's his attitude to gay marriage, whether it's. It just is what it is. Just a sort of mixture. He was never an ideological candidate. He was an attitudinal candidate and she nailed it. Now what does that mean? Look at the last 40 years. This guy is 71 years old. He's not going to change. He is who he is. What has he done for the last 40 years as a professional? He's been committed to one thing, excellence, whether it's a golf course in Scotland, whether it's skyscraper in New York, it's excellence and all he's done is he's taken that concept and tribes know, translated it into excellence for America once more and that doesn't fit into neat neoliberal neo-con, Paleo calm.

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       It just doesn't fit. He's about getting stuff done and being the best, but so how do you link that to what the general conservative movement is? Now I get. I get what you're saying about labels and I say it all the time. The labels now, especially because of trump. The labels are all the brothers at this point, but the thing that I'm struggling to fully grasp about the trump thing is how does this connect to. You know, when I see you right now, you have a huge split, right? We've got the trump base and then you've got the never trumpers and these people are. That should be kind of lining up. They can't quite get there. And how do you connect those things? Like how do you connect what you're going to connect you to? The never. Trump has a pathological pathological. When Bill Crystal, who's all obsequious and oleaginous to me in the greenroom at Fox, when he tweets out actually tweets out in a choice between the deep state and president trump, I choose the deep state.

Speaker 2:          00:16:52       Yeah, Bill, you don't have a conservative. You're a subversive right. Can get out of the tent, get out of the tenant. So that's never going to happen. The broader question of what does conservative mean today? We can't answer that because have you seen a good article, a really good article which understands first principles, founding principles about what trump ism is or should be? I haven't. I've seen a lot of people who think they know what they're talking about, but who never met the president. So I think with a lot of work to be done, but it's not going to be done by conservative establishment individuals. The NRO is not going to tell you who trump is and the NRO is not going to revitalize the conservative establishment. Right. This is a new era. It's exciting, but we have to get to work to define what it means to be a conservative. So that to me is why it seems so obvious that you're so passionate about this that nobody else was going to do it. And I think that's all. So that's sorta what Monica was saying and it's sorta what Horowitz has been saying for a long time. Even when he sat right there that no one else was going to break through. And now it's imperfect. But

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       at least there's let. Let, let, let me be brutally candid. You know, I grew up in the UK to Hungarian parents who escaped communism. I went through the private school system in the UK, stiff upper lip and all that stuff, and the debating club. So the precedent style is not exactly the style used to. I have to get used to it. And I understand when people have issues. The biggest people, the biggest thing people have issues with on, on the right of his tweets. I get it. But guess what? Who was going to Defeat Hillary? Wasn't Jeb Bush wasn't even sent. It accrues. None of them were going to the only person who could come up through that Miasma who could break through the ice of political correctness walls, this rank outsider from Manhattan. And whether you like it or not, he had to say for the Sophocles, he was the necessary but not sufficient calls of victory. Um, you don't have to like it, but it had to be him. With that start, we tried to do marquess of queensberry rules for 30 years. What did it get us? When did it get us? Mitt Romney among guys. Right? So it had to be Donald Trump. Now we have to backfill what it means. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       And that seems to be where I think you and so many of these other people that are either part or formerly part of the administration. So you had a very brief stint at the administration, uh, first of all. And then some years from now they'll go. My Dad, he was there for 90 percent longer than everybody else, but it. But it pretty breached in seven months. First, can you just tell me how you got involved because you had only, you just mentioned you only met him a little bit before the election in the first place and then sort of what happened that had you leave because that will really tie into the media, which I think we're very much aligned on what's going on with the media right now. So a summer of 15 I got a phone call from a guy called Corey Lewandowski that I'd never heard of

Speaker 3:          00:19:55       and he said, uh, candidate trump is prepping for the big full gop presidential debate on national security. And you'd like to talk to you said, sure. So I took the plane, flew to New York, went to trump tower. It was just the three of us in Donald Trump's office and we had this

Speaker 2:          00:20:15       incredible blue sky discussion on national security issues. You name it from the civil war up to the Middle East, a nuclear weapons. What kinds of topics? How knowledgeable did he seem about things? Because this is one of the parts that I think people we have no handle on, like does he really, really interested but not a guy that you're going to debate what happened in Karbala in the ninth century, but, but, but really interested in this stuff

Speaker 3:          00:20:40       and with opinions and, and halfway through this discussion and he was sitting closer to me than you are and qualities over here and he does a classic trumpism. He goes, just stops the conversation with cory. I like this guy that's hiring and that was it. And he asked me to help write. It wasn't part of the campaign, but I became an advisor, wrote policy papers that he used in the briefings and we stayed in touch but I never joined the campaign. And then as things progressed and he know the field whittled down to what it did, I kept meeting General Flynn at events. I was a participant was just in the crowd. I kept bumping into General Flynn and I'd known him from when he was directed to dia and eventually we just. He pulled me in and by October, the month before the election, I don't know if you're familiar with the system in the presidential election, the last two runners get a support from the federal government before the election and they get offices near the White House to create transition teams to prep.

Speaker 3:          00:21:43       And so hillary got one story and, and the president got another story of this building and I was pulled into the pet. Hilarious. It's in the same building. Oh yeah. And you see if you talk in the elevator. Right. So, uh, so I got pulled in and asked to work on the National Security Council Transition Team for General Flynn and my wife who has a background in the issues, was pulled into work on the dhs q and a. So I became part of the official transition team. And up until the very last moment, the week before maybe the week of the inauguration, I was going to be doing counterterrorism staff or General Flynn and the NSC. And then Steve Bannon, who knows me, reaches out at the last minute. So new, they're going to come and work for me. And the office of the chief strategist, a strategist to the president. And that's how, you know, at uh, 12. Oh, one on January the 20th I became a deputy assistant to the president.

Speaker 4:          00:22:34       Yeah. So the second that happened, basically the media just went bananas. And I knew, I mean every store I mentioned to you that right now the act where they went

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       bananas. Was it even before that? No, no, no, no. It's very interesting. They didn't, they didn't go bananas until the travel band dropped. And I realized things were not going well in terms of communicating the travel ban. So I said to Steve and I said to Sean guys, I've done a bit of media in the past. I can be the face of this stuff if you want. I mean we've got the NSC communications team, but I'm prepared to go on CNN and debate these guys. And so they threw me into the, the, you know, the, the fire. And I loved it. And the left went nuts. They just absolutely went insane. And it was once I was vehemently representing the president on television that out came the hit pieces. And the lights.

Speaker 4:          00:23:30       Yeah. So let's talk about that a little bit because I see this happening to almost everyone that I have any degree of respect for. I see it, I see it. It's coming. It's coming to me now too. I mean, I see this to almost anyone that I think is trying to be honest. The endless effects. I mean, you know, there were just endless slew of things that you're an anti Semite and all of this craziness. I mean at the turning point event that I saw you speak at, you gave one of the strongest defenses of Israel that I've ever heard, but they almost take everything and do the complete reverse of that. What do you make of that tactic specifically where it's literally the reverse of what the truth is. It's not just like we're going to take a line and make it seem a little different. We're do something that's absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:24:14       You've got a big viewership. I know your why. I'm no longer a progressive thing. Has got millions of views now. And I'll, I'll open up a little bit the spot size of your audience. Um, I have a reputation for being a scary dude and being a hot ass, that's fine, but after the seven months that I went through and my family went through, every time, every few weeks, I have the same emotional response and it probably surprises your others as a human being. I want to try and understand how another human being who's never met me, who knows nothing about me or what my family has been through, can write what they wrote about me will say what they say about me.

Speaker 3:          00:25:12       It leaves me speechless that you can have such venomous hatred for somebody and pedal so egregious sets of lies. And you not only call yourself a journalist, but you actually think you're a human being. Um, I was attacked and that's fine because I'm a politically commissioned officer of the president. I'm a proxy. I was approximate for Steve as a proxy for the president. I understand that. That's okay, but hey, why don't we debate the policies they never wanted, never wanted to debate the policies was ad hominem attacks and lives. And secondly, it's okay to attack me, but guess what? It's not a kate attack, my wife. It's not okay to attack my dead mother's reputation and it's not okay to attack my teenage high school age son either these people are reprehensible and they're out of control, David. And then not learning the doubling down.

Speaker 4:          00:26:17       So that's the part that I'm concerned about right now that it seat. People always asked me. I did an event in Irvine last night and, and the question I'm getting more and more now is, is this thing turning around now? I sense my sense is that there is something brewing against it. There's something brewing finally, and I think any of us in this space or a little piece of it, but to me it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better and that that's what I'm concerned about. Uh, you're already. So I suspect

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       you, under what conditions does something like that change. If we rule out violence, right? We don't want to have violence. Okay. We've, you know, the, the worst war we ever had was all civil war. Okay? Six hundred thousand Americans killed. Even though they're subtly condoning violence, CEO of twitter is condoning it. Um, so let's, let's, let's pray to the good Lord that that's not where we're going. What's the other option? What's the other scenario that they look in the mirror and they stopped, but one would thing they reward each other for the lies. I mean, look at Time Magazine's latest issue. It's just a for Rango of lines. It's all opinion pieces, not journalism. When they look at the people who they celebrate at their get togethers, they're not journalists. I mean there's maybe six journalists left in this country that are actually doing investigative research like Sarah Carter, right?

Speaker 3:          00:27:44       Like Molly Hemingway. When are they going to be recognized by the Washington press corps? Never, never, because they don't comport with the narrative that we're Nazis. And the president is a dictator. This is a man whose grandchildren are orthodox Jews. Can you wrap your heads around it? New York Times, CNN, Huffington Post, buzzfeed. You'll reprehensible for calling this administration what you call it. I know that he doesn't, not that he doesn't have a racist bone in his body. He doesn't have a racist molecule in his body. The stunning thing, and this is, this is what, why it was such an honor to work for him. The stunning thing about Donald trump is, and look, I got a Bible in my pocket. I can swear on it. I'll swear on this Bible. This man wants only two things. We're all Americans. He wants you and your family to be safe and he wants you to prosper, which is what all American president should want, but you know it's starting, David.

Speaker 3:          00:28:49       He wants that for you. Whether or not you voted for him or not, he doesn't care whether you voted for Hillary. He doesn't care whether you want to burn it all and he doesn't care whether you stayed at home and ate doritos. If you're an American living here legally, he wants you to be safe from harm, from gangs, from terrorism, and he wants you to prosper like he has prospered. And the left. This is the answer to your question. The left will never ever believed that. Although it is true and I tested it. So when they put you out there and as you said you. No, no, no, no, no. That, that, that's what it's all about, right. That's what it's all about. What you just said there, when they put you out there and as you said, you willfully went out to, to go for the, for the ban the Muslim ban. I when, uh, when we talked about it on our tour, but I'm glad for it to their narrative. Okay. So we talked about it a bunch of the show. I

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       did a bunch of videos. I tried to be very fair. I have Muslim friends, I've had Muslims on the show and ex Muslims and I've had people that are critical of religion and people that are religious in the whole freaking thing. Look, most of the countries, the most of the most populous countries of Muslim people were not included on the band. The original list, the original list was Oklahoma by the Obama administration. All that. So I tried to talk about it as fairly as possible, but it seems to be one of those issues. And then I think this will sort of lead us a little bit into your book as well, talking about radical Islam and trying to make the distinction between Islam as a set of ideas versus Muslims as people. And of course you shouldn't be prejudice and all of that. This seems to be basically the stickiest thing that we have going right now, right? Like the quicksand to even talk about it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:30:28       Uh, you mean the threat, the threat of jihadism? Well, just trying to kind of things that are so well the quicksand of trying to make the distinction of we have to be able to talk about ideas and what we have to fight for good ideas and against bad ideas, but at the same time make sure that we're not being prejudice towards people and making sure that America remains the open plurals, pluralistic society that it is.

Speaker 3:          00:30:52       Look at the argument in, in my book, different jihad is a very simple one. Um, we live in the only country ever created on the principle of individual freedom and liberties and granted to us, not by the government, but by our creative because we are made in his image, not the founding fathers said you are, you have dignity because you all made in the image of the creator, not because Washington says you have dignity. And that concept of the individual's dignity and the freedom that it provides is antithetical to the spectrum of politics that says manage perfectible and perfection can be created in real. My first degree was philosophy and theology. And I study, uh, this event here in California. All politics can be, can be all ideological differences can be summarized in just two camps. It doesn't matter which country you're in or what era, two camps, those that believe truth is objective and not manmade.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       And those who say no man can define truth and perfection can be created here on earth. This statement that man defines truth leads to the gas chambers and to the gulags. Okay? Now, social justice warriors don't realize that they're walking down the same path, but it's the same concept to say, I'm going to perfect the world and there will be justice and equality. No, you won't. If we are free, there will never be justice for all and equality for all, as long as we are free because evil is real. Evil exists. Man is fallen and jihadism is just the latest version. Like my book is a very simple argument. There is a connective tissue between al Qaeda and Isis and the Nazis of the Third Reich and the comments of the Soviet Union. Yes, they watch different things on worship and Erin Rice when we should work in class, the other worship, that version of Islam, but guess what?

Speaker 3:          00:32:48       The connective tissues, they're all totalitarians and if you disagree with them, guess what? You're going to be enslaved or murdered. End of story and if you. If you deny that reality, I've trained, I don't know, six, $7,000 federal officers. I've trained more than that in the military. When the military professional and FBI agent understands that his government is telling him what he can or cannot say about the threat group is supposed to be protecting us from then we have problems when President Obama says in a 2011 writes a memo to the chairman of the joint chiefs and the then attorney general all counter terrorism training of FBI agents and the US military must not mention Islam and especially must not mention the word Jihad. Well, that's like saying we're about to storm the Normandy beaches and guys make sure you're [inaudible] one's loaded and your boots are tied up, but whatever you do, don't mention the word Nazi because you could offend a German. It's a bad snl skit, David. It's insanity and the fact that we weren't allowed to talk about it truthfully, that gets people killed. Political correctness

Speaker 4:          00:33:58       eventually can lead to good people dying, so that also explains why there's such craziness in Europe right now. Right? I mean, we're going to see. It seems to me that we're going to consistently see the rise of right or far right parties, but it really is just the symptom of not being able to talk about these issues. Honestly.

Speaker 3:          00:34:19       Let's differentiate between the rise of two different things. Okay. So, um, we've just had an election in Hungary. We've seen the elections in Italy and elsewhere and we've seen brexit. Let's don't conflate two issues. There's the rise of very disturbing, uh, groups like your back in Hungary that are really crypto nationalists and, and feed off a, a long seated antisemitic kind of era dentist, a sentiment in the country. So these are the true

Speaker 4:          00:34:43       sort of. They're not all white nationalists, but the true sort of, they want ethno state and they want, right?

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       Well, it's complicated because as history that has tree and on this side, but that big. Yeah, little nuggets. Okay. Then that you mustn't conflate that with the trump phenomena and things like brexit, original, a causation, and I don't even use the word populism. I reject the word populism, unless your definition is part of populism is a, those kinds of politics that the elite disagrees with. Good. Definitely. I'm pretty sure that's not the standard for me. This isn't populism that trump winning or brexit happening. This is a reassertion of democracy. I mean why? Why did trump occur? Because people on the left and the right looked at DC and said, you know, I don't know the difference between Sunni and Shia, but guess what? It's broken. I don't know what a federal

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       budget should look like, but we were spending like drunken sailors, so it's the reassertion of accountable politics, vice faceless bureaucracy or uni party swamp to others, whether they're in DC or whether they're in Brussels. So for me it should be. We should welcome it with open arms. This is a reassertion of accountable government, but for the left that wants uniformity of thought and bigger government. It's fascism. So how does the, how do then does the right. How do you police that? I know that you don't like that idea of policing and government coming in fixing it, but how do you make sure that the part that you're worried about doesn't lead to the good part? Because I think from the way, at least from the way I see it, the left is always lead now by its worst parts, so for them, that's why they purge everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       The video that you mentioned that I did, I'm praying for you. That's what I talked about. I mean, anyone that steps out of group think you get purged and that's why I think there's such a movement towards libertarianism or classical liberalism or whatever you wanna call it, so I see what the left's doing on that. How do you make sure that doesn't happen on the right where the far right that you were worried about, you think it's fair estimation to call it fire, right? Yeah. I don't even like the alt right. I think it's bogus. I think those are just. That's a new label for nationalist or or or, or incidental bigots. All right. That's a reader that re wrapping themselves to be solid. Faith will be fit for polite company. Well, I hate to tell you, I hate to tell you on your wikipedia page, it calls you all right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       Of course. Right. And offset the page. That doesn't allow the subject to correct when I try and correct the lies. It's frozen. Interesting. Wikipedia you. I told you right before we started, but your wikipedia out of all of the ones that. Because I usually just glance there, not for fact, but just to get a sense of what's going on. Yours is such a mess. It's. I've tried. I've tried to correct the friends who have tried to correct it. Then they froze it and then forget about it. Yeah. So what do you do though to make sure that those two songs don't come? We need to spine. So those of us that have a podium, those that are out there, those that wish to see the principles we believe in in terms of the founding come back and be celebrated in this country. We have to call them out like we don't believe that you use legislation.

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       I mean hate speech. Give me a break. I mean, either you're inciting violence, so you will not, either you're committing a crime or you're not. We don't need extra labels and we don't. It's censorship. Call them out for what they need. People on the right hand side. You know what? He's a racist. That. All right. Think that's just bigotry. That's just the KKK wrapped up in a new bow. It's up to us. Do you think that's happening? That's not gonna do it, right? They're going to use it. You want to use those people to silence the majority. Do you think that went not enough? Not Enough, but by far, um, we have um, begun, but there's a lot of work to do. Yeah. Does everything that's happening in Europe right now and there's definitely a distinction to be made between what's happening in eastern Europe. Western Europe

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       and Eastern Europe I think is dealing with some of their existential crisis. He's a little bit better perhaps because western Europe still a little behind on the political correctness stuff that you're talking about. Does everything that's happening in Europe right now? Does it all come down to immigration, do you think?

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       No, no, no. Uh, immigration, uh, was the blue touch paper on the firework? No, it's, it's the death of representative democracy. I mean, I watched this because I grew up in the UK under Margaret Thatcher. For me, Maggie, the Gipper blessed St John Paul the second. These were my heroes.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       I remember riding to school on the bus in the morning in west London and the bus driver would be Jamaican. I'd be with my Indian or Pakistani school body I with, with this Polish guy next to me. I mean it's super hydrogenous part of London and as far as far as I was concerned, these are all Brits. The guy must've might've had the thickest Jamaican accent possible. My, my, my friend Martin's mom cooked the best Indian cars, but guess what? We're all British. Yeah, that's gone. You know, when Tony Black came in, when Clinton came in, this idea that, you know, the West is guilty and words like British, a pejorative to your wealth or whatever that was the death of these countries. I mean, why do you think I'm in America? I'm a proud American citizen now because they lost the plot. The things that the Gi guys that fought for that, the Tommy's fought for make safe spaces, really got 19 year olds that are being blown up over Berlin and bomber planes and you want a safe space. This is in a space of 70 years. I mean, what's going on in London right now? Here's the line of Churchill.

Speaker 4:          00:40:33       Yeah, it's shocking. So I saw, I'm sure you saw this, but just in the last couple of weeks they said London's crime. Violent crime has now surpassed New York cities for the first time in history. And then Cindy Kahn, who's the mayor, a statement saying, you can't carry knives. I mean, first off, people are walking out with Swiss army knives, a woman that might want to protect herself. My one have a knife in her pocket. I mean it. It seems like a mass mental disorder to me,

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       but that's what happens. That is the natural progression when you deny objective truth. If everything is plastic, then you will get wrapped around your own act solely in absurdities and for for mayor of one of the most powerful cities in the world of financial centers to say no one should ever have a knife on them and nobody needs a knife. So every plumber, every tradesman, every person working at the fish market is suddenly out of a job. So conduit, insane.

Speaker 4:          00:41:27       So what does your Britain or Europe in a wider sense have to do to reverse the tide on

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       some of this stuff? I mean, Nigel Farrage, I dunno. I mean it's lucky that the saying and crops up in every nation and every country deserves the politicians. They elect.

Speaker 3:          00:41:46       Don't bitch and Moan. Get up the street where I live outside DC. I mean you're the conservatives who's so fed up and they're constantly posting stuff on facebook. What have you done to do something about it? Have you gone out with leaflets? Have you given more than $5 to a local candidate? Have you given up and surrender? I see this all the time that people who say, well, greatest nation on earth, and then they said, well, you know, we're going purple and bureaucrats moved in and what are you going to do? What are you going to do? Would you have said that in 17, 76, the founding fathers have said, what are you going to do? No.

Speaker 2:          00:42:25       Is this just a symptom of the success of the West that we've just become so successful that you're right. We kind of sit there and we sit on twitter and we complain all day, but we're all talking. We're not doing anything like it's all talk. It's not do a. it's much more than that. It's deep. I mean, I. I went to the Jesuits. I studied philosophy under them. It was painful, but I will, I won't regret a minute of it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:51       Identity is a function of history and culture and values and if, if you don't study Western civilization and your schools colleges, this is what happens. If you don't understand why people have dignity, just that they do. Oh, unless that conservatives, right. This is where you arrive at and and you know who's responsible for this. I don't play in the Left, David. This is not the. This is not the left's culpability. It's ours. It's the conservatives. The radicals, when they saw Paris and fire in 1968, believed that they could do the segment America, that we could have a left wing revolution. This is what your students were democratic society believed, and when Bernadine, dohrn and bill as took over the SDS and try to execute the Chicago days of rage. What happened? Because Americans are not rabble rousing a leftists. It died. It was a damp squib article there.

Speaker 3:          00:43:54       Maoist revolution. The, the. What was it? The prairie fire manifesto died instantly. So what did they decide? They'd read that Trotsky. They'd read their lending. They even knew. Hitler said, give me that children and our own their future. So these people actually became tenured professors in Chicago. They became high school teachers. And what did we do on the right? We let them. People who are avowedly believe America is evil. We're allowed to influence our education system to the point at which they pretty much owned it. But with exceptional, your hillsdale and grove city, they own the education

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       system. And what was our response? Homeschooling. Great. I love the movement, but you're not going to save, but that ain't, that ain't enough. Yeah. So, um, it's gonna be a hard slog. It's going to be 20, 30 years of saying guys, America means this and it's nothing to do with your skin color. It's nothing to do with your sexual preference, your social class, your gender. America is eternal values and that's, that's gonna be a lot of work. Alright. So I want to shift a little bit to foreign policy because I think that sort of a, one of your, one of your. Would you say that's one of your main strengths? So my, my, my claim to fame is counter terrorism and stuff like this. But, but really deep down I'm a strategy wank. Grand Strategy is my thing. Okay. So we'll talk. We'll talk in the language and strategy then.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       So as we're taping this right now, I mentioned earlier, it's gonna, it's gonna sit on the shelf for a couple of days, so I don't want to get too lost in anything that happened today, but at the moment it's a little upside down in Syria. We know there might've been strikes already from when we're taping this. A hungry just had elections in your wikipedia that I referenced earlier. It says you worked for the guy who just won you. Apparently you never worked for him. He told his potty. I wasn't victim to Audubon's advising, which is what it says on Wikipedia at least. Um, what, what's your general thoughts on foreign policy strategy? Like what is a sensible policy and Eddie's trump applying that view? Uh, first things first. Uh, the great irony of all nation is that we are the most powerful nation in the world has ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       And until recently we have been the dumbest and most a strategic. I mean we haven't done, we haven't thought or acted strategically since about 1989. November the ninth when the Berlin Wall fell. And, and this is, you know, how have we acted? What, what would you say that since then, it's just nineties was just this kind of confused. What is national security about lurching for the snooze button, just who are the threats is that China is a weapons of mass destruction and say you just love it. It was just a mess. And then we had 2001 and nine slash 11 and we had just as neo-con disasters, it's not an accident. These guys were former trotskyites because they're so naive the way they look at the world that we're going to create democracy at the end of a gun barrel in a country with 36 languages that defeated Alexander the Great and the British empire and the Soviets. You couldn't be stupid or if you tried. So, you know, we, we've done some very, very foolish things because we haven't stuck to the basics. Strategy at the end of the day is about one thing. It's about prioritization based upon interests. But you've got to say some things are more important than others. And guess what? Some countries are more important than others. And in a postmodern secular world, you'll not allowed or no countries, oh, Vanuatu is as

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       important as Turkey wrong. It's not that I love the people that a while too, but no, it's not a geo strategic import to the, to the country of America. So number one, we have to prioritize and I think this administration, I dock my cap to Nadia shadow a HR mcmasters deputy. She held the pen in the meetings that I was in on the new national security strategy of America. And I tell you David, it is the first document of that name in steady is that deserves the name national security strategy. Every administration has them. This is the first one that says, this is what we stand for. These are our values, these are our friends, these are our enemies and this is what we're going to prioritize. Prior to that, it was laundry lists of, well we're going to have to front walls, we're going to save the whales and you know know.

Speaker 3:          00:48:15       So you have to prioritize. And finally this administration is about America first. We are not isolationists, nor are we interventionists. This is really annoys me that if you're a conservative for 20 years you were given two options, button a invade other people's countries and occupy them button. Be be a Randy Sta and close the curtains on the Pacific and the Atlantic and say, we don't care about anybody else. Well guess what is the most powerful nation in the world? There is a large pallet of options. It's got to be something in the middle there. Yeah, so it's about being smart. It's about our interests and it. To summarize the president's approach, this isn't official, but I like it. We have numerous former generals and active generals from the Marine Corps at the highest level of administration showed the joint chiefs, Chief of staff, secretary defense. And the interesting thing is they all come from the same Marine Corps division, not just the Marine Corps, the same division.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       And that division has a motto, no better friend, no worse enemy. That's America first. So when you see someone like John Bolton a now part of the cabinet, and if you were to look on, you know, not that you can get truth out of twitter, but the day it was happening, you know, everybody's saying this is going to start world war three and just the general hysterics. And now John Bolton is definitely suspect more of a neocon than you're comfortable with it. Is that. I don't think it's fair to Chordoma Naoko. I don't, I don't, I don't think he's ideologically driven. If you watch the videos that he know recording of his speech is 20 years ago, he was certainly very much like trump. We're America and we have interests. You want to work with us, fight. If you don't, there's a problem. So, um, and I think it's very telling that within 40 minutes of the president's tweet about John Coming on board, um, massive bulk and gave an interview on Fox and they asked him about what are you going to be like as a national security advisor? And he gave a very interesting onset. He could've Dean Acheson and you know, the, the, the doyen of foreign policy in America, and uh, I don't know if this is true story, but John said the natural one was once asked, how do you have such a good relationship with the president in serve

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Indian actress and said, well, it's very easy. We may disagree on policy issues, but at the end of the day, I never forget who was elected president and it wasn't me. That's a John Bolton two point. Oh, he understands that unlike his predecessor hr mcmaster, he's not there to lecture the president or forced his version of what you should do onto the commodity and chief. He's at to be an honest broker and provide a palate of options because guess who gets to decide the person who was elected president. So I'm very excited about John and I, I'm, I'm as excited about Mike pompeo coming from the CIA to the State Department that we are in. Very good hands, David. So how do you make sure, if it's between the pure isolationists and, and the neocons or something, something like the nation builder, something like that. How do you make sure that not everything that you do outside of our borders becomes something much bigger?

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       I mean, look, we're still at war in Afghanistan. I don't think anyone knows why. I mean, can you, can you tell me why we're at war in Afghanistan? Can anyone tell me why we went, why we went to Afghanistan in October of, uh, one is the only reason we should be that today. Nothing's changed. Okay. The idea that goes go to school. I love it. I get it that people can listen to music freely and the Taliban won't execute you. My parents lived on the communism. My father suffered under fascism. He protected his fellow Jewish classmates during the occupation of Budapest. I get it. I don't like those kinds of systems, but there's only one reason why they were there to make sure that that piece of land that would never ever again be used to execute mass casualty attacks in Manhattan, in Washington or in a field in Pennsylvania.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       End of story. It's not about building a ring road around Kabul. The not even the Soviets could finish. It's not about building hospitals. I'm sorry you never make the ideal, the enemy of the good. What the president does is he looks at things as questions of possibility. You cannot be a massively successful realtor in the toughest market in the world, which is New York real estate. If you have a filter that distorts reality, I mean either this square footage is worth x or it's not worth x according to the market and that's how he approaches these issues. So Afghanistan is only important to make sure that bad guys don't use it again to kill Americans in America. So. So you would say, or at least if you were, if you had to guesstimate basically what he believes you would say that he believes that still keeping us there at the moment is still accomplishing.

Speaker 2:          00:53:01       Oh, I don't have to get somebody tell you that. Yeah. So you believe that as well because he just seems unclear and it has nothing to do. He will. He will never. I tend to write this 71 year old man who is now the most powerful man in the world, will never, ever, ever buy into a nation building scenario anywhere outside of the United States. Not happening for the next seven years. End of story and the idea that you have my followers on twitter, tearing their hair out, the boltons going to invade Syria guys, get a grip on reality and stop talking about crisis actors and 10 fall how to garbage. It's not gonna happen while the president's the president. Well that I tweeted something to that effect the day of the Bolton thing because it also reminds me that people don't understand basic deterrence that you have to bring in people that you know, talk a big game.

Speaker 2:          00:53:54       So that pronounced to arrange these. Hello? Right. The man who was going to take us to war, what did he do? I think the success in North Korea today has in large part been been a thanks to his tweets because that's how you deal with dictators. You make fun of them. They hate that. And then you were ridiculed him. Right? And then you do what you scare them. Oh, Lo and behold, they want to negotiate for the first time in 65 years. Well, isn't that interesting? Do you think there's any chance he would ever give up his nukes? About three percent because at that point, what leverage does he have left? Right? So that you still think it's worth having the talks to figure out what we can. Absolutely. Because what's happened for the last 25 years? Escalation, escalation, escalation. I mean we, we have given into nuclear blackmail since Bill Clinton.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       Uh, so yeah, we have to at the end of the day, we have to remember 1953 was not a peace treaty in 1953 in Korea was a ceasefire and an armistice and that, that is actually a wall that's just simply been frozen for 65 years. Will be nice to have a little bit of a peace treaty or something. Yeah. How much of what's happening in the world right now? Do you? You must be thrilled, I assume with everything going on at the UN, Nikki Haley as basically walked in there and John Bolton two point. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, she strikes me as. I almost wondered, did trump really know what he was getting with? Ideally? Yeah. Did anyone know? Anybody did? Yeah, we're, we're going to do, do you know her at all? Where do you think that, that kind of. I don't know her as a friend. Um, she found herself.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       She found herself in more power to her. What, what usefulness do you see in the UN at this point? Because it seems like truly it seems like the most corrupt should be backward pushed into the river. I mean really, I, well the buildings basically other now they're going to quote that and go, you see, he was calling for him to be knocking. Look, the idea was a good idea in 1945 in San Francisco, let's have an organization that stops us from killing 60 million people again. Um, but when you look in dictatorships like China and Russia into the Security Council with veto power and then you create this, this empire of UN organizations, I mean, has that been a year in the last 20 years that we haven't seen a UN scandal?

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       Whether it's money for oil, whether it's UN troops raping children in Africa? Have we seen it one year without a UN scandal? I don't think so. So try and reform it. And if you come with a question, the validity of what it does. I forget. I'm not talking about, you know, the, the, the, the children's rights organizations and food, food security. I'm talking about its main mission which is stability and safety. Failed abysmally. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:56:49       What, what do you make of the endless obsession with Israel that something like 47 of the last 51 resolutions are against Israel and usually voted on by countries.

Speaker 3:          00:56:59       Sorry, but that alone is a reason to dissolve the UN mean what a lack of moral compass. What an utter bankruptcy of the morality that there are nations in the world that actually still have slavery going on. Slavery where we're basic human rights for individuals are not guaranteed based upon sex based upon lifestyle choices. And you're going to lambast Israel the only democracy in the Middle East. Yeah, I think. I think you nailed it. I mean that, that in and of itself is a reason enough to question the future of the UN.

Speaker 4:          00:57:39       So is the US sort of in an odd position where it's like if we don't do anything, nothing can get done sort of. And that, that then puts us endlessly in these quagmires or at least in these positions where we can either watch the world burn or get involved in things where we may end up adding to the burning in the first place. Like for example, you know, with Russia going into Crimea, you know, they gave up their weapons, right? They gave up the weapons. They said alright, NATO is going to take care of us, but what that really means is the United States is going to take care of you. And I'm not saying we should have gone in and done anything there, but that we're in this endless situation now where it is either us there, there is no international fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:58:17       Yeah, you're super careful not to get caught in a binary dichotomy. You can absolutely say a world without American leadership is a more dangerous world because it was for the last eight years. Look, I mean we had a government that actually said we're going to lead from behind, which is an oxymoron. You cannot lead from behind. We're going to have strategic patients, which means we do nothing and allow others to act. What happened? You name it from China building fate, ministry basis on fake islands to isis, to Russia invading. It was just a disaster.

Speaker 4:          00:58:52       We back the guy, the other guys and Rebecca.

Speaker 3:          00:58:56       So yeah, to say that a world without American leadership is, is more dangerous, is true, but that doesn't mean that we have to fix everybody's problem and that's where smart strategy comes in where you say, but we have a moral duty to espouse certain values, but that doesn't mean we are responsible for all human beings because. Because American revolution says the opposite, right? Each nation is responsible, the citizens are responsible if you don't like your system, do something about it because guess what we did against the most powerful empire in the world. So, um, again, it's about finding that, that happy medium in the middle and being smart about it. And again, without being callous, being realistic, right? There are atrocities everywhere from Orlando to Yugoslavia, part American taxpayers going to pay for fixing all of them. Are we responsible? Are they responsible for what's happening in their country?

Speaker 3:          00:59:59       Sure are the times when we could perhaps help them, but it's a balance to balance. All right, so let's shift back to your book defeating Jihad. It seems to me that the main sort of narrative on this is not that we can defeat it, but we should live with it, that there's a degree of it with which we should just live, which is don't carry knives in London and it's, you know, we're going to put up more barricades so the trucks can't be driven into buildings or into shopping centers or just down the street and killing people that we can't really defeat this ideology. We just have to manage it. Right. I suspect you do not agree with that premise because we've defeated ideologies before. You can't look. There are idiots who run around with swastika arm bands today. I get it. So Nazi-ism hasn't disappeared, but we have made it so anathema that if you walk down the street with a Nazi flag, you will be rejected by society instantly.

Speaker 3:          01:00:56       The same thing with the KKK, right? Sadly, not with Che Guevara was a hammer and sickle. Right, right, right. But, but there are ways to defeat ideologies or to put them in a box where the La football and everybody shuns them. We have to do the same thing with jihadism. This is my argument. This is the conclusion of the book. We have to be as effective in dealer gentamycin. The message of Jeff, because very simply put, killing jihadis is great, but at the end of the day, a bodybags as a metric, not a good metric. It didn't work in Vietnam doesn't work today because guess what? If you've got a recruiting pool, it's massive. Not just recruit new jihadis, so what's your victory condition? Your victory condition is when the life style of jihad is no longer sexy from Brussels to San Bernardino. How do you do that? You make a laughingstock.

Speaker 3:          01:01:46       You discredit that value system. We're not asking white skin Catholic isn't going to do it right, but we help. President Sisi were helped. King Abdullah of Jordan will help mbes in Saudi Arabia. I mean mbs, historic things. He said, I mean massive about Israel in just the last few weeks. That's how we win because sooner or later enough people say, those guys are losers. That's how we win, but you only do that if you get to talk about it. Truthfully. You've got to be able to talk about the Koran or jihad means the history of the religion because if you can't talk about it honestly, you're never going to treat it accurately. Yeah. We're not very good at that though. Well, political correctness, right? I mean, imagine if you're a doctor and you've got a patient that comes in with a third stage lymphoma, but your hospital administrator, because it's a scary word, has banned the use of the word cancer.

Speaker 3:          01:02:41       You can't say it right. It's just not allowed. Yeah, and then you have to tell the patient what, well, you know, you're dehydrated. Go home, drink some water, and take some aspirin. What happens to your patient? And they die. It's the same thing. If you can't diagnose a geo strategical issue accurately, however much money you throw at it, you will not solve the problem. So are you concerned at all that just even if it's purely because of the way the media frames things that perhaps trump is not the right person to lead the fight against this, that for whatever, whatever he's going to say about Jihad or a radical Islamic terrorism or the rest, even if he said everything the exact way that you wanted it to be sad, cleanly and clearly and correctly defined all of that, that he may not be the right messenger on this just because of the filter it has to get through to get to reality.

Speaker 3:          01:03:30       He's not the right messenger domestically because of what political correctness is wrought in our country, but he is absolutely the right message. Internationally. Watch the video of his speech. Don't watch him. Watch the 53 mostly matter of heads of state and the body language because man did he say, guys, you got a problem in your most and your society is extremely determined. You have to deal with it. It was tough. A new thing that'd be all negative and arms crossed. They were beaming, right? Cc Abdullah. We're going, oh, finally a guy who understands our problem and what is giving us tough love. So yeah, he, he is absolutely the right guy to fix this internationally, which is where it needs to be fixed domestically. Now the political correctness thing is going to get in the way. The media insanity. So do you think he has more support from foreign heads of state and then we'll have a sense.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       I mean even at the Ga there was a feeling of like that actually these guys kinda liked him or I can tell you. Yeah, I told people before the inauguration, you have no idea. Even if you voted for him, you have no idea how successful he will be internationally because he's a straight shooter because he's an Alpha dog. And guess what? In a lot of places outside of Berkeley they like have that right? Because they know what you're talking about. They don't have to walk on eggshells. They understand your direction. So yeah, internationally are prestige as a nation has skyrocketed in, you know, outside of the European Union and maybe certain century pin countries exempted. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, I know we could do a whole

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       other show on this, but, but very quickly just on Russia collusion, as someone that has been around the administration, you've mentioned some of these people already, flint, you know, down the road.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       Well, what, what can you tell me about that and is there anything that people should be worried about or do you think this is all going to actually point just back to the Democrats, which every time it seems, every time it seems to point to trump, you go a little bit further and then going, oh, well, wait a minute. That was actually the Democrats do. My good friend has a, the best morning show in DC. Uh, I'm Chris plot. The radio host is actually a national syndicated and I have to credit him with this. He says it's the last scene from the hunt for Red October when the bad captain Tupolev launches the torpedoes against Sean connery on the radio October. And it takes the fuses off and then what happens? Remember his ex says, your thing comes back and syncs them. This is the most hilarious boomerang in history, right? I'll tell you what the president told me in the Oval Office,

Speaker 3:          01:06:17       it's just the two of us. It was very frustrated one day I think maybe dad had just testified or given his speech, his little press conference, and he said they will not find anything because there is nothing and you know what? I take that to the bank. There is no Russia collusion. How could there be off for the last 15 months from arming the Ukrainians to the xl pipeline to Anwar to finally after 30 years, the first president to ever get NATO to finally stump up the two percent of GDP that they promised they'd spend on defense to our own military expenditure increases. Every significant policy decision this president has taken with regards to Russia has been bad for that former KGB colonel, so the idea that we're colluding, you have to be on drugs or be so ideologically blind to believe that,

Speaker 2:          01:07:10       well then what do we do with this? This layer, you know, whatever that you. You've referenced deep state before, whatever. Yeah. What? What do we do with this thing? Do we have an ongoing investigation? To me, the Mueller investigation, which seems odd to me, is that I don't know what the actual. I don't know that they ever laid out what their mission is other than to find what was the crime, right and that illusion to commit to collusion to conspire in a crime.

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       Okay, but what's the crime? Because if it's Russia misrepresenting itself or perverting the truth on facebook, well then Zuckerberg should be charged then. Then you know Anderson Cooper should be in the dark. What are the charges that have been brought outrageously ridiculous or lying to federal investigators? You? You would probably be able to be caught in a perjury trap today. Okay, because not everybody remembers what they did and how they did it. Poetry traps. What you said to somebody Irri irrespective of Russia. That's not donald trump's problem. Why a fraud? Eight years ago when manafort worked for the Ukrainian president, what's that going to do with Russian collusion? Nothing. My worry is that Mueller is not a good actor. If you look at who is hired, it's clear that there's massive bias and this report is writing for Congress is simply going to be a political weapon in the elections and and that's not how justice is served. That's the rule of law. That's a law enforcement official getting involved in politics.

Speaker 4:          01:08:55       So that's what I'm concerned about. Also, whether, whether you think something for the people that are watching this, the thing something happened or didn't happen, what I'm more concerned about is that we're entering this new phase where whether it's trump that's president or it's a Democrat that's president or it's a different republican or whatever, that we're just going to endlessly also have this layer that all it does is investigate itself. Waste money, you know, just constantly just be keeping us all in this state where we never know what's real. Because if you listen to half of the pundits on television, I mean their implication is that Russia has installed our president, in which case that's probably the single biggest active board and the history of the world and what are you actually saying? Do we take trump out? And then do you take out pence and now should Paul, right? I mean if you take it to its logical conclusion or do we have Paul Ryan as president then and right where are you really taking this? And that's what I'm worried about is that we're just going to end up in this constant state where yes, we'll have a democrat and a Republican or whatever, but we'll really be caught in just con. All government can do is investigate itself be more than anything else.

Speaker 3:          01:09:57       I see myself as an optimist,

Speaker 4:          01:09:59       but you're giving me a real challenge with that last one. I see myself as an optimist too, but I think I'm a realist. So for months and months and months or refused to use the phrase deep state, I really thought that was a tinfoil hat. He kind of thing. One of the record, I don't even know that I've even said it once on this show. It sort of pops up and answers. Uh, I

Speaker 3:          01:10:17       use it now because I've seen it. I've seen it inside the administration. When you go to enough National Security Council meetings that are classified, that is the, the, the, the pinnacle of policymaking in America outside of the Oval Office, and this is where policy's made. Everybody's in the room from the NSC. Then you've got the outstations on secure vtc from Dia, a chair of the joint chiefs, CIA state, you name it, right, and you sit there as a new deployment of political and you listen for two hours on a big issue, isis, Russia, whatever it is, and not one participant mentions the name of the president or what he said yesterday in Warsaw or what his objective is, given that specific issue and you see this happen again and again and again, and you're the guy at the end of the conversation with the funny accent. He says, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, you do

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       know what the president said about x yesterday. Can we actually do that? The deep state is real. When you've got gas fifteens and scs is saying, well, I've been here for 20 years. I know this guy is going to be here for four. I know better. That's bad for democracy. So it'll be clear that you don't think it's some sort of massive underground conspiracy. You think it's just the apparatus, the, it's just the old Washington apparatus so that I don't think you know, these people who think Obama sitting in a cave somewhere with a joystick, he's lazy. He'd never be a Muslim was I'll specter, not blofeld but, but no, there's a culture in government that's antithetical to an undermining, undermining the president on a daily basis. But, but there is, there is concerted effort in the media. Oh my gosh. I mean, Ben Rhodes brags about Ai.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       That guy's unbelievable. What he says. My bodies, the left wing journalists are morons and they're my echo chamber. He, he built this machine that was, was this incestuous connection between people in the West Wing, people in the think tank community and their buddies in the media. I mean, look at the attack pieces on anybody. Me or whatever. It's very interesting to. Somebody should do a case study. A journalism school, one attack piece will drop at 7:00 AM by 2:00 in the afternoon, 30 have been written. We're just simply cut and paste. But if you don't know that, it looks as, oh my gosh, gawkers a fascist. No, it's one guy's article. It was written because Ben Rhodes told them to ride it. That comes and multiplies on the right. How do we react? Well, I got my ipad international review. This one right there. There's a Gulf in terms of managing narrative.

Speaker 2:          01:13:02       The left built, built a whole ecosystem and we're still in the 19 eighties, you know? Oh, we'll take out a full page ad in the Washington. Well that's why when discussing, right? Yeah. I think it's so important to not odd. I think most people, especially just because of the way social media works, they immediately go to the full on conspiracy of Obama with the joystick or just some other, you know, the globalist thing and this whole, to me it's like they're there. What you just described seems more realistic to me that there's an apparatus there that then is still connected to the media that seems we can, we can discuss that in a sensible way with one audition. And, and I appreciate this, not having been, you know, in the target has the crosshairs for so long, they have an advantage because our site is predicated on what David, the individual manifest destiny, the rugged individualism.

Speaker 2:          01:13:57       We believe in individual, the left by definition, as a collective entity. There are elements of the Borg in the left and it is a truly is a collective, collective mob mentality. A friend of mine on Raphael Watching, I mean, thank you. [inaudible] is smoke. What, when, when, when one guy goes off the goal Golkar or Bannon or whoever, the president that has this massive collective pylon sort of conspiracy, but it, but it's a, they're all on the same hymn sheet. They don't need direction, but they say, Oh yeah, let's go off to him. Which, which puts us on the right at a disadvantage. Yeah. So this is just sort of an emerging group thing. It's a cultural thing. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. We could do. We're, we're going to do this again. I hope so. This is so much fun. Yeah. This was an absolute pleasure for more on Dr Gorka can. I feel like I have to say, I know well it I would if I'm a pro when I'm doing that later, have clients who have asked you, but I feel like Dr Gorka. I mean you should be a star wars character. It's all in there for more on Sebastian, follow him on twitter. It's at Seb Gorka.
