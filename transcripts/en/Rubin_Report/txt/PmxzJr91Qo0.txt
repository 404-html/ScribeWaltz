Speaker 1:          00:02          To start this week's direct message with a trigger warning. That's right, so take a moment, get a design comfy, and move carefully to your safe space because we've got to talk. I'll actually wait for

Speaker 2:          00:12          bit.

Speaker 1:          00:27          All right. I think that did it. Now that you've been triggered, warranty Leah, let's talk about free speech. It feels like it's on the ropes these days, right? Well, we've been talking a lot about it here in the context of how the regressive stifled debate by calling everyone racist, sexist, homophobic, or the rest. This very concept tolerance for intolerance has been taking root at college campuses across the country for quite some time now. There are two completely separate situations unfolding right this very moment. One is on the campus of Yale where some students were upset that a professor wrote a letter defending the right to wear offensive Halloween costumes. The letter in part explained that you can either ignore the costume altogether or you can engage in the person wearing the costume, telling them why you find it offensive. Apparently this wasn't enough for some of the students culminating and video that has now gone viral in which a student's screams at the dean quote.

Speaker 1:          01:18          It's not about creating an intellectual space. It's about creating a home here. The other situation is at the University of Missouri where students were fed up with a series of racially motivated instances they felt weren't being properly dealt with by the administration. The students demand to the resignation of the president, which he submitted after the mostly black football team got involved. A video on campus has also gone viral, showing a young journalist trying to cover the protest, but being screamed at and bullied by a group of students. Ironically, these students are trying to silence someone who was only there to cover the very protest that they wanted attention for. For one of the oldest and largest journalism schools in America. It seems that Mou has gotten something very wrong about free speech. Of course, these two instances are not isolated in America, nor in other parts of the Western world.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Colleges and universities are the very places you're supposed to go to engage in the battle of ideas. To learn new ways of thinking and to challenge your preconceived notions. Yet somehow colleges are the very place that had become hostile to all of these concepts. Now shouting down speakers you don't agree with demanding professors, be fired for contrarian views and denying the media free and unfettered access have found their home in these safe spaces. Of course, this all ties in perfectly with everything we've been talking about on this show. The regressive left by calling everyone racists and bigots and homophobes and the rest have ushered in a generation of people who were so sure in their beliefs and so dismissive of their opponents ideals that they have no reason to stand up for free speech anymore. If your opponent is a racist or a bigot, then why even engage with them?

Speaker 1:          02:55          You've got the moral high ground, so just shout them down or call them until they give up. These are the tactics. The regressive have used successfully in so many areas and now we're seeing the fruits of their labor. I want to be very clear here. Nothing I'm saying is dismissive of the actual issues these college students are dealing with. There is no doubt we have racial problems in this country. We have a quality problems. We have wealth disparity problems and the list goes on and on, but these problems won't go away if we don't talk about them. They won't magically resolve themselves. If we only talk to people we agree with actually, they'll only get much worse. This is the inherent flaw of identity politics that the regressives love so much. When you whittle us all down just to race, religion, nationality, sexuality, or whatever else there is, there's very little left to unite us.

Speaker 1:          03:44          I'd much rather look at people based on their ideas and their beliefs. Those are the principles that unite us across the divide that the regressive left has been digging. I've been saying for awhile now, the two things can be true at once. In this case, it can be true that these students have legitimate grievances and at the same time it can be true that free speech shouldn't be sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. We should be more worried about the government taking away our free speech rather than us taking it away from ourselves. Some say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Some say the ends justify the means. Some just want to shut you up and that's when you have to speak the loudest.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Joining me this week as a human rights activist who grew up in a place not too kind to freethinkers. Currently he's the Middle East community manager of movements dot Org and organization dedicated to open and close societies. He also happens to be in Los Angeles for the first time, right? This very second. Feisal, Syeda Macarthur who welcome to the show. Who all affect you that hiring me. I mean I thank you for bringing sanitary towel overall. I've been a big fan of your show since it started, so wow. Saturday to all of the world. I would say so because like I've seen your video being shared of lexile. I have friends who will live in in the Middle East and and, and they were all talking about you, so it's certainly great to be here. All right. That's very rewarding. We could probably on the show right there, we'll talk a little bit about you as well.

Speaker 1:          05:10          So, uh, I want to talk about your personal story and coming from Iraq and all that, which is really, it's really a wonderful story and it's so a perfectly lined up with a lot of things we've been talking about here. But first I want to talk about how I came to know you a because the second episode that we did have this show on Oprah. I had Karen Santa Maria on and uh, a few days before that she had been tweeting that she was in contact with someone that knew somebody in Saudi Arabia that was outed as a secular list or an atheist and was in trouble there. Life was threatened, I think by their father in your name then got looped into this. And then this is a direct through to what you do@movements.org. So can you just tell me a little bit about that instance? Yeah, I mean that, why it's a pretty

Speaker 3:          05:58          interesting case to say the least is that so the man is, comes from Saudi Arabia and uh, and he, he also happens to be a lucky one because he does have an American passport, so he lives in the United States and he went to, like into a discussion with his father on the dinner table and he told him he didn't even say like, he's an atheist. He just said that he has some doubts about God and things of that sort. And the end result of that conversation is that his dad had threatened him that he's going to report him to the authorities and that actually means in a country like Saudi Arabia, which is digitally death or you're going to get flashed like our friend Dr. but our, um, so far, uh, he started contacting a lot of secondary organizations. Like, this is my story. Um, I'm, uh, I need help and things of that sort.

Speaker 3:          06:50          And he came across Kara and Kara made that like she said like, oh, I have a friend who can have someone inside Arabia and, and I kind of became the direct person. Uh, somebody tagged me on the foot on the post because that's my work that I try to help activists in closed societies. So basically carry tweeted something saying I would like to help this person but I don't know what to do and that's where you jumped out. I jumped in and I also jumped in, in trying to verify his story is true. And I went back and forth and conversation with him to see a like if, because I mean we have tons and tons of cases and it's very important to know which ones are true to case because every case takes take long time. Like nothing gets solved. So I tried to make it too.

Speaker 3:          07:37          We have a vetting system in which we make sure that these stories are, are legitimate. And then so what do you do? Like what is the vetting system actually entail to find out if this guy is actually telling the truth and not just somebody that wants to get out of the country for other reasons. Yeah, I mean, I mean somebody who is a refugee myself. Uh, there are certainly questions that somebody can know whether this like you can ask them specific questions about, uh, about what, what they, what did they say to their parents and a weather like how is their relationship with their parents, you know, if that is actually like his dad is really crazy enough to report him to the, like to get his son killed. Like it's a and try to see like what he is trying to achieve. Like why he wants to leave.

Speaker 3:          08:21          Like what are you trying to achieve when he wants to leave and, and things of that sort and try to connect if he does no other circles and other friends that go through his facebook friends and started to see if it says like I told this person and tried to see if there's like the story matches up. Um, for this story. I mean, I admit like I always spend few hours because it's very, was very emergent situation. What we did is that, uh, because he got an American passport so there was no visa, like there's no visa needed, so we crowdsourced, we crowdfunded a money to get him to United States. So like within, like I tell him like by, by five, I think like by 5:00 AM you have to be at the airport, we only have like 12 hours and just make sure that you're able to go to the airport and within this 12 hours I'm going to be able to crowd fund and get you the ticket.

Speaker 3:          09:16          The ticket was waiting for him at the airport. Yes. And how are you communicating? This is done via email. Well, in some of these clubs societies, they use apps like whatsapp and viber and all of these stuff because they cannot be controlled by the government. Um, and he does seem to be a bit of tech savvy that he's able to use, let's call vpn that the government cannot track. Whereas exact location is. Um, and also, I mean, here's what the crazy part about this is that there is another case happened before by a gal called Hamza coach Carter, and he also came out as an atheist and he escaped in Malaysia, which is so called moderate Muslim country and the Saudi government contacted the Interpol and got him out of the airport there. So Interpol, which is a national or international position to defend human rights and all of that, they stopped him and get him back to Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 3:          10:11          So this guy, because he got an American citizenship, Kinda helps in getting him. He went to Dubai and from why he went to the United States. Um, so yeah, that's, that's a now he's actually, he's in the United States and he's in the united. Yeah. So that's a good success story. Yeah, it's a good success story. And that's why I wanted to jump off there with you because that's what you guys do@movements.org. It's a perfect example of technology meeting something that's important because you guys are literally raising money to save secular people and atheists. Yen Not only money. I mean, so the whole system of movements.org, so we crowdsource a human rights, so what we do is we connect activist from clubs, societies to people in open societies who have the skills to help them. So it can be somebody who's looking for a web designer and woman rights activists in Afghanistan want to be published in the media.

Speaker 3:          11:06          We have a partnership with the New York Times, the woman in the world. We have partnership with the daily beast, the Huffington Post. So we try to match what the activists in this closed societies want with people who are on the open societies who have the skills to help these specific requests. So it's kind of like multi sided platform. There's request and that our offers. And then our job is just get a match.com for four skills, uh, and also have a partnership with people who give organization. They'll give grants to civil rights organizations and things of that sort. So that's like the main concept of movements. Yeah. So how do you guys make sure that the network of people that you're setting up isn't being infiltrated either by governments or other people that want to hurt these people? Yeah, I mean what I mean, there's very impossible to have 100 percent secure system.

Speaker 3:          11:53          So I'm going to be very honest about this. I mean even facebook and Google and all of these, but we. So we have a vetting system in which these people who sign up, we ask them to put as much information as possible to be able for us to be able to verify this information. And also we asked people from closed societies, and I'm going to go to the definition of our societies afterwards, is that to use anonymous, uh, names and like don't use a username that does not reflect their, like their actual location or the real name for people who are in office societies, it's not really a big problem. But for people who like live in Saudi Arabia and in Pakistan, in Iraq and all these places, they would need to use a username and they don't give an exact. Like they don't say, well this is my zip code and this is my address and folks to please come and save me, but they can just make kind of a general request.

Speaker 3:          12:49          And then within the, within the messaging service that we have, they can reveal some of the information and we also have a very strong security in terms of, of people trying to hock and things of that sort. And the organization started as a result of funding from Google. So we get that kind of saved in terms of security. We don't have a problem of like big hacking and uh, but yeah, I mean it is, it is. It's obviously a possibility that many of these governments, whether it's Iran or Saudi Arabia, would you try to use a, uh, but we can track whether they're tried to message people and tell them like, oh, what you guys do and things like that. So also we have the star rating system. So for every user, no matter how much we've verified that information, we put them on a star rating system from like zero stars to five stars.

Speaker 3:          13:38          So we ask people a few, you get messaged by somebody got zero stars, you this person, watch out, watch out, and if it's five stars like people like the New York Times or having linkedin post. So that's. So we, I mean it's, it is dependent on the user and we also tried to make them cautious that they, uh, but as I said, look, you cannot prevent, uh, all types of attacks from this authoritarian governments. Sure, sure. So I want to talk more about the authoritarian governance, but a little bit more about your work first. How much is actually just trying to get these people out versus connecting them with people in the closed society so that they can actually change their societies from within. Yeah, I mean the fact of the matter is, is that many of the activists, we have one to do change it their own countries.

Speaker 3:          14:28          There is a significant amount that actually want to get out. And getting out business is one of the most difficult ones. And I've been somebody who's a refugee myself. I had, it took me around three years and I mean I left Iraq. I went to Lebanon from Lebanon, I went to Malaysia and I had to wait and then like from I left Iraq in 2009, I would have to United States in 2013. So it's like, it's a four year process to actually eventually move, uh, from a closed societies. So most of the refugees or the people or trying to save their life, they go through like middle countries like, so because you're in your own country or most immediate dangers of many people will move to that clause countries and their farm country countries moved to the West. So that is extremely difficult process is that it's a.

Speaker 3:          15:20          But sometimes things change. So for example, one of the cases I've worked on is the case of the Bengali bloggers and as a result of we help publishing them at the daily beast. They were able to give that article to the Swedish Embassy and received the visa as a result because they told them like, look, we are literally like publish it, the mainstream media and, and we are now in Sweden. So is there a risk in a case like that where these bloggers are writing in Bangladesh where we know people are being killed for this just in the last two weeks, several people killed. Is there a risk that when you guys go ahead and publish that either on daily beast or Huffington post or wherever it is, that that brings more attention to it so that suddenly there's this new crop of people that didn't even know about it that now now wants to kill them?

Speaker 3:          16:06          I, I wouldn't think so. I mean, I mean as they say, there is no such thing as half pregnant. You're either pregnant or not. Is that when, when you. I mean they're like a recent tweet by a group called Ansara Islam, which is the Al Qaeda affiliate in Southeast Asia and they actually published all the names of the bloggers ask like. So they actually stole our idea that crowdsourcing terrorism. Yeah. So they like, it's the reverse. If they got something, I got something there and they are crowdsourcing terrorism is that these are the names of the bloggers and this and you should. It's open source to everybody who wants to go and kill them. So many of us, I mean it's, it's, they're already under threat, so people, when actually it's kind of helpful like this, I mean, back to my case is that it helped me that I was published in the mainstream media in terms of getting known and it will be easy for me to get a visa.

Speaker 3:          17:03          So if you are only published within local news media, most of the people who like know about, like the lawyers and the staff will not, will discount that. They will say like, oh, we need something, we can show it to American authorities, like they don't understand Bengali or, or do any of that sort. So, um, so it is helpful to get published like mainstream American media and all these writers in La that just want to get published for. So they get picked up by an agent and you're dealing with the same thing. They're just by, by language. Yes. Yes. And and Mac, the concept of crowdsourcing is like, so like in the case of Bengali, so, so he said they send this article in Bengali and there is another person translated Dr. color from Bengali to English and there was another person as is article and all these people don't know each other, everybody has a certain skill and then there's the publisher.

Speaker 3:          17:53          So these three people work together and they don't know each other, help publishing the article and that helped that getting somebody out to Sweden. So. So that is. So that's the concept of crowdsourcing. Like everybody has a skill that they can contribute collectively to great. A great result. Right? So that's the beauty of it because people think of crowd funding and when I first went to the site and I was looking around, I thought it was really just going to be about money, like we're trying to raise x amount of dollars to get this person out of this country. But really it's about the skill set and linking people that otherwise couldn't find each other. I for, for, for a case like we talked about in our Saudi Arabia, we like, so we depended on partnerships, we're not actually the ones doing the job, but we could have the platform in which all these people work together.

Speaker 3:          18:36          So the organization that did the crowd funding was called recovery from religion, which is like a, I think in Kansas or somewhere in the midwest. Uh, and uh, there is the funds there and so all of us are connected together, so the funds go to their and their users from movements and. Yeah. So it's like a circle of people working together to get somebody out. Yeah, it's incredible. So in a case like this, like this one that we're talking about with Saudi Arabia where he had a. So he had an American passport. So you had an actual American passport. Is this a case, like why can't they just go to the embassy then? Why was he afraid to actually just go to the American embassy? I mean, Saudi Arabia is supposed to be our big ally, right? Yeah. That's what these guys. Sure. Women can vote and all and can't drive.

Speaker 3:          19:20          But I'm not sure what the ally ward here. Yeah. So why, what would be the fear though of going to the US embassy and claiming asylum or something like that? Yeah, I mean, um, I, I don't think that the embassies give a protections because he's like a Saudi citizen, an American citizen at the same time. And um, I mean sometimes, I mean even the, these cases of like other other folks, the US embassy doesn't seem to give that much protection of from people persecuted by, as you said allies because allies, right? So yeah. So that's what it creates attention. So it's, it's, it was a better for him, I mean just to leave the country and go to, to say to the United States other than get a safe haven and he, I mean even if going to go to the US embassy is gonna still be in Saudi Arabia.

Speaker 3:          20:12          So you're going to still be stuck inside the embassy. Do you have like a list of the countries? I mean, I'm sure there's a master list of countries that are close to you guys call them, but what are the countries that are really the most impossible for the secular released or the free thinker or the atheists are all that yo? Well, I mean, what we depend on the definition of free society. Our society come from an organization called Freedom House, so freedom house trucks, all the countries in terms of freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of association. So they have like all the countries and they're trying to put a try to do reports on a basis to see which ones get advised. So which one got worse? So I mean, when it comes to the worst, I mean our to put Saudi Arabia as the worst.

Speaker 3:          20:54          I get our allies, our, yeah, our, our favorite ally, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and Iran. I mean that's, I call them the axis of evil. But uh, so that's an. I mean obviously North Korea, but that's, I mean it's, it's, uh, I mean being anything in North Korea is a problem. Whether that being a believer in the supreme leader of the leader of North Korea. So, so North Korea is probably like the closest yet society we know we know of at the moment and I think there's a Tajik start talking about Stan in Central Asia and uh, this is kind of like the most difficult and also it depends on the strength of there's something called strength of the passport. So like for example, me as somebody who was an Iraqi Iraqi passport doesn't get me anywhere. Like there are only few countries that get me in without a visa and that's the countries I went to Lebanon in Malaysia, like when I applied to United Kingdom they rejected me saying that they require like thousands of pounds in my savings account and touch for six months.

Speaker 3:          21:55          So yeah really. So it's very difficult for countries that have, that. They required a lot of, like they require a visa for every country they go to a to leave that country. But, but for countries like which are in the Gulf region, sometimes it's easier for them to get a visa elsewhere. So there's, the passport also plays a role in how to get people out. Yeah. All right, well that's a perfect segue to your story, which is pretty great. So you grew up, you were born, interact and grew up in. Yes. Uh, I guess we could now be referred to as the good old days under Saddam Hussein. I think of them as the good old days kind of know right now. I mean, uh, I mean it's surely, I mean necessarily to use the word, it's like it's a cluster fuck. I'm his dad. It's okay.

Speaker 3:          22:40          Yeah, I mean I'm living at a living under Saddam Hussein was, was not really great. I mean a w plus I was living under the sanctions when Saddam Hussein was the president. So it was two things. Those are two separate. You had the regime itself? Yeah. The regime. And you had the sanctioned, sanctioned by the US and UK and everybody. Yeah. And I mean it's literally a prison living. What was it like, uh, on any given day you're, you're 13 years old, what was it like? Oh, well, um, I mean you see his pictures everywhere and you have to, like when, when you go to classroom elementary school, you'll have to stand up and say long lifts. Saddam Hussein, when nine slash 11 happened, he declared a holiday in the schools in which my school was like praising the mujaheddin did nine slash 11 because he started like the faith campaign after the Gulf War.

Speaker 3:          23:32          That's what, there's a lot of confusion in which they, they conserve Saddam Hussein to be a secularist. His secular as compared to isis. But that doesn't say much like probably al-Qaeda's secular comfort diocese. Was He really, was he just using religion or was, did you think he actually believed. I mean, uh, it's, I, I don't, I mean I'm not really good in psychoanalysis but um, I think that regardless of whether he was using it for his own benefit is like Iraq as secular as a. sorry, a just society. So using religion is definitely a beneficial to all of the people. It cannot use religion to Sweden for example, but you're definitely able to use it. Plus, he built a lot of mosques and uh, and he was um, also, I mean, yeah, I mean since the Gulf War, I mean he started waging jihad against the west and he start bringing people like almost opposite became the leader of al Qaeda and was he came to Iraq and to like before the war.

Speaker 3:          24:34          And so yeah, I mean, um, so for your life though, so you're 13 years old and what happened when were you having your, sort of, your secular awakening in yourself? Well, I mean the, the lucky part of me is that I was raised in a certain sort of liberal family. I call them cafeteria Muslims. Um, so my, my dad was like said like, Oh, you can think for yourself. And I was like, I was reading the Bible, the Old Testament, the Torah, the Telemundo and all of this stuff. And all of that copy of the Talmud. And well the Internet is, even though it was like the Internet, but there are some parts that you can actually get online. And I've seen that all of these religions make objective of claims that have them being true. So I said, okay, well either one of them is through or all of them are false and I moved like start reading more about science and I just realized that's probably like all of them are false.

Speaker 3:          25:31          But my, I would say like my spark do activism came in after the war. I mean when the first elections happened in Iraq in 2005 and I was afraid of that. The sheer, when they're going to take off the power that Islam is a, she, I was going to take the power, they're going to discriminate against the Sundays and that would lead to a civil war and that. Exactly what happened. I mean, it's very sad to be right on this subject. A actually saw that coming. You felt that? Yeah, I mean it was very obvious. I mean the moment that Saddam Hussein fell down the moment is when the shit starts getting more. Like they start getting more mobilized and you can see pictures of Ayatollah Sistani and mocked up the southern and all of these little figures and it's very obvious this, these guys are sectarian.

Speaker 3:          26:17          And uh, so I, I said like, well secularism is the literally the solution is that try to make Sunni's and equal under the law. And we seen, we seen that success happening when, when the first prime minister I allow, he was a secularist when he was the prime minister. There were much less sectarian warfare happening, but the moment where the election happened is when Islam as part d sharp too one and, and w, which is my biggest agreement with the United States when it comes to you as management of the water, because I always thought that there was not qualified yet for our democracy and there needs to be some sort of transitional period between building a secular, secular civil society and that will take some time. And then you created election, not like after 40 years of dictatorship, you would just make people who many of them are illiterate, would just go for a vote for the best interests of Iraq.

Speaker 3:          27:10          So when we've seen many instances of this as in Hamas was democratically elected, right? Yeah. Yeah. The only example of a democratic is another example of the majority of people because voted for, for a Muslim Brotherhood. I mean one of the things of living under a dictatorship, but what I've noticed is that dictatorships kill everybody with disagree with them. So people are left out, are the, are the ones who don't care about life, so don't care about life that jihadists. So dictatorships for a large extent creates extra radical Muslims because they kill all the moderates and they then give the people a false binary system is that either you want us or you want the terrorists and the same thing happening now in Syria. So like with Assad, his and now with the Russian intervention, most of what they're killing our, the moderate troubles who are in the middle.

Speaker 3:          28:03          So when, when they destroy the troubles, they're going to give the two choices you want us or isis and I can assure you, most people including myself, would choose us. And, and, and that is exempt. So dictatorships create extremism. So what happens is that when these dictatorships have go away, they literally created like a hostage crisis. They created like a prison and you get out of the prison and eventually you would have continuous sectarian warfare and continuous like bad politics and America was obviously not very well versed and dictatorship. There were a lot of focus on like, let's get rid of Saddam Hussein, but there was very little thinking of what after, which is bostic Taylor. She was much more important than just getting rid of the dictator. Right. So where do you place or how much do you place the blame on the United States? And I guess at that time it was a coalition that or at least originally when of course it was mostly as because I think most people in America now, there's a real sense that it was the wrong war to go to and they lied us into the war and all that stuff, which I do it, but the sense I'm getting from you is that there was a ton of really bad stuff going on there anyway and a lot of it maybe would have bubbled up.

Speaker 3:          29:12          Yeah, I mean, I mean there are so many things that were like. I mean, Islamic extremism is done, you it didn't, it didn't start with, with the United States and then started with the CIA or Israel or the Mossad. So these things have been have been going on for hundreds of years. So they send their conflict. I mean it started in Iraq and back at the time, I don't think it was called, but I mean now jeff and Kabbalah is where mom, Jose Hussein, Ali were killed and that's where the split between the Shia I think, and then fast forward to the modern history, you got men empire who was at war with the purchase of a weekend or the Persian empire who are the and where the sun is. So the conflict has been going on for hundreds of years and all these dictatorships and unsustainable. Alexa was unsustainable and America did not intervene in Syria until now, recently after, after the Messiah came back.

Speaker 3:          30:06          Is that, is that still. They still had the civil war between Sunnis and Shias and they still had to isis and al Qaeda and all of that stuff. So it's, it's true. I mean, I never thought that. I'd never think that the United States is the root of our problems obviously, but I think sometimes that the United States, if some policies need to be applied based upon the understanding of the region that kind of prevent or reduce amount of sectarian violence and that in my opinion was to keep some sort of transitional secular regime that can build a civil society that can reduce. I'm obviously it's not going to eliminate a stickler. So basically. So basically if you had had a time machine you would have gone back to right around the elections when they finally had the free elections. Yeah. And then you would have just sort of either.

Speaker 3:          30:54          So you would have wanted either American troops are saying they're to stay just to stabilize it a little bit longer and yet at the same time as an American, even though I know it's all gotten worse in these last three years since we out, we didn't want to stay there either. And that's. I mean, I mean, and the thing that I always go like conversation with neoconservatives and things of, of people who believe consumers, aggressive foreign policy is that is it doesn't fit in with the American political system is like an American political ecosystem. You have elections every four years and like nation building, you're talking about the Middle East in which is, which doesn't get done in four years. It does. Obviously it doesn't get probably 40 years, so. So it is unsustainable to have like a political system in which the president has to change every four years and nation building, especially in the region that is very different, let's say like Germany during World War Two, after World War Two and Japan as that.

Speaker 3:          31:46          Iraq is literally in. It has the worst neighborhood ever have. You have Saudi Arabia, which is the, which is the rule of the Wahabi regime that's not that different from Isis and you have Iran on, on the east, that is the mother lode of Shia Islam and the is in the middle between between and America was expecting like, so come to Iraq and create a liberal democracy in the middle of all regimes that are theocratic, that don't believe in liberal democracy and, and one of them is an ally, which is kind of ironic, is like, so they try like now with the city, they tried to work with non democratic countries to create a democracy. I mean it makes no sense. Makes no sense. It's like the idea that Saudi Arabia or Qatar or, or even Iran would allow a liberal democracy to flourish in Syria and Iraq.

Speaker 3:          32:41          It's a pure delusion. They're not that thrilled with the one liberal democracy that's in the neighborhood. Right? Yeah. I mean, well, let's hope it stays. I mean, it seems to. Seems like Israel is going, uh, I mean as, as I can see is that there's a lot of elements of theocratic a leaderships is now rising up in Israel, which is, which may, which I don't think I don't see Israel content. I mean I hope it's going to continue to be liberal democracy, but I see there are a lot of elements that may not be in the future. Yeah. So against theocratic dictatorships and theocratic routines regardless of religion. Of course. A lot of people, I think when I've seen, I've watched things with you on Youtube where people will attack you for, they'll attack you being Islamophobic or that you are attacking Islam or. But clearly that's not the case.

Speaker 3:          33:29          Yeah, I mean, I mean the fact of the matter is like you cannot see, you cannot criticize Islam and Muslim countries. So even here in the west they created some sort of like catch 22. So if somebody is a, as a white person, like somehow. So they immediately get attack him as cisgender white male was of interesting to hear to from like Muslims who don't believe in science and so there. But if you had to, if somebody like me who is from the Middle East looking to attack him as some sort of uncle, tall mass murderer. So they kind of catch 22. Is that in, in the middle, in the Muslim world, you cannot criticize Islam and if you do it in the West, you will be credited, you will be labeled immediately as a, as some sort of greater as a trader. Right. So this is an incredible thing to me.

Speaker 3:          34:17          So I've had my new eyes on obviously. Yeah. I think, you know, magic, right? I am an acknowledgement of his latest book. So, uh, so, you know, have a little bit. Um, and he gets this all the time. He gets it more than I do. I think that he's a trader or he's an uncle tom or he's a porch monkey. I mean these guys. And again, we've talked about this a lot, but this is coming from people on the left. So what I don't understand is if you believe in liberal values and you want women to be free and you want gay people to be free and all those things and you want a quality for everybody, how do they expect to get it? If not through people like you and Magid. Forget. Forget Sam. Okay. They want to throw him under the bus. What?

Speaker 3:          34:58          He's a great guy. Of course I'm not for that, but what I'm saying is if they want to just remove, they want to use their own version of bigotry to remove him. White Guy, fine. But then wouldn't they look at someone like you that stands up for all those values on the left and say, this is a guy he survived living. Sit down. He now fights to make his country and those other countries stand up for the very values that we as progressives say we're full. And yet you don't get support out of these guys, do you? I mean, I, I do get some but. But I, I know what you're referring to is that the regressive left as much as no one was. Yeah, I mean it's very interesting. I called the unholy alliance that happened between the liberal left and the Muslim rights against the, the or Muslim or secular left in the Arab world.

Speaker 3:          35:46          And uh, so ironically the secular left just to put that altogether, the secular left is actually lined up in a weird way with the conservative, the conservative. Right. Which is very. Yeah, it is extremely, uh, I mean they don't, they don't say it very publicly, but the fact of the matter, I mean they apply extreme different standards too. And I was speaking at UC Berkeley before I came here and I've had some debates and in northern California and I told him, I'm like, what do you call a conservative Republican who is against gay marriage? And he said, I call him a bigot, that he thank you for calling 90 percent of Muslims bigots. They said, I never said that. Right. Okay. Then I told him if you apply different standards to different people based upon their race and because they think that Muslim is the brown technically, right.

Speaker 3:          36:36          If you're not even raised, uh, if you have a few, apply different people, different sizes of, based upon their race, then you are actually a racist. And this, this form of racism is sometimes get get. Um, because most of the racism we talk about is like the KKK. And the fact of the matter is that they agree. So like when, when somebody like the Charleston shooting, the one habit in South Carolina is that the guy said I'm motivated by racism, and they immediately took him for his word and they're true. They're right there. He's this guy who was motivated by racism but replace, replace this guy by Isis. And Isis says, I am literally motivated by this interpretation of Islam. The same guys who said that this game was believable. Racism will say, no, no, this thing has ulterior motives, right? It must be avoided. Economics and foreign policy or politics and George W Bush and Dick Cheney and, and the Olympian, older, they create the solid of everybody they hate and they put him in one category.

Speaker 3:          37:34          And so, so you see like the double standards, extremely obvious. And uh, so as a result of that they can, you created a smokescreen for apologist and, and, and even extremists to flourish in, in like people like me have to fight against the religious right and the far right in the United States who, who consider me like inferior human being, right and, and yeah, and have to fight the religious right in my own country. That was lovely, cried. And then I have to find the apologists left. So like they created extra France for and they, they have made it very much, very much difficult for people like Majid Nawaz and many people who are reformers to actually even have the discussion to begin with because they don't think there is any discussion to be had and it's all about us foreign policy and they always try to divert. The discussion is all about America. It's all about America. And notice now, now that I've more of these people

Speaker 1:          38:36          on twitter and there's probably a good, maybe 40 people like yourself that are trying to reform and coming from these countries and trying to make things better. I see people like you tweeting about coexistence, tweeting about how do we make things better. All that. And I never see it from the regressives I, yeah. They always are screaming about foreign policy or whatever it is, defending our foreign policy. That's, that's not a binary system. It's not a binary and yet. So what is the angle? What is it that they're throwing back at you that they can't get behind what you're doing? Yeah, I mean, I mean they think that

Speaker 3:          39:11          the biggest problem. So they see the world's consumption of like a pyramid. So the biggest problem in this world is cisgender white, male capitalist, rich. And then we actually defined cisgender. I didn't know what it was until about a month ago. I made two. I got to because I got to talk to because of it is as a cisgender because I'm cisgender. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:32          It means that you were born at the gender that you're central.

Speaker 3:          39:36          Yeah. And that's now a privilege. And I was like, I come from Iraq and my brother was killed and I told him that I'm privileged, but anyway, so they, they, they have this pyramid in which there is a, they see the world based upon like race, gender, and, and financial privilege. And they think that the biggest problem in this planet is western capitalism. And uh, they link everything unleash, walled into. It's a very American centric point of view is that they link everything problem in this world as a problem of so. So if, if a, if a brown person and from Pakistan wants to blow himself up to say to defend Jerusalem coat and a quote, they will say that this is as a result of imperialism happening by the military industrial complex connected to western capitalism. So they always lump everything to that and everything is an expression of grievances.

Speaker 3:          40:33          So like you say, somebody is like, I hate Jews. And they say like, well, I mean he doesn't actually hate Jews, but that is his language to express his first ration with American imperialism. So. So they always link everything back to that. Is there a, is there the point is like, and then I can tell people like nom chomsky was like the head of the, of the movement. I would say I would have them on, but I don't think he'd like to talk to someone smarter than him. Well, I mean the. I mean it's, I don't think it's, I mean Sam tried to engage with him and I don't think it's, it's a, you can actually have a conversation is that it's. I mean they, they seem to subscribe to a specific dog. Like I always tried to like make the best of my friends that I can like predict what Chomsky is going to write just by seeing the title of the article.

Speaker 3:          41:26          So I like I make five points. I say this is what Tom says going to say in the, in this paragraph and this paragraph. And I always like get my $50 because I with them, I'm like, what exactly Chomsky is going to say that is about American imperialism is going to say it's about the grievance. This is going to say about capitalism and all his like you don't need to read all his books even though I've read quite a lot, but it seems like I've read two books and all the rest were like, just subscribe to the same. So is that the danger of these guys because what they're doing, even if a certain percentage of what they're saying is right about American foreign policy. I had Douglas Murray on last week. Yeah. Who I thought really said something that I'd never thought of before, which was that he said, you know, you Americans always think everything's about you.

Speaker 3:          42:10          So what you're saying that's what these guys are doing, but let's just say a certain percentage. I mean it's half truths. I mean, I mean many of them. I mean look at, for example, what some apologists say, is that what they say? Like the majority of Muslims don't support Isis. This is true, but it also doesn't support Isis. So the question is, do you support Isis? Are Not saying not, doesn't meet, move you to the moderate. Yeah. You can subscribe to a lot of beliefs that I said you agree with Isis with and you don't need the support. I says, for example, Ayatollah Khomeini, harmony and all of the ayatollahs in Iran, they disagree with Isis, but if you look at how they treat gays in Iran is not that much different than Isis, so like the disagreement, they tell you a truth, which is the majority of Muslims don't agree with Isis, which is true, but that's true if they don't tell you that there's a significant amount of Egyptians and Pakistanis and and and so many countries around the Muslim world, that thing, that penalty apostasy should be death, which is so I think like the purest that has been done on like shutting on what Muslims believe and I asked everybody to read.

Speaker 3:          43:17          It was very intelligent because it asks specific questions. It doesn't. People ask people like, Oh, do you support isis or not? So this nine slash 11 or not. But they ask him like no questions. Do you think that suicide bombing is a, is an appropriate way of dealing with grievances and they use a significant amount of saying yes, and do you think it should be allowed of killing these people who conspired with new Americans? And the Israelis will say yes and a significant bonds will say yes. So show that. So when somebody says so, all of these things, even though some of the parts are true, I mean, as I said, look, I got us foreign policy in Iraq has not been very great and uh, just say the least and there are so many things that should have been done that have not been done.

Speaker 3:          44:00          And uh, so yes, United States foreign policy have a, played a role in, in, in rise of the extremist in the Middle East, but they're not the root of the problem. There is a huge difference between. And there isn't like it was kind of very ironic. It's like the moment they agree, like for example, the abortion clinics that had happened in United States, they agreed that this is a result of religious fundamentalism, right? Many of the Liberals agree that Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz and all of these folks are motivated, are Christian fundamentalists and they are worried about them because they're a Christian fundamentalist, but the moment that this discussion goes into Islam, the moment that know the root of the fundamentalist has nothing to do with the tags, has nothing to do with interpretation and it's all about us. It's immediately goes back and it's very self center like egotistical point of view is that everything is about the United States.

Speaker 3:          44:54          It's not solving anything. I mean I think that's actually a very dangerous as you mentioned, because they are giving a free pass to these people that me and others who are fighting on a daily basis, they were fighting against the theocrats in our countries and and, and the, the regressive light has given these people a free pass to telling them, well, it's nothing to do with. It's all about us. Do you think they consciously aware of it? Because I, I've sort of struggled with this question a bit and when I've talked to people, I think a lot of people. I think Sam at this point thinks that they're fully malicious in what they're doing. I pretty much think so too, but I want to give some of these guys a little of the benefit of the doubt that they're not doing this maliciously. I mean, it depends on, on who are we talking about?

Speaker 3:          45:37          Um, I, I mean I think we need to mention names here because every. I did want to mention names, but the. I mean, I, I think that people like Nam Chomsky and Frankenstein and some folks now I'm a client I think are motivated by an ideology that they actually cared about which is left libertarianism, anarchism against United States capitalism and things of that sort. There are people who are completely disingenuous and completely dishonest and they would, Mr presents all of other people's views like I was. I was, I think. I think all my viewers probably know the names that you're going. There are people who like, like for example, I had a debate on which was featured on NPR Wy and see I bought Islamophobia in New York City and I said there are progressive Muslims, moderate Muslims, conservative Muslims and extremists and they our attacked as being generalizing on Muslims and I said, that is exactly what I didn't do.

Speaker 3:          46:37          Is that the, that the statistics and the research is being done. It's to avoid generalizations is when you say there's like 40 percent of Americans believe in creationism. You are literally saying that 60 percent of them don't. That is, you're not generalizing on Americans, but I kept repeating the same statement and they kept saying that you are generalizing all Muslims as extremists. And I kept repeating and they kept saying the same thing and then they, they go in and, and, and take something out of context and then they put that in a meme and shared it on social media. And somehow I started getting attack as we generalizing all Muslims, which is completely disingenuous. So I mean, what Sam has been dealing with is pretty much what many of us who are actually talking about this subject that I was dealing with is that they are, they're purely people are purely disingenuous on the subject and the day and actually it's kind of interesting. I think that they want to create something, what I was telling you about Bashar Al Assad, which is to destroy all the nuanced approach of the liberal critics of Islam and try to create the battle between them and people like Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer and all of the far right morons. Yeah. And so that way they will give people a binary system and which they tell. You know what? So there was a war between far right, fascist and Muslim medicine people. So which side you can achieve.

Speaker 1:          48:07          I love that. I love that framing because I, I mean I'm getting email literally from all over the world every day at this point. People talking about this middle ground. Yes. That's why I wanted to connect with you and that's why I've been talking about this stuff on the show because I don't think most people are one side or the far left or the far right. Most people are right here.

Speaker 3:          48:26          Yeah. I mean for the. I mean sometimes I'm in on college campuses. It seems to me that the debate is also like it's very polarized. Like I and I was speaking at UC Berkeley and Palo Alto and I, and I'm speaking in Cornell and I spoken so many universities before that I can see that encompasses the debate seems to be much more polarized and it's on the media and the

Speaker 1:          48:52          and, and I'm guessing it's a lot. It's a lot of white liberals on the left.

Speaker 3:          48:56          Yes. It is upset with you. Yes. It, which is which is extremely, so they always want to turn it up by them. I was like, I, I kept talking about like issues like to honor killing in Iraq and things of that sort. And then a guy jumps up. There has to be like a white liberal. They are, so there has to be this guy that was gonna be. This dude shows up at my venue, uh, whatever I go around this state. So say no. It's nothing to do with the culture. It's nothing to do with the legendary. It's all about us. Don't you know about that? Have you have to give me like the lecture about the military industrial complex. Don't you know about Wall Street? Don't pay taxes. The so, so none of the stuff. You're not defending any of it. Exactly. There is no correlation.

Speaker 3:          49:34          I mean, I, like I, I always mentioned this example is that for example, if somebody, let's say a radical Muslim, he walks in, let's say a small town in Arkansas or Mississippi and some redneck goes in and calls them like a San Diego and like, oh, he faced any racism there. And then this person, the same person goes back to his house and kills his daughter because she added the guy on facebook. These two actions are not related to with each other. Is that what some people think is that this guy, because he's facing oppression or racism and some sort does lead, let him to kill his daughter, which something that he believed in probably before he came to the United States. And so yeah, and they think that everything is really centered about oppression dynamics and, and what's happening is that now you can not even talk about the subject without claiming to be a victim and it claiming to be oppressed now.

Speaker 3:          50:24          Like the whole competition is that who's the most victim and that's like I don't really want to go to the identity politics myself because it's like a very crazy world is like all that. Like now I look at websites like tumblr or things like this and was like, somebody identification is like, it's not like, oh I'm from there and I studied there or whatever. It's like I, I'm transgender, gender fluid, a asexual, this, this, this, this is all about like his oppression, like how much is oppressed and that is what is now concerned the biography like in some places. So

Speaker 1:          50:59          at some level, if you could lighten your skin and to change your biography away from Iraq, they'd like you a little bit more in a weird way because they would think that you're helping the oppressed. Yeah. Of somehow being from the place that you're now betraying. Like it's so warped. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          51:14          it's very. Yeah, it's very. I mean that as I said, like they, they look at the wall, the wall is pretty much like as a pyramid and that's what like if you a view blood like the critical race theory and gender theory and it's pretty much all about class, gender and race and there's hardly any mention of ideology and they. So that's the way they see the world. So is there anything that a brown person is doing even though that his culture that existed before the United States or even Israel, they say, well this is as it as well of he's an oppressed by the somebody else on the upper class. But there is a, there are signs of hope. I mean, for example, give me some hope. We've got about eight minutes left. Let's. There are signs of hope strongly is that people go to movements at Oregon, they see like the continuous help, like many of these activists are doing, they're trying to achieve things in their own countries because like when I started becoming an and when I started like being active as myself and, and there were only very few people I see on the Internet who are sacred are free thinkers.

Speaker 3:          52:16          Now I look at facebook and social media and I see tons of thousands from Iraq, from Syria, from Lebanon, from all over the Arab world. Countries like Malaysia has voted for a secular country despite of all the status quo of the region. Is that, is that many people think that the Middle East is like one country. If it's like things out of bad somewhere, it's bad everywhere else. I mean places like northern Iraq, which is a Kurdish region, they seem to be much more developed in terms of human rights, uh, than they have women on the ground fighting Isis. Yeah. Then Turkeys bombing them. That's a whole lot. That's the. I mean I've, as I said, there are signs of pessimism because Turkey has a long secular history and it is going backward with the but at the same time there is a, I mean I would say a very strong position for the Argon in Turkey that needs to be supported and that's, and that's I think like if there's any message I would give to the liberals is like just don't betray us here.

Speaker 3:          53:13          Like the liberals in the way should stand with their fellow liberals on the east and, and just start to apply standards and should not stand with our enemies. That's, that's if there's a message I can say just stand. If you don't want to help, just done, don't stand with our lab. Just make it easier. Well I love that message and I love the fact that you brought it also back to colleges because that's where I started the show today because we know we have all this stuff with what's going on on our yard to Missouri and yelled the recent cases. Exactly. So that's what we were talking about earlier and to me it's, it's a direct extension of what these guys on the left have done. They've made everyone so intolerant. Yes. As you're saying that now it's sort of like they are now reaping what they sowed, Yada.

Speaker 3:          53:57          It's kind of very interesting. It's like it's a slippery slope. They're like, you're going to see over the moment of time they're going to start at talking to each other. So it was, it was a female, the female white feminist or criticizing male white feminists as being male privilege. Now the female is going to get attacked by a transgender disabled person of color. You're the white tiles, tiles, gender nondisabled. Uh, so they're going to start talking to each other and eventually nobody's going to be allowed to speak because anybody's going to claim our fence. And um, that all the trivializing their experience of, of just ended with a funny story. I mean, with people like this is somebody messaged me and he said, she said, you should stopped posting pictures of you smiling on facebook. And I said like, yeah, what's going on over here?

Speaker 3:          54:46          And then she said, uh, when you post pictures of you smiling, you are intentionally trying to trivialize the experience of depressed people. I was like, lol, are you kidding me? And then she like blocked me immediately. So, so, and eventually the 44 does this person get attacked. But other people who may also consider her trivializing their experience by like eating food without hand because they're disabled. So, so, so it just never ends, never ends. And I think, but I'm very glad that there's now a counter movement to who are the real liberals standing against the progressives. And um, because the thing is I want everyone to be treated equally equally as shitty. You don't have to treat everyone as equally great. Treat everyone equally as shitty. That would be fine with me. I want women wherever they are to be treated equal, whether the United States or whether they're in Saudi Arabia, I want gay people to be treated equally where I want the white, CIS male to be treated shitty.

Speaker 3:          55:44          That guy can be treated well, let's hope not. But uh, yeah, I mean that is, that is, I mean, that's what really motivated me when I started my activism is, is literally, I mean, the movement that I started is called the global secular humanist movement in which after seeing so many conflicts about sectarianism and religious extremism rising up, is that the best way is to create a sector of society, secular, liberal society in which all people, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation would live equally without saying that, oh, because it's their culture and things of that sort. Because, I mean, my, my, uh, motto as humans have rights, cultures and beliefs, don't todd rice and yeah, ideas that should be up to criticism and debates and human eyes have to be sustained all across the board. Well, all right, well that's a beautiful ending.

Speaker 3:          56:34          You will always have my support. Well, thank you.
