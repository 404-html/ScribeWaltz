Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02          hey everyone, we're going to be doing something a little different this week. I've got my new eyes jumping on a skype call shortly. He and Sam Harris or cough. There is a new book about Islam and Maajid is a former Islamic extremist himself. A ton of you guys have been asking us to sit down, but he lives in London, so we thought we'd give the skype thing a shot. Actually, he's in New York at the moment. I saw a picture of him and Morgan Freeman in a mosque yesterday, so I'm going to ask him about that and much more in a little bit, but first let's do a little housekeeping. I want to talk about some of the principles we laid out in the first episode and some of the reaction to last week show. It seems that a bunch of you weren't thrilled with my guest. Jimmy. Jimmy is a hardcore lefty progressive and uses some of the tactics I mentioned that I wouldn't be using on the show.

Speaker 2:          00:42          First, let me just say that I can only hold myself to the rules that I laid out if I stopped and mentioned saying every time a guest said, saying that goes against my personal rules, the show would be incredibly slow and horrifically painful. More importantly, as we build a community based on tolerance and other ideas, it's important that we remain tolerant of ideas we don't like. Jimmy is a great friend of mine. We've worked together on air for years. We've done standup gigs together and I've had him and his wife over for dinner numerous times. Yeah, we don't agree on everything, including some pretty big issues, but I think life is about more than just scoring who is right on everything all the time. The most interesting part of last week's response was that some people said the episode was an echo chamber and I didn't push back enough.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Other people question why I even had people I disagree with on at all, and that's the beauty of the Internet, right? We can all be part of the same exact conversation and still see it through our individual prisons. Good journalism is the search for truth. This show will be a battle of ideas, not just having our own ideas reinforced, you know, there's so much intolerance of the other on both sides and I think we can create something that's so much better than that. Actually, I don't just think it. I know it because I see it already happening. Last week I had a hardcore progressive lefty. This week I have a former Islamic extremists turned moderate, trying to reform his religion. Next week I have a gay conservative from Breitbart, Milo Yiannopoulos. I won't agree with all of them all the time, but I most likely won't shout them down either. I have enough faith in you guys that if we have an honest conversation here, the truth will present itself. This of course, reminds me of the Galactic Republic. In the early days of the death star, grandma tarkin wanted to stifle debate because they had the most powerful super laser in the universe. Of course, let's not forget that darth vader said that the death star was nothing compared to the power of the force. The force is on our side. Let's use it wisely.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Alright.

Speaker 2:          02:32          So much and thanks for doing this. We've been going back and forth for, for months now. I've only had to show up for, for three weeks, but we've been going back and forth for awhile. And uh, you're in New York right now? Uh, you live, you live in London, correct? That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So you live in London, so you're halfway between a Los Angeles and London. So I figured we'd do the skype because I don't know when you're gonna be out here. Any, any La plans coming? I don't know. I'd love to come to La and I was good friends in, uh,

Speaker 3:          03:00          on the west coast, but nothing fixed yet. So it's good to have this opportunity.

Speaker 2:          03:04          Yeah. All right, so we'll do the skype thing with you in New York and La. So first off I saw a picture of you that you tweeted yesterday you were hanging out with Morgan Freeman in a mosque. So what, what was that about?

Speaker 3:          03:16          Yes. This is what's brought me here to a New York icon. Explain too much of it at the moment. All I can say is that I had a great conversation with him in the, uh, in the Islamic center of, uh, of New York. Uh, we spent a good hour or so having a chat about the distinctions between Islam and Islamism and, uh, about my story and the work I do. Um, but beyond that we're just going to have to wait and see what else I'm to.

Speaker 2:          03:42          All right, well now he's played God. So I guess he's the right guy to talk to on that

Speaker 3:          03:47          in, in the house of God. I was speaking to a man that played God about God.

Speaker 2:          03:52          Alright, there you go. Okay. So, uh, I want to talk to you about some of the things that you probably did speak with him that. So first, let's just start with your story because your, your biography, what you've lived through to get to here is really, really incredible. So can you just sort of sum that up in a couple minutes,

Speaker 3:          04:08          those who want the, as you know, the full story. It's in my memoir called radical. Um, but, but in a, in a summarized form, basically I joined a revolutionary Islam is group at the age of 16 years old. Uh, I ended up on the leadership of this organization and spent 13 years with them and I played my role in exporting this organization from Britain to Pakistan and then to Denmark and eventually to Egypt. The group's name was his, had. It was the first among these limits groups to popular reaction of resurrecting a caliphate that would seek to conquer other countries and enforce their version of Islam as low. And, uh, the method by which they aimed to come to power was by a military coups. So we are very much focused in recruiting army officers to join our organization and then inciting them towards military coups.

Speaker 3:          04:59          And that's what took me to Pakistan is what eventually took me to Egypt. I arrived one day before the nine slash 11 attacks. And then 10 months later I found myself arrested and detained and taken to the torture dungeons of Egypt, stir state security headquarters in Cairo. And then sentenced after four months in solitary confinement. Sentenced to five years in prison. As a political prisoner, that's at that point is when Amnesty International adopted me as a prisoner of conscience, uh, began campaigning for my release because of course, no, we had views that I now find repugnant and what described as extreme, uh, we were and we had a group still is non non terrorist, which is why it's still illegal in America and across across Europe. So it's, it's the distinction I draw between an Islamist group and a jihadist group is that if Islam, Islam is the desire to impose any interpretation of Islam over society, a jihadism is the use of force to spread Islam, Islam and uh, and, and jihadist terrorism is the use of force to spread Islam Islam by targeting civilians. Um, the group that I joined wasn't. Islam is group. It wasn't a jihadist group.

Speaker 2:          06:05          Right. So I'm glad you made that distinction because I do find that when we're having this conversation and it's being had by so many different people in so many different forms that just the definitions alone are lost. And I know you've done a lot of work trying to just explain that kind of stuff to people so they're able to understand what we're talking about here.

Speaker 3:          06:22          Yeah, positive. The problem is because this is a phenomenon that we've never really dealt with before in terms of human beings have never really dealt with this phenomenon of a, of ideological Islam seeking a, uh, a very bolshevik form of control, totalitarian control over society. We simply as, as, as people didn't have the lexicon to have these conversations. So though I use the definitions, you won't find these definitions, tolton universities or in academic tomes because people will dealt with the problem before. So part of the challenge that we faced was in coming up with very crystal clear logical definitions and then popularizing them. Uh, and so you often, you'll find that I repeat myself a lot and the reason I repeat myself is because, you know, uh, we have to popularize these terms into popularize. These concepts can only come through repetition until everyone finally begins to understand. And it got to a point where the prime minister of the UK understood. So we got somewhere.

Speaker 2:          07:19          Okay, so you spent about five years in an Egyptian prison now that was under Mubarak at the time, who technically, I suppose he was known as the president, but he basically was a dictator that was backed by the US for about 30 years. What? What was that like being in an Egyptian prison? I can't imagine.

Speaker 3:          07:35          Well, it wasn't a pleasant experience at all to the torture. First of all, for the first four days and then we will put into solitary confinement for four months and I was held in a cell as well. All of us are in that period of solitary confinement cells where in which we had no sanitation, no lights, no, no beds. We had nothing but a bad concrete cell in which to a English to try and get through without, without going insane. And so I have with me actually I wanted to show you this because I had a. When I was arrested I had a pocket sized version of the Koran, which is this in my hand here. This, this particular Koran has been with me from the day of my wrist all the way through the torture dungeons through the solitary confinement. Wow. Um, and then through through the four years in prison and, and one of the things I did is in the solitary confinement, we didn't have any.

Speaker 3:          08:27          I need light to read a or anything so and obviously the mind can wander in that sort of situation and you fear for your own sanity. So one of the things I would do is stand by the, by the door of the, uh, of the jail cell has looked for the wait for the light to seep in through the bars. And then I would stand there and read, if you can see is a very small text is actually tiny now. Wow. You, I would read that. I ended up memorizing half of it. I'm sort of in my jail cell, but it was, you know, it was these sorts of things and it's why I've kept it seals these sorts of things that kept me from going a not during the solitary confinement period. And another thing I want to show you is this, this is, um, this is a radio which I had with me is, is a sort of, it was given to me by the British embassy and it was actually on this thing that I heard, first time that we'd been charged.

Speaker 3:          09:19          We hadn't been informed officially by the BBC World Service. I had reported it. And so I was listening to it on this and we found out that we, in fact we'd been charged and then we would go to trial. Um, uh, and finally, I think this picture is up on the Internet when I have the original with me and this is something I stole from prison. Um, and I've kept it with me ever since because it meant it means a lot to me. This is a mug shot that was taken of me so that, that's the day, that's the very day we would drag from the torture dungeon is to be thrown into solitary. So that's before I was actually, before I was actually put into solitary confinement. That's me at 24 years old. And now you see what you see is my, uh, my name in Arabic as you know, was, and there is a prison number and uh, what I've done of course since then is I've taken that number which is in Arabic a two, four, five, three, and I have tattooed on my back as, as a reminder for me actually have those days where I've come from a, which was your original question and the journey that I've made to get to where I am now.

Speaker 2:          10:24          Yeah, it's such an incredible journey. Uh, one other thing on the Gel thing, I find that fascinating that they let you keep a copy of the Qur'an with you because wasn't Mubarak basically, not that he was secular per se, but they were, you know, the Muslim Brotherhood was illegal under him. You would think that he would want no sign of religion to get the prisoners, uh, to, to apprise or something like that. And yet he let you have it or they will

Speaker 3:          10:49          on the country. Now, I'm not gonna, I'm not about to defend Mubarak. I cheered when he was overthrown. It was held in the same cell that he held me and afterwards, so I'm not. I'm not here in any way to defend Hosni Mubarak. What I would say is that the Egyptian dictator and his regime, I already understood the distinction that I now make between Islam and Islamism. Their problem wasn't us holding copies of the Koran. The problem was the interpretation that we and, and, and the ideology of Islam is that I refer to, in fact, they would encourage us to study traditional medieval Islam because they knew that medieval Islam wasn't a Islam Islam, and they would encourage us to be exposed to theologians from us how university we were in prison and that books so that we could read about Islam from its medieval era and understand it wasn't this modern ideological form that we'd come to adopt.

Speaker 3:          11:42          Now I say this and I say it with a caveat that of course, traditional, ultra conservative medieval Islam also needs to be reformed. You know, it's, it's the pinnacle. It's not that of, you know, the, the epitome of, um, of civil liberties. However, what we, what we have to accept, anyone who knows the basic, the basic thing that most basic thing about Islamic history and the development on Islamic theology will know for all of its faults and there are plenty of volts by the way. And fundamentalism largely owes a debt to sort of the fact that they, we, we Muslims generally still revere that medieval period of our theology and haven't developed it since, but it's still very different to what the Islamists project is and a, and an Egyptian authorities knew that. So they would encourage us, you know, they would rather we were a conservative religious or fundamentalist Muslims than members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Speaker 2:          12:37          Yeah. That's so fascinating. And even if you think about what's going on with Egypt now, where we sort of have another version of Mubarak and CC and sort of controlling things and yet, you know, the Muslim Brotherhood was in charge for a year and we back them too. But that, that, that's a whole other topic. So before we move on to some of the other stuff, I saw a clip where you were on real time with Bill Maher from about a year ago and on the overtime segment you recounted a story about a bomb maker that you met in jail. And I was hoping you could, you could just sum that up real quick because I thought, I thought it was fascinating and it goes to very much what you're talking about right now.

Speaker 3:          13:09          Yeah, sure. Um, so in prison that was a, I mean we were imprisoned with the, who's who of the John Seeing at the time. We had the assassins of. I'm the oldest of Egypt, Anwar Sadat who was killed in 1981 group was known as Tom Freeman, Jihad. Those who want to execute. And in that case were with us in prison. We have a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Dr Muhammad and but here has since been reincarcerated as you mentioned. Um, he wasn't the leader of the Brotherhood at the time. He became the leader of the Brotherhood, but he and his entire leadership were with me in prison. We have a leadership of his mctivia and we also had people that came from abroad and the bomb maker that you refer to a particular was from doggystyle next door to Chechnya. And uh, they, uh, he came via Afghanistan to Egypt and an attempt to cross that off our crossing into Gaza to teach us how to make bombs, but he was caught by the Egyptian authorities and they imprison them.

Speaker 3:          14:04          They sentenced him to 17 years and I became friendly with this band and had a long conversation with him, uh, due to the, to the London bombings because, you know, the invasion of Iraq happened when I was in prison and the London seven slash seven attacks in London bombings and sort of the buses and the tubes in London also happened when I was in prison. So I locked it. I kind of got locked into a long conversation with this, with this man about the, in his view then legitimacy of attacking London. And I was attempting to convince him that it wasn't legitimate. Now again, because I used to belong to a non terrorist yet revolution, extreme Islamic group. We didn't believe in jihad isn't input to come to power, so we were arguing with jihadists that actually what they should be focusing on is a minute recoup.

Speaker 3:          14:49          So that's why I was opposing him, not I hadn't yet left. I hadn't yet left Islam is, and it's because my form of Islam, Islam in its method have, you know, it was very different to his and it's sort of how it seeks to come to power. Sure. But one thing I, you know, I'm really proud of is that here's a man who was trained who was fully capable of, uh, of making bombs and then causing mayhem, mayhem and havoc yet, um, when I put it to him, that the justification he uses to say that it's legitimate to target, but just citizens in that they voted for their government would be the same justification one could use for Tux. So voted for their government in Turkey is a member of NATO and NATO as an alliance was involved in Afghanistan. And so, and so why wouldn't he be bumping Turkey?

Speaker 3:          15:36          Um, and his answer that he, the answer he gave me was a pragmatic one. Not a religious one, at which point I called him out and I said, you see, so you know, what you're doing is you're playing politics, you're giving me a pragmatic answer, which is the very thing when Bush does it, you criticize Bush for. Um, the upshot of that conversation was by the end of it, you know, it took him a couple of days or whatever. He knocked on my, on my jail cell and he came back looking really sheepish and he said, you know, I've been thinking about what you said and, uh, I think you're right though. I just don't think I agree with you. It's, it's not justifying to attack a British civilians. And one of the things that really swung him was the fact that so many in the UK protested against the Iraq war. So my argument to him was, how can you be attacking these people? But I'm happy, you know, he changed his mind. I don't know where he is and what he's doing now, but that's, you know, that's a, it's a small incremental step towards peace and reconciliation. And it was one of the first examples that I felt sent me on the path that I'm now on.

Speaker 2:          16:30          Yeah. And that, that's why I wanted to ask you about that because I, I love the story. It's a beautiful story in it and it's about what I think your whole life now is about, which is trying to explain all this to people and actually get people to change. And I think one of the problems we're really having here is that I see both sides on this or however many sides do you want to say there are. I see everybody sort of getting entrenched and the dialogue sort of disappearing. So I think that's a perfect segue. You just coauthored a book with Sam Harris. I had Sam on the show a couple of weeks ago. Uh, it's called Islam and the future of tolerance. Um, so first off, I think people would love to know a little bit more about the nature of your relationship with Sam, how you guys came together. Sam, of course, is a devout atheist. Uh, you're, you're, you're a practicing Muslim, correct.

Speaker 3:          17:17          I don't call myself religious or devout. I'm a Muslim, but I wouldn't want to hold myself up as any standard for anyone to judge the religion by or anything else.

Speaker 2:          17:25          Well, there you go. So that said, tell me a little bit about how you got connected with Sam and what sort of brought you two together to really go ahead and start doing things like this.

Speaker 3:          17:35          So, uh, we, I first met a few years ago when I came to New York where I am right now to debate a Ayaan Hirsi Ali. And the motion of the debate was Islam is a religion of peace. And there's something I need to clarify with that debate is that I've never believed it's saying never sorry. In my current incarnation off believing his, his area, I've not believed that Islam is a religion of war or peace. And this is something I've been ending of my dialogue with Sam. I chose the side of that motion that Islam is a religion of peace because there was emotion and I had to choose whether it was a religion of war or peace and pick a side. I think the emotion was worded incorrectly frankly. Um, the, you know, I, I, there a religion of peace, it's just a religion and religion's are interpreted, um, but nevertheless I sat on the side that it was a religion of peace because I logically reason in my mind that if the majority of Muslims today aren't jihadist or be at many, many, many Muslims are not liberal in the way I would like to certainly not jihadist terrorists.

Speaker 3:          18:38          And so if religion is what people make it, if Islam is what Muslims interpret it to be, then by definition it's a religion of peace simply because Muslims that are by the overwhelming majority are not terrorists. So I sat on that side of the debate night. I debated him afterwards. We ended up in the dinner afterwards and uh, and Sam who happened to be there and I hadn't mentioned before and uh, I, he was called upon by a ions, will asked me a question and he asked me, you know, he said, look, it's all good and well, you being out there and needing to present this view to the public about Islam being this or that. But, you know, here between us in the privacy of this, of this dinner, can't you just be honest with us and tell us that, you know, what you really think about Islam is a religion.

Speaker 3:          19:20          So I want immediate reaction. I was to say to him, are you accusing me of lying? Um, what do you mean? Can I not be honest with you? Are you implying that I wasn't honest outside, they're on the platform and it became a very, a hostile exchange which ended, that it didn't go any further and everyone was a bit embarrassed around the table. We didn't really develop beyond that point and then we didn't speak for a couple of years. Um, and, and so then Sam reached out to me when I think he'd watched me at the Richmond for, um, when I was reunited again where they on this time. The good thing was, it wasn't a debate, it was a conversation. And that's actually the richmond parameter. Thank you. The people from the Richmond form of watching this, I want to thank them because the format that they got, the same moderator John Donvan moderating the debate at the intelligence squared, a exhaust earlier on occasion.

Speaker 3:          20:10          Um, uh, but instead they got a on myself and Emam Ralph who had been the, uh, the email or the main Manhattan mosque and instead of having a motion to debate, they just said it. We only have to have a conversation. So that really allowed for me to be in the middle because he was arguing Islam as a religion of peace. I almost arguing it's not that it's a religion of war instead and allowed me in the center to say, guys, you know, actually I yarns got something right and you've got something right. And there's actually something in the middle here. And uh, that, that I think that conversation really set the precedent for what happened with Santa me afterwards because I think he saw that. I think almost really impressed with the, the, the, the, the, the tone that I talked with her in that conversation.

Speaker 3:          20:52          And I was really happy with the research, with the way in which we, she reciprocated my overtures to have because I think that really laid the foundations for what happened next. And then Sam reached out to me and said, hey, can we kind of have that type of conversation for my blog? Because, you know, he interviews people on his podcast, he publishes it on his blog. So I said, well, yeah, sure, we, we, we sort of had this, um, uh, exchange over the phone and he transcribed it. And I said, Sam, this is actually really good. I don't think you should put it on your blog. I actually sensed this is a book that gets, you know, that could really influence a lot of people. Um, and so then he approached a Harvard and, and uh, I called the editor in chief at Harvard, uh, agreed. And uh, that, that's the story of the book which hits the shelves in a week.

Speaker 2:          21:35          Yeah. So, so we'll talk about more about Sam in a second. But I think something interesting that you said about Ian is that, so I think a lot of your critics are a lot of the people that are critical of everyone on your, your side of this is that, that you guys all think exactly the same thing, but, so I'm fascinated that. So you and I actually don't agree on certain elements of this.

Speaker 3:          21:57          Well, you see, that's the laziness and the knee jerk reaction, the emotional reaction, which is born of fear, the fear of dialogue and a fear of actually having conversations with people, um, that we may disagree with, is that actually the best way to ignore the consequences that dialogue can work. It's a tiny share, everyone with the same brush and it's two, in fact, you know, effectively slander everyone. Um, and that way that we are justifying to ourselves and those who are listening to us why dialogue isn't a good thing. The truth is that, um, even after this dial this, and there are probably many things that he and I don't see eye to eye on him with a on as well. And, uh, but the important thing is in recognizing that dialogue is a process. It's not a, uh, you know, you don't just snap your fingers and somebody agrees with you. Um, and democracy itself, by the way, liberal democracies weren't born in a day. The reason why we use the word mature democracies will be referred to countries like United States. The United Kingdom is because they've had centuries over which time they've matured. And that's what the kids use. That analogy. That's exactly what a dialogue with people you disagree with, is that they hadn't matures over time.

Speaker 2:          23:06          Right? So there's been a bunch of people you can name them if you like. We've talked about them a lot here and I'm almost, I'm almost tired of talking about them at this point who are writing some pretty horrific things about you, uh, you know, the worst kind of slanderous stuff, calling you names that if anyone on the right called you, they'd be condemned. And, and rightfully so, and I'm seeing so much of this coming from the left and these are the people who I thought would be the one standing up for all the things that you're talking about here, the words that you're talking about, conversation, liberalism, all of these things, uh, and you're getting it from the left. What, what do you make about that?

Speaker 3:          23:43          So let's away from the individuals and, and look at the movement and, and, you know, the individuals at the end of the day, you know, they, whatever they say about me and wherever they are and have used a certainly one, uh, as bad as I was when I was a revolutionary Islam is so I hope they can change you're a good way. What I believe in change and I hope that people adapt turned into phase. If they do change their views, I'd be perfectly happy to continue being friends with them. And Reza Aslan, who used to sit on my organization's board in London as a member of our advisory council and we disbanded it, uh, two years into a founding organization. So it hasn't existed for about five years. But, you know, we used to, another guy, we invited him to London for a foot, he's spoken at my offices in London, acquit him.

Speaker 3:          24:26          So, you know, people change and I'm hoping, and I'm hoping that we can resume of accordion, a form of relationship with all of these guys. You know, I just think that if I can, if I can be a go from where I was to where I am, I have faith in humanity. But it is important to talk about the concepts because that's the only way people do change by the way is when, as happened with me, is when those ideas are challenged and in a way that tries. And it's difficult. We're all human beings. We all have emotions. We will have egos, but in a way to challenge those ideas without making about the ego because, but actually just really making it about the concepts themselves. And so what you've referred to is what I've come to refer to as the regressive left. And uh, and what I mean by the regressive left is because they're, you know, not all of the people on the left wing, progressive leftists are just like not all Muslims are Islamists.

Speaker 3:          25:18          And so what I mean by the regressive left Aba is this phenomenon of people on the left wing of the debate who are, who see between their duty, their ideological duty to challenge, uh, you know, foreign policy mistakes, American and British foreign policy mistakes. So what they interpret as colonialism and the color and they conservativism they see it as their duty is challenged this. And then they see another challenge which is theocracies and uh, and you know, the Islamist ideology and they, they have come to the, they've come to the, uh, to the view that you can't challenge both of these together because if you were to challenge his limits theocracy, your are your supporting neoconservative foreign policy. So they, in their minds, they prioritized. They've said, you know, neoconservative foreign policies and bigger evil organized violence and chaos in the form of military invasions is worse than randomized nonstate act of violence and chaos.

Speaker 3:          26:18          So we're going to go after, if they believe they're engaged in a war, we're going to go after the, this is their mindset. We're going to go after the organized violence. And the reason why sometimes you see duplicity in their statements is because they genuinely believe it's an ideological war. And so it's necessary to even engage in propaganda to defeat this bigger evil, but we believe in which is the organized violence and war now. And so why I call them aggressive. It was because in doing so, they make alliances with some of the most regressive, theocratic, fascist, totalitarian, barbaric, murdering, and justifies of murderous regimes across the world, right? So, you know, whether it's Hezbollah terrorist organization that's county fighting alongside the dictator asset and, uh, to fight with a against the Syrian people. And the reason I use the example of his mom because the man has just been elected to the, to the Labour party leadership in the United Kingdom, who's, uh, who's actually born on this regressive left phenomenon has, has been a historically has been very close to groups such as support groups such as his Blah [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          27:25          So that's why I'm siting in this example. So when was his beloved, whether it's Hummus, you know, on the one hand I can see the frustration of people who want a, a two state solution which includes a secure free and independent Israel and a secure and free and independent Palestine. But that frustration shouldn't legitimize, uh, the uh, supporting an organization that has at the heart of its policy, the legitimization of targeting civilians. And so what's happened is when I called the regressive is that they've allied in there are anti colonial prioritization with some of the most regressive theocratic organizations that are out there in the world. And then, and then, and then they feel it, they feel that anyone who, uh, who criticizes those organizations is, is by definition with the neoconservatives. So they must attack them. And that's what's going on. And I take the view, actually you can criticize, I opposed the Iraq war and the invasion of Iraq from my jail cell in Egypt. I have never supported the invasion of Iraq. I've never supported a conservativism on a member of the Liberal Democrats in the UK. I've never been a member of any conservative party, I've never been a conservative, uh, or, or supporter of wars in that sense in my life. So, so you can oppose those things at the same time. You can oppose a theocratic fascism. We can haul two thoughts at the same time and it's not impossible to do. And I encourage everyone to try it.

Speaker 2:          28:47          Yeah. I love how you wrap that together because you're right, it's two thoughts at the same time. And when I talked about this, we're Sam, you know, he was saying that they want to find this nugget in you and once they find this thing that they say you have, not that you say you have it, but that they say you have, then it's somehow discounts every other liberal principle that you have, which is why suddenly I'm hearing from them that they'll call Bill Maher is suddenly a neo-con Bill Maher who has, I think stood for every liberal principle been against every war that I can possibly think of. Um, and I have a suspicion that unfortunately, what these guys are doing, I think for the reasons that you laid out very well, I think they're actually strengthening the extremists on both sides, right? Because they are strengthening the Islamist extremists because they're not challenging them. And then they're strengthening the, uh, the extremists because they're saying they're making it seem like there's this one set of ideas that can't be talked about. And secular people want to talk about all ideas, right?

Speaker 3:          29:50          Well, if we, if we have come to refer to this as the voldemort effect, you know what I mean? It's the, it's the Harry Potter books in which I'm a j, a k, she devices really clever mechanism. The people in the story are so fearful of the evil of voldemort that two things happened. One, they can't, they don't read, they don't believe ultimately is actually alive. They think he's dead and they refuse to admit accept anyone that's telling them to vote. One still lives on. The second is that they're so petrified, or this photo who they believe is dead, uh, that they can't even name him. So they refer to him as he who must not be named. Um, so that's what I mean is the votable effect. And that leads to, you know, when you can't name something that actually is staring at you in the face and you're so scared of it, but you deny exists and you don't want to name it.

Speaker 3:          30:43          That increases the hysteria. So, you know, when president trump says we must defeat the evil ideology, well which evil ideology, right? You know, and so then you mean the average dude that stands up in Donald Trump's rally and says, when are we going to deal with America's Muslim problem? Or Carson who says, you know, he doesn't want a Muslim president when they say these things because the evil ideology, when they hear that word, what they mean by that is Islam. And by default, every Muslim who identifies with Islam, which is why they don't want to Muslim president. So what we're doing is by blurring those lines, we're increasing that hysteria and actually the fee and the bigotry that we're trying to avoid. So what I argue is for those two reasons, and actually more importantly to empower a reforming Muslim voices within Muslim communities because the first victims of theocratic fascism will be those Muslims themselves.

Speaker 3:          31:33          It will be the Muslim women, it will be the, uh, the minorities. So the Yazidi women, it will be the Coptic Christians in Egypt, it will be the liberal Muslims, it'll be the apostates, the ex Muslims, there'll be the game Muslims and the lesbian Muslims. These are the ones who first suffer under, under the yoke of the aquatic fascism. We need to also provide them with a lexicon that they can deploy it in their own internal reform debates. So if you don't, if you don't recognize Islam, Islam, what are they going to say? Is the problem when they're having these debates within their communities, Islam, the religion that's going to get them killed immediately in the first place. Aside from the, you know, the intellectual point that. What do you mean by Islam and religion? It's interpreted in a million different ways. God, yeah.

Speaker 2:          32:10          That that's such a good handle on why this is so difficult because we're talking about ideas, we're talking about people, we're talking about religion, we're talking about a political movements is just so much at once. Um, so just to sort of re, uh, just to bring around this, this part of it, um, in terms of dealing with these people, the people that have been writing all these things and all that. How, how personally exhausting is it for you? Because I see and I've read, you know, where Sam has said, you know, he's not going to do anymore. And he said to me, even that, then suddenly it's like he has to say something because it's not fun being lied about or slandered or smeared. And, and as I said before you and away get it worse, a tweet by one of these guys just this week to you was about how he's going to report you to the Department of Homeland Security when you come to the United States because he doesn't want an x terrorist here. I mean this is really horrible. So how do you just deal with it on the, on the personal level? It's exhausting, right?

Speaker 3:          33:05          You see, the thing with this tweet is really raises an interesting insight and again, you know, I hope this guy changes his approach to this, but the interesting thing this raises is, is a liberal guy who extensively opposes profiling at airports, which by the way, I've always done, I've always been a. I'm a, you can find more that I've done against profiling then any of these voices, if you Google Google on youtube, there's a whole debate on that on BBC news night, which is the flagship news show in the UK against the left wing Labor policy member of parliament who also happens to be Muslim who was advocating profiling, uh, five years ago. And I was debating him on that. So, you know, this is a city idea, so I've always been against profiling. But so was this guy who sent the tweet you just referred to get.

Speaker 3:          33:50          What's interesting is suddenly when somebody is breaking out of the group thing, think and disassociating themselves with the tribal identity that, that, that we use to, uh, to have this us and them kind of gaining a, that we referred to earlier that, you know, you're either with the neocons, are you with us, uh, and that kind of awesome them relies on this tribal identity. When someone breaks free from that tribal identity, refuses to belong here or there, suddenly you find that it's open season, that all the principles that we use to actually tarnish the neocons, the neocons who want to profile Muslims, it's the neocons who are racist. We're using that same racism against those dissenting voices. I was called a porch monkey, right? I was called a native informant. I was called a Muslim by white non Muslims in this instance,

Speaker 2:          34:42          really reputable people. This isn't just random eggs on twitter saying, no, no,

Speaker 3:          34:45          no, no. These are, these are journeys that worked for established, um, organizations with lightfoot established blogs. And then on top of that, you've just mentioned somebody saying, I hope dhs reads that department phone. It reads your book before you come to the states because I don't want an x terrorists coming into the into the United States and put aside the fact I was never a terrorist. That's advocating profiling by somebody who a literally a day earlier had been on CNN accusing Sam Harris of advocating profiling. Yeah, and so, so it's suddenly what happens is when you break away from that group, a kind of tribal group think it becomes open season and that's why I said earlier that I think what's going on here is they genuinely believe they're engaged in a war and so in a war, all of these tactics become legitimate because the objective is to win. It's not to find the truth, and I think that's of the problem.

Speaker 3:          35:37          That's why I think this dialogue and this conversation is so important because what we do is we break down that hostility, so I keep referring. That's why actually it's a lesson to myself as well. It's so important to remain polite with these guys because whenever they say to me, if I. If I reinforce that notion that they've somehow managed to convince themselves that this is a war, and if I respond in that manner, they will double down and they will continue to act. This is a war and that anything is, is, uh, is permissible. So, you know, that's why I try and, and deescalated and I fail sometimes, but you know, it's important for me to keep trying.

Speaker 2:          36:10          Yeah. I feel the same way I, I try as well from the little piece of this that I'm part of and I've tried to engage some of these people in a respectful way and unfortunately, you know, as Sam as illustrated quite well, it's hard to debate when you have your facts and then the person you're debating is debating what they think you say or what they want you to say. Not, not what you, what you actually say. Um, you know, I think a little bit of this also is what Bill Maher refers to as the bigotry or the soft bigotry of low expectations. Do you feel that, that somehow these people, and again I'm talking about the white liberals in this group, that they think because you think differently than they want you to think that that shows racism, right?

Speaker 3:          36:55          You could call right now into your show when you, when you do your production, uh, an image of me talking me talking to Sam Harris and, and being quarter porch monkey for it. Yeah, I mean, talking to Morgan Freeman now. Now the question I ask is why? Why would none of these guys in and they haven't done? So why would any of these guys not cormier porch monkey for talking to Morgan Freeman? It's not call me his native informant. No. Call me his porch monkey. Yet when I'm talking to a white man, his porch monkey, they call me his native informant. That's the racism of low expectations. It's the assumption is that when a brown man is talking to a brown man, it's a meeting of equals. But when a brown man is talking to a white land, the Brown man suddenly loses all agency and can't think for himself and his following the white man's thoughts.

Speaker 3:          37:43          And yet, the irony is that I don't even use that form of identity politics to describe people. I don't see people as white people, Brown people I see effectively I use, I, I like people to look at people as their values. You know, if someone's liberal, if someone's Islamist, if someone's a conservative, that's how I look at people. Um, because it, it tells me where I stand with them. It's a much more than skin color does, but these are the people who are, who are ostensibly anti racist, deploying that full of racism. And you will find that, you know, I tweeted the, an image of Morgan Freeman and nice yesterday. I'm putting it on my facebook page. I have not once heard any reaction from any of this, a regressive left phenomenon, uh, uh, in, in the sense of being cold, his native informant or his house or his porch monkey. It hasn't simply hasn't happened and that there is a best example of the reverse racism of low expectations.

Speaker 2:          38:33          Yeah. So I had been using the regressive left also. I just started using it in, in the last few weeks. And a few of my friends that are in this space aren't thrilled with me because of it, but I think what you're exposing there is a fatal flaw of progressivism because they view things in the prism of identity politics. It's very hard to extricate someone with a separate idea or someone that doesn't fit the cliche and you're literally a walking, breathing example of that, which is explains why you get the, the shit that you do.

Speaker 3:          39:05          And it's important to mention at the same time when I'm sitting there on a tweet out that I, um, I was Morgan Freeman in the mosque explaining, you know, having a conversation about the difference between Islam and Islamism. It is important to mentioned. But at the same time I got lots of reaction from people saying, uh, the difference between Islam and Islam. Islam is in your head. I'm actually in the same thing. So there's also that side of the reaction, you know, I'd get it from that side too. People insisting that Islam is what they believe it to be, which is what are kind of in the. And then I'm just engaged myself in a form of apology for, for what Islam is. And so it's, it's, it's difficult to try and strike this balance where, um, you know, we need honesty in this conversation. We need people to accept that there's a, a problem with Islamist extremism and there's also in fact a challenge in dealing with, uh, taking Islam out of its medieval heyday, the paradigms and the theological paradigms that were developed in the earlier that we simply haven't moved on from.

Speaker 3:          40:04          And, and actually that means that a whole bunch of Muslims. So the Islam is obviously don't write me a whole bunch of traditionalist, non Islamist conservative Muslims don't like me because I talk about reforming the interpretation and then a whole bunch of anti Muslim people on the other side who want me to apostasizes don't write me because. Because I say Islam can be interpreted a and they want me to say that Islam is evil. Uh, so, you know, you ended up getting kind of stuck in this middle of this. It requires a lot of patients.

Speaker 2:          40:29          Yeah. Well, I guess if you have a lot of people hating, you might be telling the truth.

Speaker 3:          40:33          How about you? You don't need to be a believer in Islam to concede the point, which is the point I was making with Sam, who I think has since shifted in his view and he's accepted that he's feeling has changed somewhat on this point. You don't need to be a believer in the religion of Islam to concede that texts can be interpreted. It's not as simple as saying, I'm going to go to a restaurant and order a lobster and if you bring me a chicken, why did you bring the chicken when I wanted a lobster? Because it's got the menu says mobster. You're ordering one thing that what we're talking about is a Amandla bit like a car manual. When something's gone wrong in the engine and reading the whole thing or working out what the diagnosis is, you know where the particular relevant parts are, how you put them together.

Speaker 3:          41:14          When you're talking about complex ideas like that, like interpreting scripture and adapting them to the time and space, we find ourselves in, you know, by definition, it's an exercise in interpretation and that's why even with the US Constitution, you've got the same document being used as a source for pro choice and pro life people or pro gun laws and gun restriction people using the very same document to make their arguments because the dispute is over what that document means in this day and age in the first place. And so you don't really need to believe in the scripture to concede that there is no one definitive reading of Shakespeare. There's no one definitive reading of the Bible and there's no one definitive reading of the Koran.

Speaker 2:          41:50          Yeah. Alright. So one more piece on this portion of all this, what do you make of the term Islamophobia? Uh, because to me the term itself has a lot of problems with it because I don't think people fear Islam as in the religion. They fear if there, if there is a fear. For some people it's the actions. They fear the actions that people are taking in the name of the religion, and again, that I know that can be confusing for people because that's the idea verse the people, but I do see this meme of calling everyone in Islamophobia and it goes, of course, to a lot of things we've talked about so far, but I fear that, that their use of that word also is creating a real, uh, a real backlash to what they want to accomplish.

Speaker 3:          42:34          Well, the sea, often this word is deployed to silence. You know, it's used to kind of muzzle the debate when people have every right to criticize and scrutinize and satirize any idea whether it's Christianity, science, whether it's religion, whether it's Islam, any idea, um, is open to scrutiny in the patent. That's the, the, the essence of progress. It's how all societies have ended up where they are today. Um, every innovator for their day was a blast. Fema, Galileo questioned things that he was called a heretic for what's considered a heretic for theory of evolution. And so, um, you know, and even profits were heritage acts against the old religion. Um, you know, whether that's Mohammed, Jesus, Moses, so at the end of the day, if it wasn't for blast for me, if it wasn't for, in other words, questioning established norms and heresy, we wouldn't have progress. So to use the word Islamophobia, to silence any scrutiny of an idea would be to hinder this debate and the progress that is needed in this debate.

Speaker 3:          43:34          I don't like the term for that reason and I think it's deployed to often against people who are simply questioning whether the, whether Islam needs to be reformed or not, or whether Islam. Islam has a relationship to Islam, which of course it does. You know, Islam. Islam is an offshoot of Islam. It's wrong to say it's got nothing to do with Islam and so people don't have in asking these questions to deal with some very real problems in the world. I've been called Islamophobes and that's actually unfair. I prefer the word anti Muslim bigot. There is such a thing as our anti Muslim bigotry. There are people who like Carson, who don't believe in a, in perhaps don't believe in evolution, but they also don't want Muslim presidents of the United States.

Speaker 2:          44:13          Well, what do you do with a neuroscientist who doesn't believe in evolution? Those things don't seem like they should add up,

Speaker 3:          44:18          but it kind of indicates, you know, they, they're. So there is something about people that have a, they want to discriminate against people like me because of the religion I was born into. Right? That, that's, that's anti Muslim bigotry, but that's very different to scrutinizing the idea and that's why I developed this maximum, which again, I'm the dialogue with Sam and that isn't no idea, uh, should be or is ever above scrutiny. No idea is above screws and even though people have been a dignity. And I think that really nicely summarizes where we should stand on this debate.

Speaker 2:          44:46          Yeah. That's actually a great segue for my next question, which is, what has the reaction from just sort of the mainstream Muslim community in England been to you? Because when I, even when I tweeted out that we were going to sit down and do this, the majority of it was positive. Now obviously we have a certain amount of people that follow both of us and know what we think about things that enjoy what we do. So that's expected. But I did get some people that said, oh, you know, it was, it was this porch monkey mentality, oh, he's just doing this for, for money and affection of white people. And a lot of that, what I think is pure nonsense. But what, what about the mainstream Muslim community, uh, that you're around every day?

Speaker 3:          45:26          Well, look, you know, mainstream Muslims on Islamists, they are conservative, but they're not Islamists and there's certainly not jihadists. Uh, and so, uh, while they're not going to do, even if they disagreed with me, is they're not gonna, you know, they're not going to basically attack me for it or, or launch into a tirade at home with them even if they disagreed. Now I'm, I'm very realistic about where I stand among my own religious communities. And that's because if I had just restricted myself to challenging Islamism, I probably would have had the support of the other welding majority, the mainstream of Muslims, but the other alarming mainstream also happened to be in social and religious matters, conservative with a small seat. And I challenged that to I call for reform in our approach and interpretation of the scripture. I'm a liberal socially, uh, as well as politically and um, and I mentioned I'm a member of the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom, which is the centrist party there.

Speaker 3:          46:21          Um, and so, you know, I have very openly supported a lot of social reform on these issues. And I think that, you know, we have some acid Quilliam who advocated for the reconciliation of evolution, Islamic create these granite creed that was incredibly controversial when he did something, he was kicked out of his mosque, uh, for that. And that's not an Islamic mosque, it's a conservative mosque. And so the reason that, that, um, that you will sense a lot of backlash, it's because we take on the twin challenges of, uh, wanting to again, another sort of maximum is that what we want to do is that Islam is a, must be intellectually terminated, uh, whereas Islam needs to be reformed. But that's the twin challenge that faces us. And it means that obviously because no change is seamless, all change is painful. A lot of people get upset when they kind of hear some of the things we say, but that's the nature of change. I mean, you know, that's how society has changed. It's, it's, it's, it's normal.

Speaker 2:          47:19          Yeah. I know you might be slightly hesitant to talk about this, but can I ask you just in terms of your own personal safety, I'm sure you are. You are threatened. I know that, that a lot of the other people in this from bill to Sam, too many others have a certain amount of threats that they deal with from, from all fronts. By the way, you know, I think from someone like Sam, it comes from people from radical Christians too. So I don't even, I don't even want to make this about Islam or Muslims particularly, uh, but people I think need to understand that you put yourself at great risk to talk about the things that you're talking about, right?

Speaker 3:          47:51          Yeah. I don't want to dwell on this, but it's not exactly the safest occupation in the world.

Speaker 2:          47:57          So there's a lot going on in, in England politically right now in Jeremy Corbyn, who you mentioned earlier, is now head of the Labor Party. What's the general sense of the political atmosphere in England right now? Because in America we get very, very little. Even if I just flick on BBC for a second, I mean we have very, very little of what's going on with, with basically our biggest ally in the world.

Speaker 3:          48:18          Yeah. It's interesting because we are facing the inlaws on what's happening here with the phenomenon of the rise of Donald trump. We've got Jeremy Corbyn who is populist in the way that trump is on the left wing of politics and it's the same discourse. And actually that's why you have the horse horseshoe theory of politics. You know that actually ultimately you're left and right. They come and they end up when they go to the extreme, that meeting in the middle anyway. Yeah, Mussolini's Fascist, and I'm not calling a fascist by any means, but mostly in his fascism was a left wing phenomenon that emerged into totalitarian fascism. So they ended up meeting. And the reason that, so if you look at corbion and trump, what they both have in common is they're antiestablishment approach. Um, is that a total disdain for politics and the way that things have been going on?

Speaker 3:          49:08          Um, they, they want to change the status quo, that playing on popular anger, which in many instances is there for legitimate reasons. But in other instances it's playing up the identity politics. They identify the other. So in trump's case, the Mexicans and the wall that the city idea of building a wall that he wants, you know, identifying the other and allying with some unsavory people to achieve that. It's all part of the parcel of, of the politics of our, of our times and across Europe were witnessing this phenomenon with the rise of far right populist parties. And in Greece we had golden dawn, now we got series series a, which is a far left populist party. And uh, in Scotland we had the Scottish nationalists who wanted to break away from the United Kingdom and the other for them where the English. So, um, because for whatever reason people are feeling particularly vulnerable and insecure, they are rallying around identity politics and defining themselves against somebody else. And I think that's a particularly, it's a very unhelpful, unhealthy way to engage in politics and it leads to more division, which is what we see playing out across a lot.

Speaker 2:          50:10          Yeah, not only do we see it playing out across the world, but now you know, we have this massive refugee crisis which you guys in Europe or are having to deal with much more than we are in the states now. Europe already has a huge problem with integrating their immigrants as a general rule a, especially in Muslim. Right? So what, what do you make of what England or what the rest of the EU should be doing or can be doing with the refugee situation?

Speaker 3:          50:37          I think the important thing is integration. I would caution people and they will be in the United Kingdom. We are overdue isis attack. So not if, but when Isis chooses and decides it's capable of striking in the UK, I would urge people not to blame the refugees. These are people who are, uh, in some cases who have fought isis in Syria and Iraq and then a flat since then or in other cases were fleeing for their lives because they disagree with everything that Isis is doing. Of course among them there may be one or two fighters and uh, but that's neither here nor there because 1000 born and raised British citizens of concert joined isis anyway. So they're, they're, they're finding it easy enough to recruit from UK born citizens, let alone having to sneak them in with refugees. So if there are attacks, I would urge people not to blame these poor desperate refugees who need our help.

Speaker 3:          51:29          And our sympathy and our understanding and what I would consider what I would say is important to consider for governments. On the other hand, is not to repeat the, is when, what you mentioned integration wasn't seen as important. And so what we ended up developing in Europe and in Britain, I can speak to what he's self segregated communities that didn't mix with one another and they, they grew up, you know, it's possible in 2015 to be born and raised in London as a Muslim teenager and not have a single mom, Muslim friend, nor a single friend from the opposite sex. And I just think that's not a healthy psychological state to be in. So I would encourage governments to have really, really robust and strong integration policies.

Speaker 2:          52:11          Yeah. Uh, do you think that that's even possible because they're already dealing with the integration problem that exists? It seems to me that the conversation has been dumbed down to the point where if you say anything, if you were to say, well we shouldn't bring in more refugees right now that people would immediately call you racist, which the truth probably is somewhere between, you know, there's obviously a certain amount of people that are going to be xenophobic no matter what. And then there are also some legitimate concerns about what the, what this can do to societies. But we so rarely have this conversation, right?

Speaker 3:          52:42          Yeah. And it's, you know, at the end of the day I'm, the immigration conversation is a bit like the Islam isn't conversation then it's immediately shot down and accusations of bigotry. The first, you know, a lead costs, if you like, of those who want to shut that conversation down. It is important that these conversations are in fact thrown open in the recent history, the political history of the United Kingdom. We've seen the consequences of not having these conversations because when these debates were shut down by the, the, the, the mainstream parties. What happened as a result is the rise of a two groups. One is street protest movement and the other political party, the Ukip United Kingdom Independence Party that wants to break away from the union and monster and all immigration. That party, which, uh, which started taking a chunk out of a conservative support base arose at lightening speed in the UK. How do you, by Nigel farage, precisely because the main political parties didn't want to talk about racism.

Speaker 3:          53:41          And so, uh, uh, an uglier version of that conversation happened on the outside, on the fringes of the mainstream because we didn't want to talk about it. And the other thing that happened was the rise of the English Defense League, the EDL. So, uh, what have been Europe's largest street protest movement. I began organizing rallies and demonstrations up and down the country because conversation about Islam, Islam. So what I advocate and the reason why I'm so a, so a so heavily for having these conversations is we don't have them in the mainstream in a responsible way. The fringes, we'll have them in an irresponsible way. And that's the danger of the voldemort effect that I refer to. And that's very much what I'm trying to do with this show, which is why I'm going to have people from all over the political spectrum here because we need, we need these conversations.

Speaker 3:          54:27          So just one more thing on the refugee thing. What do you make of the Arab countries that basically aren't taking in their brothers? I mean, I think Saudi Arabia has led in maybe 30 families or something. All these countries we're seeing Egypt's not letting anyone in Turkey has done a lot. Turkey's not in our country but all but all of these countries that are doing this. What do you make of that? So, uh, to, to we have a caveat. Here's the Gulf Arab countries that had let in zero refugees whereas Jordan, Lebanon, uh, and, and these surrounding countries that aren't Gulf Arabs have millions of refugees. And so there is that distinction to be made. Jordan is overflowing with refugee camps and tents and so on. But the Gulf Arabs, uh, you know, the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, these countries, Kuwait, they, uh, they, they, they think that actually they think that their responsibilities, I've been met simply by providing funds to the refugee camps.

Speaker 3:          55:22          And I think that's a particularly interesting point there too, to look at it as to the, uh, just with like, just as with the Syria conflict, there are certain responsibilities that the regional powers have to deal with conflict in their own back gardens and in their own region. And unfortunately that hasn't been happening. On the one hand, we complain when the international community led by the United States of America intervenes and you're on the other hand when, when no intervention is forthcoming, we complain because we're saying that no one cares about all the women and children, innocent men who are dying. And actually the only way around this is to say, okay, if you don't want international intervention, then take responsibility for your own region and uh, and intervene yourselves. And that applies to refugees and it applies to the war in Syria and dealing with that through political and diplomatic and military needs. And I, I'm, you know, I'm very critical. Unfortunately I don't think these Gulf countries have been doing even nearly enough regard. And by the way, I don't want to just blame the Gulf countries or any of the Arab states because we

Speaker 2:          56:23          just saw at the UN in these last couple of days, there seems to be now be this new alliance between Iraq and Iran and Russia. And again, as to what you just said, the more the US pulls out, it seems as though the worse it gets. And every time we go in, we seem to make it worse, so, so there are no easy answers here I think is the, is the ultimate conclusion. Um, so I, I have one more thing for you because I've been trying to end all my interviews on, on some sort of feeling of hope and actually you've done a nice job of giving us some hope that this whole way through. But I really sensed that there has been over the last couple of months a real secular awakening. I sense it in, in the response I'm getting to the videos, the facebook messages. People are sending me emails, the tweets, the whole thing that people that secular people that want to base their values on humanism and not on, you know, magical sky gods and all of that stuff that they're really waking up. And I, I think you've had a part to do with it. I think Sam, I think many other people do you sense that too? Please tell me you do or I'm in a lot of trouble.

Speaker 3:          57:22          I said it's particularly that more voices that I call them minorities within the minority, people on the left that we've spoken about earlier. They traditional care about the minority communities, but actually I'd say to them that if they really worth their salt, if they really want to test their metal, what they should be caring about. Other minorities within those minority communities, the gay Muslims, the lesbian Muslims, the Muslims, the, the, the liberal Muslim, a Muslims and the minorities such as the Christians in Egypt of the CDS in Iraq. So those minorities within minority communities. I since have been rallying and waking up and galvanizing. I think I sense more and more Muslim voices coming out to speak against not just Islam, Islam from also a Islamic religious conservatism and we get messages every single day. We get people asking to join our organization to help us to work with us. And I think that's really fantastic because if we're going to really defeat at the scourge of theocratic fascism and if we're going to help reform the way in which Islam is interpreted the today and those voices are really the crucial voices that we need to hear from.

Speaker 2:          58:26          Yeah. Well you've been a huge part of that. So I thank you for taking some time off while you're in New York. Your book with Sam, Islam in the future of tolerance is already sold out. The preorders are already sold out on Amazon. It's coming out way. It's coming out in a couple of days in the bookstores, right?

Speaker 3:          58:39          Yeah. It will hit the bookstores very soon and then everyone will be able to get a copy and then actually after that the kindle version will come out to a. There is a kindle version coming out, but it will come out after the pets. A hardback version. Here's the bookshelves.

Speaker 2:          58:50          All right, well I'm, I'm really glad that we got a chance to do this. Almost face to face. We can see each other but. But one day we'll be able to have a beer. And do it for real and good luck with all your work. Appreciate it. Thank you.
