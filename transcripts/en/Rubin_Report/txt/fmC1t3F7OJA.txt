Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Rubin report presidents week with five shows in five days on five former presidents of the United States in partnership with learn. Liberty continues today and joining me now is a professor of history at Western Connecticut State University and author of James Madison and the making of America. Kevin got made. Welcome to the Rubin report. I'm happy to be here. I'm excited to talk to you because this is big because you are both an expert in James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. Now everyone that's watching this knows that Thomas Jefferson is my favorite founder. I'm going to give you a little room here to play and by the end, see if you can convince me that James Madison should be my favorite founder.

Speaker 2:          00:00:47       Oh, well, I'm not sure I want to play that game because actually the reason I wrote a book about Madison is because over time I had come to think that his reputation was generally exaggerated among scholars that although he did very important things and I think he should be remembered, he wasn't as important as people were remembering him as having been. In fact, in this, he's similar to Alexander Hamilton who doesn't deserve all the accolades he's received from the musical Hamilton.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Oh my. Well, you're shooting everywhere

Speaker 2:          00:01:16       now. I'm saying they were admirable people, but there's a tendency among biographers to make their guys the central guys. So Hamilton becomes the greatest American ever. Madison becomes the smartest man ever. You don't. You don't need to do that. If you make him the real fellow, he's still extremely interesting and important.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       All right? And I think that really is what your book is about, making him the real value in showing some of the flaws and some of the mistakes he made along the way. And we're gonna get into all of that. So let's just start at the beginning. What should we know about James Madison's childhood?

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Ah, well, Madison was born. He was the first child of the most important man in his county, which was Piedmont Virginia, Orange County in those days, the Piedmont region, which is the area just off the coast of Virginia, just out of tidewater, was the western most extent of European settlement. And his father, James Madison senior, was the wealthiest man in the county. He was the largest land holder. He was the largest slave holder. He was the county lieutenant, which means he was the commander of the county militia. He was ahead of the vestry, which means he was the head of the lay organization that ran the county, a parish of the established church. He was just the most important person. What this meant for James Madison junior was he was set. He was going to inherit all of that. He was going to be able to have the kind of education that virtually nobody else in Orange County would get.

Speaker 2:          00:02:38       In fact, he's maybe the only person in his cohort of Virginians who went off to Princeton to college. Most people would go to the colonial college in Virginia, William and Mary far inferior institution in those days to Princeton. We could talk about whether it still is today. That's probably a different show. That is a different show. It's, it's an interesting question. Um, but anyway, and James Madison Junior, because of his tie to his father and his father's eminent place ended up having a, not only a more elite kind of education, but also a different outlook when it came to human nature, the relationship between government and individuals, individual rights and especially what I think is the area in which he was most important. Freedom of religion than other people.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Yeah. And he was key in making sure that separation of church and state was part of the US Constitution. Everything that's were we're going to get to all that. Do we know anything about his father's politics or even just with even interested in politics when he was young?

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       There are, there wasn't what we would call politics in colonial Virginia. There were, there weren't parties, there wasn't kind of party division. Essentially. People were uh, more or less all the same elite group. They had a common interest. Virtually everybody who lived in Virginia was either tobacco grower, a slave on tobacco plantation, somebody who lived in. It's a small town that's the only kind of towns there were in Virginia and sold tobacco or was a lawyer who worked for tobacco farmers notice a common theme here. So because people had a very similar kind of economic life, they didn't have the kind of political division we think of as normal.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       It's interesting. It almost, it sorta sounds pre politics all together. They were just sort of local and you kinda had to do what you did. Yes, pretty much. That's really interesting. So he goes off to school and is this where he starts becoming more political?

Speaker 2:          00:04:29       Yes. Well what happened was he went off to school in New Jersey and unlike William and Mary, which was Episcopalian, the established Church of Virginia was the Church of England.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       Is that one of the reasons he didn't want to go there because we're going to get into a little more about his feelings about religion, but obviously he wanted to go to a bigger school, but was it also very much about the religious school?

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       Well, we don't have any indication that that had anything to do with it. It seems that the reason he went off to New Jersey was because of the very crude state of scientific knowledge in those days. So if like James Madison Junior, who remains the smallest man who's ever been president, if you had what he called a sickly constitution, than you would want to avoid the vapors around Williamsburg. People thought there was something in the air that made you sick and they had no idea of mosquito born illnesses or any anything to do with sanitation. So he went off to New Jersey because he was afraid he'd get sick if he went to Williamsburg, which is on the James near the coast. And so, um, it was kind of fortuitous that he ended up at Princeton under the tutelage of somebody who was a minister, but not an episcopalian. And so were episcopalians at the time had a kind of latitude and area in a very liberal religious understanding of people's motives and people's personality.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       And so on. If you had gone to Princeton and studied under John Witherspoon, who would also be a signer of the declaration of independence in time, uh, you would have been under the tutelage of somebody who was a presbyterian. That is somebody who took calvinism. Seriously. Somebody who thought men were naturally corrupt, somebody who was skeptical of the motives of other people and taught that this is the way a Christian should understand human psychology. And so if you think about, if you're familiar with and think about Madison's key political writings, for example, famous federalist number, 51 where he says if men were angels, no government would be necessary, but until we're governed by angels, let ambition counteract ambition. That sounds like John Witherspoon. He wouldn't have been saying that if he had gone to school at William and Mary. Interesting. So a lot of his individualism was really born there.

Speaker 2:          00:06:38       Yeah. And the funny thing about that is though, that although the various elements of what I've been saying have to do with weather spoons, religion, and the religion of Princeton, generally madison was not in a Presbyterian. We have very limited information about what Madison's own personal religious beliefs were, but it happened that he came back to Virginia and within a couple of years there was serious. There was one of the intermittent waves of persecution of non episcopalians and then he ended up in a correspondence with a fellow he had known at Princeton. This guy was from, from Pennsylvania, so he had gone back home to Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, like New Jersey had been founded by quakers and so never had any kind of established church. Quakers disbelieved in established churches. So Madison ends up writing to this friend of his from Princeton who's in Philadelphia and saying, Oh, I'm ashamed of what's going on here in a.

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       In a nearby county. We have half a dozen men who are in jail. He said, close jail for no other offense than just preaching the Gospel. Teaching people the Baptist understanding of a spiritual reality, and of course that was illegal in Virginia. So they were thrown in jail. Madison in this fellow. Then think through the question, well, how ot government to be involved in the individual's religious lives and the conclusion that Madison came to was, it shouldn't. That is he thought and he was going to come to this conclusion and helping to write the first American Declaration of Rights to the Virginia Declaration of rights of 1776 that the traditional English liberal and in Anglo American liberal position on religion, which is we should have toleration in England. They had a rule that you could be any kind of Protestant you wanted, which sounds very, very oppressive to us. Slim version of the thing is though that in the context in the 18th century, if you were French, you had to be a catholic.

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       If you are Turkish, you had to be a Muslim. If you were in England and you were not an episcopalian, you couldn't be in the House of Lords or couldn't be in the House of Commons. You couldn't go to Oxford or Cambridge, but in general the English role was we'll tolerate you. We won't punish you for not being an Episcopalian. So that's not like France or Spain or or Turkey and I'm Madison, ends up with this idea that toleration isn't enough and so when they're drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the first American bill of rights, the committee version of a religious article of the declaration of Rights of said Virginians will be entitled to the fullest toleration matters of religion. That was George Mason's formulation. He was a very liberal fellow when it came to these questions. And Madison, age 25, the youngest man in the room says, I disapprove of this.

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       I think that toleration implies that the government one knows more than the individual to is in a supervisory role over the individual. And I think these are both incorrect ideas. The government should just stay out of these things. So Madison said, I propose an alternative that we should say Virginia's are entitled to the Free Exercise of religion. And when Mason heard this explanation, he said, I endorse this. And then the committee, the whole convention voted and they voted unanimously for Madison is formulation. So in my book I say, and this is not a common view, I say, I think this is the most important thing madison ever did. He came up with this idea that government should, should not be telling people what to think about the afterlife, about religious ethics, about what church to attend. It shouldn't say we're going to be tolerant of you if you're wrong, but we're going to have our own right views as was going on in England. And he would of course later be the one who ensured that this phrase, ology free exercise will be in the federal constitution.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       Gosh, you gave me a lot to work with. They're so. It's such an. It's such an interesting point though, that you're making, because we talked so much about tolerance these days and he was saying back then, no, no, no, no, tolerance isn't enough. We need, we need true freedom. Here was he really worked through that easy. I mean everyone, George Mason and everybody heard it and that quickly or like, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       they agreed to include it in the declaration of rights and they agreed as soon as, as they got to this question of formulating their own new form of government during the revolution, they agreed that they would discontinue taxing people to support the Anglican Church, the episcopal church, but it was going to be a long struggle to have formal this establishment of the Church of England in Virginia. So Madison was central to that too. He and Jeff Jefferson wrote a bill called the Virginia statutes religious freedom now, but he proposed it. It was defeated Madison 10 years later ensured that an alternative taxing people to support whatever form of Christianity you wanted would be defeated. And then he brushed off Jefferson's bill and said, we need, we need to pass this. So it happened. Virginia became the first officially secular society ever anywhere. It's really incredible. So he was 25 when he started this. So how old are you? What I done? I'm 41. I'm 54 and I've done nothing right. The Madison came up with this one. If he had dropped dead when he was 25, he would still be one of the 10 most important American.

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       Yeah, it is incredible, but it's such as we're going to get to all the other things. He did that through line to all the freedoms that we have right now. You briefly said that we don't know much about his actual religious beliefs. Do we know anything actually because there's. There seems to be this debate these days about what they want. Most of the founders actually believed because you know, they were talking about rights from God and yet so many of them obviously Madison but Jefferson included and others were also so it was so important to talk about a separation of church and state where they all just deists do we have a sense of, have any insight into that?

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Well, we have information about some people, but the term founders is very nebulous. What do you mean by that? That's the problem. So often people say, well, all the founders believed this and they're talking about six guys or eight guys. My, uh, my own view is that that term should be understood to include people who signed the declaration of independence, who were involved in Philadelphia Convention and writing the constitution who were in the ratification conventions and agreed to the constitution who were in the congress that proposed the bill of rights, uh, who were involved in the debate about whether to adopt the bill of rights. So I use that term far more broadly and if you understand the term broadly as I've just been most, most overwhelmingly Americans were very religious in general. They were evangelical Christians and so they did not have this kind of, um, to each his own attitude about these things that Madison or Jefferson did

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       so, so in an interesting way was their reasoning for church and state to be separated. Not so much that they were anti religion but, but the, but because they saw the way religion was so intertwined with, you know, the monarchy and the government back in England without. Was that really the key of it? It wasn't necessarily an anti religious stance.

Speaker 2:          00:13:28       Well, it wasn't only in England. Madison wrote a, a, a, a pamphlet. I'm in the seventies and eighties called memorial and remonstrance against religious assessments and there he was answering that proposal I mentioned before for having a general tax in Virginia to support the Christian congregation of one's choice. Right? So Patrick Henry had said, we've had a decline in morals in Virginia during the war. We want to resuscitate them in one way to have that happen would be to return to a situation in which people actually go to church, which they support a church, so we're going to say not that you have to support the church of England anymore, but you have to choose something. You have to choose one and designated. And so Madison in response to this, among other things, wrote a pamphlet called Memorial remonstrance against religious assessments where he argued against having the government support any religion at all. And his grounds for making that argument was that this had been a harmful. A tendency of governments forever. Right? So it wasn't only in England, it wasn't only particular time. He argued that it had been harmful to people into societies in general, wherever it had been tried, which was essentially everywhere. And he wanted that to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       Do we know anything about what they all thought this whole crew, whether you count the founders as the six to eight or sort of the broader group that you're talking, that they really

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       realized how important the work they were doing was? Sure. Yeah. Actually, it's funny, although a John Adams in Massachusetts and Thomas Jefferson in Virginia didn't know each other at the time. Each of them when he was very young man wrote a letter in which he closed by saying, save this letter. People are gonna. Want to read my letters? Jefferson was a teenager when he, when he said that, and by the time he died, 68 years later, I'm 67, something like that. By the time he died, he'd saved over 30,000 documents he'd written and the same John Adams and attorney writing to his beloved Abigail Smith. Later Abigail Adams said, saved this letter. People don't want to read my letters. And actually people like Jefferson Madison and Alexander Hamilton, Washington, they saved all their documents. They saved all their notes. They had the idea that what they were doing was really important and they also had the idea that there was inadequate information about the, the fundamental commitments and decisions of most other societies.

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       So they wanted to make a record. It's just fascinating to think about it. It's truly before the birth of a nation and we're doing this in places where they couldn't tweet at each other or get on the phone with each other and I haven't really figured this well. If they have been able to tweet, they wouldn't have written much. Right. So that's the thing, you know now, I mean, I feel kind of sorry as a historian of late 18th, early 19th centuries for people who want to work on contemporary stuff because we've seen. I mean, even if the law says save all your emails, you might find $60,000 and just disappeared. You know, who knows what happened in. And the plan is that nobody will ever read that. Right? Well, of course the special council found it, but for most people I have a feeling that just, just reams of this stuff is trashed and that means future historians have no information.

Speaker 2:          00:16:41       They're going to have a cascade of stuff and there are big libraries full of books, but most of the secret things we'd actually like to be able to read that went into their decision making. They've intentionally wrecked. That's why there's such richness to this, you know, hundred year period or so. Um, do we know anything about who the other formative people were around him? Who were the other people that really influenced his ideas? Ah, well, there are people he read, but a witherspoon is in a place for him, like William Small, who was a professor at William and Mary, who had the most influence on Jefferson. And then Madison had particular past writers who were really influential with him. One was the borrower and a French political scientist who wrote a book called the law, the spirit of the laws in which he examined Roman history in British history and tried to deduce rules of political science. So Madison carefully considered, wants, excuse writing, and adopted some of it as his own and then morphed other parts of it so that you couldn't recognize them as having come from Montesquieu. But you can see that the influence of bunch of skin is very significant for him. So that's, that's one example there Sir William Blackstone and who was a leading, uh, English legal thinker was influential virtually across the spectrum of American legal and political thought that Jefferson said negative things about him, but he was influenced by him anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       Besides that, historians, Greek and Roman writers, you know, if you have little kids reading the ceased to see spot run, they're going to learn that when they're a little bit, if you have little kids reading about cincinnatus and his is a short lived dictatorship in Rome and, and a renunciation of dictatorial authority at the end of the war, then they're going to learn that kind of thing when they're little a. So this is one reason why I think see spot run is very harmful to people. You know, even if we're, we have our youngest children learning to read that way. We might think, well, that's the best way to have the kid come out with a 3000 word vocabulary, but when he gets through he hasn't learned. He doesn't know anything. So. So, uh, the point was that there are, there are a few roman historians and Greek historians when we can see having influenced virtually all of these people. They were all influenced. Now, I'm sorry, they were all educated by learning Greek learning, Latin, reading the Greek poets, reading the Roman poets, reading the Greek historians, Roman historians, Greek philosophers. They actually argue about which Greek philosophers they like and don't like. And so can you imagine, you know, let's have a debate between, I don't know, Joe Biden and Mitt Romney over your favorite Roman historian. Yeah. So, so we just know nowadays people who are quote unquote educated, even in our supposedly finest institutions, they don't come out of it knowing much.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       Yeah. Well that's, that's why I like asking these questions because it's like, wow, these guys really were the thinkers of their time to read all the intellectual work to become the people they are versus now. I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       and it just happened that the, the educational establishment of their time was pumping stuff into their brains that would be not only useful for politicians, but also useful to make a man, a good man, to help him decide what good meant, to help him decide how he might follow that path. And today again, I think, uh, the education system of which I'm part is kind of void of this consideration even

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       we do. We could probably do a whole show on that. Obviously. We talk a lot about the education system in general here. You mentioned his wife briefly. What else do we have to know about his personal life as he's somewhere in his twenties now, before we get to all the other stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       Well, James Madison was slight. He was reserved. He was quiet. There are various people who met him and said he was unattractive. He was not good in a group. So he ended up in, when he was in his thirties, he had a kind of flirtation, which apparently became serious, at least on his end with a much younger woman. And, uh, it seems from his cryptic statements to Jefferson that maybe he was planning and engagement and then that fell through and then later on we all know of Dolly Madison, who was a widow whom he ended up marrying. She had been married and had children, one of whom had died. And then she had a surviving son. The two of them were married for very long time. People who saw them together, so they seem very happy somehow. They never had any offspring, so we, I guess were left to deduce that more likely than not, he was physically incapable, but we don't know that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Um, but in any event, he didn't have any fiscal offspring. What about the nature of his friendship with Thomas Jefferson? Because they, they definitely had a lot in common, but there was definitely stark differences as well. Right? Well, they had, they had quite a lot in common. I think nowadays it's interesting for scholars to ponder the extent to which they were divergent. And I think if either of them recognize the divergence that was more Madison who realized that they weren't exactly a like, can we just briefly, let's do some of the things that they basically agreed on. Okay. Well what did they agree on? What they agreed on? Republicanism. They agreed on freedom of conscience. They agreed that the state and the church shouldn't be related. They agreed that in general you'd like to have a nowadays what we call a non interventionist foreign policy because that had all kinds of, or I should say that the opposite of a non interventionist foreign policy would have all kinds of negative political, philosophical, social, economic consequences.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       So both of them agreed where possible stay of wars where possible just have free trade, don't, don't try to jigger your economy and your network of trade relationships to, to favor yourself. And, and uh, the two of them agreed about a monarchy and how harmful it had been over time and various European countries and that, that was to be avoided. So these are the main things. And I think also, although I said before, we don't have good proof of Madison's own religious commitments, Jefferson was one who you may know people like this who didn't have, who didn't have any friends who disagreed with him about major questions, you know, somebody like Madison or John Marshall or John Randolph of roanoke or some other contemporaries of theirs had friends with whom they had market disagreements. But Jefferson. No. So it's very much against my ethos. Yeah, you're moving.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       So I think the thing is that, uh, um, at least in so far as Jefferson understood it, they must have been pretty close when it came to these kinds of questions. So what were those divergent? Well, Jefferson was a more radical thinker. He was less trepidatious about trying the novel, about overthrowing the established. So for example, he wrote that he thought that every constitution should be void after 19 years. Well, Madison had played the key role in writing the US Constitution. He thought had been a near run thing. At one point he said he thought it was a miracle by which he meant it was very unlikely that you'd end up with any kind of agreement in Philadelphia in the summer of 17, 87, let alone that will be ratified by all 13 states within, you know, three years. So he didn't, he didn't want to try that again.

Speaker 2:          00:23:55       For Jefferson and the, the practical pragmatic question of whether this was feasible was less an issue than, well, is it a good idea? Is this what we should do? Do we want to be able to say that you have literal consent from everybody every once in a while. And so where did the 19 years. Well, he, Jefferson had come, had calculated that had a generation, was more or less 19 years. So he thought that if you had an end to every constitution every 19 years, then every person who lived in a, a, you know, a kind of a standard, a lifespan would have least once or twice when he was involved in agreeing to a constitution, agreeing to a political system. And in general, you should live under a political system to which you had agreed, but nowadays we have the idea that, well, okay, society in general, Americans agreed to the US Constitution even though you didn't. And I didn't. Uh, I guess if you're an immigrant, you have to agree to it. But, uh, if you're born here, you don't. And that Jefferson thought this was a problem and we want to avoid this, we need to figure a way around it from Addison. Don't talk about that. This was really hard to do, you know, and it's not likely it'll be better if we try to remake it. So

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       he's feeling they're really. That we would sort of forget about the freedoms that we started with and that every generation would kind of forget and we'd sort of keep wiggling.

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       Well, there was that too, actually. He said at one point, I wish I could recall the exact words, but he said something like, from the moment the revolution ends will be on the decline. Right? So his feeling was that people's attentiveness to these questions of political legitimacy, the proper structure of government, the extent to which an individual's humanity ought to be respected by the system and society, the acuteness of people's awareness of these things would immediately drop off and then we'd continue to drop off. And so how do you prevent that from ending in? Well, the people in government pay attention to. Nobody else does. Periodically you have a new constitution to create it. You have to go through the whole process again. Everybody's going to be involved, it'll be a hot topic. And so for Madison this is speculative and wow, this could have really bad results. So

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       Huh. It's interesting because I think you can make probably really strong arguments on either side of that. So this must have really been a point for the two of them. Yeah, they, they disagreed about it in print and in writing. Yeah. So James Madison wrote, I mean there's so much stuff that either he was directly writing, like the federalist papers that he was editing and zillion other things. Is this a good point to talk about the federalist papers we need to live up you want. Is there anything else we should lead up?

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       Let me just say about them in general that they are highly. Their influences. Highly exaggerated in the general understanding. Really the. Yes, because I told got a bottle of wine that's called the federalists Madison's picture on. It's a standard issue, a silhouette of Madison. I. I is celebrate the person who designed the logo, but the thing is among those of us who are specialists in this area, there's a kind of consensus that the federalist did not persuade. We cannot prove. We cannot identify one person who was persuaded to vote yes in a ratification convention because he read the federalist and was persuaded. So in other words, the idea that you're kind of taught in eighth grade and then in high school, you know, and then law school if to do that is well, here are these. Here are these papers that were used to go out and get the people to support the constitution.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       That was their purpose, but we don't know that they did and in fact by the time the last of them was published, that is by the time the last of them was seen by anybody anywhere. Eight states had already ratified the constitution, so clearly our eight states that weren't persuaded by at least those last ones, and then there were all. There were some states where none of them were published in any of the newspapers and there was no state other than New York where they were all published besides which in New York. It was not the federalists that persuade people to ratify the constitution. We know that for a fact. Well, what happened was that by the time in New York came around to considering and it okay, well maybe people don't know, but the constitution says in article seven that the constitution will go into effect among the ratifying states.

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       As soon as nine states have ratified, whether there were 13. So as soon as two thirds of the states have ratified, and what that meant was that each state was supposed to have like a state legislative election, except it would be an election just for delegates to this convention that would decide one question. Do we agree yes or no to the constitution? So by the time New York, uh, met, um, oh, there were already there. We're already a eight states that ratified the constitution. Then Wild New York convention was meeting New Hampshire. Ratified that made nine in Virginia. Did that, made 10 New York was going to be 11th. Then when they had their election in New York state for delegates to the ratification convention, two thirds of them were people who had promised a vote for me and I'll vote no in the convention. But when they had the convention, um, they got word while they're out at that New Hampshire had agreed that made nine.

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       So now it's going to go into effect. Then they heard Virginia had that made 10. Now it's really going to go into effect because George Washington can be the president. Right? And so that leaves us North Carolina and Rhode Island. Well, if we stay out, we're going to have an independent country of New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and then the federalists from New York City had a newspaper published an article that said in case New York votes no on ratification, New York City will succeed from New York state and joined the Union as a state. So then you'd have the independent country of upstate New York. And at that point the one of the leading anti federalists and the convention made a speech in which he said, we don't have a choice.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Now we have to vote. Yes. So notice I didn't mention the federalist and this whole discussion, right. Had nothing to do with it. That's really fascinating. Because I was going to ask you at before you started answering, I was gonna ask you well with the states that had said no, would they have had any recourse. But basically you're saying their own. Yeah. Actually by the time George Washington was inaugurated president in April of 17, 89, there were 11 states that are read by the constitution. So there were 22 senators that are 11 states represented in the House of Representatives. Two of the 13 states were independent countries, North Carolina and Rhode Island, and they were treated as independent countries. And eventually they talked in Congress about. The question was, well, what should we do about the fact that Rhode Island won't join the Union? Maybe we should cut off trade with Rhode Island and make it a little little dot on North American map that doesn't have fridge.

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       Yeah. At any way. Finally, because, well, what else are we going to do? Rhode Island agreed to the constitution, but when they first had their election in Rhode Island about instead of having an election for ratification convention, as soon as the Philadelphia convention ended and said, okay, here you need to ratify the constitution, become a member of the union. Rhode Island had a referendum on should we have an election for a convention? And they voted like 90 percent. No, we don't even want to vote on whether to vote. No, we just know. Wow. And so when they finally got around to having a, um, most people were overwhelmingly opposed to it, but they finally ended up agreeing to it because what else are we going to do? The other 12 states are already in the United States and besides that are staying out means they're talking about things like creating the judicial system, recommending a bill of rights.

Speaker 2:          00:31:16       Rhode Island's got no congressman, they're not participating in any of this. They're going to end up in the union anyway. So they finally joined. Again, this has nothing to do with the federalist papers. I still want to get great version of the federalist papers. But what have been the argument for people saying no at that point? I guess, I mean, in Rhode Island. Yeah. Well, um, during the, uh, this is gonna be hard for people who are listening to understand, but in the 18th century, if you said money, like when I say money and you think of an image in your mind, money, uh, that's not what they thought of. I thought of gold and silver coins, right? What that's called Specie. And what they had begun to do in Rhode Island was print notes Bay, what were called bank notes. We get paper money and a printing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       This notes is just a way to inflate your way out of debt. And so there were a lot of debtors in Rhode Island who liked this printing money and getting them out of debt. So they just kept voting for people in the legislature who would do this? Well, the constitution said that a state could not make anything but gold or silver currency. So in other words, if you joined the union, you can't keep printing money. Rhode Island had this paper money party that was not going to agree to this. Yeah, that's why they put it off forever. Interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       90 17. 90 was when they joined the union. Yeah, it's over a year after Washington was inaugurated. Alright. So I want to do the eighth grade version has of the federalist papers. That's why I want to circle back there for a second. Okay. That's really fascinating. And I don't think most people know that, that they didn't have the influence that we now believe them to have. So for the eighth grade version of this, really, he was just trying to get people on board signing the constitution. That was, that was the general idea. But what actually was in there, was it a real sales pitch? People that just really don't know. Okay. What's a know about the federal? Actually the people who you keep saying the federalist papers, and I keep seeing the federalists, the term, the title, the federalists papers was not given to this document until 1961.

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       Originally it was just called the federalists author was Publius, which was a pseudonym for John Jay. James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. Um, they wrote different essays. There are two or three where we think probably Hamilton cooperative. Yeah. But anyway, so that was the only thing that was the compilation. So they put them all together and it's, it's one series under the pseudonym. Nobody will not make that error. But the, uh, the purpose of the series was that Hamilton lived in New York and he knew, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, that they had their election for a ratification convention in New York. And two thirds of the people they elected voted no so or promised to vote no on the convention. So what do we do about this? I'm at the Philadelphia Convention. Hamilton had been one of three delegates from New York. The other two left. After a few weeks they gave speeches in which they explained we were sent here to propose amendments to the articles of confederation, not create a new government.

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       One of the two who left was the chief justice of New York. And when they got home to New York, the governor of New York was entirely against this. Right? He agreed with them entirely. We're not going to have a new constitution. We don't want any of this stuff. We don't want to transfer a lot of authority out of New York. And so no, we're against it. So Hamilton knew that most people in New York, political establishment didn't like it. They had elections voted against it. What are we going to do? Well, maybe I could go directly to the people. So his idea was to have a series of newspaper essays maybe to get voters to change their minds. I'm not going to persuade the governor or the chief justice. They're both definitely set, but maybe through a newspaper series we could get people to change their minds. So it's kind of interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:34:53       He, he went to a friend of his name, Gouverneur Morris, the guy who actually wrote the constitution. So if you think of the expression, the actual constitution, you see that fancy Henry Gouverneur Morris, his handwriting. He was one of the delegates from New York and Philadelphia Convention, I mean from Pennsylvania in the Philadelphia Convention, and he wrote the constitution. Hamilton asked Morris, will you please help me write this series of essays for the papers to persuade New Yorkers is part of the constitution. And Morris said not, don't write for newspapers. So then he went to another friend of his former congressman named William durer and he said, would you please write some essays? So Dora wrote three essays that were going to be in this series in Hamilton, read them and said, now these aren't good enough. So dual, republished them as a separate pamphlet. And then he talked to John. Jay. John Jay was actually probably the most famous New Yorker at the time, and Jay said, yes, I'll do it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       But after he wrote a couple of them, he got extremely sick. He was bedridden for weeks, and so he ended up writing only five of the 85 essays. So now Hamilton's now what? And it turned out that this, this, a Virginian congressman who had been in the Philadelphia convention, Madison was back in New York City where Congress was meeting. He was a member of Congress too. And he asked Madison, will you help me write these for the newspapers? I got to do something in Madison, said, sure, I'll do it. So that's why Madison ends up being kind of second most important author of the series. Um, the thing about the series is in my book on Madison, James Madison and making America, I devote a lot of space to the federalist, not because it was important at the time, but for two reasons. One, it's important now. People tend to, even people in Congress, the presidents of people who are on federal courts, they tend to start to answer the question, how do you understand the constitution by saying, well, here's what federalist 48 says.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       You know, so that's one thing, but another thing is that this is one of the most important things Madison did. Even if he, even if no one had read them their brilliance. So you know, if you have a painter, you writing a book about a painter and he made a brilliant painting and nobody saw it until last week. You'd have a chapter on it because it's important. It's an interesting part of his life. So I think the fact that Madison was as brilliant political scientists sheds light on the rest of his career. He had an extremely important political career besides his career in the short lived career as a political scientist. So that's why I paid them a lot of attention. But the point is, and I said before, I wrote this book about Madison, partly because we thought is his significance has been exaggerated in several ways. One is the federalists didn't, didn't sell the constitution actually in the play Hamilton, fascinating. And the play Hamilton, there's a song, but you know, you sold it, you wrote it, and all this stuff about Hamilton, which is also totally exaggerated. Uh, but the same thing goes for Hamilton, you know, the same series. It didn't, it didn't sell it. It's not true. They didn't make people ratify the constitution, the two of them.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       All right, well now that you've changed the lore of the federalist or the federalist papers, depending on what year we're talking that we're referencing them, right? Let's talk about some of the other things that he drafted. So he actually did draft the constitution and the bill of rights. I think people are very confused what that actually means or how many people actually did this together, where they all sitting in a room where they mailing pieces back and forth. Were they sending edits to people? How did the whole process actually go?

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       Oh, well, you mean you want to start with us constantly. Let's start with the constitution. Okay. So Madison is often called the father of the constitution. I think this is exaggerated. So did he, in his own lifetime, people gave him accolades like that and he would always reject them. In fact, at one point he said the, uh, the constitution was the work of many hands heads and many hands. And what he meant by that was that the constitution was largely unlike what he had proposed. So, uh, essentially he had an idea and he wasn't the only one. He was part of a movement in 17, seventies and eighties called the federalists movement, which is kind of confusing because we have different groups in American history are called federalists. There's going to be a federalist party, not the same people. Who were the federalists who were behind creating the US Constitution.

Speaker 2:          00:39:05       Who were that? Were those original? Well, the, these. Okay. The Labor Party is the one that congeals around Alexander Hamilton in 17 counties over his, uh, his platform, his program, his treasury secretary in the Washington ministration. But before that, there had been people who wanted to strengthen the central government in 17, seventies and the eighties. They're called federalists too. You have Hamilton, Madison, uh, Richard Morris, who is the chief financial expert in the continental congress in the Secretary for finance of the Confederation Congress, the guy who has to pay for the war, basically a general Washington was a federalist. Various other people, generally people who were federalists in this first sentence. People who want to strengthen the central government, 17, seventies and eighties had either been in Congress or they had been officers in the military or some of them had been diplomats. So they saw that during the revolution we, I literally had American soldiers who starved to death in the field, went into battle literally without muskets who, uh, in the winter, didn't have boots and their feet broken, bled a, they didn't have blankets.

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       Um, there were people who were diplomats like John Jay and Thomas Jefferson who went overseas and John Jay, for example, in the seventies and eighties when he was American minister to Spain, showed up in Spain. And the first thing he had to ask the foreign ministers assistant was, can you loan me some money so I can buy some food? Wow, I need to borrow money. So I can get myself a place to sleep. Um, so in other words, the federal government had no money. I couldn't do anything. And it also, during the revolution it had not only did it have to ask Congress for money to pay for things, but it had to ask, I'm sorry, did it have to ask the states to pay for things? But the, the congress had to ask the states for men and always they got less. They have less money than they had asked for.

Speaker 2:          00:40:51       They had less, fewer men than they had asked for. And there were some times when states said, no, we're not sending anything. So by the time the Philadelphia convention met in 17, 87, every single state had sometimes sent less than requested. Some of them had sent nothing in some in response to some of these requests from men or money. And was there a punishment? What can we do? There was no as if, as if today, for example, we have this situation of president trump made famous in 2016 campaign in which we have 27 members of NATO and only five of them meet the two percent of GDP threshold of, of, uh, military spending that they have all committed to what can the other 22 of including the Americans who pay more than anybody, what can the rest of us do to Germany or the Netherlands or Spain for not spending two percent of GDP on the military?

Speaker 2:          00:41:41       And the answer is nothing. There's nothing we can do. The same thing was going on and actually the worst a transgressor in this regard was Rhode Island, which repeatedly sent nothing. And these guys were the real rebels. They were scofflaws and actually they were going to send, they were the only state that didn't send anybody to the Philadelphia convention because they didn't want to strengthen it. We're not paying. Why should we want a straight from that? That would mean we'd have to pay. And they actually, there were, what economists call a free rider. They realized that if Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, we're going to defend themselves, they're going to be defending Rhode Island. Yeah, so why should we pay for this? So anyways, so people like Washington who had been commander and chief of the army and seen his men in these dire straits in the field and Madison who had been in Congress and tried to get money to, you know, to send to Washington or men, they realize this is inadequate.

Speaker 2:          00:42:30       We have to have something else. So Madison drafted what's called the Virginia plan, which envisioned a new national government, unlike the one we have now, unlike the one that was created by this process. So people credit him with having written the constitution. He wrote a rough draft that you could say, you know, a couple of major features were made part of a new constitution, but many of the major features were rejected over and over in. Some of them met after he repeatedly brought them up again. And again, when they get to the last week of the Philadelphia Convention, they voted on and one of his major pet ideas and every single state including Virginia voted no. So he was not the author of the Constitution. It's not, it's not true. He played a very important role, which should be remembered, but I don't think it makes them look better to make up something that he didn't actually do.

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       So, so interesting. So this, this group of federalist, at the time they were really trying to strengthen the federal government. It sounds like it really was mostly for military purposes. I mean you mentioned the main function for some overseas post. Well you had to have diplomats. If you're going to have a military, you want to have diplomats overseas. Mainly what the diplomats were doing was trying to get alliances to help fight the war, to get foreign countries to loan the United States money. So it was all one cause essentially it was about foreign policy. That's what the federal government was for. This is classic federal government, you know, where you have some countries that can't defend themselves, and so they leave together for mutual defense. Yeah. So, all right, so if he wasn't the author of the Constitution in the way that we think, what were the contributions that we need to know about?

Speaker 2:          00:44:03       Well, first he was one of the main people behind the fact that there was a Philadelphia convention. So if there ended up being this meeting have delegates from 12 states to talk about amending the articles of confederation so that the congress would be able to raise men and money to, you know, send diplomats and raise an army. Madison was one of the two or three people most responsible for there being a Philadelphia convention. And then when they got to Philadelphia, he persuaded the other Virginia delegates who included some of the most prominent men in the country, uh, to propose what's called the Virginia plan, which laid out that there should be three branches of the federal government, that the legislature should be by cameras. It should have a taxing power. These are very important ideas. These are all the ideas that ultimately made it into, these are some ideas that ultimately made it into the constitution at all.

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       These are important ideas that made it in the constitution, but. But again, if we had time, I could go through many other ideas of Madison proposed that were rejected. In fact, one of them. Yeah. Give me. Give me one. One example is madison proposed that there should be three branches of a new national government. It should have a national legislature and national executive under national judiciary. The national legislature should be by camera. Okay. So far this sounds like the US constitution so far. I'm with you. Okay, so the lower house shall be elected by the people. The upper house shall be elected by the lower house. Both houses should be apportioned by population. The congress should have a veto overall state laws that Congress should be able to to legislate about anything they wanted. About half of what I just said is not in the constitution, including the veto overall state laws.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       Madison said was his favorite proposal really, and it sounds so counter. He thought it was essential for the central government to be able to say, if Rhode Island, uh, wants to print paper money, no veto, you can't print paper money. So that was one thing. So this must've been one of those points that he and Jefferson had a major difference, right? Well, Jefferson was in France while the constitution was being written, so he only saw it afterward. He couldn't have been thrilled. Actually. This is kind of funny because it's good that you asked me this because when, when Jefferson received the constitution first, the Philadelphia convention ends on September 17, 17, 87. And you have 11 states signed the constitution. Rhode Island never showed up, so they didn't. New York couldn't sign because two of their three delegates had left. So Hamilton signed it, but he didn't. He couldn't vote Yes for New York because he was only one of three delegates.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       So he was not a quorum himself. So 11 states sign it. And then Madison waited from September 17th until October 24th to send Jefferson a copy. Usually two of them are writing each other all the time. He waits a month and a week before he sends him a copy. Why does he wait so long? Well, there are two parts of the answer. One is he's writing a very long letter. There are hundreds and hundreds of surviving letters between the two of them over the 50 year friendship. Very long body of very large body of, of missives, back and forth, but he waited a long time. One thing he did was he wrote a description of the convention, which is several pages, but another thing seems to been he probably knew that Jefferson wasn't going to like this thing, so Jefferson, by the time he got Madison's letter cover letter in copy of the Constitution has already received it from someone else and then when he read it, he, he looked at it and he wrote to his friend John Adams, who in Britain, Jefferson's and France.

Speaker 2:          00:47:24       Adams is in Britain. So Jefferson sends Adam's a letter and he says, I've seen. Have you seen the product of the Philadelphia Convention? I own that. I'm, I'm disappointed in the car in this. I would have expected more from the people who were in the Philadelphia Convention. I don't know. I don't know whether it's more good or more bad, but. So that's his original response to it. And then when he finally gets it from Madison he says, okay, I liked bicameralism and I liked that Congress has a taxing power and I, I liked that there was an independent executive and you have a judiciary, but there are a couple of things I don't like. One is perpetual eligibility of the president. That's terrible idea. President will be able to make friends all over the country. He'll be able to hand out contracts and make appointments and pretty soon a president will serve for life.

Speaker 2:          00:48:05       This is a bad idea. You should have a term limit. He thought. And the second thing was he says there's no bill of rights. So then he had madison. This is one of the other areas where they had a serious disagreement. They went back and forth over this question whether there should be a bill of rights and Madison's answer was, well, okay, um, I like the principles you would include in your bill of rights, but the thing is, um, I don't think a bill of rights really is going to bind anybody. So over time the government will ignore or violate or in some sense, practically void the bill of rights. And what will people learn from that? So I think it's better that the people should have their insistence on particular rights and when they vote, they should ensure that their representatives stand for these, right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:44       But if you don't want to put them in the constitution, and Jefferson says, well, okay, it's true that occasionally that, uh, people who hold office will violate the provisions of bill of rights. But on the other hand, it's something you can point to. You can say, this guy shouldn't be reluctant because look, fourth amendment, he violated it. He doesn't care about it all you should. So they went back and forth and Madison says, well these, you know, in Virginia we have a declaration of rights and it's ignored. The legislature violates at Madison and Jefferson says that's true, but you and I are both complaining about it and other people complain about it too and we, you know, at least we can point to that. Besides that, Jefferson says, I think a bill of rights has an instructive. It's got an educational function. People maybe they don't think about these kinds of questions and if he didn't mention them to them, they, they might.

Speaker 2:          00:49:30       They might never come to mind for them. But if you have a bill of rights listing, particular rights that people should be able to count on, then they'll realize that somebody is violating one of their important rights and then they'll care when otherwise they would never notice. So he says, I think even if only for that a bill of rights was good idea. Madison comes back and says, well, yeah, I think it would take a lot of work and probably people are going to be really disappointed if they think that we're going to have to amend the Constitution and Jefferson finally you can tell he gets angry, so at his answer to that is look, Bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government in the world general or particular. So by this point, Madison has already gone to the Philadelphia Convention. He's worked through the whole convention.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       When they got to the end of it, his friend George Mason and his friend Edmund Randolph, both from Virginia ones, George the George Mason, the leading constitutional thinker in Virginia and the other one is at Miranda off the governor of Virginia and former attorney general of Virginia. They both refused to sign it, partly because it didn't have bill of rights. Now was Thomas Jefferson and corresponding with them, we don't know. We don't know that he was in and I think if he had been either here they would've saved letters. So I don't think so, but the thing is. But the thing is Jefferson insisting on this follows on Mason and randolph insisting on this and refusing to sign, and you have to kind of imagine madison thinking, okay, I don't think this is that important. I don't really think it would have that much impact, but if it's going to mean that Mason Randolph and Jefferson are opposed, this could mean that we don't get the thing ratified.

Speaker 2:          00:51:01       So finally he's going to say, I agree to this. Now, one, one, one thing you can rightly call Madison is the author of the bill of rights. But it's interesting to look at the way he introduced this in Congress. So they go to Congress after he's been elected to Congress on the ground that he put, he promised he would seek amendments in Congress. And then when he finally introduces these amendments, here's how he introduces them. He says, you know, some men who would otherwise be willed, disposed toward our new government are opposed to it because it doesn't have a bill of rights. And that he says this in his speech in Congress and I don't think it can hurt anything. So why don't we add these, right? So he's not persuaded, but he thinks it's a good political idea. So nowadays we think, oh, James Madison gave us, you know, the basis of every lawsuit in America.

Speaker 2:          00:51:48       No, no, he grudgingly did this because his friends wanted him to. And he was afraid they would never agree to, to support the constitution if he didn't say, okay, we'll have these. And he says, I don't think they're going to hurt anything, please. Let's agree to them. We'll get, you know, we get people like Randolph and Mason and Jefferson to be enthusiastic. So basically he was a realist at that. He was all the time a realist. He in Jefferson kind of Yin and Yang right once, once, kind of impractical, theoretical, philosophical. He's very, they're both very bookish. We both know you can name 50 books and political science in Greek and Latin into English classics and a couple of freshmen. They both know every page, right? But they come out of this entirely different and yet they're, they're just very affectionate friends because they have this common interests and they both think, well, we have kind of the same goal.

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       We want Americans to be free. What we want to republic, we want stability, we want prosperity, we don't want wars. They have a lot in common. But I hope you've already gotten that. They're very different. Yeah, well it's fascinating and it's like, you know, 241 some odd years later, the idea that Jefferson was pushing their up. We need people to be able to point to something and say that's one thing that actually does seem to work the time because as everyone watching this knows, I mean I'm constantly yammering about free speech and the first amendment. We know what the First Amendment is. We know the second amendment is the right to bear arms. We know the fourth amendment is the right to privacy. I mean, so that point really does seem like it's something that truly translated over time and that is, it kind of had to be dragged into it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       So they had to be completely had to be dragged into it. In fact, he also was defeated for election to the first US Senate, partly because of his having resisted having a bill of rights in the constitution. That's why he ends up in the House of Representatives. So not only are people in Virginia who didn't want a new constitution, they didn't like Madison for having this Philadelphia Convention and the rest of it, but they also were very skeptical about his willingness to amend the constitution. So they kept him out of the Senate and he ends up being narrowly elected. The House of Representatives. How much

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       fighting was there once they said, okay, well once he conceded the point on the bill of rights, how much writing was there as to what actually was going to be in the bill of rights?

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       Not a lot. People weren't really interested because the first congress was completely dominated by federalists. So you have most historians now who've spent a lot of attention on the process of creating the constitution. In ratifying it. Think probably most voters didn't want it. So if we had time to go through it state by state and kind of talk about how it came to be ratified, I think I could persuade you that it seems like most American voters did not want the constitution it had to do with better tactics on the side of the federalists that it ended up being agreed to. Um, so,

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       but what, was there anything that once the bill of rights was actually being written that Jefferson and Madison or any of them had read? Like this has to be in here, but we're not really fighting over any of that?

Speaker 2:          00:54:50       Well, several estates that had close ratification contest with their announcements. We've ratified since proposed amendments. So at an early point after five states, okay. Philadelphia convention in September 17, 17, 87, five states immediately ratified within weeks for them were small states like Rhode Island that new. This is the sweetest table. Everyday we're equal. We're equal to fill to Virginia and in Massachusetts, in the Senate, you know, that means we're going to be heavier than we ought to be in the electoral college. That means we're going to be having more of a voice in choosing presidents and judges and we better hurry up and agree to this same thing happened in Georgia and a couple of other small states besides Pennsylvania, which was an odd case. Um, but then the next state up, the first big state that considered this question was Massachusetts in there. It wasn't clear who had more votes in the convention of federalist or anti federalists.

Speaker 2:          00:55:40       So finally, the federalist society that, right, well, we don't really know that we're going to win here. So maybe we could say if you will vote for this thing, we will promise in the first congress will propose amendments. So this became the kind of the Massachusetts strategy. So the later states that had close contests did the same thing and that's what Virginia did. Madison's thing. I don't really know whether we're going to get. We're going to get this thing ratified in Virginia will promise in the first congress will propose amendments. So that's why he's doing this right? It's not because we liked the idea, but anyway, several of the states that had these clothes, convention contests with their announcements, we've officially ratified the thing per article seven also sent along here are our proposed amendments, so what Madison did was he took the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which we said earlier, he helped to write and he took the English bill of rights from 1689, which was a kind of a pattern for some of the other American declarations of rights and he took these proposals from various ratification conventions and found most of what's now in the bill of rights in those sources.

Speaker 2:          00:56:42       Right. It's not as if he kind of made them up. In fact, the eighth amendment comes directly out of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which got it directly from the English bill of Rights of 16, 80 nine. It's word for word the same thing. Really? Yeah. The eighth amendment is directly from the Virginia Declaration directly from the English bill of rights. All right, so we've got obviously a ton here. Lead it, you know, his whole life and all the work of founding the nation that we're governed by. It's not done yet though. No, I know. So let's talk a little bit about his presidency since we're doing presidents week. What's the most important thing we need to know about? Well, this is the worst part of his career. It's, it's his foreign policy is a debacle. In fact, he had the idea in the early seventies and eighties that America could some extent substitute economic coercion for traditional military, uh, calculations in international relations.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       So he persuaded Jefferson, for example, in Eighteen, oh, seven, they could adopt an embargo instead of building up the military, raising taxes, buying warships, defending American merchant ships off the coast of the United States. Now we'll just tell foreigners, okay, if you won't, if you won't treat us right at sea, we won't trade with you. This will make them do what we want. And that the reason he had this idea was because it had worked before the revolution in 17, 65, 17, 67, 17 slash 70. The British past tax laws and the colonies boycotted. And they repeal the laws, so madison thinks, well, okay, now we're better able to organize, but it can be a national boycott will use the government to keep any Americans from trading with foreigners. They'll do what we want. But the problem he had an 18, 12 was there was a world war going on.

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       Napoleon has armies of 3 million men in the field, which today, you know, it doesn't sound like much. We have 325 million Americans. 3 million is more than we have, but we can have them if we wanted. But on the other hand, in 18, 12 francis population was like $25 million. It was the biggest country in Europe. Britain had like 15 million people, 3 million men in the army was unbelievable. And Britain had over 500 warships, right? Main line warships like the dreadnoughts in the pirates of the Caribbean movies. Right? So America is not going to compete. Madison thought, well then we shouldn't even try. We should just say we're not going to trade with you. And so they tried when he was secretary of state under Jefferson, they tried this boycott idea. It had no effect at all on the French, on the British. France had complete military control of Europe and Britain had complete control of all the oceans and it was a battle to the death.

Speaker 2:          00:59:18       If the polling, we're able to cross channel, he would conquer England, right? If the British wanted to defend themselves, they had to maintain their navy. How are they going to do that? Well, one way was they were going to continue to force people into their navy if they thought there were Britain's in American ships, they were going to force them into the Royal Navy. And the other thing was they weren't going to let the United States trade with France. They weren't gonna let Americans carry products from British of, I'm sorry, from French colonies in the Caribbean to France or anywhere else in Europe. And on the other hand, the French policy was, we're not going to let the Americans trade with Europe because they're trading with the British. Yeah. So both neither France nor Britain could be, could possibly be persuaded to give up it's Po, it's a strategy in this world, war with the other, because it was to the death.

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       But what the US government could do was it can wreck America, which is what it did. This was terrible. The war of 18, 12 following this boycott. The boycott was an economic disaster in the United States and then comes, okay, we're going to declare war. Well, one of the leading spokesman for republicanism, old Jeffersonian Thinking was a congressman from Virginia named John Randolph of Roanoke, and when this idea of war with Britain came up, he said, you're going to go to war with Britain. We don't have any warships where we have no money. What are you talking? Are you kidding? This is impossible. And of course the. The result was they burned down the capital. They burned down the White House. They burn a library of Congress, they bring the war department. They burned the State Department. They bring the Treasury Department. That's just madison has to hop on a horse and ride out of DC.

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       This is totally predictable, is not only predictable, it was predicted, so this is a disaster and the only reason it didn't lead to the end of the United States is because the British decided it's not really worth the effort. So at one point the prime minister of the United Kingdom went to the greatest, a British general ever, the Duke of Wellington. This was before waterloo, but he was already the greatest general British history and he said to him, I, okay, so I give you an army and I send you to North America. And Wellington says, well then I conquered the United States and then what we're going to stay there going to occupy the country were good as that. So yeah. So then the prime minister says, well, okay, then we'll negotiate a piece so that it was just a complete debacle. You could not exaggerate the extent to which this is a mess.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       The people really didn't know many people who write about Madison though they want. And again, this is a pitfall that biographers tend to fall into. You know, I'm writing about this guy, so he's my hero. What can I say that's good about him? Well, the one thing you can say that's good about Madison is a war president. I mean, he's. He. His strategy was terrible. He picked totally inept in competent, unqualified people to be his war secretary and he's navy secretary. He just did a terrible job. Is as a military leader, but the one thing you can say about him is he didn't repress descent. He didn't jail people. He didn't have the army attack a militia units in states that were, by this time openly trading with the British. He didn't put down domestic dissension the way that Lincoln did, or Wilson did, or you know,

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       that's interesting though, so I didn't know that. So states we're actually just bucking with. Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       In New England, people were trading with Canada, which was part of the British empire, but the New England was talking about independent, so we should declare independence. There were leading people including a felony and pickering who was a senator by this time. He had been secretary of state under Washington. He says, new English would be an independent country, were rightly, we should be aligned with the British, not with this pro French Republican policy that Jefferson and Madison have wrecked our economy with. There's no reason for this. So the argument that the, uh, sick of fence of, of Madison make as well, Lincoln would have jail. These people, he would have wrecked their presses. This is what he did. Or Wilson, he would've jail all these people, you know, he would have sent the army and shot militia units that were resisting American policy. So yeah. Okay. You can say that, right? The burden of the Capitol, the White House Treasury state, but at least he didn't. He didn't hang dissenters. Wow. There's. So, it was a terrible though the again, the only reason that the United States continue to exist was because Britain decided, eh, it's not worth the effort that we could easily. Wellington's said, yeah, I conquer them. Then what?

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       Yeah. It's just a great line. I mean, that's the truth. Nobody thinks that the then what he thinks about it. All right. My final question for you, I mean this has been really chock full of, of Info here because we're doing presidents week weekend, I'm doing five different presidents and in five different days in the 2018 lens, what do you think James Madison's political outlook would be because it's interesting they all sort of in the lens of now they all sort of look like Libertarians and small government people. But you have said several things here where he wanted a stronger federal government. I know it's a kind of tricky question because it, because our parties are so crazy right now and everything else, but if you can give you some sense of where he might fall now or what he might think these days. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:04:28       I don't think they're all libertarians. I don't think Washington or at Hamilton is a libertarian today. Um, but I do think people like Jefferson and Madison to the extent that you can kind of extrapolate from what they thought then, which they're a foreboding about the result of a foreign policy. Like the one we've had has proven justified. Of course, we have huge economic distortions because of our, our, uh, foreign policy, we have a gigantic, a remaking of the nature of our governments and we have huge diminution of the role of the average citizen in making his own life or shaping his own community are. And so it's turned out kind of the way they thought it might in that sense. On the other hand, the fact that the union has proven stable, the, the main freedoms have been enduring. This is somewhat surprising. People thought that, and this had been true, republican isn't with short lived, there never been a long lasting significant republic. And so we still have a republic, even if it has a lot of the elements that people like Jefferson and Madison and wanted to forestall or prevent it still republican. We have freedom of speech, we have freedom of religion, we have input into what the policies are, the government, even if it's somewhat attenuated. And so, uh, I think Jefferson would be more disappointed, but Jefferson was disappointed by the time he died, but I think he'd be more disappointed than Madison surely. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       Wow. That's a really interesting takeaway and I think a perfect point edits. I've thoroughly enjoyed this. I mean, Richard is acknowledge you just gave me a book. There's a lot of stuff I'm going to have to go back in and think about, so thank you so much for more of Kevin's work, you can check out James Madison and the making of America, which will link to write down below.
