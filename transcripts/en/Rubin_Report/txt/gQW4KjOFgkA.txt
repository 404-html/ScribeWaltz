Speaker 1:          00:05          We're continuing our partnership with learn liberty today and joining me as an author and associate professor of Philosophy at the College of William and Mary. Chris Freeman. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. All right, man. We're going to do philosophy for an hour. Are you ready? Sounds good. You are prepared. I feel the jacket shirt combo. It's very philosophy said. Give me the rubin. Let's talk philosophy because I think one of the things that I try to do on this show is I talk about philosophies more than people ideas more than people. And it seems to me we live in a time where we don't do a lot of philosophy and idea stuff. Well, and I guess that's maybe why, why people are watching this. So let's do a little philosophy one. Oh, one with you. Give me just some of the basics of what people should understand about philosophy.

Speaker 2:          00:52          Okay. Well, yeah, that's a great question. How's that for an open ended question to start a. yeah, something might take the hour, but uh, yeah. So I think, you know, at the fundamental level, philosophy is about challenging assumptions. I think one thing that makes philosophy different from other sorts of academic disciplines is that you can't really take anything for granted. So when you're, you know, doing philosophy, you have to justify why killing people is wrong, for example, a why feeding the hungry is good and all of these things that we take for granted at the level of everyday life philosophy calls into question and I think that's really important. And so the kinds of philosophical questions that I'm most interested in are ones having to do with moral right and wrong justice, injustice, the moral importance of economic equality, these sorts of things, uh, and also the, the ethics of public policy.

Speaker 2:          01:44          So for example, one thing that non philosophical disciplines can do is make predictions about what a given policy is likely to do. So we'll opening the borders lead to higher unemployment, higher gdp, something like that. Um, but all things considered, they can't really tell us what the right thing to do is say, okay. Suppose it turns out that opening borders will slightly increase domestic unemployment, but it also will mean that a certain workers and the developing world will see their incomes rise by 300 percent. For example, this leaves open the question, what should we do? Is that a trade off that we should make? And that's really what philosophy tries to answer is what should we do, all things considered.

Speaker 1:          02:26          All right, so in a little bit we're going to get to some of your moral philosophies that you care about, an economic philosophies and, and, uh, immigration and a bunch of other things in just a little bit. But first I'm curious, what got you interested in philosophy in the first place?

Speaker 2:          02:41          Yeah, that's a good question. So I think it was doing philosophy before I realized I was doing philosophy because arguing, let's say good natured arguing was the family tradition in my household. So ever since I was a little kid, uh, you know, my parents and my sister and I, we would argue about religion and, and these sorts of things, right and wrong, the economy. And when I got a little bit older, I started reading things in philosophy and economics, columns, articles and things like that. And I realized that there was this kind of formal discipline called philosophy where you could argue about right and wrong and justice and injustice and if you were very lucky you could get a job doing this. If I get paid to do this. Not a lot of jobs of jobs. Not paid very much either, but it's Kinda like saying, you know, you can get paid to eat ice cream for a living.

Speaker 2:          03:28          I thought okay, that's, that's a pretty good gig if I can get it. And so that was Kinda the start of the trajectory into philosophy. Yeah. You know, it's interesting because I came from a very similar family in that regard where we argued about everything from economics and religion and all those things. And I guess perhaps if this is what led you here, it's Kinda what led me here as well. But we're missing that these days. Don't you think like that must infuriate you as someone that cares about ideas. When you watch the news and watch all these people that are aren't arguing from like a principled position or something like philosophically thought out position, but just from like a party place or a partisan place must drive you nuts. It does. It does because, right? I care about ideas. I care fundamentally about good arguments.

Speaker 2:          04:10          So this is something that I hope happens to my students in my classes is they come in with a set of preconceptions. They have their partisan political beliefs. Everybody does. I have my partisan political beliefs, but I hope we can try as hard as we can to just focus on the arguments, think critically and maybe change our minds even if it means admitting that we were wrong or uh, you know, finding out that we have different political or religious beliefs from our friends, we should really just follow wherever the arguments lead us. Do you actually like it when you find out you were wrong on something? Because when I've had the moments on this show and the, and the most famous one is when I had larry elder in here and he just kind of beat me senseless with facts and you know, and we've since become friends and he was on just recently and I loved the guy that it was scary in the moment, like sitting there in the moment of being beaten is not fun, but afterwards when you go, Whoa, that's what it's about.

Speaker 2:          05:03          It's actually pretty cool. Yes. So I don't like, like you said in the moment, I don't like being threatened by it because I got a couple of things I'm going to expect nothing less. Yeah. But, but longterm, I think that's right. It shows growth. And the funny thing is that what are we afraid of when it comes to changing our minds and admitting when we're wrong, what's the harm in that? And I really, I liked the process of arguing it's, you know, a form of recreation or something like a form of exercise. Um, I think, I think it was Edmund Burke who said something like, the person who challenged my adversary is actually my best friend or something like this. So the person that is willing to argue with you in good faith and genuinely cares about getting at what's true rather than what maybe confirms their prior political beliefs, that's, you know, that's the person that I want to hang out with. I just don't want to talk with one of my best friends growing up. Uh, his name's are Greek, so he was all into Greek philosophy and all that and he was my intellectual sparring

Speaker 1:          05:58          partner for them from, from literally from 12 years old til, well past college. Even now. And we ironically, we actually agree more now than ever before, which is sort of weird because we both had sort of reverse a philosophical journeys or political journeys. But that's actually what it's all about. So tell me a little bit about some of the philosophers that have affected you.

Speaker 2:          06:18          So one of my favorites is probably John Stuart Mill. So he was a classical liberal. He so his, what's known as a utilitarian, and this is a moral theory that essentially says the right thing to do is the thing that has the best consequences, the thing that produces the most happiness for everybody who's affected, I find that view, attractive and, and moral philosophy. But he was also, he was a classical liberal politically, uh, he was a big defender of free speech free discussion in particular. His book on Liberty is probably the single greatest defense of freedom of speech.

Speaker 1:          06:50          I traveled with it, you know, I'm on tour right now. I travel with it. It's a thin book. Everyone should have it. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So what. Okay. So you mentioned classical liberalism. Okay. Everyone knows my feelings on this. Do you see any meaningful distinction between classical liberalism and libertarianism at this point?

Speaker 2:          07:09          I think that libertarianism is probably a bit narrower than classical liberalism, so, but this is a matter of debate. I don't have a very firm opinion on this, but when I think of a libertarian, I think of somebody who says the state should do the following. Three things have a court system have police force, um, and maybe enforced contracts, something like that, no more, maybe some kind of very small social minimum Milton Friedman negative income tax type thing. Whereas I think classical liberals are more friendly to a more active state, but I would also say that I'm happy to say that libertarians are part of the classical liberal family.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Yeah. It's funny because I had done boudreaux and here a couple of weeks ago talking about this and I fall on that path where the more I go down the libertarian roots I really liked. I liked that line of thinking. I still think there's some utility of the state, but I think the more that you have these conversations, for me, I'm finding it harder and harder to defend anything related to the state, which is a. I Guess I'm taking a philosophically fair approach to this because I'm taking in new information.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm, I'm the same way. So I think that the best arguments for something like classical liberalism or libertarianism is just the pervasiveness of government failure. So you know, you look at where actual government money goes, not just not in theory, but in practice where it goes, um, what sorts of groups are advantaged and disadvantaged by the state? I think that the government just doesn't work very well and so the same reasons why we don't want the government producing food, for example, are also reasons why we might not want the government in the business of say, running school.

Speaker 1:          08:50          Right? So do you think it will be fair to say that if it ran well, if this thing was a slim trim operation

Speaker 2:          08:56          and it was financially sensible and we had people of good moral character in the government in the rest of it, that you'd actually have no reason to be. Certainly a libertarian and me perhaps even a classical liberal, you might actually be more, have some sort of big government democrat or something like that. I think that's right. So at least from my perspective, so as I said, I'm a fan of mill and utilitarianism. The idea that the right thing is the thing that produces the best results. And so I think in a world in which the state was run by angels, very wise people, very benevolent people, and it produced good results. I would be happy to accept a, a big activist government or regulatory and redistributive state, but I think that are very powerful reasons for thinking that that's not the world that we live in.

Speaker 2:          09:36          So I think that some of my audience, when they hear you talk about mill and what's best for everyone, they're going to view that through some sort of lens of collectivism, which is going to set some bells off. So can you unpack that a little bit, right? Yeah. So, so for, for what it's worth, my view is that a system that produces the most happiness, the most flourishing, the most prosperity is something like a libertarian, minimal state, perhaps with a small social minimum. So when you look historically at collectivist regimes, say the Soviet Union or North Korea or something like that, these don't have a good track record of making people happy. When you look at the societies that actually make people happy compared to the alternative, they tend to be liberty limited. Government free market, a civil libertarian ish kind of states. Alright. So what other philosophers that's affected you?

Speaker 2:          10:28          You're one for one. Yeah, John Stuart Mill. Right up the top. I'll give you somebody who you might not like, although he might not be familiar with them. Peter Singer who's a contemporary utilitarian and a lot of people. I think a lot of classical liberals and libertarians aren't big fans of his, although I think they need not, not be fans of his. So he's a, he's famous for a number of things. He has a number of very controversial positions on a lot of things, but one of his more famous thought experiments involves you will imagining that you're a walking somewhere and you pass a small child who is drowning in a shallow pond and you can save this child at a very low cost to you. Uh, all, all that's required is that you step into the pond to get your shoes muddy and pulled the child out.

Speaker 2:          11:13          But this means you'll have to spend 100 bucks on new shoes. And he says, clearly the sacrifice of $100 worth of shoes is worth saving this child. And so this suggests that we have strong obligations to make personal sacrifices for the betterment of the world's poor. And I think that's right, uh, as at the level of moral principle, for example. But I think a lot of libertarians and classical liberals worry that what this is going to mean is we ought to have large welfare states. We ought to have billions of dollars channeled into foreign aid and so on. And I can understand why they make that leap. But I don't think that follows, especially again, if you look at the track record of whether or not the government does a good job of helping the poor and I think it generally doesn't. Yeah. So, and I definitely want to get to your thoughts on that.

Speaker 2:          11:57          So do you view that sort of is like that sort of like a micro macro argument that at a micro level, yeah, you'd probably do it. Like I'm sure if either one of us were walking down the street, we wouldn't care that much about our shoes. Enabled to save somebody, but at a societal level, we'd probably get swept out of your economic arguments as well. The more that you keep giving over to society, the more that it keeps taking in essence, individuals in their private lives, uh, if they do a good job of saying, researching which private charities do a good job of alleviating poverty in the developing world. And I think there are some, then we would have in some sense in some sense of societal obligation to help just in the sense that most people of means have this obligation to say donate some of their paycheck to the against malaria foundation for example.

Speaker 2:          12:43          But I think that doesn't justify saying we want the state in the business of redistributing income, uh, on a global level if only because it just doesn't do a very good job of it and oftentimes makes poverty even worse. All right, so you are a blogger at bleeding heart libertarian. Now, I've seen this site before and check it out again before, uh, before you got here. But I thought the phrase bleeding heart, libertarians, that sort of sounds like what a classical liberal is like, right? We got a little, a little more heart in essence, where we were okay with a little more state to hopefully make sure that people who need it the most are okay, but I think a lot of people will see those terms at odds. Bleeding, heart, libertarian. Yeah. No, and that's a great, a great point too. In light of the conversation about Peter Singer, because I do think that we have, and I think a lot of classical liberals agree that we have this strong obligation to uphold political institutions that work particularly well for the poor.

Speaker 2:          13:38          And this isn't, even though the term a bleeding heart, libertarians is new. This isn't just something that popped up in the last five or six years. If you go all the way back to Adam Smith, he has this, this argument about the division of Labor and free trade. He says, you know, you sitting at your desk trying to make pins all by yourself. Maybe you could do two or three in a day. You have a division of labor where one person straightening up the wire, the other person's putting the pin on the on the wire and so forth, makes us massively more productive than we otherwise could be, and then through free trade are everybody's welfare is increased, but he stresses that this is particularly good for the poor because he says a society in which we're very productive and we have this abundance of material goods is a society in which these sorts of goods are going to be a lot cheaper and this is in fact what we see, uh, and so a society in which the real price of not just necessities but also things that we might consider luxuries like smartphones or something, a society that makes those abundant and cheap is a society that's very good for the poor.

Speaker 2:          14:37          So I think a bleeding heart libertarian or classical perspective is hundreds of years old, although you'd probably w we haven't done a good job of marketing ourselves perhaps. Yeah. How would you actually define what good is that too tough for them? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That's a, that's a big question. So the, here's the evasive answer is it depends on which philosopher you're talking. Yeah. So, so some philosophers think that so mill has this view that the code consists of pleasure, but it's a sophisticated view where some pleasures are of higher quality than others. So if I don't know you have pleasure as a result of shooting up heroin and that's equal in intensity and duration to the pleasure that you get from reading Shakespeare. There's something qualitatively better about the Shakespeare's and then the heroin. And so that's his view is that it's a life of pleasure, but where you have these high, higher and lower pleasures, other people, other utilitarians think, oh, pleasure is created equal.

Speaker 2:          15:35          Other people have a maybe more complicated views were a bunch of stuff, makes a life good. So it's pleasure. It's knowledge, it's living the morally virtuous life and so on. And this is a debate that we've been having for $200 or 2000, 500 years with no end in sight. I sense, I know where you stand on that, but you want to elaborate on that a little bit more. Well, so I think that the, yeah, so it's a good question because you're here as long as I'm here. So what, what is good? Well, so I think the good for a particular person is probably, um, what a philosopher would call the satisfaction of your informed preferences. So essentially getting what you want, if you know what it is that you're getting. So for example, you might want the liquid that is in their glass right now because you have the belief that it's water, but if you have the fall, if that belief is false because it turns out to be vodka or something like that, you might have a desire for what's in there, but the desire is in some sense informed by this false belief.

Speaker 2:          16:34          But if you had perfectly true beliefs about the world and then you desired say that cup of water, I said, well that's good for you to get that water. You're getting what you want. Yeah. So you basically believe that selfishness is good. No, because I think that a lot of people, I think most people in fact have preferences, rational preferences for the welfare of other people. So I would say, you know, most, can you make a selfish argument for that because the way I've always sort of understand, or at least the way I use these words now is by doing what is good for me. That doesn't mean I want to ransack the entire world. I want to do good so that it's good for my community. I want to take care of my own house so that my neighbor, hopefully it will be like I'm next door to someone with a nice house and we're going to take care of their eyes.

Speaker 2:          17:19          So I've used selfishly, I guess that's a little more of ran thing where I've used selfishness actually as a virtue. Yeah. So I think the difference would be in say a case where you're, you're a walking and see the child drowning on the shallow pond, the question would be, well, what is the reason why you're saving this child and ruining their boots? I think a good answer to that as well because they care about the child's welfare. Um, and then sometimes it's true that that's a preference that you have. So it's your preference. And so you could call it a sort of self guided or self preference, but I wouldn't call it a selfish preference in the sense that you expect in some sense a this child's welfare to directly translate into benefits for you. Right? But you would feel good after, I guess like you wouldn't if you'd be a pretty twisted person if you were like, well, walking by like, well what, how's that gonna make me feel after a little, you should, you should do what's right.

Speaker 2:          18:10          But I know what's right can often lead to all sorts of bad things. But I think you could make a selfish argument for that. Like you know that if you walk by a child that you could easily help and you don't, you're going to feel shitty after if you have any shred of conscious. Right. So I hope right on sociopaths, I hope have that, have that sort of psychological disposition and as far as sort of once. So I think also what morality is more concerned with is not just the good of the individual, but sort of the good of all. So I think for what the morally right thing to do is figuring out the decision. So this is the kind of million utilitarian view that the right thing to do is basically that which produces the most good for everybody, not just an individual person.

Speaker 2:          18:50          So it could be in some cases that, uh, a person's individual good comes apart from what's morally good. So you could imagine somebody who just has no desire to help other people. I would still say they're doing something morally wrong if they fail to help other people because they're not taking that person's welfare into account. Right. So where do you think morals come from? This has been an ongoing discussion on this show between, you know, talking to Jordan Peterson and bench and Sam Harris and Michael Shermer, Dennis Prager, and many others. And there's sort of a religious argument. I think there's a secular argument for it. Um, I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I think it's a really rich spot to figure out what people think about things. Yeah. So that's, that's a, that's a hard question. Uh, I'm not sure I have a satisfying answer to that.

Speaker 2:          19:33          So, but maybe in terms of the religious question there, this very old argument from Plato, the EUTHYPHRO dilemma. I'm not sure if that's ever popped up in conversation, but the idea is basically, uh, does, does God will something because it's pious independently of God's will or is it pious because God wills it and Plato's view was, well, uh, it doesn't quite make sense to say that it's pious just because God wills it because you could imagine as a thought experiment that God willing all sorts of terrible family just as, as a thought experiment that, you know, if God wills us to torture it doesn't seem like that would make torture good. Um, and so it seems more plausible to think that there is sort of an independent standard of goodness even, even if you are a theist, for example, in, in, you believe in God and you believe God has this intimate connection to morality. I think even on views like that, it make sense to say that goodness is in some sense independent of the will of God. And so in terms of what more, that's again, sort of an evasive answer as to what. It's not a where morality comes from. I mean, I'm inclined to say it. I mean it comes from sort of what's good for human beings and maybe other and animals. So what sorts of things satisfy or interest to our preferences causes pleasure and pain, these sorts of things.

Speaker 1:          20:50          Do you think that subjective though, that the different cultures obviously have different beliefs and different moralities and all sorts of things?

Speaker 2:          20:58          I would say it is not subjective in the sense that a different different cultures having different moral beliefs would show that nobody's wrong in those debates. So it might be very difficult to determine who is wrong, but I don't think the mere fact that different cultures have moral standards shows that it's subjective. So by analogy, uh, you could imagine different cultures having different beliefs about astrology for example. So some cultures think that astrology is legitimate enterprise. Other ones don't. They disagree about that. But I think it's safe to say that there is in some sense and objectively correct answer about that. Uh, same thing with other sorts of scientific disputes, right?

Speaker 1:          21:37          But do you think that that objective place, does that have to come from God per se? Or can it come from, I mean, the, the discussion that we've had a lot around here that a lot of people in this space talk about basically is, does objective morality either come from God and religion or does it come from enlightened enlightenment and values? And then there's other arguments that it's only through religion that we got to enlightenment values in the.

Speaker 2:          22:01          Yeah, that's tough. My hunch is that something like enlightenment values, um, so I don't know. I'm somewhere in the agnostic space, uh, myself. Uh, and so I think that sort of philosophy guy, right? Exactly. So it's hard not to. It's hard not to be an agnostic. So, uh, yeah, so I'm agnostic, but I'm also Jewish and so there's, it's all part of the kind of questioning, lack of certainty and so forth. So I think that there is, there's enough reason to think that we have objective morality, even if you're not certain about the existence of God. Um, that yeah, we shouldn't worry that morality is going to collapse if people become atheist and agnostic.

Speaker 1:          22:43          Right? Because when I've had this discussion usually with conservatives, you know, they love to say, well, God gave us morality. You know what I mean? Your rights come from God. And for me it's like I think you have whether they're God, God given rights or it's your right, freedom is your right as a human being or as optimist prime said, freedom is the right of all sentient beings. You don't. You're like, I think you are born free. I just think that's a, that's a humanistic approach or your boyfriend. The government can take away your freedom but he doesn't give it to you. And I think that's just a really interesting place to go for all these political discussions.

Speaker 2:          23:16          So I, that's why I think that there are right and wrong ways to treat other human beings that are just true independently of whether or not the state happens to respect them and as soon as the kind of enlightenment thought. So John Locke's I'd look in the state of nature, I would be wrong to kill you or assault you or steal your property. This is just the wrong way to treat human beings. It doesn't really have anything to do with the state. Now he might want the state to come in and protect those rights, enforce those rights and so on. But the rates themselves, the standard of the right and wrong way to treat other people does not itself come from the state or. So before we get into some of your specific arguments that you make on economics and a bunch budget, how do you think are our founders got so much of this stuff right?

Speaker 2:          23:56          If I'm going on the assumption you believe they did, but I mean every time I go to DC and I go to the monuments and I read all of this stuff and I just was in philly yesterday, I mentioned to you and I have now a copy of that little copy Republican senator of the declaration and the Declaration of independence. The alarm at the, there was this thing, it would set off the TSA alarms at the. Oh, this one's just standard simple paper, whatever. It's probably will set off some alarm somewhere. I'm sure if I go to San Francisco or something, I'm sure a constitution would set off an alarm. But, um, uh, I assume you think that they got a much of this stuff correctly. How do you think they did it? Yeah, so I think that, I don't know. So I think that some of it, and this is a bit outside of my area, but I think that a lot of them were influenced by the smart philosophers.

Speaker 2:          24:43          People like. So I think the law, the influence of someone like lock on a constitution, it's pretty evident the influence of somebody like David Hume on people like Madison. I think that's, I think that maybe that's a matter of controversy in history, but I think there's some evidence to suggest that. So I think that they were students of history, students of philosophy, students of economics, and this helped them get a lot right. And I think, you know, obviously I think there were mistakes and the way that they applied it and um, you know, the way that, uh, like Jefferson's a omission of mentions of slavery and things like that. But I think in terms of like the fundamentals, a lot of that was informed by really smart philosophers and economists. Well, they were, they were all philosophers in their own right and they were inconsistent as, as people in their own time, which is why I'm so fascinated with that period of history.

Speaker 2:          25:33          All right, so let's talk about some of the specifics here. So I wanted to go to one that I think we disagree on, but I want you to, I want you to make the most compelling case that you can, uh, this open border stuff. Yes. So you're not, you're not a, I'm not an open borders guy. This is a, I'm not a crazy borders person or whatever that means. I don't, I don't think. I don't think there should be no immigration. We are a nation of immigrants. That's what's made this melting pot, I think the greatest nation in the history of the world that's given more freedom to more people than, than anyone ever. Um, but the open border situation, especially now in 2018, 2018 strikes me as particularly tenuous, but take it away. So I, I think one thing to keep in mind is what exactly a, an advocate of open borders is arguing for.

Speaker 2:          26:18          So I think most so open borders is maybe a bit of a misnomer. It's more light borders are porous borders or something like that. Where. So the idea wouldn't be that there's perhaps no checkpoints are no restrictions on immigration. Just very few. So I think most open border folks would be happy saying that if you are a wanted, violent criminal that might exclude you from immigrating if you have some particularly deadly contagious disease and so forth. But other than that, a sort of ordinary, peaceful migrants should be able to come to the United States. As far as the, the argument goes, I think they're really two strands. One is just that the, the economic benefits of immigration are huge. So the most optimistic estimates say that we could potentially double world of GDP by opening borders. So we've done a pretty good job of opening up trade.

Speaker 2:          27:06          We've done a much worse job opening up borders, but in terms of the productivity gains that it would be incredible better than anything else. We could do a. and this goes back to what I was discussing earlier with our obligations to the global poor. Foreign aid doesn't have a good track record. Military intervention doesn't have a good track record, but allowing people to move from places with lower wages to higher wages is by far the best antipoverty tool that we have. So if we were going to get into the nitty gritty number that, what do you actually have to do then to secure the borders, right? Because that's really what this is about. So even if you make every economic argument that I'm like, all right, I can't riddled my way out of that, right? Like if I'm on board that you still have to do something to make sure that you're doing those things, making sure that murderers are coming in and all of that.

Speaker 2:          27:51          And we don't seem very good at that. And I think maybe that's the leap that gets me to where I can't make the secondary part that you're talking about here. Yeah. So I'm not sure about the policy. I mean, something like the old Ellis island system seems pretty good. I mean, we had a ton of immigration, um, back then, but there still was some kind of a checking mechanism. So as far so I doubt that that involves building a wall, um, but having some kind of centralized location where immigrants can come and get documents and things like that seems, seems pretty reasonable. Uh, but that's probably the most detail I could give you on policy ideas. So then when you go over these borders then your gut, you would want these people to be governed by the laws of the place that they were in, right?

Speaker 2:          28:36          That's right, yeah. Yeah. So, so I would be happy to write a, an allow ordinary, peaceful migrants to come in and then apply for US citizenship. Just, you know, uh, make it pretty easy to do that. Is this though a tough one for a guy that doesn't trust the government that much? Because that's what's ringing with me here. And when I've heard this argument, it's like, alright wait, if you don't trust the government, well then why do you think the government would be able to vet people properly? Especially because we now see what's going on in Europe where they've vetted people very poorly and have had very poorest borders. So this might. Yeah. So I don't know. I think though, if you're a skeptic of the government, so presumably you're a free trade advocate, you like jed across borders. You wouldn't be happy with governments micromanaging trade across borders because you're a skeptic about how well the government works as am I, and for the same sorts of reasons.

Speaker 2:          29:26          I'm skeptical. So I think if you're worried about the government working well, that's all the more reason to get it out of the immigration regulation business. So it might, I think you're probably right. It does a bad job of a lot of stuff. Almost everything. Um, so the standard here is not going to be perfection, but just what's the best alternative, heavily regulated immigration or lightly immigrated regulation. And I think all things equal lightly, lightly regulated immigration will probably be better. Let me give you another argument too. So this again is maybe a more libertarian classical liberal argument for immigration, but it just seems like people have a right to, to move across borders. So for example, if, uh, you know, I dunno a this table for example, we're divided by some kind of border and I said, well look, I want you to come over to my side and rent my house from me or work in my business or join my religious congregation.

Speaker 2:          30:23          And you said, okay, I do want to do those things. And we both agree on this. We, we agree on the terms. And then the state sort of intervenes as a third party in this, what this philosopher Robert nozick would call a capitalist act between consenting adults. It seems like they wouldn't be violating our rights to associate with one another on free terms. And so I think there's a reason to think that a border controls violate people's natural rights. Is there also some inherent problem though that let's say most of the Western society is the freest society's got onboard. This will then they would end up being flooded with people where maybe the economics don't work out. Because if we just say, I mean if you think about it, like if tomorrow we were just like, all right, everybody can come. And just as long as you're not a murderer or be a drug dealer, you're good to go.

Speaker 2:          31:13          That there must be so mechanistic theory here where we're going to lead in a certain amount of people at your economics are gonna work out and then we're going to get to some odd tipping point where because freedom is pretty good, people are gonna want in on it. Yeah. So I think there are a couple of things to say. So one is just if we. I think that problem to some extent would be self correcting. So if you think that a lot of the pressure to migrate is economics. So people are moving from low wage countries to higher wage countries. Those you have more and more people enter the high wage, high wage countries. This would increase the total number of workers which would probably start dropping down their wages. And so you would probably see less motivation to move. I think that's one thing, but as a, as a concession to this word, what I would say is we can do it slowly.

Speaker 2:          31:53          So for example, if we're really worried about these affects of dramatically increasing immigration overnight, what we could do is just say increase, say the limits on immigration by 10 percent every year or something like that, and take it slowly and see where it goes. But it wouldn't have to push the button. Open the borders overnight if we have this worry. What do you think is philosophically the, the soundest way to deal with the people that are already here? Uh, I, yeah, so I am an advocate of the view that you don't have an obligation to obey unjust laws. And so I think that our immigration laws are unjust. So I think people who came here, uh, even against current immigration law, I think they should just amnesty full citizenship. That's, that would be my approach to that, Huh? Yeah. All right. We're not quite there, but it's all good.

Speaker 2:          32:44          Let me ask you this. So you're not a fan of the drug war? No, I'm not. Okay. So suppose we have somebody who is in jail for selling marijuana. It's like this, um, and then suppose that. Yeah. So they're breaking was a citizen of the United States citizens, but who broke say current immigration, not immigration, current drug laws. Do you think that they violated some moral obligation that they had a not to break us drug or do you say, well what good is it bad law? So they didn't do anything? Well, partly I think it would depend on the specific offense. So we're. So whether they were using drugs or selling drugs, I would see a distinction there. So if there's someone that. And there are people that are in jail for using drugs right now for using pot, I think those, those laws are unjust and I would want to do everything I could to reverse those laws and reversed the, the prison system, the justice system and all that.

Speaker 2:          33:35          As far as the dealers, yeah, you can't until until we fix these laws and figuring out what actually is fair and change some classifications on marijuana and a bunch of other things. It's tough. I think it's tough. I don't think you can free drug dealers per se. Even though you're a guy, you don't think they did something that should be against the law, the people that are doing the drugs, I think you have a right to do with your body as you see fit. But again, but again, if you break a law you have to like, I would change the laws is what I'm saying, but if you break a law then you have to suffer the consequences of that. So does that all work out? I'm curious, I don't know. Forgive me for this, but. So suppose you have a drug user who's convicted of this offense and they're, they're in jail, but suppose they can escape from prison harmlessly.

Speaker 2:          34:21          Um, do you think they would be doing something morally wrong by escaping from prison? All right, so this is a good little, right? We're doing students, so students. No, this is great. I mean this is what it's about, right? So, okay. So let's say someone was smoking weed at home. Cops bust in there, thrown in jail for three years. It's a year or two and they're going to pull the shawshank and get out of there. Do I think they're morally. The question is, do I think they're morally right for doing it or can that be morally justified? So. Right. So what are we morally criticize them if they pull the shawshank where they escaped to the wall or something like that, and they don't harm anyone. They just, they just leave because they say I was convicted of something that ought not be a crime, so I don't owe any morally moral allegiance to that law and so I'm just going to escape.

Speaker 2:          35:06          Would you hear about this story? Do you say? I'd be rooting for that guy. I wouldn't be rooting for that. So that's kind of my perspective on immigration that I think that it's an unjust law and justice people are under an obligation to obey the state with respect to the drug war. Yeah. I don't think people are under an obligation to be the state with respect to immigration. Right. So I guess our sort of disconnecting on this is just the unjustness of immigration laws versus drug laws. Right? Right. So if you think that the law itself is not unjust than my argument won't have any kind of grip on you. Yeah. I'm not saying our immigration laws are just by the way, I just think that especially now, uh, also just because of terrorism and people move and just when you see what's going on with Europe and, and because it hasn't just been a people trying to get over for humanitarian purposes there we know that there's a lot of migrants and all sorts of other people and then assimilation problems and then welfare state problems.

Speaker 2:          36:00          Like it just seems like it's become this massive thing that most of Europe would probably do it very differently if they could look back eight years ago. Right? Yeah. So as far as the terrorism point goes, I mean, I think if somebody is a one to terrorist or a suspected terrorist, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to, not to allow them in a. and I'm less concerned about the, the assimilation concern, the welfare state concern. So as far as the, the assimilation where he goes, I mean, a lot of the evidence I've seen suggests that the political values of immigrants and especially second generation American immigrants is almost identical to the political, a political values held by a native born Americans. Um, and as far as the welfare state concern goes, um, I would say we have lots of other freedoms that can potentially increase the cost of the welfare state.

Speaker 2:          36:50          And we're okay with people exercising them. So for example, uh, you know, I dunno, we allow people to choose their own profession, for example, in the United States. And so suppose you have a student who says, here's what I want to do with my life. I want to become a philosopher. He said, well, that's a dicey career choice, not a lot of money in it. Who knows, maybe you'll end up on unemployment and this will in fact increase the cost of the welfare state because now you have this person on unemployment because they chose to become a philosopher with our life. We say, well, uh, we, we let them do that. We let them to exercise that freedom, to choose that occupation, even knowing that this might increase the costs of the welfare state. And so I think you can make an analogous argument about immigration if you think it's a right and important human freedom, then you say, well, this is sort of a price of respecting rights and respecting freedom.

Speaker 2:          37:36          They sometimes can impose costs on third parties. So if all these people come here, then what, what duty does the state have to make sure that they don't just get here and can't do anything and then then more crime comes and drugs and the rest of it. Yeah. Their responsibility for the state at that point. I'm not sure that the responsibility of the state to immigrants is different from their responsibility to citizens. So I think part. So, uh, I mean there's also a question of what we would do in the ideal world versus the real world to say in the ideal world of somebody like Milton Friedman, the welfare state is much smaller and maybe you have something like the negative income tax. This isn't the world we live in. We have over a trillion dollars of redistributive spending every year. I mean I don't. So, so there are two separate issues.

Speaker 2:          38:19          So one is this imperial claim about whether immigrants tend to consume more in government services than they pay in taxes and it seems like the fiscal effect is pretty moderate. So some estimates say they do in fact raise fiscal costs a little bit. Others? No. In fact actually there's a net benefit because a lot of a lot of new immigrants aren't consuming a lot of government services and so forth and they're paying sales tax and things like this, but I think that again, this is a concession. If you really have to worry about the welfare state, we could say, well maybe this is not my view, but if, if, if this is what it took for me to get you over to my side, I'll give you this. I'll give you this concession. We could say something like, you have a five year waiting period before you have access to unemployment benefits and whatnot.

Speaker 2:          39:08          I would take that over border closure if those were the only two options. It's tough being intellectually honest, isn't it? Because you have to, you have to conceive things every now and again, which you just don't see people doing anymore. So it seems like doubling. That's just, this is just a ploy to get you and your viewers to Lord on my side. So yeah, I don't care so much about the honesty. Just get people on the open borders side. All right, so you've argued that inequality of income is in the real issue, but poverty is the real issue, right? Let's get into the weeds on that. Okay, good. So sometimes you'll hear, this is sometimes philosophers, but oftentimes politicians, they'll make statements like two percent of a American earners have 40 percent of the country's wealth or something like that. And from here we're supposed to infer that some injustice has occurred because there's this, this large inequality.

Speaker 2:          39:57          And I think, uh, I mean there might be an injustice there, uh, but we can't tell a strictly on the basis of the inequality. So there's a philosopher named Robert Nozick who famously said, what matters isn't so much the income distribution that we end up with, but how we got there. So if somebody has a huge amount of wealth but they got it through theft or the God had through lobbying the government for special privileges, this is very bad. This is something that we shouldn't encourage. On the other hand, if we have somebody who has a lot of wealth because they invented the iphone and there are tens, if not hundreds of millions of people who want to buy this, that's totally fine. So we can't just look at the pie and how it's carved up and say whether it's just or unjust. We have to see that people make their money by making other people better off by giving them things that they wanted.

Speaker 2:          40:44          Or did they take it through fraudulent means? Coercive means. And I think that the talk about inequality oftentimes confuses a quality with poverty. So is what we're really concerned with equalizing income or are we concerned about making the poor better off? And I think it's the latter that we really should care about. So how do we go ahead and do that? Well, so opening borders I think is the first step in terms of alleviating global inequality, or. I'm sorry, global poverty I think is the best thing that we can do. I think domestically there are a lot of government policies that really do harm to, to the most disadvantaged groups. So I think opening up school choice would be a great idea. I think. I think the drug war would be a great idea. I think ending occupational licensing would be a very good idea.

Speaker 2:          41:31          So enabling people to work in certain industries or start their own business with a lot less red tape is a very good idea. And wouldn't barbers be stabbing people that says, well this is what I say. There are some states where you have to, you have to get licensed to shampoo people. But I shampoo my. I'm, I'm pulling my hair every morning and doing this and I probably shouldn't say that. Yeah, do I do with myself? I combed my hair without a license. And so far the government hasn't come after me and I haven't poked my eye on. Yeah. So what's your, what's your best argument then when the people that don't buy into this and say, well we need these regulations because you're going to have people that don't know how to dye hair are going to be scalding people's heads and you know, Mr Burns is going to be dumping nuclear waste into the Springfield river and all of those things.

Speaker 2:          42:19          What's the best argument against them? So one argument is just that I don't think regulation works very well and I don't think so. I think the way that the public views regulation is probably misguided. So I don't think the regulators are bad people, but I think if you examine the ways that regulations are formed and operate in the real world, it's oftentimes to protect the, the interest of the industries that they're regulating. So this is what's known as regulatory capture, where regulators aren't always looking out for the public interest or actually looking out for the interests of people in that industry. So financial regulation is a case of this. You have lobbyists who might be friends with people in the financial sector, they want to work in the financial sector later or vice versa. And so they're often very friendly to the very people that they're regulating.

Speaker 2:          43:02          Um, and as far as you know, the, the worry about scolding people and so forth. Um, I think that competition itself is a kind of regulation. So in the case of, of school choice, it's true. You might have very bad charter schools for example, but again, the standard here is not perfection. The standard is what's the alternative. So we have public schools that are terrible, but charter schools have this advantage of enabling people to choose. So if you go to a charter school that's failing, you can pull your kids out and put them somewhere else. And that's a kind of regulation in the sense that it provides incentives to the providers to supply good service. So it's almost like we should rely on self regulation or not regulation, not even self regulation in a sense. So this is something that comes up when I, when I argue with people, is they think that I have this view of private business, uh, as, as being sort of benevolent where they'll just take care of themselves.

Speaker 2:          43:58          I have a sense of the public interest. I think maybe to some extent that's true, but it's more the kind of Smithian insight where if you have providers who are competing for my business, they don't have to care about my welfare directly or the welfare of my family, but they might just want my money and that itself is an incentive for them to provide good, safe service. So in a sense it's competition for dollars, competition for customers that acts as the regulations. So I think the market as a whole is self regulating, self correcting. So you're also a universal basic income supporter. Yeah. Now this is a idea that comes from economists on the left. I've heard some interesting sort of libertarian arguments from it from people, but what is your take on? So this goes back to the idea that it is important to take care of people who are in poverty or who might've fallen on hard luck and it needs some help getting back on their feet.

Speaker 2:          44:52          I might. My short pitch for the universal basic income would just be, suppose you could take, I forget what the number is, but you know, over a trillion dollars of redistributive spending that the United States government does a social security, medicare, medicaid, unemployment, all of these things. Suppose we said, okay, you can remove all that and just get some kind of cash payout if you fall below a certain level of poverty. So this is kind of the Milton Friedman idea, a where you get sort of more and more money the further below the poverty line you are. So you can see the whole apparatus of the welfare state with its bureaucracy and inefficiency and just replace that with a universal basic income. I make that trade every day of the week. Do you think that that would disincentivize people to actually the people that are right above that marker? I mean, do you know where you put that Marcus?

Speaker 2:          45:41          So I don't know, I don't have the specifics of where I would put it, but the idea is that we, uh, so the way that a friedman structured the idea of the negative income tax is that you would still get more total income by working and making more money so you would see some decrease in the cash grants that you get from the government, but it wouldn't be so massive as to disincentivize so they would be trend but they wouldn't be trimmed so much that you have no incentive to, to go to where do you see that as? Just like some sort of inconsistency with the way that you generally view government because you're obviously not a big government guy. And yet this is something that's really like I would view this as something that this is like government should have no place in giving that much to people.

Speaker 2:          46:24          Like it's kind of shitty. Like I'd love to figure out better ways to help people who need it the most. Um, but the idea of giving more, I just don't know that there's evidence that it works. Yeah. So, so, so I think though that if that objection is successful will also be successful about a, against something like private charity for example. So I think there always is this worry that when you give some kind of assistance that this will have negative effects on people's incentives to work. I think that's, I think that's probably true to some extent, but that might just be a cost that we have to live with. So I think again, even if you're doing some sort of private charity that might lessen at the margin people's willingness to go to work, but I think that trade off is worth it if it means say that, uh, we have people who aren't starving who aren't very sick without help, but I do. So again, a concession that I will make because I think by and large, private charity will work much better than sort of state bureaucratic charity, um, or, or transfer programs, some philosophical level. Doesn't that also make people feel better? Like the idea that like right now government just does

Speaker 1:          47:30          things and it either does them inefficiently or not, you don't really know where your money's going and you kind of just are like, you can just easily be like, yeah, I'm for poor people because the government's doing it where when you actually go ahead and do things and go ahead and volunteer and go ahead and give charity and all that, that just philosophically for your own goodness and happiness and things that we've talked about that that's probably much more rewarding.

Speaker 2:          47:53          I think so. Right. It's very, it's very easy and low cost to just cast a vote for some policy or politician that happens to align with your values. That doesn't really, you know, the price of that is very low, but right. Actually say doing some research, figuring out what causes you support a, putting money into those things. Right. I think that's much more gratifying. I think we should get more and moral credit for doing that than just voting for policies that you'd like to. Is that sort of thing?

Speaker 1:          48:17          Basic disconnect between Democrats and Republicans in this point. Like I view it as sort of Democrats are kind of like, we'll just do everything for you. We're going to say all the nice things and do it for you. And Republicans are just like, we're not. We. Well, they ended up doing it anyway because they had. Once they're empowered, they're always spending the money anyway, but they seem like the evil guys because they don't want to do it. Then they do it anyway, but that's what it really comes down to. It's like one set of people who were saying we're gonna do all the nice things and then doing them even when the results are a nice and another set who doesn't, don't say they want to do the nice things, but then they end up doing it and the result results

Speaker 2:          48:47          still aren't great. Well, so. So I'm not sure. Although I do remember this book I probably a little old by now called who really cares by Arthur Brooks. Have you ever come across? So he's. I think now he's the president, have a right. And what he did find that there were differences in charitable giving between Democrats and Republicans are, I'm not sure if it was along party lines or ideological lines more broadly, and he did find evidence that conservatives tend to give more privately than Democrats. Uh, there might be a variety of explanations for that. So one explanation might just be that conservatives tend to be more skeptical of the efficacy of these large scale bureaucracies. Like how well do they actually work? I think there's maybe also this, this idea that it's the role of something like the family or the church or civil society to take care of people who are in poverty rather than the states.

Speaker 2:          49:37          And so maybe that's why you see conservatives given more charitable dollars than people on the left. Alright. So I want to finish up with a couple, a scientific experiment that you've written about. Oh Wow. I got a couple here. Let's see how sharp you are on the previous work you've done. All right. Talk to me about the Stanford prison experiment credit. Yeah. So. Oh man, that's. Yeah, that's gone back. Right? So this was a, this was research around here, I don't just sit down with people and you know, I think you know, my work better than that. So that was an experiment that was conducted, I, I want to say in the early seventies by a Stanford psychologist, and he recruited a more or less ordinary young men to serve in this experiment. And uh, some of the subjects were cast as prisoners in this fake prison and other subjects were cast as the prison guards in this experiment.

Speaker 2:          50:31          And so they were enforcing the prison rules and feeding the prisoners and uh, having them go to sleep at specified times and so forth. And to make a long story short, what he found was that the power given to the students who were the prison guards did have this corrupt and effect to this idea that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely seem to be supported by his experiments. So very quickly, I think in a matter of days, what you found were the guards who are, again, we're drawing from the same demographic pool as the, as the prisoners were abusing the prisoners, were mocking them, uh, and he had to cut it short because essentially the wheels came off of this experiment and the prisoners got so abuse or the prison guards got so abusive. And so this I think, confirms this idea that, uh, you don't have to be a bad person to allow power to have this corrupting effect on their behavior.

Speaker 2:          51:24          There must be plenty of other studies proving that, right? Even through just the prison system. I mean, when I feel like every prison movie I've ever watched, orange is the new black. I mean, the people that are in charge of the prisons usually are pretty bad people. Yeah. Yeah. And like I said, they could be perfectly ordinary. And there's also the, the milgram experiments where, which are kind of the, uh, the classic case of this where you just have people who are in essence willing to torture, give electric shocks to complete strangers because somebody in authority told them to do so. And the subjects figure out ways to rationalize why these electric shocks are justified, you know, the person should have behaved differently and they wouldn't have gotten the shocks. And what's really frightened about this is it does show that ordinary people, people like, uh, you know, you and I could easily see our behavior corrupted given the right sort of institution.

Speaker 2:          52:12          What do you do as a human knowing that, what do you do to, to insulate yourself while. So one thing I think is to be very skeptical of these sorts of institutions which give people lots of power over others. I think that's one of the big picture lessons from these sorts of experiments. Experiments is just be wary of, of giving people power on an individual level. Knowing about it I think helps a little bit, but even more than just knowing about it. I think I'm practicing it so when you know that you're in a position, say to do something wrong because you feel the social pressure to do it on a small level, I'm just try to resist that impulse and actually do the right thing, so I don't think it's the sort of thing that you can condition yourself to do overnight to resist malevolent authority or resist becoming a malevolent authority, but you could take small steps, but Kinda it's like practicing an athletic skill or something like that. You don't try dunking a basketball the first time you pick it up, but you take these small incremental steps and you'll get better and better. Hopefully built character traits and then maybe resistant when the situation becomes more dire. It's interesting because that's sort of reminds me of the way that we see virtue signaling happening on social media these days. It's not that we're all deciding we have this power and we can shock somebody, but it's like you find someone

Speaker 1:          53:26          halfway across the world who says something you slightly disagree with. Even though you've never heard of them before. You start seeing the mob go at them and the next thing you know, you ratchet up more and then someone else ratcheted up more and more and it's all done in the name of being good actually. The way you're trying to shame and destroyed his person.

Speaker 2:          53:42          Yeah, they're in there, right? There's something kind of psychologically gratifying about being part of a moralizing mob. And I think that's an impulse that does have to be resisted. Right? So it's virtue signaling. It's not actually, it's not actually exactly. Actual virtue would be saying something like, well, I, you know, I think everybody here is wrong about what the right thing to do is here. That's usually a pretty lonely guy. It's true. That's true. All right, one more. Sure. The asch conformity experiment. Yeah. So that's along the same line as the Stanford prison experiment and the milgram experiments in this, I think this was the, one of the originals. It was in the 19 fifties and subjects were given, uh, a board which had lines of different lengths on them. So like there was one that was very long when it was moderately long, when it was short, for example, uh, and then they were given another line that they were told was the same length is one of the lines on the other board and it was very obvious.

Speaker 2:          54:37          So it was like this was a, like a, a very long line over here. And there was a very long line over here. They were clearly the same length but they were surrounded by other lines of various line. But it was just as very easy test until they asked subjects. Well, which line over here is the same length as this line over here? And everybody knew what the correct answer was, but the twist of the experiment was a. The experimenter would bring in confederates who would lie and give the obviously false answers. So they would say, oh, in fact it turns out that the short line over here is the same length as this long line over here. And what they wanted to test was whether the genuine subject would conform to the mistaken group judgment, which they need to be clearly wrong, or would they stick to their guns and say, no, everybody in this room is wrong. It's clearly, you know, this line here and everybody else made a mistake. And the depressing result is that many people would not just conform once, but would conform over and over again to the judgment that they knew was wrong. And even people who sometimes broke from the group would have at least a couple of answers where they conform to the group answer. So is that just

Speaker 1:          55:42          sort of basic built in DNA that just certain people are going to stand up for what they believe in? What's right and what's true and most of us aren't? Or is that,

Speaker 2:          55:51          can you. Can you really like Steven pinker? Right? Well I believe pinker would say something about a blank slate. Right? So. So I'm not sure. Right. He might. He might say it's something close to our DNA. I'm not sure. It's interesting when you read testimony from people in the milgram experiments, there were some people who just refused to deliver these shocks to people even though there was a lot of pressure on them and it seems like some of them had life experiences that really discouraged them from a obeying the authority and it wouldn't shock me, no pun intended, if there was something like that going on in these conformity experiments where maybe people have seen the malevolent effects of blind conformity in this motivated them to do it. Uh, so yeah, so I'm not sure whether it's nature or nurture. I don't know. That's probably above my pay grade.

Speaker 1:          56:40          All right. As long as you mentioned pinker, this I think will be a good way to wrap this all up. Are you hopeful as, as a philosopher, are you hopeful for free thought? I mean, a lot of people that care about the conversations that we're having are really worried and I find that the people that are most closely associated with that I have these conversations with most, I would say most of us are sort of world weary optimists. That's how I would describe myself, like if I wasn't hopeful, I don't know how the Hell I could do this everyday, right. Like I'm hopeful that we can make things better and yet at the same time there's no doubt we have an uphill battle and that there's so much history all the time and all the forces that we're not into seem to be on the march all the time. But are you hopeful?

Speaker 2:          57:23          I like that term world where he optimists, I think that probably describes me pretty well and part of the reason I'm optimistic is because oftentimes when I think when you're interacting with people on a one on one level, you're more likely to have a civil productive discussion about controversial topics. Then when it's like these huge, like I just gave this talk I think recently at a college and you got my brother give me an hour of philosophically not at University of New Hampshire. Oh, okay. Right. Yeah. And so I think in those, so talking about like virtue signaling and a mob mentality, I think those sorts of settings are conducive to that. I think oftentimes when you're just talking with a person over a beer, you might have completely different politics than they do, but it's kind of a, a nonthreatening sort of friendly situation. I think people's guards go down a little bit more and those sorts of situations and you can actually have a conversation about controversial topics in good faith and so that I. So I think people want that. I think people want to have these kinds of discussions and arguments and it might be the people who are a least friendly to that sort of thing, get the most visibility or get the most publicity, but I think if you took an average person off the street and said, hey, let's grab a beer and talk about politics, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as you know, doing it in front of 50,000 people.

Speaker 1:          58:49          I agree. And that's why I said the thing about the 80 percent before, and I think in summation, you believe that beer is the great philosophical equalizer.

Speaker 2:          58:57          Maybe Bourbon. I'm not really at, not beer. You've got this great thing over here. So yeah. So Bourbon is Bourbon whiskey that. On that note we should wrap this up and see what we can do with the Bourbon. Alright for more on Chris Checkout see fryman.com, which we'll link to write down below.
