Speaker 1:          00:02          All right, I'm very excited today. We are at political and we have a packed room. I don't even have to make that up. We actually have the standing room only room at politico and I am here with Michael Steele. He is the former head of the Republican party. Can I say that? Is that the official. You were the head of the Republican National Committee, but republic. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22          head of the party. The guy with the biggest target on this.

Speaker 1:          00:26          Yeah, exactly. He's also the former lieutenant governor of Maryland. And Are you still currently MSNBC? I am

Speaker 2:          00:33          the generalists over to MSNBC. So a one of a very small group of conservative voices.

Speaker 1:          00:40          Did they let you guys over there? Who Do we have to come in the back?

Speaker 2:          00:45          We get to come and get. I get to come in and, and folks are very nice. It's really good. I get water and uh, uh, every once in awhile I get to say hi to people. So it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Yeah. Wait, who else are the Conservatives over there?

Speaker 2:          00:59          I'm uh, Joe Scarborough. Um, and uh, me.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Yeah. All right, good. Very good. Very good. Okay. So there's a ton I want to talk to you about including Cable News, so we'll save some for later. So let's just start first because, uh, you are a Republican now according to my notes they gave me here you are black, is that correct today? Yes. Well, you know, I worked, I've been working on the Tan and I've gotten really good at it, so yeah, yeah. All right, so a black Republican, that was the head of the party. I know, I imagine they exist. Explain that to me.

Speaker 2:          01:35          It's called history. Uh, and, and a lot of folks really don't appreciate the very unique history between Republican, the Republican Party and the black community. It is our political home, uh, it is where we first emerged in this country politically, uh, and certainly, uh, you know, Lincoln and the abolitionist and, and in fact the party was born out of a fight between abolitionists and wigs, uh, over the issue of slavery. And um, the. Thankfully the abolitionists one and the Republican Party was essentially formed Frederick Douglass, a notable African American, a slave and free. A man was very much a part of helping to build this party. So we've got this very unique history and as a young, a young kid of 17, uh, looking at getting involved politically for the first time, I was like, you know, my mom who was a Roosevelt Democrat, you know, my, my family, very, very much democrats. And, um, my mother raised me to say, hey, you know, go out there and discover and, and decide for yourself. Don't let our party affiliation of what we're doing and fluency just because we're Democrats. And your onset a Democrat and your grandmother's Democrat and your grandfather, Democrat, and, uh, your cousins are Democrats. No, no pressure

Speaker 2:          03:02          out at night did the study. And I, I realized, well, this is our home. This is the political home for the party of Ronald Reagan was running for president in [inaudible] 76. At that time. It was my first election to vote in. And he sounded a lot like my mom in terms of how my mother talked to me about me. You know, as a young man, I'm in this country, uh, and, you know, having opportunities, taking advantages of opportunities so connected, it resonated. And uh, you know, went and told mom, hey, you know, I registered as a Republican and she looked at me. She said, Lord, what's the watch?

Speaker 1:          03:35          Do that. That's all been good. Yeah. So that's a lot of the history, but I think I'm going to guess that a lot of the people here would say, well, this doesn't seem to be the party. No, but it's not. Well, and I hate playing identity politics. Yeah, I don't, I don't want to get into that because that's,

Speaker 2:          03:53          that's a slippery slope on so many levels for both parties who've, who've really screwed up, uh, our politics with identity politics. But, and we can have that discussion, but I think there is a legitimacy to the, to the point that we have, I think failed over the last 50 years to appreciate that history. And I started with a history because to me it is an important place to start because it, it, you, then you then follow that into, uh, the fight that would later come on, civil rights and the Republican leaders who themselves conservatives at that time, I'm like their, their forefathers politically. Uh, the abolitionists were, we're stewards of this ideal, uh, in the Senate in the house. Um, and Johnson, Lyndon Johnson knew that and yet a political decision was made for Kras political gain. And, and that was to, um, that national politics, the idea of controlling the presidency or winning elections for Congress meant more than other things. Uh, and uh, we walked away, we walked away from the black community, uh, and, and I think we are still paying the price for that.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Yeah. So I think that's a good setup for the first part here, which, what does being a Republican in Twenty 15 in America right now with our system is so screwed up, so wacky. I feel like people don't even know what that meant to you.

Speaker 2:          05:24          They've lost meaning because it's all gotten con conflated into, uh, other labels. And, and so, you know, where this tea party as conservative or is this, and I just make the case that at the end of the day, uh, there there's a thread of value or of values or principles, ideals that you ascribe to a, whether it is, um, your view on the role of government in the lives of the American people. Um, historically Republicans have not been antigovernment they been for limited government. They think government is the legitimate as a legitimate entity. It has a legitimate purpose though unlimited purpose. Um, whether that thread, uh, uh, or idea centers around how you view the culture, in other words that, you know, morality and concerns for the unborn or whatever the issues may be that that's a part of that narrative. So there, there are broader, they're broader strokes that have been used, uh, or, or sort of stripped down, uh, in a way that gets us into this crass political discussion about, I'm right, you're wrong on an issue.

Speaker 2:          06:37          And that, that's never, that's never really the goal. And I think the, I kind of sum it up this way, that I, I look at the Party and I certainly saw this as a county chairman and as national chairman and a state chairman that even in a state like Maryland, I had western Maryland, which was very conservative. I had where I lived in Prince George's in the beltway area, which was very liberal. You had southern Maryland, which was conservative, but trending purple, you had, you know, so you had this, these different dynamics, and you have to kind of lead in that. You've got to govern in that and you realize that politics is really about the art of the possible is not about the art of the angry or scoring points or gaining advantage. It really is about how do I take all of these disparate parts, uh, and different viewpoints and, and figuring out how to effect a positive change or policy of positive change on a set of, you know, uh, ideas and that that's gotten lost today in his heart. And you've seen this play out right now in the GLP, um, this, this internet icn struggle over identity, who we are, what we believe and why we value that.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Yeah. So to the, to the point of, of what the party actually stands for, I'm always amazed by the fact that if you take to like hot button issues that are, that are clearly democrat pocket issues, gay rights and legalizing marijuana, those are Democrat issues. They, they, there for, you know, basically for legalizing weed basically for gay rights. But it seems to me a true Republican that would want small government. Well, you wouldn't care what someone does in their bedroom, whether it's having sex with someone of the same sex or uh, whether smoking weed, right? Shouldn't that be a republican issue?

Speaker 2:          08:22          Well, I, I would argue that it probably wants was that remember that the gop also has, as a part of its roots, a libertarian threat, a very strong libertarian thread. Um, I've always been amused that those who, who would argue about the limited role of government on one issue but then argue for the expansion of government on another. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:46          right. So that, that's so, so, so that

Speaker 2:          08:49          being authentically consistent for me is very important. It's like when people ask me about my views on life and, and I tell them, I say, well, I'm prolife, I'm very much pro life in a lot of has to come from how I was raised. It comes from my faith tradition and how I've been taught and, and come to believe in value life. So when it comes to the death penalty, I'm against it and I always get, well, how can you be against the death penalty? Well, because I'm prolife, you know, so you've got to be consistent from beginning to the end and that's not what we see happening. Can you think of a politician off the top of your head that's consistent actually, that really is, is governing off a real set of. I can't take anybody. I mean, can you think anyone? Can any of you think of anyone?

Speaker 2:          09:31          Anyone that's governing? Oh No. Because they're not allowed to. They're not allowed to do it because the, the, the, the tensions inside both caucus of Cockeye are, um, are, are such the Latin coming back is, is, is, um, is so, so intense, uh, that. Look, I grew up in DC and so the nation's capital has been in my backyard forever. And so I remember Washington when it was fun to be in Washington and you could go. When I was a kid, I used to go sit on the capital steps, 11:00 when I was in high school with my buddies, we'd grab a liter of coke and

Speaker 1:          10:11          bag of chips. The Soda, the Soda. I'm just seeing what is your guide? Yes, yes, yes, yes. See, I threw in liter of coke because I used to say I used to grab some coke and a bag of chips. I'm like, no, soda. Okay. Okay. Just so I got. We would sit there, but we would sit on the steps or you hang out with him,

Speaker 2:          10:31          Capitol police and so, and you see members coming back and they taught. You go to restaurants in town and you could see a table where, you know, a conservative or a Democrat or Republican, they weren't conservative liberal, that was a republican and Democrat would be off talking policy or just shooting the breeze. You don't see that now. They don't, they don't mix, they don't talk, they don't integrate. They don't want to be a part of this. They don't bring their families here. They go back to the districts which they should do. But there's this disconnect and the consequence of that is what we see now there, there is no reason for me to work with you. I remember when I was chairman and we were doing a getting ready for the 2010 election. Your course, you're going out and you're meeting candidates and you're sort of interviewing them to see who you want to line up and support and who you and not so much.

Speaker 2:          11:18          And um, I met this one candidate and we got into a nice conversation, you know, solid rock, rip conservative and he's coming. He is fire and brimstone ready to come to Washington. And so we were talking and I said something about what will, you know when you get to DC, you know, because at that time the dems were still in charge and said, you know, one of the real interesting challenges is going to be working with, with the leadership on the other side and working with Democrats. Oh, I'm not doing that. I said, excuse me doing that. I said, why are you coming to Washington? He said, I'm coming into work with Democrats. That's the attitude.

Speaker 1:          11:52          That's double down with

Speaker 2:          11:54          a 10. That's it. That's it. It's a lot of things. It's not just tea party. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on tea party and, and the tea party came into being on my watch. So I know very well what was the, the essence of that in that time. But what people don't recognize is that movement such as it is, that energy started way before 2009. This goes back to 2004. This goes back to 2002 big government republicanism. The spending on the war, the Terry Shy vo case. Remember the Terry Shive. Okay. When the republic is called the Senate, back into session two to pass a bill to prevent this family from the making decision about this poor woman who was in a coma.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Well again, these are the people that want government. So on the one hand you say, you know, government should be out of the way, but then the other you're going to call Congress into session to pass

Speaker 2:          12:46          bill to tell someone what they can't do in this instance. That's, that's the conundrum that the parties put itself.

Speaker 1:          12:53          So who do you like out of this group? You know, I met you a couple of weeks ago that the in the spin room at the gop debate and I was able to ask Scott Walker a question and I asked him about campaign finance and I got to tell you sometimes you look at someone and you go, this guy is dumb. I mean he, he struck me as dumb. He, he just, I could, I could just see it. You know what I mean? Like, I could just look at him and see, this is not a bright guy now. You don't have to comment on that specifically, but not dumb. He's won a lot of elections. He wanted more than any of those guys. But what do you think of the general, the general crop?

Speaker 2:          13:29          I think the general crop overall is a very strong group of individuals. Um, you look at the governors, the governors that are in the race, uh, or were in the race. Uh, you look at the senators. I'm Carly Fiorina, very successful businesswoman. Carly, a Ben Carson, very successful a neurosurgeon. So it's a, it's a diverse group. It is the most diverse field we put up ever. I'm not just in terms of a woman and African American, all that, but just in terms of background and experience, the depth of it. I mean, George Jeb Bush was a very successful, did a good job as governor and in Florida, uh, elected strongly two times a John Casick. Same thing in Ohio. I went through hell in the first term. Um, and weather that storm.

Speaker 1:          14:20          What did you make a case answer to? The to the gay marriage question in the first year, that was, I thought it was a beautiful thing for me that was an option inauthentically

Speaker 2:          14:29          Republican response. That's the, that and Jeb Bush, when he talked about, uh, immigration again and authentically Republican response because at the end of the day what Jeff was saying and he used the language that people could understand. He didn't come at it and policy and political ease. He used the word love, which to me and to a whole lot of people was a recognition of people behind the policy that while you can sit back and talk all the smack about, you know, we're going to build walls and we're going to electrify the marina and do all this crap. At the end of the day, there are people behind that and if you don't appreciate that, then you don't have a good policy. It's not, it's not a smart policy. And I think that that was something my takeaway in his discussion, which I thought was a very humble and a very personal way to talk about immigration.

Speaker 2:          15:26          No one ever talked about it on either side in those terms and, and I thought he did well by that. So in a way you kind of want to combine these guys. If you could combine a couple of the issues. Candida. Yeah, I mean, well we're doing pretty good on the Frankenstein part without the combination. I think. No, I think that they're in a real sense. You're right. I mean, what I'm looking for at the end of the day, I like John Casick. I like Jeb. I mean I like a lot of these guys, but what I'm looking for, and I've said this from the very beginning of the cycle, I'm looking for someone who's prepared to sacrifice their race for the presidency. That's what it's going to take. In other words, and Jeb got close. He used the words when he said, I'm willing to lose the primary to win the general, but really sit there and go, you know what, America, this is it. Let's just cut the crap. You want too much and we can't deliver.

Speaker 2:          16:26          That's how the conversation starts because it gets you into spending. It gets you into programs that gets you into the size of government, that gets you into policy. It gets you into everything that you know. We are our own worst enemies as Americans because we. What did we say folks? We say cut spending last government. Why want more in my paycheck? And then in the next sentence, why don't you put more money in that program? Why aren't you spending more on this? Why aren't you giving to this cause over here? What do you want? So the question for me is always boiled down very simply, and you know the model, your, you did a little economics in school right now. Well you know, you know the whole idea of guns and butter, right? And it was always you. You can either have guns or you can have butter.

Speaker 2:          17:09          Well I think there's a different model where you can actually have both, but the only way you get to have both is by prioritizing. Because in any given moment, at any given time, something is going to be the priority. So that's what we focus on. Let's address that. So that means we're going to spend a little bit less on guns today and more on butter because we need to put people back to work. We need to make sure that a hospital stay open. We may need to make sure that, oh gee, that bridge is falling down. We need to fix it. Right? That's the priority. So we put a little bit more into that at another time. The priorities may shift. Okay? Whether it's something that happens overseas, isis gets stoop more than they already are, whatever you've got to deal with that, then we maybe we spend a little bit less.

Speaker 2:          17:55          We reprioritize and we don't do that. The second thing is government gets out and says, look, we're going to impose these restrictions were going to make you do this and we're gonna give you all this stuff. All right, fine. I'm happy with that. Great. Right? People like stuff. People like stuff. Yeah, but no one ever goes back to see or find out how the stuff is working and whether or not the program that you've designed, no child left behind actually works for teachers in the classroom or whether you know the, the institution that you've created, our social safety net in all of its various forms actually meets the needs of the people who supposed to be treated. I thinking right now the va, so again, making government accountable for all of that is important, but also the role that we play in that process is equally important because what's happened now is our politicians, you're telling them every different thing and so if you come at this way, you come at this way, you come at this way, what happens?

Speaker 2:          18:58          They just stand still and they do nothing and then they don't. They're not governed by a basic set of principles that you talked about earlier. So they are going every week, so they're going every which way and they're given everybody anything and they're just sitting back on what asks what you want and I'm done. That's not what we want. Ultimately, we are actually looking for someone to take the risk, which is the bottom line point. Are you prepared to take the risk to do the job? So when I was lieutenant governor, my approach to being lieutenant governor, it was only have four years to do this job because the other four aren't guaranteed and they weren't because I didn't win the election, but I walked out having reformed a minority business enterprise, got charter school law passed in the state, um, and worked on a number of initiatives including the death penalty that the governor asked me to work on.

Speaker 2:          19:46          Um, and I felt that we had done the job that people have sent us to do a. Now the politics took over in that case. And that's the risk, you know, the governor of Maryland, that then my buddy Bob Ehrlich got fired with a 62 percent job approval on election day. Um, but you know, people hate it. Republicans in 2006 because of the war and a lot of other things. So, but you do the job, you can't think about the next election. And right now our politicians are more concerned about being primary or losing an election and they don't do the job. So that's really where I want to go with this. But do you want the 30 seconds to do trump or should we just tell we get to trump. All right. Thirty seconds go. What do you make of this thing? Trump is an enigma wrapped in a question mark wrapped in.

Speaker 2:          20:30          I mean, he's a lot in a wig. The Wig. Yeah, he's, he's all these things. He's all these things that have upset the status quo of American politics. Everybody is. Everybody wants to run a conventional campaign except trump. He's running an unconventional path campaign. Everybody else was running a conventional campaign in an unconventional time and they don't know how to do. We'll deal with it or what to do with it. And he is, you know, whether or not he gets the nomination. All of that remains to be seen. Folks. We're a long way from the first vote. Being cast

Speaker 1:          21:07          over a year away from the election does not know,

Speaker 2:          21:10          but we're actually only three months away from the first primary caucus votes and that's where, that's where the real rubber begins to meet the road. That's what voters actually have to go into a caucus room like this or in a voting booth and actually think about who are they're going to give this next charge, two to be the president. Um, and I think that dynamic as you get through this third debate on the fourth debate in December and then into January, we'll begin to settle. But trump has changed the way we do this. And I think that's good. I appreciate it. You know, I talked to people all across the country. They don't like what he said about Mexicans. They don't like the way he talks about women. They don't like a lot about trump, but you know, every sentence that starts like that, the next word is. But I don't like what he said. But yeah, I don't appreciate that. But, and I keep telling folks in DC as long as they're saying, but then anything can happen. Anything can happen.

Speaker 1:          22:12          So is that the interesting thing about, about both parties right now, because trump and Bernie to me are hitting on the same thing, which is that the system is broke. I mean, in the first debate, trump basically said, he said, yeah, I gave Hillary a lot of money and she showed up at my wedding because that's how politicians operate. Right? And Greg, he's telling the truth on that side. So you have the capitalist, right? The poster child for capitalism and the poster child for socialism. And those are the two that are getting taken away. So what? So what do you make it? Oh, there's your ticket next year. That's not set that sanders versus trump 2016.

Speaker 1:          22:46          I want to be at that part. I'm going to have myself a gin and tonic and popcorn. Can you imagine that to be really like in the debate if it was the two of them? Because. Because Bernie's people you unfiltered trump's off his rocker. I mean, it will be something, right? No, wait a minute. So why is Bernie unfiltered and trump office rock? Because Bernie, because he is a politician. Why? Why can't Bernie, why can't trump be unfiltered to. Well, no, trump is unfiltered, but there's nothing beneath the filter. That's it. The tell that to all the people are following them. I've been trying to tell, but they're not listening.

Speaker 2:          23:22          Making the more important point that folks keep missing. It's that I'm not.

Speaker 1:          23:32          Bring it. Bring that attitude. It's that attitude

Speaker 2:          23:34          that's pissing everybody off. You think you know better than the person who's following him

Speaker 1:          23:40          and that's, that's just not, that's just not right. You've got to respect best where our politics has gotten to. We've stopped respecting the fact that I can follow you because I actually like what you're saying even though you think he's full of shit. Excuse me. So, um, but, but, but that's. But that's. But that's, that's the American process. So to do that, you don't get to judge it. I'm waiting. If you don't judge it out loud because then I may hit. You should have. Fair enough. So I'm saying so I'm with you on that. But to me, trump, this isn't a real candidacy that I just don't think. So. Why do you say that? We'll revisit this. No, no, no, he is filed the paperwork. He's disclosed his income. He's got a campaign organization. Trust me. This brother's got a camp

Speaker 2:          24:25          paint organization in a number of states that people don't even know. He's got a campaign organization in. He's doing the things. Look, you know what was a telling moment? I don't know if. How many of you caught it? Remember when he wrote out his economic plan? What did you notice about what he did? Anybody trump tower. It's everything's that comm tower. He had no cards. Yes. He was not read off the top of his head. He read off of prepared text. Trump is in this thing the right way. Everything he's done up to now has gotten your attention and now he's rolling out a little policy on this. A little policy I'm telling you. Watch it because the attitude of the folks in Washington about his campaign is the thing that keeps him in the camera.

Speaker 1:          25:16          Hey, I get it. I mean, I do get. I know you hate hearing that, but it's true. All right, so. Well I can. I can hear something and being yesterday. Yeah, look, Huffington Post says they're not going to write about him in the politics and, right, that gets, that gets the base, the base angle, right? So that was the longest 30 seconds I know. Trope, right? So let's just talk about the system of politics because you're an insider and an outsider. So when you were the chairman of the Republican Party, how much of the job, how much of your day to day was just about money because that's what this is really all about. So let's be clear,

Speaker 2:          25:48          be clear. Um, the role of any party chairman, Democrat, Republican counties, state national is two things. They only have two things. Raise money and win elections. If you don't do that, you're not doing your job. So your day is made up of doing those two things. That is 80 percent of your day. And, and, and on a good day where you will spend anywhere from two to four hours dialing for dollars, which they're very few of us like doing because it's just tough to raise. I look, I'm calling, I'm asking you for $38,000. Okay. There's a lot of presumption in that conversation. Right. All right. And, and because that's the maximum you can give.

Speaker 1:          26:35          Did they give you a list? I mean, right when you get. Oh, we get their first day. They're like, here's the list you get, get on the phone. I got, I was elected on a Friday and

Speaker 2:          26:44          that Monday I went up to New York and did a town hall on healthcare and the economy. And uh, that Tuesday I was at my desk officially for the first time at the desk and I did a three and a half hours with the calls for, for donors. Then what I did was, it was the idea was I needed to introduce myself to these folks because I'm the new kid on the block. And um, you know, for some of them I was a little bit more of a shock than they anticipated and uh, and so it was more introduction, but then, yeah, you kind of roll into. And I actually had a donut cussed me out and said, you know, I'm so sick of the party. Every time I hear from you people is when you call asking for money, I'm not giving you another damn dime, Dah, da Da.

Speaker 2:          27:28          And I let him vent. His brother went on for like 20 minutes and I let him, I let him talk. And then I said, well actually I wasn't calling to ask for money. I was just calling to introduce myself and you wouldn't have said no to the money. He wasn't given any money. So, but, but this was the point. And this is another important lesson, how I think you do this, right? So I listened to this man because here is a longtime donor, uh, an activist in the party supporter who is now ticked off at its leadership at the political operations and wants no part of it. So I told him, I said, well look, I'll tell you, I'm putting together a business plan, which is what I did. I put together a business. I'm a business guy. So I've put together a business plan for the Party and said we've got to raise money and how are we going to spend it?

Speaker 2:          28:15          These are things that are priorities. And I got that together, uh, over a period of time, but I told him I was doing it. I also told, laid out to him what I wanted to do, what my vision was, and I told him, look, I don't want your money. I said, you wait and see if I do the job to your satisfaction and if you feel like giving, give us, give us a check. Two weeks later you sent the check for the maximum amount because. Because, and he told me in his note, he said, you listened to me, you took the time to listen to me. And so I thought about that. And that is a big difference. Listening to people goes so goes so far. And so the money piece is a big part of now. I believe money is property. I just generally do.

Speaker 2:          29:01          That's my philosophical view. Like any, anything else I own, I should be free to do with it as I wish. I'm not. Doesn't say there shouldn't be limitations I suited in. This is great. Now you'll love this. So the RNC had a lawsuit and that I took over when I became chairman to, to basically peel back on mccain fine goal because Mccain Feingold took away from the parties the ability to raise the money. Right. And they created this system that we have. And of course there was a companion lawsuit. Guess what? It was put more money in now. No. What was the companion lawsuit? Anyone Supreme Court rejected my lawsuit and picked up citizens united. Right, right, right. So, so citizens united was the, it was the case. They decided to take over the one that will be given the money, allow donors to give untold sums as they used to to the state parties, to the national parties and the state parties.

Speaker 2:          30:01          And they decided to go down this road where you could set up these five slash 27, which we're now living through is a nightmare. So I want to get to that in just a sec. But I think everyone wants to know how much does the money, how much influence does it actually get you? So someone writes a $38,000 check or someone writes the shrimp. Yeah, I mean really what, what, what are you running? Get? Well with the part, again, separating the party from the candidate. When you write a check to the R and C, we going to take care of you. All right? Because that's what we do. That's what we're supposed to do. And what does that mean? When you call up and want to talk to the chairman? You get to talk to the chairman. Um, when you, now you don't bring issues to me because we're political.

Speaker 2:          30:40          We're not policy. So you can. And some do. I mean I've got buckets of ideas that people say, hey, I think we should do this. That's fine, but that's a separate way to operate. That's, that's all political. You know, it, it's, it's what it is. I, you know, we wine, you dine you, we take you out and we do big fundraisers, we do small fundraisers, we're in your home, all of that part of that. And of course the access you get. So when you have conviction, guess what? You're going to be taken care of because you're a major donor to the party. Yeah. You're going to be invited to the suite. You're going to get a chance to meet the candidates fan. Then you know the nominees, family and all of that stuff. That's what we do. There's nothing wrong with that. We've been doing that since the days of Jefferson and Washington and all those guys.

Speaker 2:          31:26          All right, so that's not unusual. What's changed now is this dynamic where you have organizations that can be created that extensively don't talk to the candidate. Right. Which we know is complete bullshit, right? Of course. Yeah. You know, you know everybody, you know, my, my, my former chief of staff is now the head of my Super Pac. You don't think I'm talking to this guy at some point. All right? So we'll, we'll, we'll go with the lie will go with the fiction that it doesn't happen. But what, what it does do is, and I'm, and I'm, I have to be honest with everyone. I'm still evolving in a way on this subject because of how I view money generally. Um, but money in politics and I see what it is doing is making it harder. It, it is becoming more of a distraction at the end of the day, whether you're a Rupert Murdoch or um, you know, some other big liberal or conservative donor, you get one vote, you get one vote, you know, you don't get, you know, 38,000 votes because you wrote a check for $30,000 so you get one vote, but now you can put a lot of money to put a lot of ads on Fox or CNN or MSNBC that influence a lot of other people, you know.

Speaker 2:          32:42          Okay. So let's talk about that. Do you, are you really influenced by political ads anyway? Do you, if you saw an ad tearing him down, if he was a candidate for office and saying that, you know, he hates puppies, do you, do you really, do you really walk away from that thinking he hates puppies. I, I really do. My grandmother didn't work and she goes, that's my point. I mean, I'm not saying it doesn't work, but what, what I'm saying? And, and Willie Horton, by the way, it was originally a Democrat and their primary, so we won't, we won't have that whole, that's a whole nother discussion. I thought they'd like to put that on our doorstep. But let's, let's go to the origins of the Willie Horton ad. Um, but the, but you're right, it works. So what does that say about us? What does that say about you, the consumer?

Speaker 2:          33:33          I mean, I, I just don't. I guess my point is this is the ying and the Yang. So the political class takes advantage of it as much as they can because they know a negative ad is going to work no matter how much you protest against it, no matter how much you hate it, you're going to sit there like this. Wow. Did you say, did you see that? And now today you're going to tweet about it and you're gonna you're gonna send it out. So they know that they play to that. Um, and, and that's part of that part of the problem. And the money does that. What I tried to do as chairman and we were moderately successful in the last cycle in 2012, but we set it up in my term in 20 2009 and 10 was I saw down the road that money was going to be an issue, particularly after the Supreme Court rejected my case and took citizens united.

Speaker 2:          34:20          So we wanted to design a system so that you could actually participate without necessarily having to have a lot of money. And we saw that with Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and a number of candidates in the 2012 cycle who didn't have Mitt Romney's bankroll. But because of the way the system was designed, they had time to get their idea out there and those ideas began to resonate and that's when the money came to them after the fact. So there is this dynamic that that you can play around with right now. And as I will argue and agree with you, it's distorted and there needs to be a reassessment of how we use money in politics. And, and right now I think it's, it's used poorly because it's just way, way too much of it. So last question about, about money. Do you think both parties treated the same?

Speaker 2:          35:10          I think there's a sense, and this may be just there. Yeah, that you know, that the Koch brothers run the Republican Party. There's more of these evil Mr Burns guys that are running the party more than say the Democrats. I, I'm a firm believer that it's equal. How much money did Hollywood, how much money did the unions, how much money did individual wealthy donors give Barack Obama into Rock Obama? Who as a US senator was up on the Senate floor beating the hell out of Republicans over campaign finance reform, talking all this smack about, oh yeah, you know, take the public money until he got a big ass check. And then all of a sudden when it was, when it came time to make that decision, what did his campaign decided to do? They didn't take public money in 2008 like Mccain did. What did they do? The suit, they took all the Super Pac money.

Speaker 2:          36:00          They, even though they weren't super pacs, they took all that money out of Hollywood. They took all that money off of Wall Street. So don't talk to me about money in republican politics and I'm not talking about money and the political system that's, that's the reality, because both sides love it. Both sides suck at that teeth every single day, politically and maybe otherwise. And that, that is, that's the reality that we're now having to live with. So, you know, talk about big money. It's just now manifesting itself in a different form because for 40 years with the unions and Hollywood, we're backing Democrats. Republicans weren't, I mean, we didn't have, we didn't have all these big players the way we do now. We didn't have the Koch brothers back in, in, in, in Ronald Reagan's Day or in the 19 seventies. So the dynamic has changed a little bit.

Speaker 2:          36:54          Um, was actually changed a lot. But the thread, the meme is the same and that is money still plays a role in politics. The question that we need to ask ourselves again in, in setting up our scales of priorities is how do we prioritize, prioritize its role, because if you're going to go to a public, uh, public financing system, then you need to account for races that are in markets like this market here in la that is damned expensive versus a market in Utah or a market in southwest corner of South Carolina. Is this an example of where Obama really has dropped the ball? Because even just yesterday he went to Oregon where the shooting was a couple days ago. And do you guys know where he went? Right after that? He went to a fundraiser. This is, I mean, think about that. He was almost after every national tragedy goes to a fundraising.

Speaker 2:          37:47          I don't know who scheduling this guy. This is a second term president with only a year left. Who after this horrific tragedy, I don't know who's raised in one, who's raised the money for I guess for the party, right? Hi. Debbie says they're broke. So I don't know. Isn't that the most emblematic thing of what's going on here? That even a two term president on his way out goes to a tragedy and then at the end of the day, his day was spent raising money and not even for himself. Yeah, I mean, I think, I think that is something that really sticks in the craw of a lot of people and I can tell you, is as many conservatives and libertarians are as annoyed about that as are liberals and progressives. And so it is, it is an American phenomenon that we invest so much of our politics and having money to do politics.

Speaker 2:          38:39          Um, when you look at the way politics is executed around the globe that come anywhere near what we spend, uh, to, to elect someone to office. You think about how much money a candidate running for. I was with the candidate, uh, yesterday in New Hampshire. I'm looking at a congressional race. Ask them how much it's going to run, how much it's gonna, cost them in New Hampshire for $2,000,000 in New Hampshire in New Hampshire for a job that pays $170,000 a year. When I ran for the US Senate in 2006, my race was the most expensive race in the state of Maryland up to that point, uh, for the, for federal office. And I raised $10,000,000 for the US Senate races today for 2000, uh, 16. Uh, that race is now about a 15 to $20,000,000 race. Why? Why? And no one stops to ask the question to answer the question, why, why is it that expensive?

Speaker 2:          39:42          Doesn't it? They're right it. And they need to continue to ask it because you know, it, it is having a, I think, a very downward, a depressive effect on our politics. Um, it, it, it, it brings out the cynicism and all of us because you just see a very small group of people who are getting to play and you're the one paying the taxes. You're the one trying to make it from paycheck to paycheck. You're the one who's trying to deal with all this crap that spews out of state capitals and in federal government. Um, and you just feel that your access is somehow limited and cut off and no American should feel that way in my view. All right? Enough, enough about money, money. It's important. It's important, but, and we can talk about it forever. It's important. It is important, but it's, it's one of those things I don't you tell me how you get it out of the game.

Speaker 2:          40:35          How do you get out of the game at this point? Because under the current rules, under the current rules, because as long as you've got to citizens united a out there where you, you, you and you can get together and decided we were going to form a PAC and it may not be for candidate a or candidate b. You just want to form a PAC and you just want to play and you're going to go to the rest of the university. You can now raise untold millions of dollars and we don't need to know who any one of you are. You can stroke a check for $10,000,000 right now and your name will never show up on any report in Washington. Do we really want that system? I believe very, again, going back to my and we can move on, going back to my central argument, money his property so I can do with my property whatever I want, right?

Speaker 2:          41:22          So if I want to write your campaign, a $10,000,000 check, all right, I should be allowed to do it. But here's the caveat. Here's the catch. The day I ride it, the next morning, the next hour, the next it is fully disclosed period. My name, what I do, the amount, the nature of my business so that everyone in the universe knows who's giving to you, and then that puts the onus on you, the politician, because if you want to be associated with my money and all that comes with it, guess what? You'll take it. But if you don't, guess what you want and that will have a chilling effect because right now, if you don't know that I'm doing something that you know harms the environment or otherwise is a negative, for example, no one in the universe will ever know it except you. When you write the check, when you get it,

Speaker 1:          42:17          the check, I'm pretty sure that politicians like the plausible deniability, of course they do. So. All right, so moving away from money. So I want to talk about foreign policy a little bit because to me it should be a republican. This should be a goto republican issue and we're in a freaking mess right now. I mean I don't, I don't think the American public really realizes what public initiatives that they're stronger, you know, the executive branch sets the foreign policy. So why is this of. Sure. But the idea that Republicans are stronger and foreign policy and we have such a meltdown, right? And we gave that up a while ago. Clearly we gave that. We gave that position up a while ago when we started making some, some, some really boneheaded decisions about how we engage boneheaded, right? So I mean it was just, it's just

Speaker 2:          43:01          bad policy. You don't, you don't do nation building. No, no super power. Since time began has been successful at nation building. It always, it always collapses. At some point it falls down around your feet.

Speaker 1:          43:14          So where do you fall down on everything that's going on in the Middle East? We tried to nation build, right? We know we went to the wrong war for the wrong reasons. Is that fair to say? But you also mentioned, um, and now because of that Iraq, but especially Syria, they're not functioning states in, in any way that we define a state. You look at it in two parts and the first one,

Speaker 2:          43:33          we all know the history, we all know how we got here. All right? So that's, that's stipulated. We all know how we got here and I think generally everyone and including a candidates now running for president on the gop side, some begrudgingly, some less. So admit that we've got here the wrong way. All right? So we're in a bad space for the wrong reasons. Alright? So now the tests of this time, um, is how do we go forward and how do we, what do we learn from the mistake? And then how do we not make it again, but more importantly, how do we position the United States visa vi, uh, are our allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia. Uh, who you represent a to two opposing problems for, for the U, s, m, a, and our enemies like Iran, um, which I really don't want to use that term because that's a little strong, you know, that's a little strong because it's not, I don't think it's there, you know, I don't think so

Speaker 1:          44:49          that kind of give them $150 million, I don't think it's that

Speaker 2:          44:54          kind of relationship. Um, and, and, and the strategic relationship which we need to have with Russia and China who are big players in the Middle East, but so are the French, the Brits. So

Speaker 1:          45:08          where does that leave us as a, as a nation? Because it seems to me we go in, we try something, we always screw it up and now we leave and we see what that does. I mean it's a real mess there and we created it. So I feel like there's, there's a guilt sort of associated with the Americans. We feel like we have to do something and yet we know, no matter what we do, we somehow make it worse. And now Russia is jumping in and, and reassess.

Speaker 2:          45:29          And, and I, you know, I, you know, we can argue the point, but I think there are enough examples of either hesitation by this administration, the Obama Administration, a reticence, uh, or even just a lack of unawareness, which they even alluded to just recently about, uh, the maneuvers of Russia when you have State Department officials off the record saying, we didn't see this coming due. That's why you're there. You're supposed to see this coming. But,

Speaker 1:          46:02          or they call them jv called.

Speaker 2:          46:05          Let me tell you what I think this goes back to. This goes back to a, believe it or not to the 19 seventies in my view, um, when the church committee, uh, and the Carter administration sort of came to this community, a conclusion that our intelligence organizations were somehow bad. Now they, you know, CIA and all those guys. Yeah, they had their fingers in some crazy pots and doing some crazy things. We got that. But I think what we, what we are, what we have seen over time, whether it's Iran Contra, whether it is a, what we're seeing right now, uh, in, uh, in the Middle East, um, is a lack of intelligence on the ground, a lack of ability to actually know what the hell is going on. And I don't just mean know who the bad players are, but know what, nook and cranny they're in.

Speaker 2:          46:59          No know what their favorite cafe is, know what their favorite coffee or Latte is. No, know who their kids. I mean just that level of detail that was so much a part of the Cold War in terms of how the US and Russia sort of worked off of each other and knew what was going on and they were so effective at it that they created a effectively a stalemate. Yeah. So who's fault is that? That we don't have that? Oh, I think it's. I think it's, I think it's a combination of, of political leadership that sort of overreacted to bad things that, that, you know, some of these institutions get into. And, and, and do, you know, government is about overreaction. It's about reaction. It's not, it's not a proactive entity, they just don't, you think they sit around and say, so listen, how do we actually solve a problem before it starts?

Speaker 2:          47:48          That's just not, that's not what they do. So, you know, a new town happens, a columbine happens, um, you know, a, a, a Freddie gray happens. These things happen. And then the government wants to come. We're now we're going to come here and we're going to fix this for you. Don't worry, we got this now actually now just step out and I'll just let the people on the ground deal with it. So there's, there's a little bit of that where they overreact and they overreact in a way in which they actually wind up making it worse. And in the process of overreacting, they begin to penalize the players in a way that prevents them from doing anything constructive later on. Because now we're going to cut your funding for this. We're going to bring you in for all these here. If they just did day to day, week to week, month to month oversight, they have committees called oversight.

Speaker 2:          48:40          Do they meet? Do they actually do oversight? Whose oversight? If you're doing this on an ongoing basis and you're sort of, you're supporting and guiding those, those intelligence organizations. A lot of the stuff that we've gotten ourselves into over the last 15, 20 years, some of that could have been avoided because we would have had the intelligence to know. I mean, look at, look at it this way. You know, how many times have we seen in the political process when you don't have to count right on something or you, you've misidentified something or you missed brand, that's okay. There are no consequences from that. Alright, so the speaker didn't get that vote because the whip didn't count it. Right, okay, we got that. But when you're out in the field, when you're, when you're in a situation like Bengazi for example, where you have cables from, from the people in the field saying, we need the support and the folks in Washington want to have a meeting about it.

Speaker 2:          49:40          That's where the things began to break down, and so there's this idea of having an ongoing, uh, accountable oversight process in which you are, you are in the moment, real time with what's going on, I think begins to alleviate the pressure on the executive branch and even the Congress, uh, to put itself in a position where, you know, we're talking about sending in troops and, you know, ratcheting up all this spending on, on, you know, in reaction to something that someone else has done. Um, I think that's a step. Not always playing catch up. I think we're playing catch up and it's more complicated. I know and there's a lot more to it, but it's, you know, I tell you, I've, I've learned over the years in Washington and certain watching some of these guys, it's always the simple stuff. You know, it, it's this, the things that you don't think are important or the things that you just kind of got, well, why are we, why would we do that? That's the thing you should do to avoid a bigger problem later on.

Speaker 1:          50:37          One thing that's become like my main thing, you, you were sitting on the panel on real time with Bill Maher when Sam Harris who was on with Ben Affleck, I'm assuming most of you guys are probably familiar with what happened, but basically that was so much fun. I mean you saw to me what became a seminal moment and a split in the, in the liberals between the progressives and what I consider the true liberals, which is where I fall, but basically, but basically a Sam Harris said a few things about the difference between Islam.

Speaker 2:          51:12          Harris was making a, an intellectual argument based in research based deal poles. He was quoting tools and things like that. So that, that's. So that's the jump off point. Um, ben was making, um, a, a progressive argument, uh, that again, going back to the point I was making before about people and how those pupils and all those numbers actually translated into people. So when you start talking about people, then you're talking about attitudes and perceptions and all of that. And it was a very interesting dynamic. I thought.

Speaker 1:          51:54          So for the people that didn't see it, basically Sam quoted a couple poles and then immediately been athletic. He screamed, that's gross, that's racist, that's racist. And then that changes the dynamic the next day. Every media outlet in the question was, you know, Ben Affleck Calls Bill Maher and Sam Harris Racist. Suddenly the onus was on them to prove that they weren't racist. So for you, I assume when someone throws around, you know, racist, you're a bigot, I assume you don't take those things lightly. What was it like to be sitting there in the midst of that? Especially because. Because you weren't even. You guys weren't even supposed to be involved in the conversation, right?

Speaker 2:          52:26          That was, that was, that was the bill and Sam moment. Yeah. And I saw Ben Lean in and I went, all hell, here we go. And then he started and I've learned over these years that when two liberals are going at it, there's no need for the conservative to opine or contribute in any way. And just like, Yo, you guys work that out, let me know. But what is your takeaway from my takeaway from it was, I understand what I, when I did speak, what I was trying when I try to get on the table was you're both right and you're both reflecting exactly what's going on in the broader population that we, we see these, these numbers that reflect some, some events or what's going on. Um, we look at extreme actions by an extreme group of and we pejoratively projected over everybody in that particular class of people.

Speaker 2:          53:31          So you had this dynamic even though you asked that Sam wasn't really doing the right, right, that the know and Sam was not doing that and that sandwiches, you know, just looking at these are the numbers, this is what this is reflecting, this is what people are saying, these are, this is what the poll says. Um, but this is again, a speaks to the dynamic of our politics. Have we immediately go to the personal. It became, it became intensely personal. When you label the charge and you throw out the charge, you're racist, or you even infer that, that that's an intensely personal moment. I'm in that conversation in which, when it comes my way, all bets are off because it's, you're asking me now, this is one on one a look. I've been called an uncle Tom. I've had oreo cookies thrown at me. I've, I've gone through this.

Speaker 2:          54:19          I know what this, this ugliness in politics is about, and even more broadly, um, and so I thought Sam did, did very well, uh, to hold a, to hold it and keep it from moving into the intensely personal. But Ben was intensely personal and that's because he cared passionately. And I think it's speaks to you can have that passion, but you need to know where the limits are. You need to know where the limits are in the conversation and you need to know how to conduct that passion in a way that your point is, it's not lost because it is still an I thought he made a valid point. And we're so because we don't want to project this pejorative view about a race of people, about a class of people, about any individual, uh, in a way. And you certainly don't want to use the test sticks.

Speaker 2:          55:11          And numbers to do that, I take great exception to the fact that whenever anyone starts talking about poverty, why do you immediately jumped to black? Why is the image that pops in your head when someone mentions poverty in this country is the image of a black person when there's. When you, when you talk about crime in this country, the criminal element, you know, crime is, why do you jump to my community? Yeah. We saw recently a, even on the welfare question, um, some members of Congress get into trouble because they were inferring that the folk, you know, you know, we're gonna solve welfare by, you know, working in the black. Do you know the majority of people in welfare in this country are white? Have you been to Appalachia? Seriously, because that, those people are hurting

Speaker 3:          55:59          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          56:00          They don't live in an urban inner city.

Speaker 2:          56:04          Why? Why? Why is their pain and their suffering and their poverty less important for focus and emphasis, particularly when they're part of the majority. So that's sort of the danger. That's the danger. That's the danger when you start pejorative sizing and start speaking about a group of people in a in which you clearly don't know what you're talking about because you're not reflecting what's really going on. I live in one of the wealthiest black county, the wealthiest black county in the country, period. So when you start talking about poverty, that's a whole different conversation when you come to where I live. So you can't paint that. You can't use that brush the same way you use it when you're talking about the folks somewhere. So that's the problem people get into when they start doing, doing that, that sort of, you know, stereotype conversation about white folks, black folks, poor folks, rich folks.

Speaker 2:          57:00          All right, well they, they gave me the rafting here. So last thing I'm putting you on the spot. Why don't you jump back into politics because I've sat here with you and exactly the reverse of what I saw with Scott Walker. Really, I mean, I know you believe in what you're saying. I may not agree with you on everything, but you get the system and I'll get back in. I, you know, I, I like where I am right now because I get to get up every day and have a nice cup of coffee and asked myself who should I piss off today and I don't have to have a meeting after I knew that.

Speaker 2:          57:36          So I, you know, I kinda liked the space. I love the national dialogue. I want to be a part of the national dialogue as you are a. and I think that that's, that's a good space right now is as long as I'm able to do it, I appreciate MSNBC, forgiving this conservative voice and opportunity to kind of come out and say, you know, with my buddy Chris Matthews. Okay, Chris, hold on just a second. Can I, can I talk now? Can I get it? So, but I'm speeding as much as it appears when he's yelling that I love hardball. It's a great show. It's a great political discussion and that is a very smart guy and is very smart, intelligent conversation and we need a lot more of that in our politics. Well, I hope you guys appreciate what I think is.

Speaker 4:          58:16          Thank you.
