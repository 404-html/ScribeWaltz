Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm not sure if you heard about this, but the 2016 election was completely been at as trump and hillary were actually the only part of it, as there were other characters from Bernie and Jeb to Marco and Ted. The election also caused the implosion of the mainstream media and set us on a path that has hashtag Maga racing towards hashtag resistance with the rest of us caught right in the middle, Ohio governor John Casick was one of the more moderate voices in a campaign season that we're short on moderation. As a fiscally conservative, socially liberal Republican. I see casick as someone who has some of the right ideas, but who's timing just wasn't right for the madness of 2016 cases. Team reached out to us a couple days ago and we have him in studio today, totally unscripted and unedited with no advanced knowledge of the topics or questions. I think this is exactly the way we need to be hearing from our politicians and I hope that this interview helps dls in on these conversations in the near future.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Joining me today is the author of the new book, two pads, America divided or united, a former Republican presidential candidate, and the current governor of the great state of Ohio, Governor John Casick. Welcome to the Rubin report. Gets a really good television voice. How is that? Well, we were just sitting here. You were kind of normal and they were like, dude, you know, it was like Ted Baxter. Very good. Ah, Ted Baxter. I like the reference that did not go over me. Well, you know, I liked. Of course everybody else watching, they don't know who he is, but that's okay. They could google it. Some of my millennial people won't get it, but they should google who ted Baxter is, that would, that would be good for them. So, uh, first one I wanted to start with you. I'm incredibly excited you're here. And it's interesting because your people reached out to us about four days ago.

Speaker 2:          01:45          They said the governor would like to come in and then we quickly set this up. Nobody said, oh, we have to talk about this or we can't talk about this. You sat down here about two minutes ago and you said whatever you want to do is fine, and I feel like that is partly what's lost in politics right now, that we're going to just do this. It's not just lost in politics. I see it lost in a lot of things. You know, I met with this big car company and like they had these guys come in to see me and it was like they were totally scripted and uh, you know, so I think, you know, life is having fun. Life is, you know, being able to be real. And the reason why we wanted to do this is I actually kind of saw part of one of your shows and this media is a really amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:32          A lot of people don't get it and I'm starting to get it and I have some people around me who say this is really a way to keep your voice out there. You know, that's what I want to be able to have a constructive positive voice to help our country. And this is another avenue that I'm glad no one else has found it yet. In my profession, so we can be a first mover, which I, I really, I really like and I liked the fact that we can actually have a conversation longer than just a couple soundbites. Do you ever worry that because we've lost the ability to do this, that the soundbite world is what's causing so many of the problems? Well, that was what happened in the campaign. It was all, you know, we didn't do it but these other campaigns and I had advice from some people who had run before, make sure you get your little thing out there so you can blow up the television morning news and you know, and it's like tricks, you know, that's not a good thing.

Speaker 2:          03:32          And I look, people I saw, I saw a thing on a sign yesterday had said, email me, please, we have to talk. Yeah, I think the. Look I, I didn't have a smartphone for a long time. I have, I've had an ipad and I got to the very beginning, but I didn't have a smartphone and people would laugh at me, but I didn't need this stuff during the day, you know, I didn't need to have basketball scores or look at the weather 25 times or some kind of headline in the news, uh, or my emails because I have people that can tell me if there's a crisis. They tell me, I go, okay, well let's see what it is. Um, but I got my smartphone and now the best thing about it is that I can text, but I find that I text, you know, what it does is it creates a laziness, right?

Speaker 2:          04:21          You don't have to go through a conversation now, don't you think? Look, you have a, you have a show here where people talk. What do you think about it? Don't you think this is a problem? I mean, I think that resetting our ability to talk and actually think and sit across from somebody and make some eye contact and really try to understand what they think. I think that is almost the most important thing that we'd given up and these last couple of years, it was the tradeoff between all these devices and the immediate, uh, response. So what do we do about this? I mean, I, I honestly think that you come in here right now and your people being brave enough to say, yeah, it's not like I have people, you know, these are people that work around, kind of support me and help me.

Speaker 2:          05:04          They're friends and, but this whole, you know, sort of funny. We were, you go on these shows on regular television which I think are really important and you get, you know, 2 million people to see you. But if you were like hanging out with Logan, Paul got 16 million subscribers. It's like, and you know, the funny thing about it is that people can't see it really now, but that's not really true because I think probably you're in demand now and you can go out and make talks and people show up to see you. Um, but it's kind of an invisible world to those who were kind of hooked on television, right? You under stand. What I mean by that? I do. So how do we, how do we bridge that? I don't know, but I gave you, you know, what's I think it's called what's news? It was really fantastic and there were a couple of million views and, and I liked it.

Speaker 2:          05:54          Um, you just have to keep doing it. It's part of why I wanted to be here. I mean, look, I pull up here, you got a studio in your garage. Um, it's, it's cool. It's neat and you don't, you don't have to go very far. My Commute's about 10 minutes, but the hard thing is got to be getting compelling. Guess that's got to be a hard thing to do. How do you go about doing that? Well, unfortunately a lot of people are coming to this medium now and a lot of the guests that you asked me right before we started all these books here, I mean most of the, I think virtually every single one except the Carl Sagan book. Are there any of them that are interesting, boring, and I don't know. There's some great books there by, by many of my guests from Steven pinker and Sam Harris and Scott Adams, and plenty of ice.

Speaker 2:          06:37          You have one here on John Adams, so that's good. We did a president's week a couple weeks ago. John Adams. So you're getting, you're getting good. People of color were getting, was it, you know what, a lot of times when I am with press, I'm actually curious about them and they don't like it when I'm asking them stuff. Okay. It must've, it must've been hard in the beginning, right? It's hard to build anything. I mean, you know, that. But I. One of the things that I consistently tell my audience is it's cool that a lot of the beliefs that I have, I, you know, I fall a little more within classical liberalism and libertarianism, a lot of the beliefs about doing things for yourself and I've built this business with the same ideas that I try to talk about here. Uh, some of which I think we're going to get to. And it's kind of a beautiful thing if I keep.

Speaker 2:          07:19          Not, not if you keep going. All right. Let me ask you a couple of questions as long as you're here. So I thought just first I thought we them just a little bit about growing up. What kind of family you grew up in. I feel like people never do that in politics anymore. We go to immediately mocks me because I say my father was a mailman and so the people write that in there, like cynical and all that. But I grew up in a towel and it was over. I mean, I don't think I ever met a Republican. Not In my town. My uncle Harry was a republican. They say we didn't listen much to him. He's a great guy, but you know, it was blue collar and you know, was sort of the, some of these people you would define is Kinda the trump people you know, who felt they had been left behind.

Speaker 2:          08:00          So, you know, as a result of that, I guess that's why I'm a populist, but a positive populace, not a negative populist positive that we can do what we can together we can, we can rise. And, um, that's a great place to come from because you really have a sense, you have a sense of people, you know, and it's not just the upper crust, uh, we respected the upper crust. I can remember saying to my father one time, Daddy, what about the rich? He said, well, we don't hate the rich. We want to be the rich, you know. And so it was great God fearing conservative Democrat, good values. Faith was a, was a part of my early childhood, which I normally drifted away from when I went to college, you know, so like Augustine, he says, you know, I need to, I know I need to be committed to God, but just not right now.

Speaker 2:          08:51          I have a couple of parties to go to. So, you know, we all drifted away and I've not drifted. I've come roaring back into that. But common sense, right? A freewheeling, sometimes it puts people off a little bit the way I am because I'm pretty direct. And, but the other thing is I was telling somebody the other day that, you know, I don't want people to be confused about my positions on anything. And so if somebody says, well, I think it's blue, and I might say, well no, I think it's red. And they, most people would expect me to say, okay, well I'll consider that. And I'm like, no, no, I just don't think that. And I think to some degree people don't get it. So it takes a little bit of time for people to come to understand me. Yeah. All right, well that's what we're going to do here for now.

Speaker 2:          09:39          So you mentioned a couple of interesting things there. So you didn't grow up in a Republican family and you just used the phrase conservative Democrat. So one of the things I talk a lot about here is that it seems to me before we get into your party that the conservative Democrat or the blue dog, democrat or sort of the moderate Democrat, a lot of them were buddies of mine in Congress, great friends. Do they really exist anymore? I think this is, I think this young man in Pennsylvania is blue dog Democrat from what I can see now. He got elected at 33, I think I was 30. So he's kind of an old timer. Yeah. But no, I think that um, I think in both parties it's really hard if you're a republican, you got a fear of the right and if you're a Democrat you fear the left and it just pulls everybody apart.

Speaker 2:          10:22          You know that though. But, but you've managed to kind of work through something that's sort of centrist, right? Somehow. Well, I don't know what that means. You know, one guy once told me, the only thing that goes down the middle of a road are yellow lines and dead skunks. Okay. And, um, I'm not a, but I'm a common sense person. Well, I guess I look, I look at an issue and say, okay, what do we do about it? And we look at a problem. How do we fix the problem? But I'm not really going to have an ideological. I'm forced. It's kept pulling me back. But the same time being a conservative, I want to see what the solutions are without having to bring bureaucracy or government in. And I'll tell you why that is. It's because government inherently a is so subject to political considerations that people have a hard time make calling a spade a spade.

Speaker 2:          11:18          It's like, no, no, I got all these pressures and I don't like that. And so when you go to government you can get trapped, but you get trapped with big business to big business. You know, you try to like, I need this prescription, you know, and somebody out here is telling me, oh no, no, it costs too much, you know, big things like that all have always bothered me, you know, big institutions, whether it's government. Uh, uh, I grew up, my dad was in a union, I always like unions, but you know, the problem with the unions is when the union boss not representing the worker, and I'm so big, institutions don't throw me, where am I? Kind of unpredictable because you kind of labeled yourself a little bit ago. You said, well I'm this and that. If you asked me what I am, I'll say I'm a conservative, but then you will say, well, but why do you think this or that?

Speaker 2:          12:03          And uh, because I don't think we need to be stuck right there. Being stuck in life is really depressing. All right, so tell me about what does being a conservative basically mean to you then if they. Again, government is government as a last resort, not as a first resort, but, but I also don't think it's like no government, you know, how do you decide where that you use your judgment and you list, you have good people around and you think about things and we're trying to price something right now in our state. Somebody wants access to stuff in our state. Okay. It would, it's a good thing. It's a good thing what they want, but I don't know what the price of the value of it is. Okay. So I can't just look at what governments have done to determine the value because I don't have.

Speaker 2:          12:53          No, I don't have a whole lot of. I don't invest a lot in that. Uh, I want to go out and talk to a variety of people in business to say, what do you think this is worth? Okay. And um, so how do I do that? People that come in and they talk and they argue for certain things, but at the end I have to decide. So I just use good judgment as I can. Do you have a certain leeway when it comes to sort of thinking for yourself as a governor that may be the senators and the congressmen can't have because they have to all, not that you don't have to come together and work with people. You have to have to do it from, with people outside of their state with massively competing interests and things like that. I was offering budgets against Republican presidents.

Speaker 2:          13:38          I mean, just do your job. I mean, why would you want to be. Why would you want to have a television show where you don't make it real? Why would I want to be in politics no matter where I am and not make it real? I mean, what would I be there for? It's really stupid, right? I mean, there's a lot of people there I don't want to be, I don't want to be casting aspersions or judging them only for me. Why would you do that? I mean, so we had a decision on Medicaid expansion, right? In Ohio, you know that, you know, that Medicaid expansion, of course, right? So I just really. Jan Brewer and Arizona did it, which really was kind of shocking to me, but I was really the first big state, big Republican governor who expand it. Was it hard? Was a piece of cake.

Speaker 2:          14:27          If I'm going to get money that's not going to put me in a straight jacket from the federal government. If I can use that money to heal, to help heal or help help to help the mentally ill so they're not sleeping under a bridge or living in a jail. Or if I can help people who have drug addiction to get treatment and get off of it, if I can have a lower uninsurance rate, why wouldn't I do that? And because people are going to yell at me and fight with, so what? Who Cares? I mean I care. I don't want them to not, I don't want them to be anxious. In fact, in my state of the state address I was, I made a talk that really had almost nothing to do with policy. It'll had all to do with basically philosophy and the meaning of life.

Speaker 2:          15:11          They say it was the only state of the state speech delivered by a governor in the history of the world where the name Cammo was discussed. But I, I, um, and I didn't mention that because I don't want to jab anybody in the eye, but the decision to do that, to help people, it's just, it's such an easy decision. Do you find you have a little bit of extra freedom right now because you can't run for reelection and Ohio now there's a lot of talk at 2020, which I want to end the interview. Oh look, I mean, I'm probably so, but I've always been very independent. You know, I was a military reformer. I was offering my own budgets against President Bush. I took on corporate welfare reform, couldn't find a Democrat with a search light. And the Republicans ran the other way. Um, no, I, I've always pretty well felt that, you know, you gotta do what you have to do and uh, and my more free now and maybe a little bit but, but I, I, nothing would change.

Speaker 2:          16:14          I mean, I don't know, what is it I would reverse, I wouldn't say, well, we're not going to do this medicaid thing now if it got us into point where we were fiscally at risk, I would have to stop it. I've told everybody that, but no, I don't really think so. But I am having probably more fun now. You know, having a lot of fun. I mean I can tell that I've been having fun. You know, I ran for reelection and I, and I never even used the word Obama running for reelection. Never talked about it. I just talked about our record and it was fun and it was positive. Look, here's the thing, and we all need to know this. We all need to be healers in one way or another. We need to heal our family and our friends and strangers. I'm not that great a guy.

Speaker 2:          17:00          Okay. But I know that that makes sense and I know that it's right. So it's just a cool thing to think about and that's why politics is so boring to me because it's all these, all these calculations and all this crap. Why don't we just do a job? Let's think about how to pull to pull the country together. Let's make sure that we can help people to be lifted. Let's not tear somebody down. Elizabeth Warren wants to tear down all these rich people. I don't know why, or Bernie or whatever. I used to work with Bernie. It's, you don't need to tear people down. We need to just build people up and, and put them together. Yeah. Did you ever get into any of those philosophical discussions with Bernie? Because the class war thing I see, I see as extremely dangerous. No, I don't have a conversation with Bernie had been burning and I, we're in a house together.

Speaker 2:          17:45          He was, you know, really kind of in another orbit. We all thought he was. And yet, you know, the country's kind of moved towards him. And I think a lot of young people are, you know, the one thing that is concerning to me and I have great faith in the millennials and the gen x, but I'm not sure they understand the consequences of losing a representative democracy. There seems to be with some of them, some appeal towards an authoritarian figure. Have you. Am I right on that? I think you have to tell me I haven't studied it, but I've got that sense that's not good or that you know, maybe socialism will work. Look and free enterprise system. Michael Novak, the great philosopher, theologian said that a free market system that is not underlaid with a set of values is bankrupt. So you have to have values.

Speaker 2:          18:38          You can't just be in it to make money. There has to be something else there. Where do you think those values come from? Oh, I think they. I think that they. The easy thing to say politically easy thing to say as they come from mom and dad and I say to people, well, where do you think mom and dad got it from? Well, they got it from their parents. Where do I think these virtues come from? Look, if you're a humanist, I respect you. Okay? Uh, you wake up every day trying to figure out how to make the world a little better place. I like that. Okay. But for me, the winds of change, the fads can knock me off my path. So, uh, I need something deeper than that. So I look to theologians and I believe that we are, we are a unique form of life, greater than all other life on the earth, and I think that life has given to us by our creator.

Speaker 2:          19:34          And I think our creator has a character that we can learn about and that's not only held by a Christian but also a Jew and also a Muslim. We have the same kind of view of creation and our purpose and within those values are things like mercy and justice and compassion and forgiveness. And, you know, um, I don't know if you played golf that we see we have to have mulligans in life because we know and I, and the danger of talking about these things is that people want to say, oh, well, you don't have great values. I caught you. Yeah, of course. I'm just a slob on a bus trying to make it through life, you know, but I kind of know what I need to do. So I think that these values, they flow from, from our creator. And I think too much in religion today, which has turned off a lot of young people.

Speaker 2:          20:27          Uh, I'm actually mentoring a young man in faith, but it's not about all this judgment we hear. It's about hope. It's about human connectedness. And that's appealing to people. And it's what I think is true about faith and virtue. It's not confining, it's enlarging, it doesn't make you smaller. It makes you bigger. And today in religion we see a lot of forces that are counter to that. And I don't like it. Yeah. Well, it's interesting to me because my, my audience knows that Thomas Jefferson, who was my favorite, favorite founder and I go to the Jefferson memorial often in dc and I try to read those big plaques and to me they're as relevant now as they were, you know, 200 some odd years ago where he talked to, you know, they talk about a creator at the same time they're talking about why church and state have to be separate.

Speaker 2:          21:17          And I think that's really to the heart of what you're saying. Well, I think first of all, um, we don't want the government being involved in religion. Uh, we don't want that. We want though in a free society. Look, freedom means we have to learn to self govern and if every time we turn around, this is a big thing about facebook now they didn't self-govern right? I mean we can pass all these rules, but you know, guys like you and me were met, were born to figure out how to get around the rules. Okay? Right. I want to be free. That's why we're both here, but what I'm saying is that you can't, if you're going to have freedom, people have to have self restraint and the less self restraint we have, the more the government tries to impose things and the more they impose things, the less freedom we have.

Speaker 2:          22:06          So I don't want it. I believe that, that, that our, our faith system, and again, if you're a humanist, that's cool with me, that's fine with me because you're trying to do good every day. I just, it can't work for me because I get to knocked off kilter by the culture today and the winds of change. But with that system, it, it, it reinforces the sense of freedom. So it's interesting. You've referenced culture a couple times and one of the things that seem pretty obvious from an outside perspective of the 2016 election was that trump captured the culture, good or bad. He captured that. He captured the Internet culture. The reason that you're on. And I was like 80,000 votes, so we have to keep it in perspective and trump is, but he, he's a negative populist. I'm a positive populist. The people that I grew up with, when they're out at work or whatever, my message is, this is terrible, but let's go fix it.

Speaker 2:          23:05          I think the negative populous messages while you're out of work, because that guy over there took it away from you. He took your stuff away and that creates a bitterness and an anger and there's also a sense that that can translate into victim hood. I'm a victim. You ever like to be a victim? My, I do not want to be a big no, but it's easy to be a victim. Don't you think? It's very easy. It's particularly if you have other people around that want to be a victim. Now I'm not going to condemn them, but it's easy to fall into that. If somebody tells you you don't have something because somebody else took it. So what we need to do is, if you were to go to say Youngstown, Ohio, they talk about that a lot in the national news. And I was a steel worker.

Speaker 2:          23:50          I worked in a coal mine in West Virginia or whatever we have in Ohio working with, um, with one of the tech companies. We have a list of all the job openings. Okay? Now, if you're a victim and I come to you and I say you are a coal miner or your steel worker and this would be hard for me to listen. I can show you this Internet stuff, right? And I can get you one of these jobs. You don't have to become an expert, but I can show you stuff. If I'm a victim, I may not want to do it, but if I, if I give that person a message, hey, look at these jobs. It pays good money. Your family will be healthier, help will be healthier, your children will be healthier, you will have more self respect, but you know, it's tough where you are. I under that. That is the better message than, well, you're just a victim and we're going to go and punish people. Right? That's done. It doesn't work for the good for the mental health of our society.

Speaker 1:          24:46          Yeah. So I mean that's a great phrase right there because we seem to be in a mental health. Came up with that. That's pretty good. Did you write that down? We can go back and hey, roll the tape back there. They used to do that on television. Roll it today. Could say we're long past their tape. There's no tape anymore. It's all digital. So, but negative populate the electrons back and. No, no. So negative populism. Do you see that train coming? Because it seems to me that trump grabbed it.

Speaker 2:          25:18          Istation. He's not. He didn't create this people for a long time. I felt that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. People in my party have ignored that. Uh, maybe to some degree early on I did too. I thought, well, what's that all about? But it's true that you see these chasms and those are dangerous because you know, we need to believe that all this wealth and everything changes. They say that the ocean always kind of flips upside down. And that's what we need to see in our country that, you know, people in the bottom can get to the top and we look and Bayzos guy selling books out of his garage. Look at you. It's just a matter of time til you're a billionaire, you know, you, you know,

Speaker 1:          25:59          operating out of this girl. He's delivering me a lot of stuff everyday.

Speaker 2:          26:05          But you see what I'm saying? I mean, it is possible to rise in a free society with a free enterprise. And um,

Speaker 1:          26:13          do you think we stopped selling that correctly? Because as you don't think we talk about it. Yeah. That young people now they starting to think that socialism is

Speaker 2:          26:20          cool. Yeah, I don't, I don't get that. I mean, well, because it sounds good, you know, like let's share. I tell you a really interesting story. My chief of staff, there's that, you know, that show that you get on your phone at 9:00 eastern. It's like they ask questions and you answer the, my kids have done it for awhile. They don't do it anymore. I don't know what, what the show was called. Um, well anyway, she and her kids, daughters, they listened to this every, every night at 9:00 and they work together and so she said one day to her kids, why don't I, I'll be on one phone and you got, you'll be on your phone and, and, and joy, you'll be on your phone and let's have a competition. They looked at her like she was crazy. They're like, why would we do that?

Speaker 2:          27:03          You know, so, you know, when I, I guess what I'm saying about that is the idea of community and together is good, but we don't want that to erode the basic sense that competition is good as long as it's played fairly and everybody has a chance to compete. So really what you're talking about, you're sort of talking about individualism and how we can create groups around that as opposed to collectivism, right? Yeah. What really the thrust of that, write that down. That's a good one individually rather than collectivism. But if you're a young person, you go, I don't know what's wrong with that and, but look there my hope, because they would rather take a job that pays less if the job has meaning, look at what they're doing in Parkland, look at what these young people are doing across this country and using social media to, to have a voice.

Speaker 2:          27:52          I mean it's, it's really awesome. I mean it's, it gets me really pumped up because the. I think we need a new era of activism and citizenship and by the way, we're, we fixate all the time on the leader. Okay. Did you see that movie on Churchill? Darkest Hour? I didn't see it yet. I just saw the common law. A lot of him in the crowd. You and Gary Oldman. I know. I got to get out there. It's on demand now. I'll do it tonight. I'm giving you my word. Oh my word. Yeah. Anyway, here's the thing. Watching it tonight in that movie, and this is made up stuff. He gets on, he gets, goes down and gets on the subway and he's talking to people and they're like, you. We're not given in, and they, they, they embolden him, set the fire in him. I'm not telling you that, uh, that he wasn't a great leader because he clearly he was, but it was a bottom up and top down.

Speaker 2:          28:56          I mean, when we think about the civil rights movement, I mean, they didn't. The great leaders, Martin Luther King, David, good help politicians were afraid of him, including JFK. Um, they were all afraid of him. And what happened, it was, it was from the street up, a lot of social change, uh, the end of the Vietnam War. How much longer would the generals have said we were winning? And by the way, look at Afghanistan, they keep saying, oh, we're victories just around the corner. Terrible. Um, and so you have a situation here where you can't just expect change in the country because I have elected a good, I have a new good coach, so therefore I'm going to win a basketball game. It doesn't work that way. It works both ways. You a good leader, but a great group of people that drive that drive change. How dangerous then is that cult of personality that we've now made around the president, and I'm not just saying that trump here, I mean even with Obama and plenty of the other presidents that we think that somehow the executive branch is going to fail, this one person is going to fix it.

Speaker 2:          30:02          You know, there's a book that I don't know that I'm like, I don't know a lot of things here. I'm giving you might be over here. The book is not. Here is a book that says this. Um, and I have never talked about this before. Like on television. I was with a, a, a great preacher. A got 6,000 people. He's in the Silicon Valley. He's very grace oriented and hopeful and he's just, he's a phd in psychology. He's just got all this stuff, all this talent. And I was asking him, I said, I keep telling people it's bottom up, not top down. He said, well John, it's interesting because a man wrote a book and the book says that when pieces of our society start to erode, let's think about it. Facebook, Wells Fargo, a Equifax, you know the scandal around, um, around Volkswagen sports. You got guys that had brain injuries but the league is and helping them and they're living in a car.

Speaker 2:          31:04          Their families are destitute or Hollywood need to say anything. They're a, you look across the board and we're seeing an erosion of what we really want. Right? So there is a tendency, this man maintains that. I'm fascinated to read this book, that we now start looking to politics to solve these problems. In other words, we look at politicians or government to use in a sense, coercion, to restore things to the right balance and it just doesn't work that way. Really in practicality. Now I'm the governor of the state. Seventh largest state. I have a, it's a very powerful executive position, but I can't just give edicts from up here and expect it to work. The people have to be engaged and ascent and do things. They have to self govern, they have to lift. And so this is a very, very. I think this is like the next thing to think about.

Speaker 2:          32:04          To me it's the next wave. You know what, I love what I think it has been fun because of my friends and because of the my mind in a way it works. I'm kind of always looking for the next thing and I can kind of sense the next thing, you know, and I believe this is something that really needs to be talked about. I mean, it's a virtue. It's religion, it's doing well by doing good. It's driving ourselves from the bottom up. It's not trying to vest all this power in a handful of people in the government because I think it's futile. Yeah. I hate to tell you this, but in a weird way, you don't sound like a politician, but I think you can take that as a column. No, I'm, I'm, I'm, look, I'm, I'm a public official. I'm a CEO of a state.

Speaker 2:          32:49          I'm sick of politics. Drives me crazy because I see that in the middle of trying to do things. Um, we're all week, we're all everybody's week and we're all susceptible to certain pressures, you know, and, and I'm like, we need to run through that door. And they're like, oh no, no, no, no, no who slowdown here, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And it's, it's, here's the problem with politics, you know, you could sit next to somebody your entire lifetime in an office job and never really know what they think. But in politics people get called out. It's really interesting if they get called out and it's in some ways it's not fair because it's almost like an x ray like you know, you and I could know each other, we could hang out, we could watch basketball games and never ever get into my finding out how you make decisions in a really tough situation.

Speaker 2:          33:44          But with politics you're going to have to vote and if you vote wrong, you're afraid you're going to lose. I mean, it really, it really is, is an amazing process and it's frustrating. My, my friend and former guests a couple times, Eric Weinstein, who's a world renowned mathematician and also and thinker and authors that he talks about how one of the things we've lost now is communal sensemaking. That because everything has become so politicized, sports are politicized now. Hollywood, as you just mentioned that all of these things have become so political, but what does that mean? I don't know that term. What does that term? So for example, like, you know, everything that happened with the kneeling about the national anthem that we start that if you turn on sports center, you're watching politics. If you turn on the news and they're talking about Hollywood, it's about sex scan, but politics or is that a discussion of virtue or values?

Speaker 2:          34:35          Is it politics, you know? Well, I guess at some level it's both, right on the underlying piece of. It's a debate about behavior. It's behavior. It's not really politics. No, I understand what that person would be saying. I'm not sure that's the right characterization. So yeah, you're right on espn, you know, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of angst over there now because of different positions. Uh, but really kinda debating how we're supposed to behave, don't you think? Yeah. Well that's what we're doing now. What was so amazing about the kneeling it was brought about by the guy that played for the 40 niners. People didn't know this. I was told this, you know, he's a devout Christian. Yeah, Colin Kaepernick. When, when people hear that, they're like, Whoa, you know, isn't it interesting that when we dig into somebody who we feel one way or another about, it's amazing sometimes how we find out things that change our fundamental attitude towards them.

Speaker 2:          35:33          Did you find that that whole situation actually was what was right about America in a bizarre way? I found that everybody was screaming about, here's what I. here's what nobody was staying in jail and everywhere. All. But here's what I think where it got lost. I don't feel that the players themselves were able to articulate to Americans exactly why they were doing that and exactly what they wanted, I think was kind of lost in the motion as opposed to what is real? What's behind this? You know, what is really behind this, you know, I'm a black man and I've worn my kid that be careful about when you're out there late at night and what you might find. Um, I think if people heard that and they understood that, they would say, oh, so that was the one way you had to say something because it's so divided the country.

Speaker 2:          36:24          Um, now, uh, you know, and people had different views. But you know, what I found, Dave, what I have found in my life is if you pull people together like we have on police and community, tough issue. I just had two police officers killed, murdered in my little hometown in Ohio. You heard about it happened a couple of weeks ago. Community needs to understand that mom and dad need to go home at night. You know, they, they're at risk. They, you go to a domestic disturbance and you have to go in a door. You are putting your life on the line. Community needs to understand it, but police need to understand that if you are, that they need understand that community. If you're not treating people right in the community, you're going to have a problem. Sit them down the bet, peel to the better angels.

Speaker 2:          37:13          And in many cases you can come up with resolutions, but you have to get the right people in a room and you have to appeal to the better angels of them. Yeah, I suspect you don't think trump is appealing to better angels. That seems to be pretty. No, I mean, I think that, you know, look, my job on this is to my job. I have a position, a platform, I can say things. I'm not here to be, you know, knee jerk against trump. If he does a good thing, he shouldn't be praised. And if he does something that's dividing us, then I can't support it to the point where I didn't even go to the convention in my state or ever endorsed him. I wasn't like weaseling around. I would say that's the wrong word. I wasn't maneuvering around to say, okay, one day I liked him and the next day I did.

Speaker 2:          37:56          And I just was, was consistent. Look, I took a lot of heat for it. The amount of pressure that you must have gotten from the party and from pressure. What is pressure pressure? Whether they say pressures, uh, a guy that loses his job, he's got a couple kids to feed. That's pressure pressure in politics. What are they going to do to me? You know, what they're going to criticize me, make you know what we talked. I mean, briefly just now about the anthem part. What, what are you making the state of race in America? If you listen to a lot of people right now, it seems like we're at the worst racial state that we've been. No, I think we've made a lot of progress. I do. I think though that what we're seeing now is it's back to this. I don't want somebody getting something that I don't get and somebody else took what I have and why doesn't anybody care about me?

Speaker 2:          38:39          And I think that caring about me is real. Dave, I do. Um, let's say that you, that you have a kid and you need and you need a pill to deal with that kid's problem, but it's expensive and you can't get it. Does anybody stand up for you? You know, if this is where people feel like, and this is where community matters, you know, they, if, if I'm, if, if I'm being harassed at work, how about that story in a New York Times where these waitresses were being told, let me grope you and I'll give you a $20 tip. I mean, who in that restaurant saw that and said, I'm going to take you outside, right? To the guy that was the perpetrator. People tend to feel, I think too much of the time that we're in this alone that doesn't that kind of get back to the overstate this, but back to the texting and the no communication.

Speaker 2:          39:36          We got to care about our neighbor. The way our neighbor cares about us. We're. I learned that from my mother. You know, tell you interesting story. My mother and I, we would hang out at the school all the time and there's, the kids came up and gave his pony rides and my mother wanted to checkout what does this whole thing going on up there? So she comes up and I don't have. It's probably a dime to do a pony ride. And and my mother was there and she gave the guy that had the pony a lot more money than the cost of the pony ride. And we were walking home and I said, mom, you gave that guy a lot of money. She said, Johnny, did you see? As I was out of place, we got to help people like that. Like I used to see my father given a couple extra bucks to the guy that picked up the trash because he didn't make much money.

Speaker 2:          40:24          I'm like, thanks mom and dad, because that's something you carry. All right. So this is interesting because I feel like I'm talking to half philosopher, half governor here. So let's go. Let's finish with solutions. I like that. By the way, half philosopher, half politician, governor, you said, oh governor, that we go. That was fun. But that on your business. There you go. You don't have to credit me. So I want to talk some solutions because so many things seem wrong in 2016 that I think that's what led us here. So we can talk about some of the specific things. So like watching the debates that you were part of, they're the dumbest way to pick a president. Okay. You can't get from A. Well you can't pick the way to do it is now. Look, it's all about ratings. Okay. So nobody wants to change the format, but the way it ought to be is what we're doing.

Speaker 2:          41:11          Let people, let somebody interview somebody, find out who they are and then we can judge instead of like, who's got the cleverest line or who, you know, it's really stupid when you were up there and trump, you know, usually he was brow beating everybody and you could see sort of each debate would go by and he'd pick who he had to go for and, and you know, the media kind of fell along with that. That really wasn't for what you're doing here is the field narrowed. He just didn't show up anymore. He didn't debate anymore. I mean I wanted them to debate that he, towards the end when you, when you stayed to the other guy was down to fewer and fewer of us. Yeah. But I just think it's a bad way to pick a president now. We, I think this all started probably with Kennedy and Nixon and Nixon lost because he looked, he didn't have the right brow, he was sweating.

Speaker 2:          41:57          I mean, what a dumb way to pick, pick a leader. So, uh, I don't know if that'll change. I don't know because it makes too much money for the networks. So what are the things we can do to just change the electoral system enough? Like I'm not somebody that believes you have to go in and wreck everything, but it seems to me if we could just tweak something. Well, gerrymandering needs to be changed so that we're not. Gerrymandering is where you draw district to favor one party or the other and then all you have to do is listen to people and you're extreme and not have to listen to people who are, who are different than you, but you need to be heard. That's one thing. Don't have an answer for the finance, the spending. I don't know what to do about it, but I'm open to anything.

Speaker 2:          42:35          So those are a couple of things that really the issue though, I mean at the end of the day is it really, if we were just to go backwards with everything, I think gerrymandering is very, very serious problem and we are fixing it in Ohio and I'm proud of my legislature for doing it. That's a big part of it, but it isn't a big part of it. Also the kind of people we elect, you know, and do you carry virtue into these offices and be willing to take a risk. I've got a friend of mine now who's just got on the city council and he called me the other day. He said, I just seem to be making everybody mad because they all want to have this, this thing that they want to do and I just think it's dumb. And I said, yeah, just just, you know, pick your battles and be pleasant than before.

Speaker 2:          43:15          And you know, we shouldn't want to be in these jobs forever. It's natural. Nobody wants to go to work and lose their job. Okay. Nobody wants to do that, but you're not in these jobs for, you know, for a long time. I don't think you should be at the end of the day. Is that really what the government's role is? Just making sure we have jobs. I mean really, you know, making sure we're basically secure. I think it's the greatest moral purpose is, is to provide an environment for job creation because that's what creates human dignity, right? That's what strengthens communities and builds a strengthened families. Uh, you know, for the government of the United States to make sure that we have a, we are protected, that we can be free and yet safe. And then it's also course domestic tranquility. You know, that we're at peace where we are. So if you have high unemployment, it's terrible.

Speaker 2:          44:04          So I believe our greatest moral purpose as politician for me and my job is the fact that I need to have a job creating environment. So it's interesting as I'm listening to you, I can understand the reasons for not liking trump and the tweets and virtue and all of that. I can get that in terms of policy of the things that he's done. Well, let's talk about a couple of things. Let's talk about immigration. I mean the idea that we're going to ship these Daca kids out to me as well, but we're. I don't even know where the Democrats are. We keep talking about trump. I mean we're in the Democrats. Is Bart is Bernie and his left wing philosophy. Is that where, I don't know where the Democrats are, but this Daca thing should be solved. I mean these are, these are people, you know, 25, 26, 27 years old.

Speaker 2:          44:46          It came here when they were six or seven or eight. Now we're going to ship them out and there are a meaningful part of our culture. So. So what do you actually do then? What they oughta be grandfathered in. They ought to be said. You get to stay and then when it comes to immigration itself, we need to know who's coming and we need to be able to protect our borders, but I don't want to be shrinking legal, immigration. I think people create a great deal to our country, a trade, you know, it's a thorny issue, but 40 million Americans have trade related jobs and most of the businesses that are involved in exporting or small and medium size businesses and consumers benefit from open and free enough. It's not open and free find and have a process to restore equity but just don't go out to create a trade war. Um, you know, I mean those are things. What else you want to ask about? I mean those are two that jump out at me. There's lots of them.

Speaker 1:          45:36          Yeah. Well I'll throw a couple others that we actually did meet once before it was at, I believe it was the first or second Republican debate and I asked you a question and you know, with everyone's jamming the nice, strong enough where we're jamming their megaphones in my face. Trust me, I had to fight through plenty of people to get the question. But basically at my question to you, was that the social issues that gay marriage in particular, I, I could tell you, I think at the first debate you immediately said they asked you about it and you said that's not what I want to focus on. I think, yeah,

Speaker 2:          46:04          I remember exactly what I said, but it did get a uh, you know, look, I, I, it, it's not, I'm not, that's not where I want to live because that is a dividing. I mean, in terms of gay marriage, I'm fine with it. I mean, I think it was that time when I said I was going to a, a wedding of my, of my gate, you know, one of my gay friends who's terrific and I talked to them all that. I mean, I don't even think that way that's behind, that's beyond us.

Speaker 1:          46:27          So you'd love for the Republicans to get past the social stuff, right? I mean, I think in effect the party has even even the more conservative Christian side of the party is in talking about it. That, and I got on here Santorum or how could he really rally taller?

Speaker 2:          46:40          And it's, you know, things have changed and um, you know, I prefer the traditional marriage, but you know, I'm not like I don't worry what you're doing and they're not.

Speaker 1:          46:50          You mentioned to me it's your 21st anniversary with your wife today. Exactly. And I'm here and here you are with me. What does that say? I don't know what that says. Well, where are you on a medical marijuana or illegally?

Speaker 2:          47:05          I'm not for legalizing it because it gets. I, I told people when I was in college, of course I smoke dope. I mean we, we all did, we all did. But many of us did. Um, but here's the problem. You can't tell kids don't do drugs, but by the way, this drugs. Okay. So it's a problem. Medical Marijuana, we have it in our state and we have it in our state, but I don't think legalizing it is a good thing to do. Yeah. Is this one of those things where. So when I hear that to me, this is where my libertarian side kicking him and I would say, well you can put anything in your body that you want. And as long as you're doing it in the privacy of your own home and the rest of that's a bad argument. Makes a lot of sense to me.

Speaker 2:          47:43          But you think that if we just sort of unfurl this, that just say I got kids here. I mean we've got an opiate crisis. I mean, you know, I just was looking last night you got fentinol and these street drugs, whether it's coke or, or heroin and just dropping dead left and right. Um, this is not a time when I think we ought to be trying to say to kids, okay, what? Don't do any drugs, but you know, but this one's okay to do. That's kind of how I feel about it. And yet, you know, alcoholics, you know. No. And we look and we have a lot of people die from drunk driving and all that. But we'd been through that and I don't know where this is all going to ultimately end up. I'm just giving you my sense dealing with a real problem here.

Speaker 2:          48:23          I don't want to have to explain to young people the two that you can do this, but don't do that. It needs to be a simple message for me. Yeah. Okay. A couple more. And then the big question at the end. So, uh, I can answer the big question. Dan. I don't know what I'm going to do in 20, 20. I don't know what I'm going to do. I really don't know. I am. I want to be able to participate in a positive way in the public debate that's I want my voice to be out there and that's Kinda what I wanna do and I don't know where that's gonna take me. I'm not plotting and scheming, but I'm making a lot of effort to be able to have the resources to be able to stay. All options are really on the table, but I don't know what, what will be exercise because we don't know what the future's going to bring.

Speaker 2:          49:04          The big question is going to be whether you want it to play golf with me after this, but are you a good golfer? Not well, but I not. Well. Uh, okay. Well, all right, that was the answer to that question. A couple of things. So you're in California right now. I know you just met with Arnold Schwarzenegger and you guys are talking about how to reset Californian in politics. I'm here in California. It's an insanely high tax state. If I told you what my property taxes on this place, your head would explode. I should probably move to Ohio if you want to help her. All my property taxes are high enough. It makes my head explode. Driving in my state. Trust me in La. Yeah. Um, what, what do you think can be done to help a place like California? That's obviously so less traditional. It's happening though, is you're beginning to lose people.

Speaker 2:          49:46          Yeah. You know, whether it's to Washington state, no income tax or to Nevada, uh, or to Austin, Texas. I mean, it's, you don't want to see that happening. Um, you've got to make government more efficient. And you remember in the old days when you bought a kindle, you know, you had to pay money for it. Now they'll pay you to have a kid. No, I mean we need to use creative and 21st century technology and techniques to skinny that government down to get it to do what it's supposed to do and be efficient and effective. You just said you can't believe what it was like for me to get permission to build a studio in my garage. No, that's nuts. This is the 21st century. What are they worried about? Yeah, and so, you know, I think that, and I love California. I mean, are you kidding me?

Speaker 2:          50:30          I wanted to be out here. I wanted a campaign out here, but things move too fast. I mean, how could you not love this state, but you can also do enough things to begin to drive people in businesses out in that it's not good. All right, well since you answered the big one already, I'll, I'll just give you a, a wide one to bring us home with, which would be so many emails that I get tweets and messages that I get are all about people that are just afraid to look. Can I go back for one second? Because you were asking about these social issues. Okay, I read an article about Billy Graham who was, who spoke to 200 million people across the globe and he had fights with people inside of faith because he stayed away from the hot button social issues of the time. I think it is possible.

Speaker 2:          51:18          For example, I'm dealing with guns right now. Okay. And I have brought a group of people together to mediate that. I think you can deal with these social issues, uh, by being in a position of bringing people together at the end. You may have to walk away from the table, but I, I admire with Billy Graham said, there's so much negativity in the world today. Why don't I like Billy Graham did well, I don't, I just focus on the positive things, the uplifting things. Instead of dragging yourself down into these ditches where we just go into warfare with world war one, war for trench warfare, it's not going to help us in the long run. Those issues can be dealt with in a way and, and, and, and on the edges. But at the end, let's try to lift our culture. Casick 20 slash 20 politician. What was it?

Speaker 2:          52:08          Philosopher slash gov. I like that. I see it all coming together. All right, so the final one though is that I get all of these messages and tweets and emails from people that are afraid to get involved.
