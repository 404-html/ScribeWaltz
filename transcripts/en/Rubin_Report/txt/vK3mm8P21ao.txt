Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Allow me to tell you the classic children's tale of chicken, little otherwise known as henny penny as the tale goes. Little Henny was outside one day when an acorn fell from a tree and hit her on the head because of her naive, a Tay and simple mindedness. Henny foolishly began to believe that the sky itself was falling down around her. She spent the rest of the day trying to convince others like Goosey loosey and Turkey lurky that the sky was most certainly falling in. The world was surely coming to an end in most versions of the story. The trip does not end well for Henny and her hysterical friends after they meet the sly foxy. I don't want to give everything away though, so either read the story for yourself or check out the classic season six episode of the Golden Girls in which they reenact the tail.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       I mentioned Hani and Lucy and Turkey and foxy. Not just because they're great names to say, but because it seems that just about everyone is telling us the sky is falling these days between trump, Russia and North Korea. We've got about half the country that's in total freakout mode everyday. This freak out takes on a new urgency. One day the world is ending because America left the Paris climate accord and another day it's because of the net neutrality reversal and another day it's because trump holds his water glass with two hands. This endless hysteria is not only being amplified by the media, but it's actually being poked and prodded by them as well. Blue check, verify journalists on twitter who worked for news organizations which really are nothing more than partisan activist outlets want to keep you clicking on their articles and videos and they know that the best way to do that is to convince you that not only is the sky falling, but it's gonna land directly on your head.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       What F and just hear me out on this one. This outrage factory is completely wrong and the world isn't coming to an end just yet crazy. I know, but I think that it actually might be true. This doesn't mean that things are perfect, but they are pretty damn good. This is the position of my guest this week, Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker pinker argues, despite our world of perceived horror and chaos, people are living longer, happier, healthier, and freer lives right now, more than any other time in human history. This doesn't mean we don't have work to do, but if we don't stop and smell the roses, we might toss away all the goodness humans have created for the prospect of a utopia that will never appear. This is why I'm so proud of the work we've done here on the Rubin report. I truly believed that the conversations we're having are at least some part of the antidote to the craziness right now. If those of us who care about enlightenment principles like science reason and natural rights can make our voices louder than this cliff, we seem to be about to go off of, might just turn into a bridge to a better world. Henny penny story took a drastic turn when she met Foxy Lacasse who tricked her and her friends to go to his layer. Well, in real life, we've got a wolf blitzer in a situation room. If the sky is falling, maybe just changing the channel is all we have to do to survive the day.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       Joining me today is a johnstone family professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University as well as the New York Times bestselling author whose new book enlightenment now is for sale right now, Steven Pinker, welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you. I am. I am thrilled to have you here. I think I have emailed or called or contacted or pigeon messaged everyone related to you or do that knows you in any way to get you here and here I am and here you are. Worked. It goes to prove that a little positivity I think can make some things happen. So true. Yeah. Alright. A lot of want to talk to you about. I thought before we dive into the book and all the things that you teach and write about and all that. I just, I like hearing a little bit about people's history and where they come from and growing up and all that.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       You are Canadian and I've had a lot of Canadians on lately. I find there's something about Canadians in general that I like. What is it about Canadians that leads to a certain pleasant disposition? Well, it was so reasonable or so. Yeah. I liked her. Yeah. Sometimes people say the motto of candidates, Peace Order and good government. Uh, and uh, it's a country that is, that has been diverse for quite some time. A Quebec where I grew up has a English speaking community in a French speaking community. And uh, we've, we, we didn't begin with a revolution like the United States from negotiated our way to independence. Uh, we're part of the British empire and the British Commonwealth and kind of have that British reserve and a politeness. Yeah. So that we have, we have some things going for us. A couple of things going for it. Yeah. At least until at least the, all the Americans end up moving up there if things keep going this way.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       Although we might build a wall, you guys may end up building the wall. Exactly. Um, tell me a little bit about growing up, your family, what, what kind of family you grew up in. Um, I grew up in the English speaking a section of Montreal in Montreal. It was pretty segregated when I grew up. I grew up in a, um, the, uh, Jewish, uh, English speaking community, uh, which was known for producing among others, Leonard Cohen, who was a contemporary of my mother's a, the authored Mordecai richler who was a contemporary of my father's a William Shatner, burt Bacharach. Wow. Um, the, um, uh, saul bellow, spare, disperse his childhood in Montreal. So it's a small community that has a number of people that we're proud of. Yeah. What do you make of that, that, that so many. I mean, that's a pretty diverse, interesting group of people right there.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       And I'm sure there are others. Uh, yeah, I, uh, it, it, it may just be that I'm having many cultural influences, both candidates really dominated by the United States. It really is the 800 pound gorilla next door. So it's the American influence, the British influence, the French influence. Perhaps it's just being in a cosmopolitan diverse community that helped with that. And, and of course, the, the, uh, the, the Jewish influence, although it was not, um, I didn't grow up in. None of the people that I mentioned grew up in an ultra orthodox community. I grew up in a room with a reform temple. Uh, we didn't take God all that seriously, but we did take Jewish identity seriously. Yeah. I don't remember a moment in which I decided, oh, I'm an atheist. I just was not a big issue one way or another. Do you find that to be sort of standard thing with most secular Jews?

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       I think that's sort of at least the ones that I had been talking to on this show that I think are sort of out there more. That seems to be a thing that there's an ethnic identity or a cultural identity that's separate from the belief part. Absolutely. I think that's more true of Judaism than it is, say Catholicism where the belief really is stipulated in Judaism, isn't a bit of a kind of don't ask, don't tell as long as you want, painful. As long as we made the laws and rituals, if you keep the sabbath, if you have, you know, Mazzoni on Passover and then you're a good Jew and what you believe is just not as important. One a rabbi said to my wife Rebecca Goldstein, another secular Jew, well known, uh, a secular humanist writer, uh, when she talked about her novel, 36 arguments for the existence of God, a work of fiction, which is kind of the.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       And she spoke at a Jewish community center and that was a little worried whether there'd be some pushback from the rabbi who introduced her and afterwards he went over and he said, you know, it's not like in Judaism it says you have to believe in God. You just can't believe that more than one of them. That's, I mean, that's pretty perfect. Do you think there's a, there's an inherent problem there sort of disconnecting God from even if it really is as well, just for the longevity of it, let's say. Oh yeah. Uh, yeah. It's, uh, it's a good question. I think that may have been part of the explanation for why. I mean there's so many secular Jewish intellectuals kind of immersed in argument disputation, particularly about morals and ethics, but without a bit, but it was all argument disputation. It wasn't a a, a catechism that you had to recite.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       It wasn't a set of beliefs that you have to have. So there was a tradition of disputation. That's what the rabbis were famous for, that the pill pool, the hair splitting and, and maybe that was a con contributor as well, but I went to public schools and in fact when you go to public schools in Quebec, when, I mean my childhood meant you went to Protestant schools because it was divided along religious lines. There were Protestant schools and Catholic. Oh, interesting. Protestant meant on Catholic. Basically everyone else, including the Muslims and the Jews and Chinese and so on. It was a bizarre system. Yeah. How interesting. Happily unconstitutional in this country. And I got, I got. I actually got a pretty serious Protestant religious education. I saying hymns, we said the Lord's prayer every day. I learned about life of Jesus. So they had the Jews and the Muslims and everyone was getting a Protestant schools.

Speaker 1:          00:08:54       Yeah. And at one point I remember I was, I think it was, you know, eight or nine and I actually, we didn't even belong to a temple. I said to my mother, one of my friends said that, that Jews aren't supposed to believe in Jesus my should I not believe in Jesus anymore. She sent me to Hebrew school so fast that made my head spin hilarious. My teachers, because they couldn't hire Catholic teachers either. Uh, and virtually everyone in Quebec is among the Francophone community are Catholics. So they actually hired Algerian and Tunisian and Moroccan Jews to teach French to the, uh, Jewish and Protestant kids in Montreal. The Protestant kids in Montreal did not learn French from Native Quebecois. We looked at from a Egyptian or Tunisian immigrants. How bizarre it was. I'm pretty sure I know the subject of your next book. I mean, it sounds like there's just so much richness to adjusting that, or at least there's a little, a little comedy in there.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       Like, it sounds like your family was kinda on the intellectual side, or at least at the county he was in red house, was full of books and magazines. My, uh, my father was, um, had a law degree but didn't practice when I was a child. He was a and handled some little bit of real estate and did a sales, uh, before, uh, starting a law practice pretty late in life. My mother was like most mothers of the fifties and sixties, a homemaker, but then found a career when she was getting bored, uh, when I became a guidance counselor and then the vice principal of high school and my mother were Roslyn pinker, very intellectual and intense reader knows everything. A intellectually very engaged. Yeah. And my sister, Susan is a, uh, I'm a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, is written in a couple of books on one on sex differences, one on a face to face contact.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       My brother Rob, who I worked for the Canadian government for several decades as a policy analyst and a, uh, an administrator. So how much of the intellectual pursuits that you all have, do you think is his biological versus just learned experience? Yeah. This is one of the themes that keeps coming up around these decisions. And, and it, it is a, was a topic of my book, the blank slate in the modern denial of human nature. The blank slate being the metaphor that I argued became dominant and intellectual life largely for political reasons. Can you explain that a little bit for the people that, that don't know the book? Yeah. So the, the blank slate, the modern denial of human nature just was released in 2016 with an afterword was about the idea that, uh, that there is no such thing as human nature, that we are blank slates written on by our parents, my, by the culture, by a education and that there's no innate human traits or ways of learning and thinking it's, it's a, you can program a human however you want.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       Uh, and uh, I argued that it was popular in the 20th century for political reasons. One of them being that it seems like the ultimate way to achieve equality, you know, if we all, if we're all zero, then you know, zero equals zero equals zero. So we all have to be equal, right? I already, this is a mistake in the book that equality is really a legal and moral principle to treat everyone equally. It's not really the belief that we're all clones were on blank slates and a lot of the book try to both layout the science of human nature, but also to explore the political and emotional and moral baggage and coloring and to try to clarify it. And so the difference between equality of treatment and the equality of, uh, of, of our biological endowment was a major thing that also of course enters into discussion of sex differences where one of the reasons that certain intellectual factions, certain parts of feminism wants to deny that there any sex differences.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       So I think, well that will make it impossible to discriminate because there's nothing to discriminate. We're all exactly the sport exactly the same. And I get that big, big mistake. There's first of all, there is a lot of evidence that men and women aren't identical and all traits. I mean, I'm not a scientist, but I think there is a lot of evidence. Agree. Yeah. I think anyone who's had a son and a daughter who has been in a heterosexual relationship, anyone who's listened to gossip about anyone talking about anyone else. Yeah. Men and women are really not, not exactly the same, but I think the myth that at the same was introduced for political purposes, namely that would make discrimination irrational, right? Because there's nothing to discriminate on. And I argue that, that, you know, that's just a error in logic. Uh, I strongly believe in, in gender equity that no one should be prejudged because they're a man or a woman, partly because of a scientific fact that there's huge overlap between the sexes in any trade you want to look at.

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       So you can predict an individual's traits just knowing that they're a man or a woman, but they, the policy, we should be fair. It doesn't require the false belief that were the same, that are distinguishable. What's the best? Have you heard any argument for that belief that you thought made any sense or you just were which belief for the idea that, that this, that these genders are equal? Like when you must hear this from other academics, right? I mean, we know that some of this stuff is being taught at schools. Yeah. Well, there are, you know, there's no doubt that there are, there's enormous, enormous overlap. Um, there's no doubt. And, and some of the differences between the sexes are, are pretty small and subtle. So in say, mathematical ability, which was one of the most controversial, uh, claims about sex differences or it could lead to a huge firestorm when Larry Summers, the president of Harvard mentioned that differences between the sexes might explain why the number of engineering professors at Harvard and mit wasn't 50 slash 50 down the line.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       Male, female. This is very much like the James divorce situation with, with Google. It is, is exactly. I mean, it's almost, it's almost a replay and uh, and, and it isn't easy. In fact, it would be hard to say that men or women are better at math in general. It's you have to even drill down to certain subcomponents like mentally rotating three dimensional objects that men are clearly better at, but women are better at, at our word, problems in arithmetic and math. So it's a. So some of the pushback is that in fact the science is often complicated. You can't make a sweeping across the board generalization and then the other kind of push back for people who defend the blank slate as well. Yeah, that's true of 2002 when your book came out, but a society is changing and uh, you know, more women are, are consuming porn and more women are having multiple sexual partners and maybe the differences saying sexuality, uh, are due to human nature, but just due to our culture at a particular moment that may become obsolete.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       And that seems incredibly dangerous to me to view it that way. Well, maybe, um, although, you know, you could, in some ways it's actually highway a progressive and even correct because you could have said, you know, 70 years ago a women don't want to go into the professions. They, they, they want to stay home with the kids. And Housework, and that's what makes them complete and satisfied and happy and there'll be all a neurotic and anxious if they start to become lawyers and doctors. And we know from the course of history that, you know, that's not true. In fact, I went as soon as the doors open, women did pour through the doors. Um, and so that would be an example. Were too strong a claim of biological differences would have been refuted by, by the facts of history. So it's not a slam dunk.

Speaker 1:          00:16:31       I mean, it is something that has to be examined on a case by case basis. Are you shocked at how difficult it is to talk about all of this without getting yourself yourself or, or any of the people that talk about it into hot water? Yeah. Nuance that you have to go through here. As I can see, you're, you're quite well versed that you're probably the best at it. It's a lot to make sure that somebody can pinpoint that one line that then they're going to just drag you for. Exactly. Right. Well, and the reason that I wrote the blank slate was it wasn't so much, it's a chapter on gender, but the point wasn't just to review the literature on gender differences. It was also to say, okay, so what, how does it matter for our public debates? And I also documented in the book how even when the book first came out, there was a history of people being deep platformed and it down and called know all kinds of nasty names, um, for, for the view that we're not blank slates.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       And I said, well look, this is based on emotion based on bad politics, not based on the facts. So I kind of, I don't know if I want to say defended myself, but I laid out all of these political controversies. So I wasn't blundering into it. Naive. I was actually, that was actually the subject of the book sometimes though, that that can't fully defend you. And in fact both Larry Summers and Jamie to more, they almost could have taken their speeches and in case in the case of Larry Summers, partly did from the chapter on gender in the book. So I managed to escape some trouble that people who have been repeated the arguments got into trouble for. Yeah. So it's interesting. You sort of laid out a case beforehand to, to defend yourself. You did like sort of a preemptive strike. Exactly where someone, both of those guys.

Speaker 1:          00:18:14       I know James, I know James personally and he's been in here. Whereas like he sort of stumbled into this thing and then the reaction, the way it sort of, it just becomes this bigger beast that you end up fighting when you were just really trying to talk about science. Well the science, I, I wasn't just talking about the science because I was talking about first the science. Then what are the political and moral implications, which I thought got confused feeding back on people trying to shoehorn the science into a politically correct position because they were kind of lazy when it came to the politics. I don't believe in obviously I don't believe in discrimination against anyone. Uh, and, but the point being that having that belief doesn't mean that you have to insist that were blank slates. And I made that argument for other controversies around human nature, like, do we have any violent, uh, impulses where there's, there, there's a kind of political argument for different reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       And then people think, well, if we're innately violent, then we're kind of doomed to war for forever. And if you try to reduce war, you're just some romantic piece neck and it's hopeless and more as in human nature. Therefore, since war is bad, uh, and if we're violent, then we'll always have war. We can't be violent. And I invest is a logical. We do have violent impulses. I think that's pretty clear, but it's not all we have. We also have a, have the faculty of self control. We also have empathy. We have cognitive processes of problem solving, uh, so we can figure out how we can reduce war. We've got moral norms. There are just certain things you don't do. And the fact that part of us as violent doesn't mean we're doomed to violence because part of us pushes back on the fire. Once I cited a statistic that three quarters of men and 60 percent of women at least once it had a homicidal fantasy, imagined killing someone.

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       They don't like three quarters of men and 60 percent of task. Yeah. And uh, and, and when I, uh, I introduced this factor electronic and I say, well, what does this tell us about human nature tells us that three quarters of men are liars, but, uh, but I pointed out this, this doesn't mean that trying to increase piece is futile because there are other parts of human nature we can work with. And of course that was what led to my more recent book, the better angels of our nature. That said, not only is it possible it's happened. Yeah, I bet. Again, it's kind of the nexus between the political on the one hand and the scientific on the other that I was exploring. And I talked about how the people who thought they were advocates of peace tried to squash all evidence that people have a violent, uh, impulses because it was just politically too uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       And I said, that's first of all, distorting the science is never a good idea. And is it clear about the politics then the science doesn't even mean that we've got to accept war. Yeah. So for someone that's sort of insulated themselves from some of this, because you were doing the work beforehand, which is actually pretty brilliant tactic. Are you afraid that the hard sciences are going to be hit by all of this identity politics stuff in a bigger way than we're seeing right now when it comes to gender or race or, or any of these issues? It's not even so much the hard sciences, but the social sciences, well we know the social science happen hit, but you don't fear that it's going to come from the hard sciences to, well, that there may be some aspects of genetics and brain science that are, uh, that are feeling the political pressure, the neuroscience of sex differences, for example.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       Um, certainly the genetics of intelligence and personality have a, have felt that political pressure. Yeah. Uh, a, um, one of my collaborators and former students. So James Lee presented a paper where he's part of the consortium that for the first time identified number of genes that were linked to intelligence. I mean there's no icu gene, but there are hundreds, probably thousands of genes that could bump your icu up by a fraction of a point up or down. And they have been some of the first really hard replicable discoveries because there are a lot of bogus discoveries in the past. But this was really solid and there was, there was pretty, pretty big pushback, including from the president of the society saying, this is, this, is this fascist, this is unacceptable. Um, so there was some pushback and this was, this was genetics. So what do you make of the people that focus on like race and Iq?

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       I, I, you know, I've had Stefan Molyneux here. I don't know if you know who he is, but he, he really focuses on that. And I wanted what I wanted to know from him really was not necessarily why it really not. What do you think of this, but why the focus on that, that team, to me, that's the part I'm more concerned about. Yeah, I think it's. I think it's an excellent question and it's one that, uh, that um, uh, torments me. I mean, on the one hand you could make the argument, well, we should not be afraid of the truth. And for that matter of vigorous, a exploration of the genetics of racial differences might show that there are no genetic differences relevant to personality or intelligence and that would give races have a really decisive blow. But the other hand, you never know that before you look.

Speaker 1:          00:23:27       So you can't count on that. You've of course, if you do science, you got to be prepared for any possibility. There is, I think, a legitimate question of whether we really should be getting to the bottom of this. It's an argument that actually goes back to my old mit colleague, Noam Chomsky way back in the 19 seventies said, uh, we can't insist that the truth one way or another because that's just contrary to the whole spirit of science. But we don't have to ask every question, a lot of questions that are scientifically pretty minor, they could have socially damaging consequences. So let's put them really low on the list and he suggested that, uh, that racing Iq, for example, is, should not be an interest in a society that treats people as individuals because then it's just like a correlation between any two traits and that, uh, that, that we should just be a low priority and something that we should ignore.

Speaker 1:          00:24:16       Now that's a little bit. Um, uh, I think it ignores the fact that there are people who already are dividing humans by race and by measuring the outcomes and attributing it to poverty or racism. And then you kind of say, well, Gee, if, as long as we were raising the question at all, should we look at all the hypotheses, it might even be an argument for just downplaying race in general. Uh, instead of dividing us up by race and obsessive measuring the differences, I'm looking at things like class and income because that that's really what, what matters more and just not make everything a racial issue in the first place so that whether the racial issue is from biology kind of fades and importance. Yeah. You mentioned the nexus of politics and science. I really like that phrase because I think there's so many of the conversations I'm having here.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       It seems to me that politics and science are really just linked all the time and it explains why so many people want to talk to you and why they want to talk to the Weinstein brothers and Sam Harris and so many other people. Are you a little concerned that it's becoming so political? Yeah, I mean, part of it is that it's that what, what, uh, what I'm doing and what some of the other your other guests have been doing is to try to depoliticize some of the scientific issues and certainly what I tried to do in the blank slate or clarify what the political issues are not. It's almost impossible these days right. It, it is becoming a little bit, uh, well, it's, the landscape is really diverse and divided. I mean there are the very, the identity politicians in the social justice warriors and the political correctness police who are making things as political as possible.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       I mean they'd been around for a long time when I was a student in the seventies, there were plenty of people who are shouting things like fascists don't have the right to speak or chanting mobs that shut down a Harvard colleague, Eo Wilson when he published sociobiology. So this isn't a new thing. Uh, and there are certainly constituencies that are totally opened to depoliticizing the science and considering the politics on its own terms. But on the other hand, there is a fringe that appears to be more radical than ever. Yeah. How do you decide how much weight that fringe has? That seems to be one of the themes these days. It seems to be very hard to tell. Is this just this small group that's screaming a lot or, or has it truly infected? Not only a ton of, you know, the millennial generation and had a huge swath of young people, but that also it does seem to be creeping up or creeping down depending on which way you look at it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       A ton of academics at universities and all sorts of, all sorts of other people that actually have power. Well, I think the academics have been distorted for quite some time. Uh, and this is a, a, a, an idea that's been pushed by Jonathan Heit tetlock. Jose Duarte. I'm sure a lot of stern. They had a, a pretty widely discussed article that, uh, the title, something like viewpoint diversity will help social science with a, gave a number of cases, some of which I had discussed in the blank slate of how just the questions that a psychologist ask the, the items they put on their questionnaires, the way they frame issues just clearly has a left wing bias that they argued that if there were also people, conservatives in more of them in psych departments than they would have pointed out, Hey, your questionnaire is flawed and that the actual quality of the science would improved.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       And to the credit of my field of psychology, there are paper was published in a journal where there are 30 commentaries, so 30 people had a chance to go after them or teams. And it was, it was, there was disagreement, but was very respectful. They weren't call any nasty names and it was a really good debate. Um, but the, the question that you asked about how is this, uh, are the, the, uh, totally illiberal and radical movements, the ones that just shouting down speakers sometimes physically assault them. Is that the whole millennial generation or is that just a increasingly vocal fringe? Uh, my, my mind was changed just a couple of days ago when I read an article in vox about a new study, a Sam Harris had center to me saying that actually support for free speech is increasing, including the article you saw the article so that, you know, that I wasn't, I was kind of surprised.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       I wasn't totally shocked because at least my experience at Harvard is that the students are, uh, all the ones that I've interacted with, admittedly a biased sample, but they are perfectly supportive of debate, free speech, openness. So it's interesting. So I, I mentioned, uh, right before we started that I spoke at Harvard through the open issues, right. And it was a wonderful group and I, and it was clear that they were politically diverse and, and all the other diversity that everyone likes, but that I don't care about that much. But, uh, afterwards we went to a dinner and there were about 30 or 40 kids. I was with Bret Weinstein actually. And uh, I asked them like, what do you guys do? Are you guys okay with saying what you think and do you think it's going to hurt your grades or hurt your friendship? And virtually everyone said yes.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       So I'm still struggling with this because I did read it. They said, they said yeah, we would either hurt them or they've lost friends. Mostly I sent, most of them were kind of libertarian ish, kind of live and let live. But, but certainly not all of them, but, but virtually everyone at the table said that they either were afraid to say certain things, friends or certainly two professors. So that's why when I read the articles like that at box and I go to these campuses and I hear this consistently, it's just hard to grade and I, and that's exactly why I'm posing the question to you. Yeah. It's just hard to pin this article was a, was an eye opening. They go, went against the narrative that the millennial generation, are they a bunch of snowflakes that a bunch of, of, of uh, cultural revolutionaries, warriors.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       Uh, it's just, uh, there certainly is that faction, but it may not, uh, characterize our, our era altogether. Yeah. Have you thought at all about how much social media is a piece of this puzzle? Well, I don't know. And that's, you know, nowadays everything is blamed on social media, kind of like, you know, what the role of El Nino and then nine slash 11 happened. I believe it. That was all my space. Yeah, right. Yeah. I don't know. A lot of this I think, predated social media. I think that, uh, a cable news networks had, had a role, um, Fox News in particular because it was so politicized, uh, in a way that no previous network really had been. And there are studies showing that when a town gets Fox News and you could do the natural experiment because some towns got it before others just because of the way cable companies offered different packages for no particular reason.

Speaker 1:          00:31:01       Uh, you could tell the towns that got Fox News became more polarized and became a and shifted to the right. So it really did have a causal effect. That's one case where it's not just correlational. Yeah. So you, you had a strange, a moment about a month or two ago, about two months ago now, were you, you said something to the effect of you when someone asks you a question at a panel about the alt right and in and in effect you said, but I don't want to put words in mouth. What, what, what did you say? Well, this was, I don't want to butcher open campus initiative. Oh, it was it. They were the ones that are. Okay. There you go. So I know this is a good group of people you were sitting with. It wasn't the. And the, uh, topic of the event was, did political correctness help elect trump?

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       It was held almost on the anniversary of the, uh, 16 election. And uh, I suggest that I thought it did in part because the, uh, when you have certain ideas that are just not discussable, uh, on, on, on campus, and you've got a savvy, interconnected community as the original. All right, where a lot of people associate alt right with the torch carrying skinheads. But what I had in mind was the, the term as it originally applied to internet discussion groups. Uh, and that, uh, the, the danger of restricting debate on a campus of, of making certain ideas taboo is that when smart people do stumble upon them, then they are, number one, are a completely alienated from the mainstream intellectual life because they think, well, this is a truth that they can't handle a what other truths can't they? Uh, and they, since the ideas never get the kind of push back and contextualize nation and counter-arguments kind of thing that you, that you want for any idea never happens.

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       And within this likeminded community they sometimes jump to the most extreme conclusions because it's sort of a self, a self fulfilling prophecy of sewers. Yeah. So an example being gender differences, if it's taboo even to mention the possibility that men and women differ, then you stumble across some pretty good scientific evidence that they do a, then you might be like, you know, Milo Yiannopoulos saying, oh, we should, we should, uh, have fewer women in medical school because they just going to drop out and have babies. Now, I mean, that's a totally idiotic idea. Um, but the reason that, that he could put forward an idiotic idea is that since the whole existence of sex differences never discussed, no one ever said that's an idiotic idea. And likewise, and there are a number of other facts that are kind of undiscussable that you can take to extreme conclusions if you're not challenged.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       Whereas if you bring them out into the open, then you can put them into perspective. Sunlight is the best disinfectant and in many cases it is. Another example is that the rates of crime differ between blacks and whites. Now, if that's a fact that's almost undiscussable, but just go to FBI.gov. look up. They break down rates of a of a crime by age, by race, by state, and you know there it is. Now, if you have never even noticed that, then you can say, Oh gee, I wonder if you know African Americans are innately more violent than white. That's completely wrong because we know that no two ethnic groups ever have the same crime rate and they can shift over time. It used to be the Irish that were the that had sky high rates of violence compared to a non Irish and we know that that vanished over time and the black white differences might as well, but that second fact, namely ethnic and racial differences are ubiquitous and they can change with time.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       We'll never even get mentioned if the mere fact that there is a difference is unmentionable in the first place. So that was my argument. I gave some other examples anyway, that was, um, then there's a doctored film clip on some outright sites saying, oh, see pinker's saying that the operators is correct. That is actually saying, how can we, how can we starve the offer right now? We're, we're, we're, we're, uh, we're feeding them inadvertently. You were basically, I mean, just for the layman that's watching this. I mean, you were basically saying allow for more information so that those bad ideas won't be able to flourish. I mean, that is sort of one o one version. That was the whole point. Exactly. Then it was, it was, uh, edited to leave out that parts and then the kind of regressive left picked up on it to, to also suggest that I was sympathetic to the alt right, which is most bizarre attribution you could imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       And indeed, enlightenment now has a whole chapter on why the, uh, the alt right is, um, it has gone off the off the rails. Unfortunately, this misconception after a couple of days after the day was corrected, both in the New York Times and the Guardian in England, I may. They came to my defense and set things right, but it wasn't bizarre. A episode of how has the Times putting social media makes you stupid. Precisely. All right, so I do want to spend our whole second. Okay. Talking about the book, but very quickly just when you dealt with that whole thing. I mean I remember reading it and I think there was something in an odd way. I think the reaction between, as you said, the regressive left and the right, that they were sort of teaming up on you. Again. I thought it was in a weird way, even though I know it probably personally for you is no fun and you probably had all sorts of people saying terrible things to you and all, all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       That I thought if anyone has read any of Stephen's books or even remotely knows what this guy is doing that I think I don't know what you consider yourself politically. You strike me as sort of an old school liberal. I don't want to, I'm putting out there that if you centrist moderate, I have, I have sympathies to different policies and uh, but yeah, I'm, I'm pretty eclectic and centrist. Yeah. So that, that basically I thought this guy, so obviously just decent and coming at this from a, from a scientific perspective that if this is what they're going to do, where at, where you say one line, this is going to destroy. I mean really my feeling was he could destroy, like the fabric of society really if we just start picking off everybody and I've seen a lot of instances of this and this, you know, when I've talked to when I've talked to or I've talked to Bret Weinstein or Lindsay Shepherd from Lori a up in Canada and a few others that they.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       But I thought yours was just such an example of this is so ridiculous as well. So perhaps there was a nice push back to it maybe. And that was, that was exactly the New York Times response. I mean, that's why they titled the op Ed. Um, by that Jesse Singal, how social media makes them stupid. Yeah. Alright. Let's talk about the book right here in front of me. Enlightenment. Now I've been kicking around this phrase on twitter that's called a little traction that we are now in the enlightened because it seems like we're in this endless stream of constant stupidity and I, and some of it seems social media related and we touched a little bit on that in part one. And when I'm saying it, I'm saying it a little tongue in cheek and actually this book is sort of the answer to I think what I'm calling the enlightenment that there are so many good things happening right now and it, and it's very hopeful and optimistic.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       And I always tell people I'm an optimist, otherwise I couldn't do this. You know what I mean? I, I feel that there's a chance we can make things better. So first off, let's just do some one on one stuff. You're, what our enlightenment values to you. Well, I, I characterize them in the subtitle of book as reason science humanism and progress reason that we should, uh, analyze our situation, our predicament, a using the most rigorous a logic that we can. And rather than relying on dogma, authority, tradition, scripture, I'm not going for social media advocacy, social media, although at least throwing ideas out there as long as they get evaluated, as long as they had criticized, I'm a science, that namely that we should test our hypotheses, seat deep explanations and that science provides us not just with a gadgets and cures for disease, although it's important that it does that, but also defines our, our human condition, that concepts from science, like evolution, like entropy, like the whole naturalistic world view, that the laws of nature do their thing without caring about us.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       These are things that we have to understand as the most basic facts about our existence. So science is has to be part of our world to you. Then humanism is the idea that it's human beings and other sentient animals that deserve our, our our moral concern as opposed to they say the glory of the tribe or following a caring it, religious dictates or the faith or some messianic age that it's just, do people live long, healthy, happy, stimulating lives. That's what we should care about. And then progress is that if we use reason and science to make people better off, well maybe we can gradually succeed. Yeah. So it's funny when I, when I was reading this and the only word that like dinged a little something in my head was progress. And I think it's partly because of the way progressives have used progress that progress in and of itself.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       You want to progress meeting have more and more opportunity for people more and more equality for people. I think that's a far cry from what I think the progressive's are doing right now because that's the most subjective one of any of those terms. Right? Well, I, I have the wisecrack that progressives hate progress. If you look at the people who denied that we've made progress, it's often the people who politically labeled themselves as progressive who can't stand the idea that we've made progress because they wanted to save it. Every aspect of our current society and institutions. There's corrupt and racist and controlled by the, by the one percent and everything is getting worse and worse and worse. And ironically, because the whole point of being a progressive presumably is that progressive activism is not a waste of time, but it actually brings benefits and which, which actually has it sort of the catch 22 of, of progress in general that you have to acknowledge it, but in a weird way, you need to not acknowledge it to keep furthering it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       Yeah. So there is an optimum amount and what it has to keep in mind the two ideas that we've made progress. But we've got huge challenges ahead of us. Just a very simple example, a extreme poverty, the bare minimum that you, that you need to feed your family, uh, has been, has been falling. And that's it. It's got to be an example of progress in a couple of hundred years ago, you could say that probably 90 percent of humanity was living in extreme poverty. Now it's less than 10 percent. That's amazing. Yeah. A lot of that happened just in the last 30 years. Um, but another way of stating the same fact is that 730 million people live in extreme poverty. Now that's the same fact, 10 percent of seven point 3 billion, 730 million, that's an awful lot of miserable people. Now those are the same described in two different ways and we got to be able to think in both ways and let's, let's try to get it to zero now.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       That's not a crazy romantic utopian story eyed a goal that is one of the UN sustainable development goals. The predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals for poverty was reached five years ahead of schedule. So the new goal, which is to eliminate extreme poverty everywhere by 20, 30, probably a little too optimistic, but uh, but not, not completely crazy, and maybe it'll be instead of zero percent, maybe it will be two percent and maybe it'll be 20, 40, but still it's an amazing, uh, aspiration in the first place. How much of this do you think, and it's a little bit, gets back to the blank slate, but how much of this do you think the way you view progress, whether the acknowledgement of progress or that you sort of need to feel that we've made no progress to kind of fuel yourself? How much of that do you think is just hardwired in the way we look at the world?

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       I think some of it comes from a certain cognitive biases. One of them being the availability heuristic being discovered by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, namely the human mind generally estimates, probability and risk by calling examples from memory. If you've just seen a, a tornado on the news, then you think that tornadoes are a major cause of death and the fact that you know, falls off ladders, killed many more people than tornadoes. It doesn't register because those don't make the news. Uh, and, and we, we don't naturally calibrate for how many opportunities there are for bad things to happen, how big the world is, how many people there are, we just remember the examples and that's what drives our intuitions. And when you have the news media reporting, everything that goes wrong everywhere, then you can come away with an impression that the world is falling apart because all the parts of the world that aren't falling apart just never make the news.

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       So that's one. There is also a, uh, we, we are, I think tuned to dwell on the negative probably because bad things can hurt you a lot more than good things can help you. So there is something adaptive in a natural environment to be on the lookout for, for what can kill you. So that's just a survival instinct. That's, I think, part of the survival instinct there. There are other things too, like the, uh, there's always implicit competition between different elites in society, the academics, the journalists, the politicians, the business people that religious, the military, you know, they're all different kinds of power centers and they all kind of compete with each other for prestige and a, and an influence. And if you say society is declining, it's corrupt, it's a mess. It's horrible. It's kind of a way of, uh, each one of these groups can kind of feel superior to the others.

Speaker 1:          00:44:30       The academics could say, look what the businessmen in the country, in a business when you can say, look what the politicians are doing to the country. And the challenges can say, look, the incumbents are doing. And so it's kind of a backhanded way of social oneupmanship do you sense that right now we're at a unique position to bring back more enlightenment values? Like it seems to me that because of trump, because of social media, that just everything is sort of upside down right now. This again has been a theme with a bunch of my guests that everything is sort of on the table and that there's great opportunity. We don't know which way it's going to go, but there's great opportunity for good ideas. There's a great opportunity for bad ideas. Obviously. I know which way we're both hoping this is going to be. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       But do you think that we actually are in a unique moment right now? I know everyone always thinks that they're always going to be there. They're always in the moment. Right? But do you think there's something unique right now? Well, it's, there's someone thinking that there's kind of any quality of every reason maybe growing that at the top. There's so many areas in which we become so much more rational and reasonable, uh, like evidence based medicine used to be your doctor had a hunch and operated on, you gave her your drug and there's no reason to think that we're actually working. Now therapies are evaluated in a big studies or a data driven policing. One of the reasons that the crime rate went down so dramatically starting in the nineties is that the police started to gather block by block data and where the violence was occurring, they kind of collapsed on those areas like a ton of bricks.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       Make sure that, uh, one gang member that just suffered a, a, uh, an injury wouldn't be roaring for revenge saying, you know, we were watching you and that really drove down the rate of crime by a lot in sports. I'm a sabermetrics moneyball, much more rational analysis. Uh, you know, there's the effective altruism movement. How can we allocate charity and volunteering so it actually does good as opposed to just giving people a warm glow. And so all of these areas, but at the same time, you get these not all conspiracy theories and the fake news and be a politicized denial of science such as vaccine safety and climate change. So the question is, how do we let the standards of rationality, hitches will trickle down, make it so that, uh, that it's kind of second nature for everyone to just not think in certain ways because they had just been proven to be obviously ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       Yeah. How do you do it? I mean, I think that's a good. So I may not be the one to, uh, you know, to, to change a whole society. I do it by appealing to the kind of people who watch the show, kind of people would read my books in the hopes that it will kind of spread out from there. And we know it's not. No, it's not that it can't happen there. There are certain bad ideas that at one point are taken seriously and then they just drop off. And like, no one talks about when ever, again, in my lifetime when I was a kid, there was a debate over racial segregation, you know, should, should, should black students be admitted to the University of Mississippi. I mean, you just couldn't have that debate anymore. Even among the, the farthest right of the right. That's just no longer an issue should women be allowed to, to, to, to work.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       Um, and uh, in earlier decades and centuries it was slavery or women's suffrage and superstitions like, uh, you know, alchemy a or a human sacrifice. So it's not hopeless that sometimes what happens is that at any given time there's a range of reasonableness, but that, that center drifts. So that some things that were at the tail end of, of, of ridiculousness, even the conspiracy theory mongers and the most benighted can no longer take it seriously. Yeah. How would you, this is just sort of are. Or the discussion around all this is just about our lack of patience. Because actually when the, when the publisher sent me the book, I said Enlightenment now. And as you think you guys had the. And now he's bigger than enlightenment and I thought that was kind of interesting because we live in a time of immediate reaction to everything and selfies and likes and people just don't have patience anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:48:42       Attention spans are, are incredibly short that we want more now. But some of these things are just the long game. Yeah, I think that's it. That's exactly right. We also, we have Amnesia for how things were not so long ago. Yeah, that's a point that I make a uh, repeatedly, even though there are, you know, there's a horrific war going on now in Syria, but we forget some of the horrific wars that were going on in the, uh, in the eighties and nineties. What can we do to stop that Amnesia? Because I think that's a big part of this. Yeah. And I think the culture of journalism should, should put events of the day into some context. I don't mean going back hundreds of years, the American revolution, but even just, you know, what was like in the 19 nineties was likely the eighties, the likewise we'll be economy.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       People are so nostalgic for the early areas with strong unions and predictable wages and factory jobs, but you know, that was also the era of a double digit inflation. Eighteen percent inflation. If you could pay the rent this year, you didn't know whether you could pay it next year because rick could go up and kind of forget about those days long. A lines around the block that had gasoline for fear that we'd run out of heating oil and fuel freeze in the winter. A huge high rates of poverty among the elderly. People that have been has been brought down by social security, so our just. Our commentary should look back. They're not ancient history, but recent history. Yeah. What are some of the other things that are that are hopeful right now? Are there other markers in society or in science or politics? Are there any other trends that you're seeing right now that you think are leading us to some positive places?

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       Well, often you get pleasant surprises when you actually look at trends instead of headlines, and you and I were talking off camera about a, a, a recent survey that showed that contrary to the fears of a millennial generation being intolerant of free speech and the rep for that matter, the society as a whole, and especially university campuses, they actually, according to this new study anyway, you actually plot the data. We asked people should people who are espousing controversial beliefs at least be able to say them. It's actually been going up. Uh, it's higher among the college educated than the less college educated. It spans a range of controversial positions. It's true for millennials as well as baby boomers. And so the, what I, myself even experienced as a kind of dread and foreboding about a whole generation being intolerant of competing views, it turns out to be probably overblown.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       There are a lot of examples like that and the other positive developments, I mean, the, the high school students protesting are ridiculous, gun safety laws, that kind of something that we couldn't have predicted. Uh, so recently the, the me too movement has had a lot of excesses and you know, I think there's much to criticize. On the other hand, it's not okay for women to be preyed upon by their bosses and that is suddenly becoming an issue and probably the society will on the whole change for the better because of it. I wasn't planning on going here, but since you mentioned it, what would be a humanistic, enlightened way of looking at guns right now? Oh yeah. Well, some of it a lot. It has to start with, with good data because a lot of our stereotypes of, uh, just, you know, maybe right, maybe wrong on the right, they believe you have concealed carry laws then that will reduce crime on the left.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       There is if we control guns, that will reduce a homicide. So we've got to be humble and try to get as many studies as possible to know what will really make a difference in what won't. But in general, the idea that, uh, that we're, we're better off if we're, we individually are not the, uh, you're kind of judged, jury, jury and executioner, that one of the great advances of civilization was that you outsource justice to a disinterested third party named with the court system. And that the idea that safety comes from individuals defending their interests with guns is, will in fact almost certainly has led to high rates of violence. Do you fear though that we could, that we often give too much power to the state? I mean, I think in, in, in some areas we do, but I think the idea that people should have guns so that they should resist the uh, uh, the government, you know, the kind of David Koresh and Idaho a cults, that is a terrible idea.

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       The idea that we should resist the government with, with guns. I mean, that's what they do in Congo, Somalia, we have this thing called democracy. So if the government becomes too repressive, we speak out against it. We vote, we petition, I, we form organizations. But the idea that we're going to shoot back at the police, I mean, that's nuts. What do you think of the state of our democracy in general? Because I think we're breaking off into these different factions now where, I mean, I think some people genuinely think that, you know, this hashtag resistance, that we're under this horrific authoritarian regime with. We don't even have to get into trump specifically if you don't want, but what do you think of just sort of the, the, the systems that are in place, the branches of government, all of the documents that founded this or are they doing all right at the moment?

Speaker 1:          00:54:00       So, so there are a lot of, uh, by any standards of world history, we live in fantastic freedom. Know I could say that, uh, you know, trump is a moron and he's a fascist and I don't have to worry about being put in jail. I mean, that's a real. Something to take, not to take for granted. If I sent the equivalent in Turkey, I wouldn't be put in jail or in, in, in Venezuela. Is that a little bit of the short memory on some of these things and why you need to know history? Because I think that all the time I see these guys all over twitter medians. It's amazing. Yeah. You can say what ever you really can and we should not take that for granted. It's apartment history, but also partly a comparisons across countries. And then history remembering fascism and communism and looking at regions today like, like Turkey and Venezuela and Russia.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       There's that. It, the, what's not so healthy is like gerrymandering that obviously super a subversion of democracy, uh, the effects of lobbying and campaign contributions from the, the, the wealthiest. That can't be a good idea. The fact that our elections drag on for a year and depends so much on, on a cash is a problem. Um, and there are government bureaucracies that have gotten too big and too, too many regulations that don't actually do anything beneficial. I don't think that means that's called for just reducing regulation with, uh, with, uh, a meat cleaver because some regulations really have done, done good. We've got cleaner air, we've got less poverty. Uh, but we should at least analyze what government programs, uh, are, are cost effective and which ones are just a nuisance and a drag. Yeah. And even having that conversation then gets people crazy where I, I personally, I come from it from a little more of a libertarian perspective and I would usually say that these days we've got people like Elon Musk that can get us to Mars and that can help clean the environment and green energy and all of those things where I know there's just another set of people that think, well, we just can't leave it to the industrialists.

Speaker 1:          00:56:03       We have to leave it to the government. That's at least a place where we can have some respectful disagreement that's a, that's a great place to. That's the conversation we should be having. And I, uh, my, my view is that there has to be a mix of a policy and regulation and a private enterprise I and with all of the creativity and, and bottom up a diversity that. So an example would be one thing that the government can do and that private industry can do is put a price on carbon emissions and this is a, a position that both left wing and right wing economists favor. But having done that, then the private sector can come up with a technology to reduce CO2 and it shouldn't be up to the government to say this, this company is the one that we're going to have support.

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       Right? And that's where the, the, uh, the, the free market really does a better job. But having that, that discussion, and I think Libertarians deserve credit for raising an issue that people on the left just don't even think of. Like just because you have good intentions and you have a program with the goal of achieving some good doesn't mean it's gonna work. Total waste of money. Well that's what I think so much of it is. It sounds good. It all sounds good. We want the government to do all these things and then we know that in practice often, although you've laid out a case for some of these things that actually do work cleaner air here, I mean look, we're in Los Angeles and air is cleaner and it really, it had a lot to do with the government for sure. So I absolutely acknowledge that, but to me it seems like so much of it feels like it's.

Speaker 1:          00:57:28       It sounds good. Let's just sort of hand it to the government. Yeah. And then you end up creating a whole series of other problems that are from fiscal things to, to all sorts of other things. Yeah, and I agree and I think actually in some ways liberals had been their own worst enemy and not being willing to have that conversation and almost like the platform is, if you support government programs, you're a good person and if you post them, you're a bad person. Whereas the, the, the discussion really should be which government programs make us better off, repay their costs to clean up the air, reduce poverty, which ones are, you know, boondoggles are bureaucracies and that way even the people who are liberals could at least have some ammunition and say, well, don't, don't kill that program. It actually works. And I have in the book a graph of the environmental quality since the EPA was initiated in 1970 by Richard Nixon.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       As it turns out, and the population has increased by 40 percent GDP increased by two and a half. Uh, we've driven twice as many miles, but air pollution has been reduced by 60 percent. So, and that, that almost certainly wouldn't have just happened with market innovation because there's just no, no one individually has an incentive to not pollute. That's the kind of thing where governments can make a difference. Likewise, I'm a poverty or there are certain measures like the earned income tax credit, which is a kind of negative income tax where almost everyone who a right and left two exams. So that's a government program that really worked. It's kind of cheap. So automatic and it really did reduce poverty and the lower middle class and working poor and we need to have that discussion so that the liberals for that matter can say, well, this, this program works.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       Don't cut it. They don't pay. But even they have kind of disarmed on the often on the evidentiary a debate and just made it more realistic. Yeah. I think that's what so many of us that I would include in this new group. Have you heard this phrase, intellectual dark web? Has this, has this come across your desk? I googled it. I mean, do you sort of catch what I mean? I think that, I don't know who's to say what it is or who is in it or whatever, but it strikes me that you were sort of one of the people that's right there. Just people that are all coming together because we're just trying to get a little bit of the answers here, which really is what this is about. Yeah. And um, the way Jonathan Haidt calls it, his viewpoint diversity, that it's, uh, it's not pushing a particular ideology, but it's getting a set of ideas out there that, that they have to, they have, they have to struggle.

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       They don't, they don't get a pass. The whole point of, of mentioning them is that, okay, now now attack them, see if they survive. Is there a piece of America right now or I guess we can say this in the West in general, that our freedoms have gotten so good actually, that we can't really figure out what's bad. So for example, like during the, uh, the whole debate over the football players kneeling for the anthem, I was watching people and everyone's just screaming about everything. And half the people hate trump. Half the people say the football players are anti American and half the people turn it on the owners of the teams. But I tried to lay out a case that actually the entire thing worked the way it was supposed to do in a free society. Trump said something, but he didn't. Whether you agree with what he said or not about mocking the players, he didn't try to pass a law about it, so he has so he exercises his free speech.

Speaker 1:          01:00:48       It's important to recognize that that he has that right to. If he had tried to pass a law, that's a different thing. The players could either neil or not neil, they might have to deal with the repercussions of that. The owners could decide whether they want it to keep those players on. Their teams are not. The fans could decide if they want it to not buy jerseys or not or not attend games. Right. That to me it was actually like a puzzle of freedom actually working and yet every day for months people were screaming that this is, you know, that this is tyrannical regime and everything so horrible. Does that sort of jive with you that, that we've gotten to a place where we don't. Our freedoms are so great that we're making these, these mountains out of things that are important to talk about, but yeah, I think that's a good.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       That's good analysis. I mean, I think it's a way of appreciating what other countries would would die for. I mean, you just couldn't have that football players or soccer players and the here in Turkey protests, government policy. I mean they, they'd be in jail. Turkey, one of our ally, you know, ally, it depends how you want to use air quotes. Yeah. But yes, I guess I think sort of a good point. Yeah. Yeah. So before we finish up here, give me it. Give me a few more things to just feel hopeful about because I think that really is what you're, you're trying to show people that there's so much goodness right now and let's not lose that. Yeah. Well, here's some, some, uh, heartening facts. They have the flynn effect that Iq scores have been rising by three points a decade for almost a century. A something here.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       I know. Incredible as it may sound really well. I'm going to have to dive into that one a little bit. I spent much time on twitter. Uh, certainly the fact that extreme poverty has been plummeting, I think is one of the greatest things that's ever happened to me, literally from 75 percent reduction just in 30 years in global rate of extreme poverty and the rise of, of literacy, 90 percent of the world's population under the age of 25 can read and write and there's almost perfect parody now between girls and boys, but that's encouraging diseases. Infectious diseases are in decline. Um, malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhea, and uh, we vanquish smallpox just sent it off into the, the, the, uh, in, into ancient history. It's no longer a disease there. We may do the same thing with polio with Guinea worm is terrific progress being made. Um, the uh, and values of toleration.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       And, um, what would I think we'd all agree, or progressive values such as a toleration of homosexuality, of women's equality, have the right to get a divorce of political participation. Uh, those have, believe it or not, all been in Ge in a gradual increase in every part of the world, even in the most politically backward part of the world. Namely, the Middle East and North Africa, there's been an increase with, especially when you compare generations with the younger generations are much more, uh, open and uh, I'm sympathetic to liberal values than the older generation and there's a, a, a, a widespread illusion. Everyone thinks that everyone else is more reactionary than they really are. Uh, people say, well, I'm kind of progressive, but everyone around me reactionaries there's a huge gap in how tolerant people really are and in how tolerant they think everyone else's. And that's really interesting. All right, so, so in summation, we should feel good about the future, but we have to fight for it, right? We should be recognized. What we're in danger of losing. We should recognize what we've accomplished as a kind of a impetus to do more steven pinker, it's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you for doing remind. Thanks for having me.
