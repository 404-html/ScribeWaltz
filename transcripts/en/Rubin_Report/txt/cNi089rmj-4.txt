Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Joining me today as a student and activist and the director of high school outreach for turning point USA, Kyle [inaudible]. You have welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me on. I'm excited to have you here. We've met a couple times. We've done some events together. You are seemingly wise beyond your years. That's true. All right, let's get to it. Well actually, I mean in a weird way, I guess you've been, you've been sort of thrust into being wise beyond your years. You were obviously a survivor of the parkland shooting. Uh, as you know, I had your classmate calmer and Kasey, I'm a couple of weeks ago and he kind of laid out, uh, what happened to him that day and subsequently everything that's happened. So let's just start there because that's kind of what put you on the map.

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       Okay. I'll sort of preface it. I don't like it. I don't like to refer myself as a survivor because I wasn't in the building that was shot into and I think that cheapens the pain and tragedy that people who were in the building. Uh, so what happened with me that day, it was fourth period. Uh, I was in, I was in my fourth period Class A and all of a sudden the alarms a ring. So we go into the hallway and we're walking out and we hear two, like two little pops. I don't know if two textbooks fell. No fire, fire works. I really had no idea. So we run back, uh, and I go and reach for, for the, uh, the door to my classroom and the teacher locked it. So you go into a nearby room, we get in there and we just hide for two hours straight. We just hear pops and ambulances. I ended up. So that was the freshman building and the entire time we had no idea was going on. Uh, and then all throughout the entire time people, uh, immediately or just villainizing guns, you know, the second we got a second I got out of the, uh, the closet that I was in, kids were like, we have to be an air fifteens

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       yeah, let's not jump into the political parties. So it's like, because it's interesting just listening to you hear about that. It's almost like the way you were describing it almost sounds like you weren't even there. Like it's just like a story that you were telling in a bizarre way. So once. Okay. So all of this happens, you find out now they're, they're dead students. I mean to do a friend killed.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       So we get it. We get out of the closet, so takes us out. They put their, you know, air fifteens in our faces, take us out. We have to put our hands on the person in front of us walking outside and all throughout this, the most disgusting thing was every single corner of the entire block surrounding us was just filled with media. Cars was just like jam packed. And what I saw there was that whenever there was like someone crying or like a moment of pain, the media would just surround them and encapsulate them. Uh, and I got home and I was really hoping that this wouldn't be like a politicized spectacle with like mass media jumping the gun to everything. Uh, and sadly that was the case. So when I was sitting there in shock, seeing the numbers rise on the screens for the death count, it was like so insane to internalize what had just occurred because like everyone's always, you know, this will never happen to my school. How could this happen to my school? Uh, and the sad reality is it can happen to any school. Like, I mean, stoneman Douglas was in the most affluent, low crime, you know, city I think in southern Florida. And this happened at our school.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       Did you know some of the kids that were killed?

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       Yeah, I knew one girl, Helena. She was in a class of my year back.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       Yeah. So what kind of time did you guys have to grieve because that you were already alluding to this, but it was like, it was as if the event happened, the shooting happened, and then it seemingly, there was no grieving. And then you guys were all over the television. You were all over twitter. You at all political people using you guys and all sorts of different ways. Just tell me a little bit about just kind of the grieving and trying to be able to be. How old are you now? 17. You're 17. Trying to be 16, 15, 16, 17 year old kids trying to just survive something. Unimaginably horrible.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       Yeah. I don't know how freshmen and sophomores have managed to go through this. Like I'm, I'm at least a Jew. I was a junior at the time, so I, I knew the school have a better in somewhat of my self esteem, a little more, build up more and a little bit more mature. Uh, but there was absolutely no time to grieve whatsoever, like a few days after the shooting. They already buses up to Tallahassee till, you know, kind of like push to like tug on the emotional heartstrings of Republicans to pass legislation that the otherwise wouldn't have passed. Who's they in that equation? So there are some, uh, members, uh, in the Florida Senate, uh, that like personally like coordinated buses. I'm from Parkland to Tallahassee.

Speaker 1:          00:04:28       Yeah. And what were your parents saying or the friends, you know, friends, parents. Like, it just seemed like the parents were almost gone now, now there is some of the parents that are a little more high profile that I, that I see, but it was as if you guys were just like taken. That's what it felt like suddenly we're seeing on CNN and town halls and I want to talk a little bit about that, but just like that you were just used all over the place with not even having a moment to just digest what happened.

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       So, so here's how I don't think that necessarily. So, so here's what I think will happen. I think that the kids saw what happened. They were shocked as they should be and they decided tack, like we said, this can't happen to anyone else ever again. Let's do something. You know what, what really occurred is that the mainstream media jumped, jumped on this immediately, uh, and just like put it to like a national scale and really used it to push a gun control agenda. And that's why I started speaking out because I wanted to represent the other side of stone douglas who doesn't believe in gun control.

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       Yeah. So just tell me a little bit about you in high school before this. Like we've jumped a lot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What, what, what was kyle? Because you have like before this, because I know you sort of as a political beast now and like a wickedly incisive twitter and like, you know, you've put on events that I've been part of and I, and you're incredibly organized and connecting with great people and all that stuff which is telling you about the kid. Before that,

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       I'll give you all the recap. Give me the story of my life story. Let's go. Yeah. So, uh, so my parents came from Israel. They immigrated here. My Dad, my mom served in the IDF. They came here, there's nothing worked their way up. And then when I was, when I was at home they taught me Hebrew and English. So we only spoke Hebrew at home so I'm fluent Hebrew and they put me through school and I was always the shortest kid in the grade. So I was like always like I was just like, even shorter than the shortest girl in my grade. I was like super short and like, what was it like in like eighth grade? I was four foot eight, I was like legally it in eighth grade. So I'll, I got bullied a lot. Like I try not to have a victim hood mentality because I don't think it's successful and I think you agree with me on that.

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       Um, so it was always bullied and I was always, I was always smart so that Kinda went back on me a little bit, but I was always put a lot and it built up my self esteem. In addition, I was always like taking the hardest classes. My parents would always push me to take the hardest classes possible. Um, so at Douglas, before all this, uh, you know, as someone who I had a good social life, uh, so I would basically, I would go to school, do my ap classes, go home, play video games, so like 10, 10:00 PM, start homework to like start homework, you know, and then finish it at 2:00 AM and then have like five hours of sleep. So that was my cycle was terrible. But I was super addicted to video games and then the shooting happens and just turned my entire life upside down. So it just completely changed me. So at that moment, you know, I had to become much more mature. I had, I was living in the adult world, you know, I had responsibilities. There are things that had to do, you know, I had to act a proper certain way and you know, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       did you have any particular political beliefs before all this because you're definitely in terms of at least the kids or the young people that are public about all of this now that have come out of snowmen. Douglas. I mean, you definitely are the one that seemed, at least that I know of is, is the furthest right that is sort of embraced conservatism and all that did. Is that where you were politically to hear that?

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       They not about me. My parents aren't political at all whatsoever. So all my political beliefs I have developed myself and how I develop every single political belief is just I look at it straight from a rational, logical point of view with no emotions whatsoever. I think you can guess I'm not an emotional person, so like I think with, with legislative decisions, you have to put a motion as far out of it as possible. You have to do policies that, that actually solve the problem, not just make you feel good. So I'm really not a, not for feel good policies.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       You care about politics at all before any of this or is this new?

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       Yeah, I didn't care either. The 2016 election I was, I was somewhat into it after the election I kind of didn't care as much, but I was always somewhat of a second amendment supporter. Um, yeah, but when I, when I started speaking out, so it's really interesting. When I started speaking out a, it was like a tidal wave of opposition, you know, I had, my school was against me. Someone seemed like that, you know, all my peers were against me and I try not to do a victim mentality. I just want to paint the picture of how it actually was. And it seemed like the community, the mainstream media and my friends, you know, it seemed like I was going against every single opposition, you know, I was scared like this could, this could have ruined my life, but, you know, I believed in what I was doing and I just power through it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:03       Uh, and, and just really, I just stuck to my beliefs and didn't let anyone tell me otherwise because, you know, when I was. So when I was in Tallahassee, uh, when they were pushing Republican legislators to enact gun control legislation, I said, look, gun control isn't going to solve the problem. I want to solve the problem. Okay, I want to make sure that school school shootings never happened. What can I do to actually make that happen? And what can I do while protecting the second amendment? Because I actually believe it's one of those fundamental rights of Americans. So while I was there, I started speaking out and nobody cared, like APP. I would go to reporters and nobody cared. So I had to forcefully know, like talk to reporters, say, hey look, I'm a conservative. Can I reach out? And then I managed to get a Leland Vitor, a contact with Louis that are at Fox and I want them Fox and I did an interview and then Ben Shapiro psy and it blew off. But all the wild. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       That's the first time I remember seeing.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Yeah. And all the while there's this extreme opposition and the entire thing that I've, I've always had. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       Well I just wanted to. What do you, because I know you, you kind of mock the media the way I do now on, on twitter and just sort of what mainstream media has become and that they really activists and journalists and that whole thing. Um, but were you shocked when you were going up to them and going, you know, I'm a conservative or I want to defend the second amendment, but I'm a student from this school and they're just blatantly ignoring you. Or even. I know this is minor, but like I remember when a bunch of you guys were all verified on twitter. It was with instagram as well. It took me like three months after everyone else. Yeah. And I'm not saying that, that it doesn't really mean it doesn't matter in and of itself, but it is, it is a symptom of sort of the broader situation going on here with tech companies and media and all that. Like were they flat out ignoring you? You saw them interviewing people. And then. So here's here, here's what occurred,

Speaker 2:          00:10:52       uh, the main organizers of that, that you can recruit a solid group of, like the march for our live kids. At this point they had solidified a click and they wouldn't let anyone new or with a different opposing view into it. So I said I had to take matters into my own hand. In addition, we were in Tallahassee. I realized that the mainstream media is just doing this for clicks because can we think about it when shooting occurs? And the mainstream media loves it. Like they get great coverage, they get great amount of views, they do. Um, I'll switch, I'll talk to like notoriety in addition after this. But I saw that when someone, there was a girl crying and Tallahassee and the second she cried just, she got sworn by reporters. And I saw that they were just looking for clicks and for headlines and I realize that they're really, they're not reading it for the right reasons and they're not gonna listen to a rational or irrational young kid like me.

Speaker 2:          00:11:44       Okay. So in addition, I also realized that there was an extreme amount of just. People were just getting benefiting off of this so much. I'm so the shooting when you realized that a lot of this occurred because the shooter, who I, I try not to say his name ever because I think that gives them to notarize them. They, they, they would, they would post. So here's what time did. So the video of the shooter were basically says, you know, I'm going to be the next school shooter of Twenty Eighteen, I want 20 people. And he basically says, you're all going to see me on the news. So. And then Time magazine puts this video up on Youtube. It gets three point 6 million views. The same thing with all the other videos. You know, CNN talked about this exact clip and basically just still showed it on air. Yeah. So the entire thing with the mainstream media is doing is that they're basically, they're just benefiting off the situation and what they don't realize that they're perpetuating the issue and making it worse. That's why I think daily wire of Ben is doing a great decision with not showing their names and faces because it's an ethical decision. No, I don't think government should impose on, on, on the mainstream media to not allow the show their faces. But I think it's an ethical and moral decisions that people should be taking up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       Yeah. So just to be totally clear. So after this shooting, that was when Ben announced he's the editor of wired, they are no longer going to show their name days after. Yeah. So okay. So you started to see this, this issue with the media that they're ignoring people like you and they're sort of making other people stars and they're going for the clicks and all of that. What about, you know, I don't want to make this about people per se, but so that, that little click of of kids that then was all over the media and was getting retweeted by every celebrity and all of that. Were you trying to reach out to them at all and just have that discussion or was it just very clear?

Speaker 2:          00:13:27       Oh No, I still try to have that discussion. You know, when they first started speaking I said, oh my God, that's great. Someone speaking out. And originally when the movement started speed, when it started, you know, remember Cameron Caskey was on, on the car shouting the movement wasn't an Antiguan movement. It was an anti school shooting. And I said, hey guys, this is quickly. I just, I was like, I gave him the morning guys, it looks like you're moving through the direction of an anti gun movement and I don't think that's beneficial at all. So here's my point of view. I tried communicating and I, and I tried speaking on and they really didn't care in allowing me. So I said, okay, I have to go solo. And that's what I've been doing, but I've, I've always been open to discussion and open debate. I think it was one of the great things that we're a country where you can have, you know, open discussion, uh, and just free expression of ideas. That's why I think the Kanye thing is somewhat great because regardless of what you think of the person or celebrity, um, I'm, I'm not, I'm not in favor of propping up celebrities and their political opinion simply because they're famous. But you don't need a lot of political expertise to say that I believe in free expression, free thought,

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       right? That's, that shouldn't be a really controversial position to be, to be staking out. Alright. So you mentioned cameron and you know, I had them on the show a couple of weeks ago. He's going through a very interesting evolution right now. I suspect I can figure out where this is going to end up, which actually be much closer to your position than the position that he sort of at right now. Because I just continually see that as the evolution of things. The more that he understands rights and all of those things, but I was happy to hear his thoughts and all that and he sat down with me. He sat down with Shapiro and I think you'll continue to do that. Um, have you guys been able to make any piece with some of this stuff or you must at least be enjoying the fact that somebody kind of coming around?

Speaker 2:          00:15:09       No, I think. I think Cam's a good guy. I think that what we're seeing right now is that he's matured. I mean we've all made so and cam have gone through like the same political slash media experience so we can understand each other. What happened with came as like, look, we've all made mistakes. We've all said stuff we don't want to, but he's matured and I've also matured a. and what I see, what I think is happening with Cam, it's a natural progression of just having logical thought instead of emotions. And I think logic and facts moves you towards the political beliefs of being a conservative.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       Okay. So all of this happens. I think the, the sort of rock bottom of this was that CNN town hall. That was terrible. Yeah. Just share your thoughts on that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       So here's what happened with the CNN town hall. So a lot of the kids that you saw there were actually flown in on a private jet from Tallahassee. So already at the time of the town hall there was a solidified group click of, of the kids that you see now, and they won't let anything until they actually flew these kids on a private jet from Tallahassee to the town hall. And right there it was, it was just simply,

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       they were just the, it was an anti gun debate and they were just villainizing Rubio in Dana lasts for things that had nothing into their control whatsoever. It wasn't their fault. And Marco Rubio was villainized to such an extreme extent and he's one of the best senators. Uh, so you've now connected with Rubio. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I hate it because when people say that politicians just don't care. It's just so wrong. I mean, politicians, they do care. Um, and you know, he was one of the greatest supporters of the school violence act that we got passed, um, and you just helped push it and look, these senators don't want this to occur. Kenny was and just saying, the politicians want this to happen. It's just wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       Do you have any thoughts on what actually happened that day in terms of security or what should have happened or should've or shouldn't have happened? Because even now when you go back and listen, depending on where you're getting your news from this, it sounds, you know, they either step down or they didn't go in or this or that or the other thing. And it's like, well, well, what, what should have happened in the ideal world that you want to create in the system that you want to create to protect this, these schools from not having this happen again? Um, what, what should it happen that day?

Speaker 2:          00:17:29       What we saw at my school was simply an utterly just massive and competence and failure of law enforcement. You know, the, the. So the shooter was flagged multiple times by the school, by the school administration. They knew he had mental issues. He was put into the promise program, um, and knew that this kid was a threat. There were 76 times the police. There were 76 times the police came to his house, the retreat, FBI reports, they knew that this kid was a threat and the law enforcement was completely incompetent at that level and they didn't do absolutely anything. Everyone knew this kid was an issue. What happened at school was, was just utter incompetence in addition. So when he gets on campus, okay, you just make a straight beeline for the freshman building and at the exact same time we had a school resource officer who, who, who heard the gunfire and came and he just hid in a corner while kids were dying.

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       And then three unarmed individuals rushed to save at three. Oh, three on our went to the building and died trying to save kids. What we should have had, and this is why I pushed for it, the only way to stop a shooter who is active on campus is to have other people who are armed. The only way to stop, it's not a cliche that you only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, and in addition to that, there's the entire idea of a gun free gun free zone. It is utterly stupid. It is just completely stupid. All it's doing is enticing. A target saying, look, you go here, so here's, here's what's the school? The average response time from police station to a school nationally is 15 minutes. The average time a school shooting happens is five minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       That means the shooter has 15 minutes to do whatever he wants. If the school is a gun free zone, so here's what I'm saying, at least allow teachers who have gone to the proper training, you know, ex military ex law enforcement to be armed because what that does is it sends not only a message as a deterrent to a shooter that says, look, this school is armed. If you get in here, your brains are going to be blown out. It also says that that the school is in a gun. Free School is no longer a gun free zone. So I'm, I'm with you partly on that. So what I would, maybe maybe you can explain this a little bit further so I don't know that I want guns in those classrooms even if it's. So here's the license usage. I think there are 25 states where teachers can be armed or not armed in schools and all the hypotheticals that are pronounced.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       It's like, you know what, if a teacher shoots a student when there's another like, like what if there's a school shooter and a teacher gets shot and there was a gun on the floor. What does a student do? It's these hypotheticals don't happen. 20 five states where teachers are already armed and it works. So why not just have them have security guards at specific? So here's the thing, I'm all for having security guards. This entire issue is how do we best manage our funds? Insecure our schools. The thing with law enforcement officers that they cost a lot of money and impoverished schools are ready need that funding for materials. And in addition, it does not take a lot of training and a lot of money to have a teacher to be armed. And this has already been proven to work in an initiative when you have teachers who are armed, the shooter doesn't know who it, if you, if it's a law enforcement officer, you can clearly see who it is.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       So if you've one resource officer, school resource officer who's armed, the shooter comes and takes out the school resource officer and then they're free to do whatever, but it's simply. So here's the thing, simply giving teachers to have the opportunity has a massive effect because it's up to their own will to do so they have to go through training and they have to. It's a concealed carry. So nobody knows they have them. So as you said before, you like facts and logic. Okay? Yeah. Strictly facts. Facts don't care about your feelings. All right, I got you. That, that, that works. When you've engaged some of your friends and other students about these ideas. I mean, everyone watching this at this point knows that so much of what's coming out of the modern left is about feelings and all of these things. Do you have a sense that they understand that young people, at least the ones you're talking to understand like, what rights are, what, why, why we should care about these things, why free speech matters, why the second amendment matters and things of that nature.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       So, or does it all just sound good to them? And there's a, that's pretty much it. It makes them feel good. You know, what they push and makes them feel good by their emotions. That makes sense. So here's the thing, I am very scared of lowering the age for people to vote to be 15. Like that scares me because the kids that I know who are 15 know absolutely nothing about politics. I think I know like the kids from the march for our lives better than I think I know their own arguments better than they know their own arguments. Like I can argue for them better than they can do. So I strictly use facts only. Um, so when I make an argument with them, I cannot really know what they're going to do next. So here's how I'll give you like a 10 minute or five minute recap.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       Basically how I premise the second amendment argument in America, we have the right to bear arms in DC versus Heller that rule that an individual's right to arms. It doesn't mean the militia, the militia clause is different from the individual, right to bear arms. That means that you personally have the right to arm yourself. Okay? There are about 270 million guns in the United States. Fifty dollars million. Those are air fifteens. So we look at the guns sets are 33,000 annual gun deaths, 66 percent. So two thirds are suicides. So leaves us with 11,000 gun deaths a. So we have to. So in addition to put in parentheses, there's a difference in a homicide and a murder. So homicide is, is just a killing murders and unlawful killing and gun stats. A lot of them like to perverse this into skew statistics. So three percent of all gun deaths are with rifles.

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       Okay? And in that three percent, 68 percent of those are suicides. So one percent of all gun that's are actual murders are actually. Sorry. Yeah, we're actually murders with rifles. A 80 percent of all gun crime related activity is with illegal firearms, a most schools, most shootings or with pistols. So. So march for life was five bullet points. One of them is like, I don't like to talk about the CDC and we should allow the CDC to research. The issue with that is the CDC has already proven to skew statistics and, and to not actually provide good research. What research is it that they want? So the CDC used to be able to do research on gun violence prevention and just figure out what's going on. But it's been proven time and time again that they screw their statistics. So the Fargo and was like, no, we're not allowing you to penetrate a false myth, a myth.

Speaker 2:          00:24:04       So basically they stopped funding. The next thing is that they want high capacity magazines. Uh, there is no distinction there. There was no difference. That shows that high capacity magazines, whatever that means, can do more damage than simply having more like clips. I'm just having smaller, having larger clips, but less of them. There's no distinction that actually does more damage to the next thing that they want to do is band semiauto rifles. As I've said before, only three percent of all gun deaths are with rifles. So banning them does absolutely nothing addressing the issue in lowering a gun. Violence is making sure that we have, uh, uh, making sure that we have more people who are armed because there's a direct correlation, not causation, but correlation that when we increase farm, um, ownership and concealed carry permits in addition, um, violent crime goes down. So the next thing that I'd like to propose is what about Great Britain and Australia?

Speaker 2:          00:24:54       So in Great Britain there was a, there's a ban on guns and immediately after violent crime spiked. And in addition, you have armed robberies increased. So violent crime increased immediately after and burglaries in Great Britain, 60 percent of them occur when the individuals at home versus 13 percent of the US. So burglars have admitted that they do this because they know that the person will have like the purse or whatever, and they won't, there'll be on arm. So violent crime spike. The next thing is they say, hey, Kyla, what about the Australian gun by program? So already in Australia when the program was initiated, there was already statistical zero, uh, for, uh, you know, gun death and public mass public school shootings. Um, so in addition, when the buyback gets implemented there already, we're like the millions, millions less guns in Australia than there were now. So the gun buyback grows in, only one third of guns get taken.

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       And when we saw immediately after the buyback was that violent crime spiked. So here's just the basic argument, there is not been one single occurrence where gun control gets passed and, and, and gun deaths, no gun homicides actually decreases at a faster rate. In Australia, the gun, the homicide rate was already decreasing at a really good rate. It gets passed gun control and the rate stalls. So it actually hurt an addition immediately after it was passed to violent crime rates go up. And the national trend was going down, so the gun buyback program was completely ineffective, did absolutely nothing, and then it failed on such a huge level in Australia that implementing it in the US with 270 million guns simply won't work. All right, so let's shift the discussion a little bit to the NRA because that was the other part of this that during the town hall and the subsequent discussions

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       that it got very confused as to what the NRA actually does. What do they want to do? What are their people who don't like them, think they do, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, so first off, just give me your position on the NRA general.

Speaker 2:          00:26:59       I think the NRA is a fantastic organization that defends the rights, the right to bear arms of individuals. Thing with the NRA is that they really don't have the money influence that people say they do. All they have is the social influence. Republican senators know that the base believes in the values that the NRA promotes and defense. And they understand that. And if they go against the NRA, they're going against their own constituents. The NRA does not have a big budget. They really don't. They're not like this super powerful like that. They directly control senators and congressmen with their money. They control with their ideals. What the NRA does, which is fantastic, is it provides a check from the, from the public, not from the government for defending our right to bear arms and it's fantastic. You know, it helped I think with the case with Mcdonald's for Chicago that helped bolster a second amendment rights for individuals.

Speaker 2:          00:27:54       I mean, and the NRA does just does a great job. They're NRA Ila program, which is actually the legislative branch on defending the second amendment, does a fantastic job. I think right now they're taking a case against raising the age from 18 to 21. There was right for the shooting of Rick Scott signed into law in Florida, raising the age to buy, I think a firearm or rifle now. So before, before, uh, you couldn't buy a handgun if you're under 21, but you could buy a rifle because handguns were used in violent crimes. Whether I think that's right or not, that's a separate discussion. But he raised the age from 18, 21 to buy a rifle and directly the NRA was like, this is unconstitutional. Boom. We put it in the lawsuit just to address that. Eighteen to 21 age. Uh, there is absolutely no evidence that raising the age does absolutely. Does, does anything to, uh, to lower, um, gun homicide whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       So what do you think about the certain set of people that think that if we could just have all of the right laws or if we could just manage everything properly, that everything would be fine because he doesn't take into fingers. We have a ball.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       All the laws that we need already on the books as thing, as the enforcement doesn't work. So I'll just make a tangent. I'll get back to here. I think it is utterly hypocritical that the left hates trump and they, that he's in power, but then they're saying we have to trust they cover more. So if you think the government, if you think trump is literally Hitler, why are you giving away your right to bear arms to this tyrannical government? Um, it was the question again.

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       Well, just that there's a certain set of people that think if we,

Speaker 2:          00:29:20       I got you. So we already have the, the laws on the books, you know, just the enforcement and the enforcement of what needs to occur. Like the Lautenberg amendment means that domain, it says that domestic abusers cannot have a firearm that's already on the books. It just needs to be enforced. There's the issue with um, you know, the nics background check program where they say we need more time to, to evaluate and give you back your background check in order to buy a weapon. The issue is the government doesn't need more time, it just needs more of the records. So the reason why the Texas oil and shooting occurred was because I think it was some military brands where there was someone where he, he committed a violation and by law they sh the heat. They should have transferred that over to the database and there, if we wouldn't have been able to buy a weapon, but the records weren't transferred.

Speaker 2:          00:30:05       He was able to buy a weapon and he shot up the church. So the government just needs to get all the records and do their job. Same thing with red flag laws, um, and people like to talk about this. This is a little bit more of the trickier areas of this, but red flag laws basically say that someone can flag you and then you get reviewed and then you can get your gun taken away. And a lot of people also like. So the issue with red flag gun laws is that it's all about government enforcement and, and that's, that's the issue. And there's also the big issue where people like to talk about mental health and they say you're mentally ill, people shouldn't be able to acquire weapon. So I have talked to countless individuals about this and I should ask Peterson but I forgot to. The question is how do you determine when someone is mentally ill enough and hits the threshold so they cannot have a weapon and nobody knows. And in addition to things with the shooter at my school looking retroactively, we can say this kid was mentally insane, but I don't know if a court would adjudicate that. He would actually be mentally insane by by law, therefore taking his gun away.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       Yeah. So is the inherent problem here. Do you think that you cannot manage all of these things? You can do the best you can to have some sensible laws around them and defend our right to bear arms and all of that and make sure schools are taken care of, but that generally speaking, yes, there's a sort of sliding scale psychologically, but also that the people that want to do bad, we'll find ways to do bad. They're not the ones that are walking out and looking at a building and it says, oh no guns here, so not going to walk in with a gun.

Speaker 2:          00:31:36       Criminals will act like criminals no matter what, but the good thing is that our laws are working. I mean, I think it's violent crime or some rate from the 1998 to 2010 has decreased by 50 percent and and pub in schools are safer now than they were 20 years ago. Like school shooting rates are declining and homicide, right? Gun homicide rates are declining in the homicide rates are declining. So we're becoming a more peaceful nation and a lot of that has to do with having more gun owners and to having more concealed carry permit owners because those people, when when there's a shooting, those people are the first responders. I think it's wrong to say that. Oh well we'll just let the police arrive after the crime has been committed. No, you need people there immediately to stop the shooter. That's why I'm all for having teachers and arm school officers at schools to immediately take down the shooter.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       All right, so let's shift. I mean, I don't think we're going to fully get away from guns here, but let's shift a little bit. Okay. What is it like to be a 17 year old right now that's in the mix of this? That's now a public person. Crazy. Yeah. To just be part of this, this oddly unique time where it feels like the adults have lost the plot and it's got to be very hard for you to find people that kind of makes sense. I think you've been able to find a couple of them, but just to be 17 in this very odd political cultural time. It's insane. Like what does it feel unique to you? I know you haven't lived through this before, but like

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       they don't know how to judge it. All I know is that I'm an adult now and I have to act like an adult, whether whether I'm 17 or 18, I have committed like commitments that I make. I have to go through with them and I've just. My immaturity, I was forced to become mature. Like I can no longer play video games and waste time. There's things that I have to do but I've just been so blessed to find a solid group of people who actually care about me and want the best for me. Like, like Ben and Charlie Guy, Benson. People who have just reached out to me and I'm just selflessly helped me navigate this political minefield. But it's crazy [inaudible] like all the people that I looked up to like two years ago and like watch their videos, like not gonna snack, trying to like boost your ego here.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       But I used to, I would watch her show, please continue, but yeah, it's awesome that now I can reach out for their expertise. The thing with me is that I always like to start with, look, I don't know anything and I'm always looking to get more information to know more. Like today I had a call with a gun expert. I'm on the way here and it's like, what more can I learn in order to be like fully fluent and, and knowledgeable about the subject that I'm talking about and there are a bunch of stuff that I don't know about and I'm constantly trying to learn.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       So when you see a guy, and again I don't like making this about people rather than ideas, but when you see a guy like David Hogg out there and he clearly is taking just the progressive line on this and he seems more to me to be sort of a progressive activists than sort of a, a fair arbiter of what's going on here. Um, that's gotta be frustrating for you that he's so public about this. I suppose so. Well that you obviously probably disagree with him on on 100 percent of the policy parts. This is true. Yeah. I don't want to make it about the personal part, but that he's thought of as sort of a media hero and you're kind of the black sheep of this group. I mean maybe not to the, to the Shapiros and me and whoever else.

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       Yeah. So here's what I say. There is no issue that kids are on television. The issue is is that when someone is spouting policy that they are no longer a child, they are pushing policy and they should be treated as every adult does such when you say something outrageous, you should be called out on that. Remember there's a segment with you. It was on cnn where he said something completely outlandish a and there was no blowback Solo.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Well, I think it was that the line Marco Rubio wants to kill kids or something.

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       That's crazy. Yeah. So what I say is when I'm pushing policy and I say thanks to the police, like tell me that I'm saying something stupid and pushed me back on that. The thing is with me that look when I'm on TV, I'm not talking as a child and pushing policy, right. And I expect there to be pushed back. I don't think you can say whatever you want like and in addition, I think that having debate is great. So like I love, I love going on piers Morgan and having a debate with that was great and I think we have to. I hate this thing where like we're, we're one second you're spouting policy, but then you rushed back to the Dust Shield of Oh, I'm a child, but we have to take my opinion seriously because the second I said I'm an adult, so just, just this isn't, this isn't fair. And what I saw, I think one of the reasons why I grew to such publicity was because I was saying the things that adults weren't able to say. Like I was able to say things that Ben Shapiro or you or Charlie Kirk or the right wasn't able to say because I'm a kid and I don't think that's fair. Because I think that when you're spouting policy, you are no longer a child. You're an adult,

Speaker 1:          00:36:46       what do you make of what's going on with the right generally because you ran the turning point. Was that the high school event that I did? I've done so many scholarships on you. Okay. So you did the high school leadership summit in DC and I spoke there. This is a couple of months ago and you had a great lineup of speakers and Peter till is there and you had big, big time politicians and, and first off, I mean that was the first time we met and I was like, Holy Shit. We just debate about abortion. Abortion. Exactly. So that's my point. So first of all, you, you, you ran this whole thing. I mean you're, you're, you're still in high school, right? We're going to talk a little bit about where you want to go to college and all that, but you ran an incredible event with major prime time people and, and it was, it was jam packed and it was a diverse in terms of ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:37:28       So we get into a private debate about abortion, but you brought me there. Uh, and I went up there. Thanks. But I, I went up there and I talked about my differences with this group I talked about and the kids were respectful and I talked about gay marriage and abortion and death penalty in a couple of other things that generally these young conservatives are not for. I think gay marriage there pretty much for. I hope that the ship has sailed on that one actually. I'm pretty sure I got a huge ovation on that. Um, but it is just clear to me that there has been a realignment on the right where there is exactly what you're talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       Can we just say that Lindsey Graham? Two point. Oh is fantastic.

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       No, the guy. It's unbelievable that, I mean, just that one thing with the tie the daily caller. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:38:14       So I think the rightest finally realizing that youth, um, and like energizing the youth and instilling the next future of conservative leaders is extremely important. And we saw that with the high school leadership summit. We had some of the biggest names speak like Nikki Haley. That's advice we'd like turning jeff sessions we had so people. And every week we had Mark Meadows. We had Steve scully's, we had, we had, we had prager u and it was just, it was fantastic to see the right. Just understand that these are the leaders of tomorrow, let's inform them, but in addition, turning point is such a great organization. It's free speech, free markets and capitalism. Those are the three legs. Uh, and what we saw with turning point is such a, it's such a great organization because we were, we brought people who I have disagreements with to speak there. Mark Cuban spoke, got a couple standing ovations, had a debate with Charlie and people loved it. So we're all open having free discussion and debate. Like we're, we're, we're working on sassal shooting action summit, December 19, 20 seconds, shameless plug. And we're, we're looking like how can we get the most diverse group of people to speak? Like I'm thinking about something from the intellectual dark web to speak there. I think it's great if we can get Alan Dershowitz just how can we get diversity of thought?

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       So why is it that these new right or whatever you want to call it, young conservative group, whatever it is. Why is it that you guys are able to do this and I see virtually none of this

Speaker 2:          00:39:48       on your counterparts on the left. That's not true. I mean the left has organize and mobilize youth dish right now.

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       Well, I mean, no, no, no, but I'm talking about diversity of thought. Like where are they bringing a mildly disagree with. I'm not talking about scary conservatives. I'm talking about old school liberals were. Where are they inviting them to just have an interesting conversation. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       Just so dead set on political correctness and saying everything to not offend anyone with the slightest micro micro micro aggression that is just. You can't live in that world and and tall like logical liberals like yourself are moving

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       to the right. These subtle little injections of pleasantry yeah, that's nice. Are moving people to the

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       right and conservatives are like, come here, my. He is. My political refugees were embracing you.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Yeah. So. Okay. So when I hear people will say, Ruben, the conservatives are just using you. You go to turning point. They were just using you.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       You're not just using Mikael. No, I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       no, no, but really, I mean what I've seen is intellectual flexibility there and it's even when I've had been in here and we've done this conversation repeatedly now about gay marriage, I just firmly believe that as time goes on I can shift him. I, there's something that's sort of insulting about it to me. When people say that to me because I'm confident, I'm confident enough in my,

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       he's going to take you on abortion. I really think that like in a few years you'll be with us on a board

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       mean maybe, but you know what? That would be a trade off, right? Like if, if, if ultimately I always described myself as begrudgingly

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       of of homosexuality. While I don't, I don't, I don't have a strong opinion on it because I haven't thought about it enough. By his religious standpoint. It makes sense, but from the government standpoint, it also makes total sense.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       Well, that's why I'm completely fine with him. It's like you want to have your religious. I have to respect that, but if you are trying to legislate,

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       the great thing with the right is that we're open to this diversity of thought. Just say whatever you want, let's talk about it and let's get to the right rational viewpoint. Like I've, I've always been about the bait because it brings people, it's all about logic and it brings people to the right end result.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       So when I'm on tour with Peterson, a w, the question that I think both of us get asked more than anything else is, what are the best techniques to wake people up out of this sort of postmodern identity, politics, progressive group. Think as a young person in the midst of this, what would you say are some techniques you've been able to use? Because it can't just be about drubbing them with facts,

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       right? I mean, the left is doing a fantastic job with. They're just craziness and pushing people to the right. So it's just sort of doing it on himself. Um, well what we saw right now with canyon and in addition, it's just, he was simply saying, freedom of expression, freedom of thought. I support the president. Our president has to be the freshest, the flies thoughts. I'm just pushing people to diversity of thought and freedom of expression to think whatever you want you shouldn't have. You shouldn't be held down by your skin color or your race or your sexuality. Like none of this matters. You should be able to think what you want and be able to say it without being tied down by you know, your identity.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       Yeah. How do you make sure that you don't get burned out? Because I think I remember the first communication we ever had. I think when either you followed me or I followed you on twitter. I just sent you a quick one line note and I was just like, just don't get burned out because I saw you just. You were in the fight everyday. You were, you were owning, owning the libs and all that. Which by the way, you know, you mentioned that Nikki Haley was at your summit and she went, she went to to, you know, in effect, what is a, a lot of trump people right at this, at this event you put on. She goes there and she says, you know, don't make this about just owning the libs and she got applause for it and I, I hit that same point I think the next day because I think if you guys do exactly what you just laid out, just kind of stand there. It would be cool and be decent. You'll, you will welcome a lot of them.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       Well, I think, I honestly believe that decency wins. Can we just take a second and that Nikki Haley is fantastic and I, I, I kind of cried for like a week ever since.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       What do you think that this is perhaps a paving the road for her running at some point?

Speaker 2:          00:43:54       I don't know. There's so many 40 chests, like theories. I just know I just, I know that she's just been doing a fantastic job and she's just one of the best. I know Nikki Haley. Ben Shapiro. Twenty 24.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       Yeah, I mean I'd probably have to be press secretary at that point. Yeah, that would work for like one horrific week and then. No, that'd be fine. I should do. All right. So gimme, Gimme some of the techniques when you see that it can't just be about standing still and, and facts if you're, if you're in a conversation with a young person that's really just bought into all of this, what are some of the techniques you used? Have you been successful? I suspect that you sometimes. Yeah, I think I have. The first thing you

Speaker 2:          00:44:31       have to realize is that is this person looking cap and open discussion and actually wants. Sorry about that. Talking a lot these days. It's all right. I know it's too much or, or actually wants to develop their point of view. If they do, you have to treat it with decency and respect and not call them an idiot or something. You have to treat them like a, like a good human being should, um, and then just have a rational conversation with them and see where they're coming from. A and a lot of times I can immediately know what they're going to respond to me like just straight off the bat, I know what they're gonna respond to me and I hit them with, with an initial, here's what you're gonna say, here's the reason. And they're just shocked. But then do you get them around? I mean do, do you find because it really, it's like sort of deprogramming somebody out of this and I've had some success at it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       Right. And a lot of them have watched my show now. So yeah, I mean when I first heard speaking out, kids would come up to me in school and two things they would say it'd be like, Kyla, I'm a conservative. So, so the thing about school is really interesting. I wouldn't get stare downs and like people would like try to beat me up so people would like send me like, hey kyle, watch out. So and so trying to beat you up. I was like, all right man, go for it. Okay. Um, and people would give me stare downs and there was such villainization of being conservative being second amendment supporter. When I spoke up I kind of opened the crack for people to say, Oh, I agree with him. People would walk up to me and like caught up like, Kyle, thank you so much for doing.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       I'm just scared to speak out. And in addition people say, Kyle, I thought I was pro gun control and you spoke and I listened to you and then I did some more research and I agree with you. So that was great to see it. And like that's just, that's all I'm here for. So to have people, you know, understand conservatism and understand the second amendment, it's got to be pretty weird that you guys are still in high school, right? Like now you're your celebrities in the most strange sense of celebrity you are and your role still in high school together. What is that like? I mean, at the end of the day we have to remember that we're kids and I will explain it to you guys. Don't think I'm hypocritical. Um, when you're on TV and you're spouting politics during adult but in your private life you were a kid and we cannot forget that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       So let's say, you know, when someone, some kid on the left does something stupid. It's at the end day, they're a kid and we have to address it as such, um, but, but it's, it's been a crazy world when and I think, thank God I found a solid group of people who want the best for me that I can reach out, you know, just not for policy, but it's also like personal advice. Like I, I, uh, I asked Ben, Hey, how do you think I should approach college apps and some conservative, you know, and he helped me out and it's just, it's so great to be able to reach out to people and have them, you know, give you advice from like 20 years older than me and given me that advice that they had to go through the, what was that great tweet? So you're like number one in your class, right? Not like number one. You are number one, you're correct. There was some tweet that you had about that, that awesome. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       What was that

Speaker 2:          00:47:32       number one? Yeah. Um, and people got so angry, so angry and they're like, we're going to boycott graduation. So I was like, Yay. More cake. It was great. It was great. And then, you know, the next step, what was the reason they wanted to boycott because I was number one, so then the semester updated and then I was still number one. So I posted another tweet about that and then also blew up and I was like, we're going to get Ben Shapiro to come. Data Lash is gonna come. It's gonna be fantastic. Chris Cox was like, yeah, I'm going to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       Why would they want. I mean, is that really how sort of polarizing Lee crazy this has got at a high school level that just because they don't like. I mean you're your number one not by, by being more deemed. No until your number one out of clearly a lot of hard work and smarts and all that. You'd think that there would be certain respect for that in some alternative.

Speaker 2:          00:48:23       It's sad that we have, we are no longer able to be friends with people like it's sad that people on the left think so people on the left think that you're a Republican, therefore you're evil and that sad that you're not allowed to be friends with people who have different political viewpoints and you're like, my best friend is a liberal and I actually brought him to the turning point event and after it was like, you know, Kyle, some awesome people. And I was like, yeah, I told you. He still liberal. He's an old school. That's cool. These probably we're getting there. You and him both.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       All right, so wait, let's talk a little bit about college. So you're, you're doing a great job in high school. Clearly now you've got a public profile. Grades are great. Seemingly you could get in to wherever you want to go and do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So do you really think that that will play a role in, in the schools that you're able to get into?

Speaker 2:          00:49:15       Yeah, absolutely. It's sad to say, but, but there is a bias against conservative, especially like the top tier schools. Like right now I'm looking to apply to ivy's. It'd be great to get into Harvard or Columbia. I really think a man, you'd be the reckoning of those places. I really think it'd be awesome. I really think that. I think it's really important to be accredited. Um, you know, I might, I'm thinking about Georgetown or Gw to work on the hill. I think that's great. Um, but yeah, like I really, I really don't know what's next for me. I really don't go to college. I'm definitely going to stay with turning point. It's a great organization. I'm still going to be conservative. Don't worry. I'm not going to change to change.

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       People don't go the other way, right? You're not going to suddenly grow up and be like, no, no, no. I'll go to the feelings. Things that, that usually does, that won't happen. Yeah. But all right, so you want to go to school, but you. So you really do think that your, your politics could affect I guess. Well, what happened with David Hogg Right? He didn't get into to all, I don't know what his grades are, but like he didn't get into a whole bunch of schools. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       I mean there've been rumors that he got into Harvard. Northeastern, it wouldn't surprise me. Yeah. Yeah. And what do you want to study? You have any idea? It's either business or law. I really don't know yet. I just, you know, I, I've always liked business and I think law is just absolutely phenomenal. Really don't know yet. Uh, but you know, it's going to be great to be on a college campus where everyone is just really liberal. That'll be fun.

Speaker 1:          00:50:41       It's sort of weird and I guess this shows a little bit about the way the college experience is going, but in a bizarre way, just knowing you from the little bit that I know you, it's like in a way it's almost like you don't have to go to college like you. Well, I'm not saying you shouldn't and I think there's all sorts of social reasons that somebody should go and you can, you know, you learn in all sorts of other ways that aren't necessarily academic, but it's like clearly you've got the academic thing down and can keep learning that way. So it's, you know, it's bizarre that people spend, you know, 20 grand a year to go to college when no one thing is we're surrounded by a lot of great minds is what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       I'm with you. But the issue with colleges that you're basically paying to get, you're so brainwashed with stupidity and that's suck part because there were actual, like great things to learn in college. Just not like lesbian dance theory that says that a lot. Some of these classes are just useless and you know, and just, it's just straight up complete stupidity. A lot of the stuff that they're teaching there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       So what do you make of how this seems to be a through line through education and I mean high school education, college education. Clearly the media, like all of this sort of brainwashing stuff that you're talking about. It's always going against people like you and I see you on twitter, you take down cnn all the time, you take down main street all the time. People know my thoughts on this. It's like I just wish like to me, if these, we just address that twitter, just twitter's for fond and we have to stop taking twitter, associate your bio. Your bio is perfect. Twitter is not real life. It's not real life but pete. But the weird thing about that is it's starting to leak into real life. I did a direct message like a year and a half ago or so about how online culture is becoming mainstream culture and I think that that really is what's happening here. Twitter is not real life but it's starting to like leak out into everyone's conversation. So Fox News and CNN and MSNBC or basically trump's twitter, like twitter is like, you know, like have you seen shows where they basically read random replies to messages. It's like John Smith, three point seven, four for this like that. So

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       stupid. But the biggest thing that we're seeing right now is, is a cultural shift with the youth, like memes, memes have so much power in our lives matter. Memes, one, a lot of memes helped so much for the trumps 2016 campaign with it really did. Um, and social media has a huge influence on our beliefs and our actions and that's why it is so scary to see censorship of Conservatives online because that is basically like twitter is basically the new version of you just like yelling into a crowd and that's basically like the main form of everyone's communication and shutting that down. It's like heavily restricting, you know, I haven't developed my full opinion on this, but it seems as such restricting this restricts your, like really restricts your First Amendment, right?

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       Yeah. So this is the whole issue about whether they're publishers or platforms. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       Big issue. I don't know if I'm saying this right, but I think one of the things is if there are certain if there or if they're a published further than like they have a lot of legal liability. If they're a platform, then every everyone should say whatever they want, but that's not the case, so just pick one and they're just completely censoring conservatives. Like I know prager u gets like their videos demonetize so much and have your videos got demonetized? They probably,

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       yeah. Well now now it's gotten a little bit better, but our video is just don't go out to feeds anymore. I went on that rhythm. Yeah, that crazy rampage I went on where I just started retweeting real people. I only did it with real people with real names saying they'd been unsubscribed and they're getting hundreds and sometimes thousands of retweets and I'm tagging youtube and they just ignore me and it's like, come on guys. I mean you to play the game a little bit. Both facebook and twitter all have proven biases. Proven. Yeah. How worried are a. So it's really interesting to me because you never. You didn't grow up in a time when there was some sort of trustworthy, seemingly trustworthy level of the media. Like CNN was not always this. The reason I don't even know if you know this, but the the reason I think that so many people like me that are older than you attack cnn the most is cassina and used to be decent like msnbc saying, we lean left Fox and CNN saying that, and it's like, no, you're not. We know exactly what you're doing and that's why I always tax CNN because it's like you guys have actually become the worst.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       The ratings are like the lowest. It's like a block of read CNN. Yeah. So here's what I think. I think that a lot of young people and like an average Americans do not trust the media anymore and they have sought out individuals instead. So they trusted individuals. So they look to you, they look to Ben, they look to a Guy Benson, Charlie Kirk for, for their news because they trust the individual.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       Right. Do you see a great risk in that too? Because I'm worried about that.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       I also put. But the thing is with that is that you have absolute liability for what you say. You know, CNN can whip something up or you know, but when, when an individual like tweets something, it's on like they're responsible for their actions.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       Yeah. So one of the things I've been saying lately is that I'm actually in a bizarre way less interested in politics now than I've ever been, but I'm interested in what, you referenced it a little while ago, this culture thing. I mean culture, where does it cultures, politics is downstream from culture. Yeah. That's so true. Yeah. So do you see that really as a sort of the future of all this, that it's not going to be about all of the little machinations of politics, it's just going to be about. I mean this, I guess this is the strength of trump. Well, where you'd argue it's either the strength or the, the worst

Speaker 2:          00:56:23       part of trump. I suppose that's a cultural thing. Not necessarily a political thing. No, I mean there, there are pros and cons to that, but we just have to play by the rules that are set by society and these are the rules. These are rules that culture has a massive impact on society and whether I like it or not, that Kanye, Kanye speaking out. First of all, I think it's great to be speaking out to the First Amendment right. I don't think we should be propping up opinions by celebrities, siblings, because they're famous. You have to show that you are informed on the subject and that's that. But it doesn't take a political genius to say that I believe in our second amendment and our first amendment that doesn't take but Taylor swift doing like a 7,000 page essay, you know, that makes absolutely no sense and contradicts itself written by like a liberal, you know, a worker on the hill.

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       That's what I was disappointed in that just because I have no particular feelings about her when I don't care. I honestly don't think I could name one song or whatever, but it's just like the fact that she stayed out of politics. I liked, I was like, oh, whatever she's doing or whatever. Her handlers are saying to her, I kinda like it. And then she got in on this and it's like, I don't care which way she was going to break. I was just like, ah, this is not what we need.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       Yeah, I mean, Taylor swift effect president is like down Marsha Blackburn love. So thanks Taylor swift. No, but, but what we saw right now by the left is that they are losing their stranglehold on culture and that is very frightening for them. And we saw that with Connie and Connie started speaking out. I gave my speech about this and they started off with mob tactics that didn't work. Uh, emotional appeal. The TMZ guy was basically begging him like, Kanye, please men take, take off your hat, man. It hurts me emotionally. It was like, no, it's my first semester. I'm not taking it off. And then we saw just blatant racism, viola character, assassinations and disgusting. You wouldn't know that. That is. How does that fly? He wouldn't bow down to the mob. Absolutely wouldn't be, but no, they're losing their stranglehold on culture. And whether I like that we are putting so much emphasis on cultural icon.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       Those are the rules. The rules say that on twitter, a lot of rules, but this is, this is, this is the reality that we're living in and we have to understand that and what's happening with Kanye is a real shift, especially for African Americans and people who were like in Little Tinos. They're basically saying, I don't know why this controversial. Blackstone have to be Democrats. You don't own me. That's all. Basically, it's all he sang and he has created such like a pivotal moment that says, you're, you don't, you're stranglehold doesn't affect me because I know in Hollywood, like the second you say something like, I remember someone said, Ben Shapiro is a nice guy. His career was destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       Yeah. Mark Duplass, who's a friend of mine who's been on this show and he had to issue an apology and it's like, you know, oddly. Whereas the ID people, people came to his defense at first basically saying, you know, you should be allowed to say that.

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       Yeah. And then unfortunately he issued and black, especially young blacks are saying, look, they look up to Kanye west and the millions look up to him and they say, this individual, why does this individual think this way? And even more so he didn't bow down to the mob, which is fantastic. And we're seeing a real shift. I don't know the 38 percent number. We're 38 percent African American approval over trump. I don't know if that's necessarily true. All I know is that there was a three percent jump from there was in August. The black approval rating of trump was three percent. One of the last latest polls that I know month or so ago was 10 percent. So there's a big jump in, you know, we're seeing that so many young African Americans are so energized. Like I know turning point is doing a black leadership summit like a week in the White House.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       We're going to get just 400 African American young individuals to be able to speak their since table listen. And to see that the left is losing their stranglehold on culture. And it is scary for them because that is the one thing that they have left. All right, I got two more for you. All right. You are you in the prediction game at all? What do you think's going to happen in these midterms? We've got coming up. So what I've been hearing is that Republicans or lose it in the house and gain in the Senate. Uh, I love how your work has, is that we're going to win back the executive. These midterms are confused about but looks the cabinet effect is real. Like this was like the, all the left had to do was sit down, be quiet, be civil plaintiffs to like, no, no, this is, we're not going to allow this.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       Okay. And they hit themselves in the foot with the club and then there started crying. And then the same thing with Kanye. That was great. So the cabinet really amped up and energized the conservative base and even more so it finally gave the conservative like the conservatives a backbone, like Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham. Two point. Oh. Or is this skype in? I love it. And like bill cassidy. But, but here's the peers of the interesting thing. Women were the most angered by all of this. Before the cabinet in August, it was like a 35 point seven percent approval of trump after it was a 40 point seven. And then in August I'm the Democrats at a 12 point lead over republicans in a voter doozy. Asm. Now it's 64 percent republican, 65 Democrats. So we are neck and neck and they said it's all thanks to the Democrat.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       Yeah, I mean my gut. As long as you're doing predictions here, I actually think the Republicans that are do well in both the house and the Senate. I really hope so. But I do think so because I agree. I think this mob mentality and watching these videos of Antifa and Portland and Hillary saying we can't be civil and Eric holder saying below them and it's like, man, if you stand for due process and civil society and all of those things, that thing needs to burn it. It kind of sucks. But it's like that. That set of ideas

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       thinks the left just completely disregards the constitution. The constitution was written and in the amendment, Bill of rights was forced by anti federalists to make sure that the government cannot become tyrannical and abuse its power, and this is so important. It's protecting the rights of the individuals in these rights. Why? Why do we not all agree on them? Why is it wrong to believe nude process? Why is it wrong to say, I believe that individuals should have the right to defend themselves and also defend against the tyranny of a possible government. Look, second man was basically Britain because the founders had just fought against Great Britain and they had seen how a turntable government quickly become. So one more thing I didn't know. The first thing tyrannical government stay was they take away the weapons of the civilians. So it's Nazi Germany. We saw this in China, we saw this in in Cambodia. That's the first thing they do, and the individual right to bear arms is every individual is not related to the militia clause. So it's basically saying every individual has the right to protect themselves and even more so it's. It's necessary for the protection of a free state.

Speaker 1:          01:03:23       All right, one more for you. Hit me with you. Don't play video games as much because you don't have time. What do you do for fun, man? What's fun? I used to sites. Twitter. You can't just tell me twitter. I know you have to put it on twitter but it can't just be twitter. What are you doing for fun? So with me, I used to play a lot of video games. What kind of games? So here's, here's my progression. I haven't said this, but this is like a scoop tanks. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       Advent moved to to, to a rocket league. Okay. It's sockets. Terrible game. It's boring. Then it moved to, I played overwatch Paladins. I played pub g and I played for night and four nine. This was when the shooting occurred and I just stopped dead in my tracks because it was just, it's a waste of time and I see my younger brothers who were addicted to the game and it's just sad to see that this is the state of our youth, that they're just completely addicted to technology. Like, I'm sure if I have kids. Okay. They're not saying a phone till they're 12. You didn't ever. They do call me or nine slash 11. No video games or reading a book. I don't care.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       So what do you do for fun? You just told me what you used to do. Come on. You must be having fun somewhere. You're having fun sometimes. Wow. I got you. Yeah man did you're, you are having fun with this. I have some of them, um, of the

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       remaining friends that I have which are really solid friends on weekends we hang out, we go watch movies and stuff like that. In addition, I, I just think it's great. One of the greatest things for me for having funders, just simply talking to like minded kids, like young individuals at these turning point events that we run and it's great and like meeting with pushing policy and stuff like that. It's just fantastic. One of the greatest feelings ever was like passing the Stop School Violence Act and fixing nick's like the stops go. Ransack appropriated funds $2,000,000,000 in funds for the production of schools like hardening schools, metal detectors. I'm making better communication between law enforcement, training, law enforcement teachers and students. In addition, there was a clause that said none of this money will be used for firearm or firearm trainings. So this was like the greatest win for the left and they still hated the bill and like the march for life, kids hated it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:27       But no, I mean I'm really dead set on making sure that school shootings are a thing of the past. They never happened again. Uh, and you love what you do and just like, just learning about the second amendment and just like being more knowledgeable and having these debates and discussions are just like they really make my day. Well, I think it goes without saying. I mean, I think you have an absurdly bright future. Thank you. You're going to run for president or something? Probably not for, but you left a little window. No, I mean, I literally do navy. There's a thing, um, for politics and like the hill in the future. Right now I'm just dead set on going to college, getting my degree, learning, staying the political sphere. But uh, you know, who knows, I'm definitely supporting Nikki. Haley's Shapiro Twenty 24. All right. You see people there is hope for the future. For more on Kyle, follow him on twitter at Kyle [inaudible].
