Speaker 2:          00:05          In America, we tend to think that the news is all about us all the time. At some level, you really can't blame us though. Just turn on CNN or Fox News or Msnbc and all you get these days is endless election coverage with like a tiny bit of national news and maybe a minute, an hour on the international front. Occasionally when something big flairs up the talking heads, we'll focus on Syria or North Korea or Iran for a couple days, but then it's quickly back to the usual grind. Even when something huge like brexit is happening. We barely talk about it in the u s until the very last second when suddenly every pundit who hasn't mentioned it once in the past year is supposedly an expert beyond hearing about terror attacks, we barely even talk about the countries we have the most in common with. Once the initial response to the attack is over, has anything happened in the UK since brexit?

Speaker 2:          00:56          What's been happening in France since the Paris attacks? How are the toppest in Spain or the pasta in Italy or the cheese in Denmark? You might know and I might know, but I bet it's from alternative news sources and social media and not from mainstream television. The danger of only hearing about other countries when bad things happen like terror attacks, riots and scandals, is that you begin to think that's all that there is to these other places as well as the citizens that live there themselves. Imagine if other countries only associated Americans with our current election, many already do, and that is pretty Shitty, although possibly warranted every country on earth. Every single one has elements in it that are good and that are bad. This doesn't mean that every country or every culture is equal. Obviously this is not the case, but every country is made up of all sorts of people with all sorts of beliefs.

Speaker 2:          01:48          As I've said often on the show, the ultimate minorities, the individual judging an entire group as a collective, we'll almost always assure you, dismiss huge amounts of people who don't fit the stereotype or the narrative. I've said this before and I'll say it again and one of the things that I'm most proud of about the Ruben report is that our audience is truly worldwide. When we did our fan shore a couple of months ago, we got messages from people in over 60 countries. We chose people based on their individual attributes, not because we expected them to represent an entire nation. While our mainstream media does a pretty poor job of showing that we have more in common than what separates us, I find that people like you, the ones watching this right now do an incredibly good job of it. The conversations I see you having in the comments sections right here on twitter and on facebook or even on your own youtube videos are connecting people from all over the world.

Speaker 2:          02:41          I see you guys constantly trying to cut through the nonsense and have real conversations and find some common ground together is the only way that we'll have a chance to truly be hurt. My guest this week is Australian journalist Rida Panahi. Rita grew up in Iran in a Muslim family and emigrated to Australia. She was six years old. She's now a fierce defender of western values and spends much of her time writing about the same issues I talk about on this show. We're going to talk about her childhood in Iran as well as her life in Australia. Is there more to that giant island country than just boomerangs and Kangaroos? I suspect there might just be, to prove my earlier point, when was the last time you heard anything in the news about Australia since the terrorist attack in Sydney almost two years ago. They had a nationwide election about two months ago, but I think I only heard about that because of a random link on twitter. If you're watching this, you are, you've already shared much of the mainstream nonsense, but our work is still cut out for us. Let's keep talking to interesting people from all over the world and if you've got suggestions, well, there's a comment section right down below.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Rita Pinar, he is a journalist who was born in America, spent her first year is in Iran and has lived in Australia ever since. Rita, welcome to the Rubin report.

Speaker 3:          04:02          Thank you for having me. Greetings from Melbourne.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Greetings from Melbourne. Greetings from Los Angeles. I'm going to, I want to dive into some Australia stuff cause we never hear anything about Australia in America. I mean nothing since Crocodile Dundee too. We haven't heard anything from you guys. Uh, but let's start a little bit with your history. Cause you have a really interesting history. You were actually born in the United States, but you never lived in the United States. Correct.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:29          No, not really. I spent my first couple of years there. My parents were there, my dad was studying, he was, um, getting his degree in Arkansas. So I was born in, down in pine bluff, Arkansas. And then we moved back to the ranch was always the plan and then the Islamic revolution happened. So things went, pay shaped, you ran quite quickly. And we're sort of a trap now in a country that was entirely different to before the revolution. Um, and ended up in Australia. And I'm, I'm really grateful to be here really. So it's a wonderful place. I know you guys think America is the center of the world, but I really think Australia is that the lucky country as we call it and in any body can do well in this country.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Yeah. And I've heard you say that in speeches before that you really think Australia is the true place of tolerance and where everyone can come and make a better life and all that sort of stuff. So your parents, so they moved to, to the states that your, your dad was teaching or something. Right.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Okay.

Speaker 3:          05:28          Um, well when he was in the states, he was getting his degree, so he was at university and as soon as he graduated, they moved back. That was always the plan. Um, and uh, and then when you ran, went to hell, half of the Islamic Revolution, um, they started looking at how they could get at, cause uh, they, um, will fairly persecuted there and they, they, um, well it just wasn't safe. When we had family members walked up and sending them in, killed it, it was really hell on earth for our family. So we, um, we're looking to leave and the plan was always to come back to the states. Um, but my dad had a brother in Australia and um, we ended up here. It wasn't the plan, but, um, it was, it was a lucky, lucky chance.

Speaker 2:          06:17          Yeah. People don't realize that before the Islamic revolution. I mean a rod was a, was a widely secular state and a lot of ways, much more secular than it is now. I know you were really young when you were there, but what are your memories from being five or six years old?

Speaker 3:          06:32          Look out of the feeling limited memories, but I mean, yeah, it was one of the more western parts of the Middle East. You know, you look at pictures of Tara and back in before the revolution and you know, you see women in miniskirts and I, men and women mixing freely and women at beaches. You know, we used to live by the beach before we're in Turan. Um, and then things changed dramatically in, you know, it really brings home just how quickly things can degenerate into what we see now. I mean, the rants progressed a little bit from when the revolution first happened as far as its treatment of women, but it's still pretty bloody poor. Um, you know, I remember having to go to school and then suddenly going from being fairly carefree and not having to cover my hair to being in an age women at five, six years old, where, you know, that was a time where you had to wear the hijab.

Speaker 3:          07:26          That was a requirement and it was just completely dehumanizing and I just loved it. I liked that change even just in my little life from when I was running around with the boys and being a regular kid to being expected to observe these moral codes, like making sure my hair's covered and behaving in a certain way. Um, so even that as a, at a tender age, it, I felt the full force of it. Um, always knew I was an American citizens. So for me, I always identified as someone other than, um, someone had to live the rest of their life under that oppressive system. So it was, um, it was significant for me and I was like, we have one of the original anchor babies. I was like, I, I can't get out one day when I made team, I'm not going to have to be here. So that really was a source of comfort to me, even as a very young child, that one day I'd get out of this.

Speaker 2:          08:26          What a fascinating time to grow up because it's not like people having their formative years when there isn't change where you just were going through what you had to go through, but to go from, even though you were very young to having memories of freedom and that, and then as, as a five year old or whatever that you, you knew something was wrong with being forced into that kind of system.

Speaker 3:          08:50          That's it. And you know, and even now that keeps them sticking to the young girls, you know, for the first years, they don't have to cover up and they can run around and then they don't have these obligations on them. But when they start school, then the hijabs have to be worn. And you know, that, uh, know not the best things when you've got a stinking hot day, nevermind that the rest of the year. Um, and yeah, breaks my heart when I see that. When you see the kids, that girl's been tickled out having to, you know, transition from just being a kid and to bang, you know, part of the regime.

Speaker 2:          09:28          Yeah. What was it like to actually get out? I mean, you said your dad had a brother in Australia. I assume the regime probably didn't want their, their bright young people to leave.

Speaker 3:          09:39          No. I know we, um, we were really lucky to be accepted in Australia. My mom, uh, was a midwife. She was actually, she was the head midwife at a hospital there that was, um, attended by the royal family before the Islamic Revolution. So it was a lot of pictures of her showing the role family around the facilities. You know, that was a fairly regular thing with that come and visit and she'd be the one responsible, she was a bit of a glamor, glamor, Paulson, you know, look the, um, so they really feared for their life because there were publications and pictures of her with the royal family. And you think that might be a minor thing. People got killed for that, you know, people we know, um, got, got in prison. So, um, we were lucky to, uh, like I said, the intention wasn't to stay in Australia, but we ended up staying here and a were granted asylum and it was, um, uh, just, uh, you know, forever indebted, indebted to the country because of that, because he gave us a chance at a new life.

Speaker 2:          10:38          Yeah. What kind of culture shock was that? Like a six year old going from Iran in the, in the Middle East to, to an island, uh, with, you know, people in, in Boardshorts, um, uh, will be boarding and all that.

Speaker 3:          10:52          Oh, absolutely. And, and the language was a shock too because, um, even though I was born in the states, I had zero English because I'd been brought up in your end. So I had like two words, hello. And T, which is a weird combination of woods deny. So I had to learn the language very quickly. Um, but it's such a welcoming place and thankfully English is a very simple language for a child to learn. So it only took a few months and um, and yeah, it is a bit of a culture shock, but Australia is not that different that the, you guys imagine any guys think they, we never got Kangaroos, you know, just a hobby. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:30          I assume you have a boomerang within reaching distance of you right now.

Speaker 3:          11:34          Oh, wise, I'd never leave home without a boomerang. You never know when you need it. Yeah. It's um, yeah, it was a culture shock. Definitely. You know, you made, it really felt safe and very quickly you realize, you know, this is a really welcoming, um, you know, wonderful to, to grow up and so much opportunity.

Speaker 2:          11:56          Yeah. Uh, did you experience any discrimination or anything like that or really was it just simply you were there

Speaker 3:          12:03          30 years and I've been here now for like over 13 years so you know, I have seen um, occasional discrimination but really it is minor and um, it's been, um, quite often then the discrimination I say are from your, you know, your bloody social justice warriors as opposed to be the most tolerant, you know, open minded people in the world. But if you don't conform to their idea of what a brown person should be saying and doing and thinking then that quite often really vicious and beneath that seem to be near of goodness is, is a bigot. Um, and I've seen that quite a lot on twitter. That's probably the most racism I've ever faced has been on twitter from, from the lunatic left.

Speaker 2:          12:49          Right. Because your, because somehow you're a brown. Do you do identify as Muslim? Do you consider yourself ex Muslim or do you consider yourself Muslim?

Speaker 3:          12:57          Cool myself, eggs, x moles on my family and was one like if you ask them what's your religion next time was lump and then very, very relaxed about it. They were Muslim in the way most Australians are Christian. Um, as one big difference between Australia and America where a lot less religious than than you guys. And um, and so, but as early as I could remember identified as atheist, I just didn't believe. And um, so for me there wasn't a real big transition from being a Muslim to being an agnostic or an atheist because I never was practicing, you know, I don't think my parents had ever been to a mosque. Um, right. Certainly not me. So they're not at all devout.

Speaker 2:          13:37          So That's interesting that the, the discrimination which you faced, what you're describing is very little and mostly on twitter, which is not reality. I keep trying to remind myself that twitter's not reality, but you're getting, you're getting the discrimination from the social justice crew because your not your, not their type of brown person because you do speak your mind.

Speaker 3:          13:58          Absolutely. It is extraordinary that these people who supposedly spend their lives fighting for the, for the minorities, that, you know, they see as a pitcher, you're pressed, even in countries like Australia and when are, he actually speaks up and has their own thoughts. They, and it doesn't conform to their world view. They are absolutely appalling in, in their response, uh, straight out bigotry. Um, and you know, it's like if you were sitting rice or if you're from a minority group, you should only vote a certain way. You know, you're not allowed the opportunity to think for yourself and decide for yourself who, who you're going to support or where you're going to stand on certain issues. Um, and yeah, like I said, but beneath that thin veneer of virtue, quite often there's a really hateful bigot when, when someone is, um, you know, identifies as a social justice warrior and I've got no qualms or bad mocking them day and night. I just think there are quite often hard people who deserve to be called out.

Speaker 2:          15:05          Yeah. And you get a lot of crap for calling them out, but it doesn't stop you. But I agree. Of course. I mean it's such a dim view of the world that they have that we should all be viewed in. This collective is space. But before we go all in on that stuff, tell me a little bit about Australia because boomerangs and Kangaroos and reverse coriolis effect in your toilet aside. I feel like nobody in the states knows anything about Australia. You're a big island. That's pretty much it.

Speaker 3:          15:31          Well, our big island, most of the population lives along the coast love desert in the middle. Um, it's a really modern, uh, I think it's a lot like the states, except we're not really just, uh, that's one of the things we look at you and we don't sort of identify when we've had a prime minister who was an atheist and we had no issue with that at all. I mean, she was a terrible prime minister, but not because she was an atheist.

Speaker 3:          15:59          No, no. That had nothing to do with it. Um, we've had a lot of prime minister's recently. We've had a, a modern history of being really stable, particularly politically, but in the last six, seven years, we seem to just keep knifing our prime minister's was they getting elected and then their own party nights them. And then we have another one. So that's kind of characterize the politics in recent years. And we've got a conservative government at the moment, but led by a man who many conservatives don't really see as a conservative. So it's a really interesting period. And he just hung on, um, because a lot of the conservative base abandoned their party and went and voted for minor parties. So it's really interesting seeing what's happening around the world with you guys because there does seem to be this, uh, uprising from, from conservatives where they don't actually think that the major parties or the, the major, uh, establishment, I guess isn't really representing their interests. And in Australia we had, you know, a lot of minor parties and some of them describe as far right, um, a lot of boats in the last election this year.

Speaker 2:          17:06          Yeah. So I think Americans think that everybody is like us. Like, oh, we're a two party system. Even though I keep saying on the show, the constitution never says anything about only having two parties. It's just that the two parties have a strangle their system. You guys have a bunch of parties that sort of trade power and, uh, and it's not just two parties on top of everything, right?

Speaker 3:          17:27          That's right. Well, we've got a labor, which is your predominant left party. We've got at the conservatives, which are liberal and national and they are in a coalition together. And then we've got a minor party called the grains, which they like wanting 10 votes. So, um, in the Senate, our Apple House, they have to have a presence. But this last election, the minor from all we had facets, you know, the, our senate isn't the absolute dog's breakfast, you know, is, it's going to be fascinating to see how we can govern for the next few years because you've got so many months, so many minor parties that I have got their own little objection objectives and you wonder how they're going to work together, um, and, and, and a gray and passed legislation. So, um, so yeah, we do, we have a very different system to you. It's a party based system. We don't like for a, for a Labor prime minister we've like for our representative in our local seat, so it's a little bit uh, different. Um, but though we don't directly both for the prime minister, whoever is leading them parties significant obviously and know it has a fair, fair deal to do with who gets elected.

Speaker 2:          18:39          Yeah. So it's kind of, there's benefits and drawbacks to both, right? Because here,

Speaker 3:          18:43          oh, definitely. Yeah, there is. There is. Um, and you know, you've got, particularly in the Senate when you've got so many different parties now he can have the vote diluted and our senate is a really weird system. Every single stage is entitled to the same number of senators. So you might have a very populous state like New South Wales or Victoria, but we get the same number of senators as Tasmania, which is, you know, I know what it is there. So it's not a one vote, one value. So it's, it's, it's, it's mad. I mean, I, I'd be very much for abolishing our Senate after the house because it's very much obstructionist and unrepresentative. But, um, that ain't going to happen anytime soon. It's an argument that's been made decades and, and you know, it's still there, right?

Speaker 2:          19:31          Uh, I'm curious it being an island, I mean, being just a day, the fact that you guys are so big geographically and that you're an eye on how much of that actually plays into sorta the national eat those because you know, like when we see what's going on with the European Union and borders and all that stuff, these are people that are landlocked next to each other. You know, borders and immigration are important, all that kind of stuff. And you guys really have the advantage of water. I mean, it really is just that simple in a way. But how much is that actually like affect policies and the way people think about the rest of the world and all that kinds of stuff?

Speaker 3:          20:05          Oh look, we've got oceans and yeah, geographically we are blessed to be apart from a lot of that turmoil. But those oceans didn't stop 50,000 people coming here by boat. And when Labor was in government, and we had a very strict border control system under the conservative government of, of John Howard, and when labour were elected, they completely dismantled that because that's not, that wasn't in their thinking. They thought it was more humane to, to be a little bit more tolerant. But that tolerance led to hundreds of people over 1200 people drowning when our borders trying to come here from places like Indonesia by boat, they went Indonesians that travel from typically the Middle East. Right. So there are migrant, yeah,

Speaker 2:          20:51          it's actually from other countries that use it.

Speaker 3:          20:53          That's right. Yeah. Typically economic migrants, I'm, I'm sure there was some genuine refugees amongst them, but the overwhelming majority you would describe as economic migrants and even the Labor Party came to acknowledge that and they started toughening up. And right now they're, well, they say they back all the border protection policies that the conservative side have and, and you know, then they're not going to dismantle everything because it led to enormous suffering, not just the 1200 people be drowned trying to get here, women and children amongst them, but also all our detention centers field. You know, we have 50,000, we had 50,000, I think even more than that in detention centers, you know, effectively locked up. And since we've managed to take regain control of our borders, those detention centers have emptied out. There's not people drowning on the border. Um, and we still have a refugee program.

Speaker 3:          21:47          We still have a humanitarian intake, in fact increased it. But we select people who are waiting and observing the rules because you know what people, there was a period where people would argue that there are no cues to come here. And you know, they're, these programs don't exist. But as we know they do exist and there's people floundering, waiting in camps, um, who don't have the resources to hop on a plane to Indonesia and then pay a people smuggler to come by boat to Australia and then now priority. So we, uh, ab refugee and take I think is something to really be really proud of because we are very generous with that. Um, and you know, this isn't just simply porous borders. This is a proper humanitarian program where these people are brought here, they even housing healthcare education and you know, help to, to become integrated into society.

Speaker 2:          22:38          What Rita Rita, I thought you were supposed to be a cold hearted, heartless, conservative who, who wants to close borders and all that. But it sounds like you're actually okay with immigration as you are an immigrant yourself, but you just want, you just want reasonable standards to

Speaker 3:          22:54          absolutely. I'm willing to go. What would would this country particularly economically needs are economic migrants. They bring a great deal of wealth and you know, we're an aging nation. We need people to who are working age and come here and are productive and contribute well, our humanitarian intake, we've got to be honest, it costs us a lot of money, but it is something I think that, um, as a rich nation we're obliged to do and I'm proud of that. However, that doesn't mean that it's a free for all and whoever, you know, I can just a break the rules, come here and come here first. Also, we've got to be mindful of where those refugees are coming from because of late, there has been issues with, uh, some not integrating as they should and as immigrants decades before them have integrated. Um, so there is lot of debate in this country about where should these refugees come from, you know, where do we, do we prioritize?

Speaker 3:          23:53          Christians are being persecuted in, in the Middle East, he's eighties. Um, or do we not consider religion at all? And just bring in whoever's, um, you know, Dean, the neediest. Um, there was a poll just this week that was published. Those absolutely blown people away. It was a, it was a poll that was uh, you know, by one of the more left leaning pollsters. So you know, there can be no sort of accusations and you know, it was published in the Guardian says it came in accusations of this was some sort of a rogue pole too to try to change public sentiment. But he showed one in two Australians supports an immediate ban on Muslim migration. Now this is absolutely shocked. So many people who just refuse to accept that this sort of sentiment is out there and it's there because people don't talk about this issue. People pretend that, you know, terrorism isn't happening, that it doesn't have a religion. And, and you know, most Australians are smarter than that now. I don't actually agree with the immediate ban on Muslim, on migration. I'm not for that at all. But I can understand and, and the pole didn't surprise me because you know, I don't think exist in this little tiny echo chamber that so many of the media seem to existing where I just think we need to talk about these things openly. Cause when you don't, that's when you have sent them in life. This rising, and I don't think it's particularly healthy.

Speaker 2:          25:15          So isn't that the ultimate irony of, of your position for you particularly because as an immigrant from the Middle East, it's, it's extremely personal to you. But for me and the people that are in our space that we see on twitter that are talking about this stuff that aren't doing it from a bigoted place that want to help people when we can and all that, but also what a proper bedding they've put us in a, in a really bizarre situation. And for you, I mean I've seen you go on tv and I saw something where you are on tv debating this guy and I anchor and he kept implying you were saying all Muslims repeatedly. Even even though you never said it. Well we'll link to it below so people can see it. You never said it. It was the, it was the age old argument that we have all the time here. And it's like, man, she's from the Middle East. She was born to Muslim parents. She immigrated properly. Now she's trying to stand up for the very values that this country is four and they're doing this to you too.

Speaker 3:          26:14          This bizarro alliance between the regressive left and Islamist is prevalent every way. You know, in the UK, the US and even in Australia and it is bloody seat. It doesn't make any sense. The only sense it makes is that they share a common enemy conservatives. But I think you're talking about, um, appearance on morning television. I had written a piece about, you know, this terror has an, has a religion and we've got to acknowledge it. Again, I was at pains as we always are. Um, to say I'm talking about is limits until a little bad. The extremist, I'm not talking about that in time was the long, you know, all those qualifications were made, but no, nevertheless, you know, even just talking about it, Ebony and identifying what is happening that is clear to anybody who hasn't got their head buried in the sand was a pour into this dude. And he brought up Christian terrorism, you know, bombings at abortion clinics, which I think, you know, the last one was that he could find was about 15, 20 years ago. But nevertheless, you know, you can't talk about Muslim based or Islam as space terror without mentioning the Christian. You know, it's just,

Speaker 2:          27:30          it was pretty great because you asked him when the last one was and he had no idea that he busted out his phone in a few minutes later, came back and yeah, it turned out to be 15 or 20 years ago. I'm curious, you know, because you guys haven't been hit with terrorism really until about two years ago in Sydney and there was that hostage situation and all that was, how much did that actually change the discussion for you guys because you were seeing it everywhere else again, surrounded by water, seemingly safe. Um, did that really change the discussion in the country?

Speaker 3:          28:03          Okay. Did the Lindt cafe siege in Sydney and there's been other events? It just a short time before that, there was a, a young kitten, Melvin, who was radicalized and, uh, he tried to kill a couple of police officers, stabbed and repeatedly he was shot dead. That was probably our first taste of it. Um, linked effected the public. It wasn't just targeted at police, but we've been really fortunate in this country. We've had our counter terrorism offices, uh, and authorities foil several plots. We've just had some, uh, uh, someone in prison for what was a called the Anzac Day, Tara Palantir. Really significant date within our, within our calendar, the plot plot there was to run over a police officer, behead them, take their gun and shoot more people. Um, we've had a mother's Day plot that's with before the courts now, which was again, uh, you know, going to be tired in the public from the information that's out there.

Speaker 3:          29:05          So there's, there's been, um, and, and the biggest one we had was all about a decade ago, if not longer. Um, you know, about a decade ago, which was a quite advanced plans to bomb the Melbourne cricket ground, which is our biggest sporting stadium here. So we've been really fortunate that these plots have been, um, stopped in their tracks. But those lone wolf attacks as we call them, they're not so easily stopped. And, and it has been a, we had a police member shot in Sydney last year, um, in an attack by a young kid, I think it was 15, 16, who was again, radicalized. So we've had a taste of it, but no way. Like, yeah, places like France and Belgium where there issues seem to be so advanced that you want to have they ever going to get on top of it.

Speaker 2:          29:55          Yeah. Is that the irony too is that it's like the better that our security services are, the more things that they stop. And often we don't know that they stopped them until sometimes months or years later. And then at the same time it makes the threat seem lower. So then people want to be more tolerant. And again, tolerance basically is good. Uh, but you don't have a full picture. And I guess that's really what the, the big issue is

Speaker 3:          30:20          absolutely. You can become complacent. I know we don't live in fear here. We don't think you know, over what was going to be blowing off around the street corner. But again, you've just got to be awake to the reality of what's happening around the world and that we are not immune from it. You know, the terror denies around here we'll bring up things like what you got much more chance of, you know, dying in a car crash. Right. Cool. Bloody do you know, we drive around, they got millions of cars but you know, do we not think about terror and we don't worry about that and make sure we kept doing things to counter it. Um, yeah. Do we not worry about domestic violence because more people are dying on the roads from car accidents. I mean, it is just a stupid argument. There is just so much that is intellectually dishonest and, and just fraudulent in my mind when it comes to this space because people will do anything not to talk about it. People will do anything to deny that it's even an issue. And it obviously is an issue on this poll that came out this week show is that it is an issue and people are thinking about it. Even if our elite median politicians aren't willing to discuss it.

Speaker 2:          31:30          Yeah. Can you think of anything else that were so paralyzed to talk about? Cause I really can't in 2016 is there anything else that we treat with such kid gloves that is of such importance and I, and I get email from people literally all over the world from almost every country saying that their governments are doing the exact same thing.

Speaker 3:          31:51          Yeah. It seems to, yeah. Not Be. Every western nation seems to be dealing with it in Australia. I think the other issue that is, seems to be to do, uh, but is a significant issue is what's happening in a lot of indigenous communities. Again, it's something that people don't talk about because if you do talk about it and he can get labeled a racist very quickly, even though you care enough to want to actually do something about an attack, lease, put it on the public to public or discuss it. Even we've got kids who are being really mistreated, neglected,

Speaker 2:          32:27          okay.

Speaker 3:          32:27          And they're not being saved by the authorities. They're not being taken into care at the same level as you would expect. Uh, I mean, sorry, let me rephrase that. They actually are taking in to care at greater rates then, then the non indigenous community, but at the point where the authorities typed them seems to be a, you know, a lot higher than then. You know, no white kid I don't think would be allowed to be mistreated in that way for so long before they are saved. And we, we've got this nurse stolen generation narrative in our history that, that the authorities are scared now to actually save kids who are being abused. And, and because of that political correctness, because they don't want to create another stolen generation of the indigenous kids taken from their parents. But those kids are condemned to just terrible lives.

Speaker 3:          33:23          You know, their, they're, they're, they repeat the cycle. They, and, and I think that's just such a great shame and there is that there is a really significant gap in, in living standards in life expectancy in outcomes. Right. Did you in this community compared to the non indigenous community. And I believe a great deal of that has to do with these politically correct policies where we can't talk about what's happening. We can't talk about the rampant abuse, sexual abuse. We can't talk about the alcoholism, the drug use because to, to even start discussing it is, is, is racist. You know, the arguments will come up with what about all the drug use and alcoholism and the non indigenous community? Well, yes, of course. But that doesn't stop. Yeah. It's exactly the same sort of phenomenon happening there and it's just as destructive and it actually hurts the people that they're trying to protect from, from discussion.

Speaker 2:          34:22          Right. And we see that, we see that exact same thing when it comes to the discussion on Islam because if we don't talk about it, then who are you hurting the most? You're actually hurting Muslim people who are living under these theocracies

Speaker 3:          34:38          killed the most and oppress the most are other Muslims and Islamic state and looks at Shiite Muslims like my family as infidels. No different from, from Jews or a nonbelievers gays, you know, they, they think they're deserving of nothing other than death as well. So, um, and extremist Islam as have been killing other Muslims, you know, at a rate that is extraordinary for decades and we just don't, it's almost not on our radar anymore because it happens so often

Speaker 2:          35:12          about the abortion bombing in the Crusades.

Speaker 3:          35:14          Well, that's it. Well, even google. Yeah. What about the Crusades? I mean, God's sake, some of the arguments that are thrown up are just, they're just too stupid. But you've got to acknowledge them when you've got to counter them because they're being taught in universities. You know, I've had these sort of arguments with university lecturers and journalists and you know, pay academics who are on public purse and I just spewing forth bullshit and it's maddening.

Speaker 2:          35:43          Spewing forth bullshit. That could be the title of a, of a book that we should probably call write that book. So jumping back for a second, talking about Australia's role in the world, what is the Australian sort of ethos about what you feel your role should be? Obviously you guys aren't that interventionists, but you've been part of coalitions and things like that. What is the, the feeling there of what your purpose in the world should be?

Speaker 3:          36:09          Well, pretty laid back about things. We don't try to sort of sit the agenda agender or, um, you know, in four our belief systems. But we have been a good corporates. The corporates, we've been global citizen. Oh Man.

Speaker 2:          36:24          Slip is going to be replayed many, many times.

Speaker 3:          36:28          Um, but yeah, we will, I think, you know, I, I'm used to, we can be quite proud of, um, uh, involvement in World War Two, our involvement, um, uh, you know, with the allied forces. And I think, you know, we do feel a little bit removed geographically. We are so far from so much of what's happening around the world, but these days, you know, it's all there in your hand and your phone and it's, it's, it's, it's immediate. You know, what's happening as soon as it happens, you know, it's, it's, uh, uh, we are living in a time where, you know, those, those borders don't seem to mean as much. So I think, um, we're feeling relaxed about our place in the world. Uh, you know, when we do have those amongst us, as you have been Erie community who wants to set the agenda, they want to be, you know, yeah, we had a carbon tax for a while and, you know, the rationale was there. We, you know, we got to lead the world in an emission trading scheme. We're going to be the standard bearers in a fighting global warming. And, uh, the government got thrown out really quickly, so yeah, that didn't last too long. So I think overall it's Australians recognize a pretty lucky, we got a very good standard of living. We've got our own concerns. Um, all sorts of issues from housing affordability to uh, the threat of terror. Um, but um, I think we're, yeah, we're pretty happy with

Speaker 3:          38:00          saying what's happening around the world and, and, and feeling fortunate that it's not happening in our back yard yet.

Speaker 2:          38:07          Yeah, it's, I'm telling you it's that water thing being big and surrounded by water. It's, it's pretty good. Um, what do, what do you make of our crazy election here at Natalie? What do you make of it? But what kind of coverage in Australia just in mainstream media is our election getting? Cause it's all, it's all we have here. Any of the Cable News, 24 hour days, that's all we talk about.

Speaker 4:          38:30          Okay.

Speaker 3:          38:30          Are we getting a lot, a lot more than previously? There is a lot of American election coverage in our mainstream news, that particular television, great deal of it and all of it. Almost all of it is pretty much what you'd expect. It's very much, you know, trump is this maniac who's a racist and sexist. And you know, some of the reports I've seen, she's wasted. They just straight. And news reports have been, again, an extraordinary in, in being little, you know, editorials that are absolutely biased. Um, personally, um, I don't know what, I mean, I've got a great deal of thoughts. I'm not a fan of either candidate. Um, I can't believe it's easy astic for trump, but I completely understand the phenomenon. I understand people being utterly fed up and wanting an antiestablishment figure. Um, and I know why he appeals to people. I think a lot of things that the media sees gaps and sees huge errors in his character.

Speaker 3:          39:33          I actually enormous assets and a of what appealed to a lot of people. So, um, it's been just fascinating. I would love to be there for the last month or two and just say had on phones. Um, but you know, trump, some of his greatest enemies are, again, he's great. Assess it. So you look at what's happening now with the protests in, in Charlotte and um, you know, the, the protests that were happening at Israelis and you think the average American looking at that would actually sympathize with, would simply would understand some of the things he's been saying about what the country has turned into. Um, you know, Charlotte is just extraordinary. You've got a black cop shooting and seems to be an arm of black men and the places being torn apart and our black protestors showed another black protests and stuff. But it's

Speaker 2:          40:23          in a city with a democratic mayor.

Speaker 3:          40:26          Yeah. And it, but it is why she's fault somehow. You know, this black on black violence that's happened as somehow a course for just lutie and beatings and just a mass mindless violence that's been characterized as some sort of a protest that's got some purpose and it doesn't, it is just mindless looting and violence. And it should be called and what it is, and again, I think the public can see what it is, but the media narrative is trying to paint it as something other than that. And I think that is a great, uh, the thing is something else we have in common in Australia and America, Europe is the media being out of touch with its readers, viewers, listeners, they're just increasingly, there's a gap between members of the media and the mainstream population. And I think that's not healthy.

Speaker 2:          41:24          Yeah, I think it's interesting that you used the phrase out of touch because I think one of the debates were constantly having here and the reason that online shows are working is that it's it, is it out of touch or is it that they're actually in it with the politicians? Do you think it's, it's like a sort of generational thing and just the technology thing and you know, we're all walking around with phones, so now we're all on the ground journalists or, or is it that they're actually in it with the people in power so they have a vested interest in keeping that game going? Or maybe both?

Speaker 3:          41:55          Well in the U S in might be a bit of that. In Australia I think it is that, I think it's because they're part of the establishment or the elite. I think it's just the ideological disposition of a great number of the members of the media and it's, it's, it's quite many of them, uh, not, uh, you know, then look at the mainstream, well, one, they don't acknowledge the mainstream is actually mainstream. No, they think quite often things because they're surrounded by likeminded people that their views or the prep one's views and they're not, or they just look at, uh, the mainstream with this sort of condemnation as if they're too stupid to believe what they believe. Um, and I think it's, again, really unhealthy at a time where the mainstream media needs, it needs its audience more than ever to be poles apart from, from what the great majority of the population thinks, I think is really unfortunate.

Speaker 3:          42:52          Yeah. And I, I, in Australia anyway, I think it's just a simple matter of the politics of the individuals within the media tends to be very much on the left as it has in your been for the generations. And, um, and the, the, the rest of the population is a lot more diverse than that. It's a lot more nuanced than that. You know? Uh, and, uh, and they've used aren't being properly reflected. Uh, um, of course there are conservative commentators and writers and journalists, but very much in the minority and not reflecting the number of voters who are, um, leaning that way.

Speaker 2:          43:30          Yeah. How much of this stuff do you think is actually just purely the fault of education, be it in Australia or be it here or wherever? I mean, I was watching the, the Charlotte, uh, the riot and there was this guy and they found a protest or, and he was screaming about trump. And I'll preface this with saying, this is not a defense of trump, but trump is not empower. Now he's not the president or the governor of the state or the mayor of that city. And the guy was blaming trump. And it's like, I'm not saying you should be blaming Hillary, and I'm not even saying you should be blaming Obama, but you're, you're misdirecting things at somebody that has literally nothing to do. No power in place has anything to do with trump right now. And to me, that's an education problem, not a, a political problem.

Speaker 3:          44:18          Very much. And a Yay. It, those opinions come from ignorance, but they are supported again by quite often by mainstream media. Now I remember, you know, after even Orlando there was talk about trump as if he had anything to do with it. The Alando massive gain is just absurd to be blaming him. You imagine how this news would be reported if it was a bunch of trump supporters were tearing apart a city where, you know, bashing by standards or just the color of this game who were looting and that and just causing this widespread widespread mayhem and destruction. Yeah, yeah. It is. It is completely idiotic. But it's become almost a joke, you know, and whenever something horrible happens around the world, you know, you'd be blame brexit. You blame trump, you blame the crusades. You know, you can't ever actually pin point the blame at the people responsible. Cause that would be, you know, probably racist and gross,

Speaker 2:          45:20          the gross and racist. We know that. Um, I want to back up a little bit to some of your history because you weren't always a public person and a journalist and someone that's, you know, staked out controversial positions. You were actually, you were a private citizen. You were in banking at first, right?

Speaker 3:          45:36          Laura, yet

Speaker 2:          45:38          you to go from a, a normal job to somebody that's, that's out there putting their, their face with their words.

Speaker 3:          45:45          I know I was in studio, a same industry with the good prospects and good income and you know, that Matt. And then we'll miss score if he just wasn't for me. I thought I want to go, I want to go into an industry where there's massive job losses and where I'm going to be the tiniest of tiny minorities. Um, it will, it wasn't completely planned. It was fairly accidental, but he was a happy accident. And, uh, you know, I needed decade in, in, in finance and I think I enjoyed my seven, but by the end of it I just had enough. And um, uh, I had much higher than that, that point too. So it sort of gave me an opportunity to rethink things. I went back to university, I did my master's, um, which was a, again, that's kind of cemented some of my thoughts about higher education and just how many junk degrees there are. Just completely pointless, just settling basically.

Speaker 2:          46:43          Do you think higher education is a waste altogether? Right?

Speaker 3:          46:47          Oh No, no, not a waste all together. I just think in Australia in particular anyway, there are so many of these junk degrees, they don't qualify you to do anything that saddled students with big debts, raise their expectations and they come out and they know more qualified for a job. And then when they went in and you know, a lot of buddies just lefty indoctrination posing as education. It's just absurd. Um, and uh, you know, I'm all for having even more degrees for, you know, doctors and nurses and architects and accountants, things that actually, you know, teach you how to do a certain job, but, you know, bloody, uh, master's in gender dance therapy or something else or just, um, rides. Anyway. Um, so yeah, it will, it was all, uh, again, it wasn't planned. I was, it was a by chance and just, uh, I'm finding myself, I guess, so that's such a wonky term. But Anyway, um, here I am and it's, it's worked out well.

Speaker 2:          47:51          Yeah. So here you are. It's worked out well. We, we connected on twitter, I don't know, maybe six months ago or so. And I thought, wow, here's someone else across the world, uh, who, who gets it, who, you know, I, I sense cares about the same things I care about. I see you every now and again. You fight with some of the haters. I'm not big on fighting with the haters as a general rule. And I see them spewing all sorts of genuinely racist, awful things at you. They often, they often think that you're another nationality than you are, or religion.

Speaker 3:          48:21          I think I'm Indian or Pakistani. Yesterday I was copying it back. Yesterday I had someone, I told them, I'm not Indiana cause you know, all their sort of a piece was framed around me being Indian or Hindu. Like never, never don't know anybody. There had never been there. I've got to know me and they just refuse to accept it then I've know you are in Dnx. All thought it was hilarious. Look, it is a really fine balance. I tell people, you know, if I'm giving them advice about twitter's is like don't feed the trolls, don't acknowledge them, their attention seekers, they're desperate for any sort of attention. So don't give them what they are looking for. But on the other hand, every now and then I know my whole is enjoyed. It's good to call out some filthy hypocrites and just highlight the EDC, highlight BDC and hypocrisy and violence of some of these social justice warriors who think, you know, their, their morals are pristine and who thinks they're better than the rest of us, but they're quite often fairly vile human beings.

Speaker 3:          49:27          And I'm happy to mock them. I'm happy to, uh, you know, how like them to the followers and let them have their fun with the mom. But I knowledge the other way your way, which is just don't acknowledge them because you know, I get literally some days, thousands and thousands of mentions and I can't even read all of them. And I certainly don't, you know, respond to all of them. Um, and it does seem like sometimes, you know, the overwhelming bulk, a decent comments, intelligent comments that you're not acknowledging and you're acknowledging the loon lunatic. Right? And that seems to be a sort of cancer counter intuitive. But I think we've got to, um, highlight the mentality of these people, particularly when they pretend to be morally superior to the rest of us.

Speaker 2:          50:12          Right. So that, that's an interesting piece of this cause we've got the social justice warrior class that are moralizing all of us and telling us how racist we are and all this nonsense. And then at the same time, there absolutely is a piece of this alright. Thing that I've talked about bit a bit on this show where I get it, they're, they're pepe the frog and Heran Bay and they're trolling everybody and then they get Hillary to talk about the frog and they're just internet meme poster is there shit posters and they want to upset everybody and they, I think they're perfectly harmless. But I also do see the real white nationalists stuff and I don't know how much of that. So my question to you really is, do you think it's just I go back and forth basically between thinking that it's healthy when they get this stuff out because then it's not just hidden and secretive and even though they anonymous whatever, they're getting it out versus on another hand. In the last year I had seen more blatant, true hate, uh, than ever before on mine. So I'm not sure which one I, whether I think this is actually healthy or, or not.

Speaker 3:          51:15          Yeah, I, I'm, I haven't set my mind to that too. I'm not, I'm not sure. I mean, you just seem like an absolute is sewer at times. Twitter, you know, more so than any other social media forum. It seems to be just a bio field slur full of people who are miserable, who just want to fight. And, uh, yeah, it, uh, those, uh, really not nasty Nazi, uh, types. I haven't encountered too many. I've had a few and I've just bought them. Um, uh, but there've been very few in numbers as far as the ones attacking maze now that I'm not sure of the size of that population. And I think it's any way Nia, the size of the, of the other side. But yeah, any sign of them isn't healthy. And again, I think they should be treated with absolute disdain that should be called out.

Speaker 3:          52:11          They should be mocked. And that's what I tend to do. I don't try to, you know, convince these people. I ain't tried to reeducate them. I just mock them because that's all they deserve. They don't deserve your time, they don't deserve, you know, and I think twitter is a really dumb forum for in depth arguments. You know, you just kind of have them, it's just, that's not the place for, uh, discussions. Yeah. You try to frame your point of view in it as fewer characters as possible. Um, and if you actually trying to have a proper discussion, I just don't think that's the forum for it.

Speaker 2:          52:45          Yeah. Do you see a new center sort of lining up all over the world? Cause I think even a year ago or so, people were barely talking about this. I'm talking about the people that are not the far right prue white supremacists or racist or whatever you want to call them. And you know, I don't like using all the buzzwords and not, and not the regressive left and all the sjws and all that, but that there is some sort of new center lining up and it's because of the Internet because people like us had been able to, uh, to connect that my friend Ali Rizvi up in Canada who's an atheist Muslim coined the phrase, the new center. He said that's, that's the new home politically. Do you sense that this could actually become a political

Speaker 3:          53:27          absolutely. I think political parties are starting to recognize what the electorate cares about and they need, you've got to think the Republicans have to regroup over the next decade and recognize that they abandoned their base, that they had so many people so desperately unhappy with them. Um, and so eager to jump on the, on the trump train and in Australia as well, you know, in the last election, uh, uh, something between one or 2 million votes, 2 million voters. And that's a significant figure here. We're a small country of conservative voters, took their vote elsewhere from, from the mainstream, a conservative, a liberal national coalition. Um, so I think there is this new center, um, and where it is, is the question, I think it's a far more, uh, to the right then the media class would want it to be and acknowledge it to be, um, I don't mean their right wing.

Speaker 3:          54:28          I just think that, you know, in their economic point of view, in their attitude to borders and immigration and national security, they're far more, um, conservative then then the media class, uh, would like them to be and acknowledging them to be. So I think the politicians have no choice but to acknowledge it. Yeah. They can't ignore it. Then their political survival depends on it. So, um, but whether you let me, you actually see the emergence of the new party is something else too to ponder. I'm not sure about that. But um, there's talk of that in Australia. There's talk about, um, an actual new conservative party that will bring in all these sort of minor parties. Losier's um, but it hasn't happened. It's something that's been talked about or whether it actually been choice is another question. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          55:18          I think it's interesting that, you know, a second ago you started to say that they're more right, but you really meant conservative and then you, you fixed.

Speaker 3:          55:25          Yeah, yeah. I do to change,

Speaker 2:          55:28          but no, no, no. But I, I bring that up only because it's like even people like you to make your point, you still want to be so concerned about the language. And I feel that too, because we're, we're so just under this thing where if you say one thing wrong and implied that the conservatives are really far right or that, that everyone will be all over you. And that what a, what a crazy place for people like us to be in.

Speaker 3:          55:49          Oh, it's insane. It is. People are just so hyper sensitive to the, you know, and so looking to be offended by something or take something out of context that you do sometimes, you know, even someone who doesn't want to, doesn't give a stuff about political correctness. You find yourself qualifying things and explaining things like over explaining things. It's, yeah, it's, it's, I guess we're not immune to it either. We've, we live in that world and we have to acknowledge it.

Speaker 2:          56:20          I wish we were over. I see people on twitter telling me sometimes times we could see it get over yourself, like, you know, just stop. But you know, I'm, I'm still trying to be a person that, a good person that exists in 2016 so, so my last, my last question for you is taking everything that we've discussed here, um, what do you think the best thing for, for people that are, that are hearing our messages, whether they a little more right or conservative or a little more left or liberal or whatever it is for all of these people that are hearing this and seeing the same trends that you're talking about all over the world, what is the best thing that they can do to help fix some of this stuff?

Speaker 3:          56:57          Be Brave. Be Bold. Say what she think. I think that's the message to take out of it. Don't be afraid, don't be bullied into silence. Don't feel like, uh, your point of view isn't worthy of being aired and discussed. And don't worry about, you know, if you say something, you're going to be unfriended on facebook by someone you went to school with 20 years ago. You know, I just think people need to be, people need to be brave and have and be interested. You know, be easy. I wouldn't force anybody to, to become political nuts, but you know, if you care about this stuff, get interested, read, uh, read different sources, find out what's really happening and um, don't be shy. They're putting your 2 cents in.

Speaker 2:          57:44          Yeah. Well I, that's what I say on the, on the show every week. So I will co sign that one. Alright. Well, Rita, it was a pleasure. I'm so glad we finally connected and we were supposed to have you a couple of days ago in our Internet blew out. I think we, somebody is watching us and they didn't want us to connect.

Speaker 3:          57:58          Well, I don't even believe that was just coincidence. There's obviously some sort of the left wing conspiracy to silence. Now. I don't think there's any other explanation possible.

Speaker 2:          58:08          Definitely some sort of left wing conspiracy a. Anyway, you guys can follow Rita. It's at Rita Panahi on twitter and she can follow her writing, uh, over at the Australian Harold's son. Uh, Rita. It was a pleasure. So we'll, we'll keep doing this in 140 characters.
