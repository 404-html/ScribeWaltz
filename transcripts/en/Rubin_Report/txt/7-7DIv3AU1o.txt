Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Joining me today is an author, the Co founder and president of environmental progress.org and a candidate to be the next governor of the great state of California. Mike shellenberger. Welcome to the Rubin report. Just having me. David. I am very jealous of your beard. Even the amount of gray here. I just added that before I do the reverse. What do they do? It's just for men usually takes the gray out. Exactly. You do the training of the baby boomer votes. Added some gray in. Yeah. I'm very excited to talk to you because I think this is going to be a good political discussion, but also we'll get to some environmental stuff that I've wanted to touch on and a little bit about the state of California, this highly regulated, highly tax state that we're in and all kinds of stuff, but first you live in Berkeley. I do. What the hell is going on or what's going on there? It seems like it's become one. You know, it was once the home for free speech and real liberalism and it seems like it's become this sort of hysterical, crazy silencing mob up there. What's happening?

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       I mean in some ways it's funny because it's, it's supposed to be an outlier, but in some ways it's similar to what's happening in the rest of the country. People aren't, don't listen to each other. You know, it's so striking. I think that the social media gives people a lot of confidence in their reviews. They have a lot of information available to them and so people are just not listening and I find that everywhere. You Know, Berkeley is certainly the case. We've been smug for a long time though in Berkeley we pioneered it, but have you seen a change

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       say in the last five or 10 years, has something actually changed or was this all just sort of what's happening nationally?

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       I mean when I, when I sort of changed my views in particular of nuclear and dealt with some of the backlash against that, that gave me a different point of view on the broader kind of culture and the ways in which people are intolerant to don't want to hear it, but you know, just because of my age I think and I hadn't been associated with the university. I had a think tank in Oakland, lived in Berkeley, but I hadn't really had a lot of interaction with the students until recently so I didn't even know about trigger warnings like into like a couple of years ago. And I was like what are those?

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       So live in Berkeley had a think tank in Oakland. I'm just trying to think for the people that don't know, you know, you come from the left, the area and all that stuff. So before we get into the nuclear stuff, which is really, I think your, your, your key thing. Tell me just a little bit about your history. What do I need to know about you before we get into the meeting?

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Let's see. So I'm a gen x or a born 19, 71. Raised you in that fear of the Cold War as you probably had, you know, saw the day after on television when I was in whatever, 12 terrified of nuclear war. My parents were Christian pacifists, but they also divorced. So I was a kid of divorce, a suburban Colorado. I'm very left wing kid, you know, I had very, my parents were pretty liberal and then I moved to the bay area after college to work with a left activist group called global exchange. So it was always. I've always been sort of a man of the left and when my views of nuclear in particular change in the environment, then I sort of was able to kind of start to give myself permission to rethink other things and not not believe everything I thought so to speak and to start to question some of those things.

Speaker 1:          00:03:15       Yeah. And that's why I thought you'd be a perfect guest because what we're about to talk about now, your sort of evolution and know you're pushing against and where are you get support. It sort of fits a lot of sort of where I'm at and a lot of what some of my other guests who have dealt with. So tell me as, as you woke up to nuclear. Alright. So what was the sort of base environmental thinking when you just got out of college and we're working in?

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       Yeah. Yeah, I mean I had sort of that sort of basic simplistic kind of lefty view that all of the problems in the world due to big corporations and capitalism and that that's what was wrong with the environment. And I had this picture I think that a lot of people have still, which is that a more beautiful world would be solar panels on your roof and electric car in the driveway. And um, and we wrote about how to achieve that. But the more we were writing about it, the more we realized the limitations of solar and wind in particular as energy sources. And we had a bunch of friends who were just like, you know, if you're concerned about climate change and air pollution, why not nuclear? And we had to go through a process, really took several years to sort of finally answered that question and go, yeah, we got to have nuclear, we're going to deal with climate.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       Yeah. So before we fully get there, what are some of the limitations? Because I think most people, even now, even though you're saying this was a couple of years ago for you sure now most people I think have that idea if we just all had solar panels on our roof and if you'll, if we had more wind turbines and all that, then everything actually would be okay. But that's actually not what you argued.

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       That's right. And it's in and my views sort of have evolved, but the biggest problem that people are aware of is that you only get electricity out of wind and solar when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. And um, people kind of go, well maybe there the sun is shining when the wind's not blowing or the way you know. And it's like, no, that's not really true either. So you always have to have power plants ready to run at any minute. I'm usually natural gas because you can fire them up so quickly and people go, what about batteries? Batteries are really expensive. Just getting enough of them to store the amount electricity you need. I mean I think we had. We calculated that if you took all of the batteries in California and you stored all of electricity would have like a couple of hours Max, you know, so and that would be taken all the batteries out of cars and trucks.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       So it's a lot of that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       A lot of batteries. Yeah. I think these batteries are terrible for the environment and there's another problem with renewables which is that they take a lot of space because the sunlight and water and wind are energy diffuse. There's just. You have to get a lot of wind to get enough electricity out of them or you have to cover a lot of area to get enough concentrated sunlight to make sufficient quantities of electricity. You actually have big land use impacts and if the whole point is to save the natural environment, you end up doing things like a lot of desert tortoises in the mojave and then you have a big waste problem that we haven't solved. Both solar panels and batteries contain high levels of toxic waste. In fact, about two to 300 more toxic waste from the same amount of energy in solar panels then is created from nuclear, so when you kind of. It's really the big problems with renewables are actually environmental problems and it also tends to make them more expensive.

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       Do you think then that there's no place for them or is there some place like if if you were to drive from La here, if we were to drive towards like palm springs, there are in the hills you see plenty of wind turbines. Obviously here in la because of the amount of sunshine, we see plenty of people with solar panels on their roof. Every time I go to home depot there's only five people that try to accost me and get me on panels and all that. Do you think there's any place for those things?

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       Oh, sure. And there's there, there's one place for them as in my backyard. I have, um, you know, I mean, I think that solar was traditionally used for remote applications, so places where you don't have electrical wire or it doesn't make sense to have electrical wire, their solar panels are really cool technologies. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them. I think there's something wrong when we are subsidizing the most affluent members of our society to have. Um, and that's what's happened. So California has seen our electricity prices went up 40 percent, um, at a period where, I'm sorry, they went up four times more than they did in the rest of the country over the last seven years. And a big part of that was we were subsidizing people to get solar and wind. I think if you're doing some experimental work, some r and d perfectly important role for the government. That's how we got jet turbines and a lot of the technologies in our iphones. But when you're kind of constantly subsidizing them, the people that get punished is working people, middle class people, poor people because their electricity prices go up and so that, that starts to have a, a, a concern that a universal concern, whether you're liberal or Conservative,

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       whatever. So I want to get a little more to that and government's role in whether that's the answer will, we'll show that for now. But I'm very much aware of that because even right now is I've looked into it a little bit, you know, I see that a lot of subsidies have actually run out in California. There's a lot that are expiring at the end of the year and all sorts of other stuff. And also just by a function of having this studio, I mean, you see all these lights, like these lights, they burn hot and they suck a ton of, uh, of electricity. So my electricity bill is there are, are crazy. So this is something I'm very aware of. So Tony, tell me when you started realizing that nuclear wasn't the evil thing that perhaps it had been portrayed. As

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       you know, I, I think, I mean I helped to stop a proposed radioactive waste repository. Actually I'm in my late twenties, but as he got concerned about climate, um, you started hearing people talk a little bit more about it. I think my views are probably softening even before I became directly focused on it, but then it was really a couple of friends. One of them was stewart brand who is sort of the originary Hippie, you know, whole earth catalog. I'm advisor to Governor Brown in the seventies. He wrote a famous essay in 2005 and then a book in 2009. And by the time I read the book in 2009 was pretty persuaded because he just went through all the evidence, you know, the accidents really. We're not what people think they are. The waste is actually the best kind of waste because there's hardly any of it. It's easy to manage, never hurts anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       What do they do with the waste? Because I think that's what we usually think of. Think of the nuclear power plant and the simpsons and the three items for damage for your argument. Oh yeah, yeah. Anything else out there you have the first thing you learn as you go. Oh wait, the waste isn't green and liquid because it was in the simpsons, which is how I got my information. Yeah. And Mr Burns was running for governor, which. Oh yeah, there you go. A little bit more money than I got, but um, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       now what we do with it is fine. I think we take it. You take the spent fuel, you take the fuel rods out of the nuclear reactor, you cool them in water for a few years and then we put them in dry cask storage right there on the site where the plant is from an environmental point of view, that's like exactly what you'd want. I mean, if you, when you grow up kind of learning about the environment, the first thing you learn is that waste always has to go somewhere, right? It doesn't disappear and you have to be responsible for taking care of the waste products from our consumption. So that's nuclear is like the only way that we make electricity that does that right now we don't have any protections that solar panels won't just go into landfills and leach toxic chemicals or be sent to Bangladesh to be torn apart by kids in slums. I'm only nuclear really cares for its waste and it's almost and really clinical way. We put them in these big casks and, and they're right there on basically a couple of basketball courts, um, at a given plant. Um, and we kind of look at them and store them and watch them and people go, what if they leak or something? They're in these hugely thick cast. But even if they were, you would be able to see it and observe it and there's not really anything to lead because there's no way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       So is there any evidence that something could really go awry with that as you're laying it out as something that's pretty safe?

Speaker 2:          00:10:48       No, there's no evidence that waste from nuclear energy production has had any of those problems. People say people point to problems with the waste that came out of weapons production, but that, that is a very different process. You're just creating huge amounts of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for bombs. And when we were really, when you had really big problems even there, it was like in the middle of World War II where you're just throwing bodies and machines to fight this war. So, um, it's got an incredibly good track record. I mean, people will talk about wanting to bury it under the desert in Nevada. My. And I'm always like, I don't know why, like why do you need to do that? Like, just, it's fine where it is, you just store it and maintain it. It takes up no space. It doesn't pose any harm. Um, for me, I'm like, that's like the one of the chief selling points of nuclear is the way it manages this way.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       Yeah. So when they talk about that, you know, burying it in the desert somewhere underground or whatever, are they talking more about the weapons grade

Speaker 2:          00:11:44       and about the nuclear energy waste? And I tried to figure it out because I'm like a bit of a newcomer to it. I didn't know. I'm just, I'm glad I asked people in the industry, why do you need to do that? And they kind of go, well, because it's better because it's better. Look, people made a lot of money building that big hole in Nevada, you know what I mean? From a libertarian point of view, you kind of go, there's just, there was a lot of money to be made on these fears that were manufactured and that we're used to manipulate people like us. I grew up in the seventies so that you would think that there's some relationship between like a bomb going off and the waste and there's just nothing. The waste can't be used in that way. Um, so I have to say it's one of the things I find most frustrating and baffling, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       is it also one of those things that you really. And this is why I want to tag it on the show to, to really unpack this stuff. You really have to have some basic understanding of how this will work. So when you even mentioned before that the different ways between weapons grade and just, you know, civilian use for power, I don't think people have any sense that these are different things

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       right now. I don't know a lot about it and the funny thing is, so I'm working on a um, I've got a book that I'm going to, I'm doing on the history of nuclear and one of the surprising things is that ordinary folks knew that there was a big difference between nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants from like the mid fifties to like the mid seventies, like people kind of, in fact the whole people were actually excited about nuclear power. Like they were like, this is great. You mean like this thing that's really terrible and frightening actually has this really positive side. And I was like, yeah, well let's get some of that positive side going because all we hear about is the negative stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       This makes sense. I was born in 76, so right when that ended probably.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       Yeah. And then, um, a three mile island accident occurred and blown way out of proportion, but really importantly, China Syndrome, this, this anti nuclear movement, 1979 came out and that really shaped perceptions and, and that they deliberately and you can see what they're doing constantly. They were trying to mix up the two things. Same word, you know. Um, but you know, it's funny because we have a lot of dangerous things in our society that we actually use for positive things were even injecting polio virus into people's brains to kill cancer particular kind of cancers. Um, you know, we obviously immunizer we inject our children with dangerous diseases because to protect them. So I think we're capable of having a more complex understanding of that technology, but there is vested interests and ideological interests in maintaining people's fears.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Right? So there's sort of two separate things here. There's one is what the reality is. And then there's the other where when you hear about three mile island Chernobyl or any of this stuff, what's the argument that you're your best argument when there's something that actually is a disaster in the case of turnover? I guess you're saying three, not as bad as they hyped it up to me.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       Yeah. So I mean there's three serious accidents that involve melted reactors. Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, the worst was Chernobyl. And even the worst one killed shockingly few people. Mo basically killed the firefighters who put out the fire about 50 to date. Um, and you know, firefighters die putting out fires, you know, so it's not like unique to nuclear accidents. There were um, uh, was about a one percent mortality for the several thousand people that got thyroid cancer. And then that's it. Like no increase in any other cancers. So nothing else. Nothing else you would have asked me, just not knowing anything about this. I think I probably would have said, oh, there's probably like some sort of even generational thing going. No, no, definitely not. That's, I think that's really the, the meme that's out there, that's the one that they even promoted it a lot was that somehow they were like, if you got exposed to radiation than your kids would have some problems and we don't see that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:22       And that's great. I mean, it's one of those things where everyone should have been like, Yay, Yay. We discovered that nobody was harmed, let's celebrate. But people were like, no, there's got to be something wrong. I mean, I think there's also just, it is such a different way of making heat. That's what nuclear plants do. They make heat and it heats, used to make electricity. Um, but there's no smoke, there's no fire, there's no smoke. And that's just weird. I mean, humans have been around for 200,000 years and we really evolved and our, and our prehuman ancestors helped to make us with fire. So fire is just a central part of human stories around the world and a central part of our identity. And we look at the Greek myths and then we have this completely different way of making energy and power and fire.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       And I just think I'm not fire energy and power and, and we kind of go. It's strange and I think we kind of go, there's gotta be something wrong with it. Um, and of course, you know, you get really close to nuclear reactors, it's really dangerous, harmful and you can die. So it's not like it's harmless, but I think people don't understand, you know, when you consider that, you know, somewhere between five and 7 million people die every year from just breathing, smoke and suffering, respiratory illnesses. I think we just are less scared of smoke then, then we should be part of it though, that we're, there's something about nuclear power and when we related to weapons in our minds, it's become like this thing where we love disaster movies, you know, all of this stuff. So it's sort of taken a life unto its own in a way.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       Yeah. Um, yeah, it's such an interesting problem because on the one hand people like, they want so much safety from nuclear even though it like kills, like basically nobody, you know, compared to like every other way of making energy mean natural gas pipelines explode all the time. Oil Refineries go down and it's kind of like, come on, you know, you drive your car super fast, you smoke cigarettes when you get, when you drink, when you drink too much, you know, we do all these risky behaviors and somehow we don't want any risky behavior from this one. I think it is that association. You think something horribly could go wrong. Even though we've seen horrible things go wrong with nuclear accidents and it doesn't harm our laney buddy. So, you know, I think it's about a lot of different things. Um, you know, I also, it was interesting, I saw, I was watching one of your earlier conversations where one of your guests talked about the infantilization of the public, you know, mean here we're rich and comfortable and where we want like high levels of safety. I think the other thing that happens as we've become developed and civilization is that our fantasies of what could go wrong get even more crazy. Like,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       you know, I mean just the crazy things that people thought about with genetically modified foods, you know, these kind of scenarios that we concoct, it's different from. It is 100 years ago. I mean, when you're trying to deal with the cholera epidemic or a polio epidemic, you're not, you don't need to fantasize about horrible things going wrong. You're watching them happen. It's interesting. I'm not going to remember this story totally correctly, so I have a feeling you'll be able to clean it up. But I grew up in long island and there was a power plant either that was coming or that they wanted to move her saying Indian point. Does that sound right? Sure. Um, yeah, insurance they were, they wanted to build the shore on one. They did finish the Indian point one. Okay. So I remember just around that, all the, I think I was maybe around 12 or something and I remember hearing about it all the time and that's when the phrase Nimby got in my head, you know, not in my backyard.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       And just this endless hysteria that people were talking about that, you know, we're all gonna, you know, tumor has growing out of our head and all this craziness. And I guess you're saying there's no evidence for any of that. No. And you know, it's always like those panics that occur and I think you have to consider it as a panic. It's always about something else, you know, there's something going on in the society. I mean, the people that, it's not everybody that was equally afraid of nuclear plants, right? It's a particular people that have particular views of the world and that are suspicious of the government, suspicious of corporations and the system. I'm suspicious of modern life. And so, um, they're the ones that were more prone to have those kinds of fears. I think we see something different on the conservative side of the political, right.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       They have different fears, um, you know, that. And if they express themselves differently. Yeah. So, okay. So when you start having this sort of wake up to nuclear and you're in this pretty lefty field in the geographic places that, in what kind of pushback did you get? Oh, a lot. I mean a lot. I mean and, and it's. And it's continued, although I have to say it's gotten a lot better. I mean we saw one of the big environmental online magazines just came out with a long article and supportive nuclear. The I was in a documentary film that came out of 2013, so it's been now, you know, five years almost. And that's how long these things take for people to kind of calm down and look at the evidence and you just get up every morning and you continue to advocate and, and people, you know, facts still matter.

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       They matter. Yeah, I think they do. I mean, I think, I think you still need time. There's a way in which facts matter more than ever because there's so much opinion out there. Everyone's got an opinion, but you know, real facts. You kind of go, look, it's the World Health Organization. Like do you think there's a conspiracy involving thousands of scientists to cover up some deaths that occurred? I mean, it just doesn't really make sense for most people. There's obviously a lot of conspiracy theorists and crazy ideas, but I think that a lot of people have come around on the issue, so a lot of my former guests had been progressives that have sort of had a kind of awakening and then they ended up being hated by the very people they were with. Were you getting that? Like, I know I'm sure you were getting pushback on the intellectual ideas, but just I just want to sort of understand because I think my audience is surely attuned to this when you start doing something a little bit different.

Speaker 3:          00:20:52       I just want to understand sort of the level of hate and push back to you were getting. Yeah, it was hard. I mean, you know, you get a lot of. I mean it's important to remind yourself that sort of, not about you, you know, because you've take it personally. You're like, well I'm not that kind of a person, you know? And it was like, oh, they're just projecting stuff onto you. Um, you know, the most painful stuff was when I had a friend on my facebook page accused me of being on the take from the nuclear industry and I was just kinda like, look dude, the friendship is like overnight. And I was like, that's. But I didn't. And he apologized later. But it was an interesting interaction because it was kinda like, hey man, you really kind of let yourself forget who your friend was, you know, in this kind of, you know, is in the midst of all the Bernie Sanders stuff, or Bernie was attacking nuclear and he was a big Bernie guy.

Speaker 3:          00:21:35       And I just remember being like, you don't, you're just caught up in something and actually you need to kind of take us, take a minute and get control and think about what you're saying, who you're saying it too. And he apologized for it. But I was kind of like, how do you do that at like a mass level where you kind of go, hey, everyone can be just a deep breath. Take a deep breath. And I love hearing that personal side of it because I think so many people are going through that, not necessarily with, with nuclear power like you're going through it, but just with whatever their own political evolution is. So let, let's talk about Bernie and this for a little bit because yeah, he was campaigning against this. Now if this, if the science is as clean as what you're saying is, then why wouldn't the progressive, you know, lefty guy who's always talking about, he's talking about and what does he say?

Speaker 3:          00:22:20       And environmental revolution writing once a social revolution and a political revolution in environmental. He wants environmental justice. I don't even know what that means. Right? But why wouldn't he be for this? That's a very interesting question. Um, and I suspect there's a lot of different reasons. I mean, some of it is he's an old guy, you know, it was very hard for old people to change. It was hard for me to change my mind about nuclear and I was in my life like late thirties, early forties. And again, you have to overcome a whole bunch of associations. You know, there's basically a picture what a lot of it gets called environmentalism doesn't have any to do with the environment. It has more to do with the kind of society you want. And so the idea would be we should have decentralized food and energy production. You know, we're all going to have our own little chicken coop and our own little garden.

Speaker 3:          00:23:05       I got a solar panel. There you go. You're a part of it. My kids aren't laying there like 18 weeks right now. Now I can have an egg be one at the end of this aisle. Yeah, I mean we, you know, we have a little garden in the back and the amount of money and labor we put into that garden, I'm like, each tomato is like $500, you know. So, you know, it's a bit of that fantasy. I mean I, you know, I love working in the garden, right? Like it's great to work in the garden. It's great to have fresh eggs and you know, and, and, and for people that can afford it and you might want it, it might be cool to have solar panels for a variety of different reasons. I think that when you kind of get too caught up in that and you start to think that I'm going to produce all my food, that way, you know, where I'm going to lose all my energy that way that you really started to lose touch with kind of a basic understanding of how materials and energy and society works and you're letting that desire for a fantasy to take over.

Speaker 3:          00:23:58       So that's kind of what we come up against. I think that that's where if you can kind of get people out of their own life and their own how they want to live in their backyard to well, how are we gonna you know, there's 7 billion people on earth, so how are we going to provide food and resources for everybody that helps to recontextualize things. So what's the connection there between or what's the disconnect I should say, between sort of progressivism and using nuclear power? Because what you're saying is this can bring more energy to people that are lower cost than a lot of the other things that we're using it as a safer level and it seems to me that even though, yes, Bernie is an old guy, it seems like this is something he should, should, should have come around on. So I'm still missing that disconnect.

Speaker 3:          00:24:37       Maybe. Maybe we just don't know. Yeah, I'm more. Or is there something about the way the lefties with environmentalism that's so connected now to solar and wind and stuff like that? Well, and it's funny because it all actually happened here in California and you can see the difference between our current governor, Jerry Brown and his dad. His Dad was governor and he was what he was the Democratic Party that I kind of was raised on as the kids are the party of the people, you know, it was a party for the working man, the working family. Everyone gets a high wage. You build highways, agriculture factories. Um, the sixties occur. His son gets elected. Jerry for the first time, 1974, it takes part 1975. And He, and he says, he's interviewed by William F Buckley, actually. He says, we all have to do with less. We need to have less material consumption.

Speaker 3:          00:25:26       We have to obey. Limits was a striking thing to be to hear from not just who he was as a Democrat, as someone that was up for everybody prospering, but it was also. He's one of the wealthiest families in California. They owned a huge oil monopoly from the Indonesian military dictatorship. So who was the one who were the people that were promoting this idea of doing with less? It was the wealthiest members of our society. It was often kids that inherited family wealth. They had land. And so one of the most surprising things running for governor as I learned more about the state, is our housing crisis is a direct consequence of that same worldview that took over left liberal politics in the seventies. Before that, the idea was there should be abundant housing. People should be able to buy a home. And home ownership was really very progressive, right? Because homeowners have so much wealth in their homes and progressive's wanted to promote that. Well Jerry Brown gets in and his anti development, you know, so called environmentalists get in there and they seek to restrict homes, housing, consumption, energy and it was almost like, it was like almost the opposite of what came before it. So you're telling me that first term, Jerry Brown is the guy I have to blame for the mortgage that I'm going to be

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       paying for the rest of my life on this thing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       Yeah. I mean, and really the. I mean he's now sort of four terms when he leaves office at the end of this year and right at the beginning of next year I should say. Um, and yeah, I mean, and it's again, you kind of go, well then why did, why was jerry like that? I mean that's where in my book I kind of, you kind of are like searching for it and I think you just kinda get to a backlash against basic progressive and liberal lists. And I mean that's the funny thing you get. There's a backlash against making prosperity for all. They didn't want everybody to have prosperity. They want it to really kick away the latter. And kind of protect all of it for themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       Right. So it's so interesting. So you're saying basically in 75 he's going, well we're going to have to deal with less, but he didn't really mean we, he may know because oil guys and obviously the guys had a lot of money and power for a long time through his family because he's, he's still around 30 some odd years later. Um, I want to talk a lot more about what, why you want to be governor. But one other thing, have you read that book right there by any chance? Of course. And I know Alex, I had a coffee with them. Yeah. Okay, great. So, so Alex Epstein I had him on. It's the, the, the, the case. The moral case for fossil fuels is the book I hit him on probably about two years ago. I don't think that I've ever gotten more hate for an interview then. I mean, I've had plenty of controversial people on here that I then get lumped in with and people think I endorse all their abuse, which obviously is nonsensical, but I truly think I got the most hate I ever got for having this guy. Now he's basically, his basic argument is the title of the book and he's just saying the most you can do for humans now is to still use fossil fuels. I'm curious where you fall on that argument.

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       I think he gets it half right. I mean, my view is that it's very. I mean, my view is very simple in some ways. I mean, I think people. I think now that I know more about housing and schools and other things, I'm like, well that's really complicated stuff, but energy, I think it's pretty simple. So most of us start off in societies using wood and Dung as our primary energy. Anything is better than that, including burning coal, right? Because it's terrible. You breathe the smoke and and it's just the Labor involved, right? So then you get electricity from coal and hydroelectric dams. Those are the first in poor countries. Get so it was really a moral case for, for coal and hydro if all you're using is wouldn't dung, but then I also think there's a moral case for using cleaner burning fuels like natural gas and uranium.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       Um, so, so he wants to, I mean, Alex did a good job with this book in the sense that he wanted to start a conversation about why or when it stopped poor countries from using fossil fuels. That's really unethical. Um, but I think you should go the other step to say, look, there's, even if you don't worry about climate, there's air pollution, there's other impacts of fossil energy use and if we've got this fantastic alternative and usually we go from coal to natural gas and then to uranium than we should keep going, you know, it's energy transitions and these energy transitions, which I don't want to get too much of my campaign, but these energy a little bit. I do energy transitions. Um, you know, when you go from horse and Buggy to internal combustion engines and trains are what drives those transitions from energy sources. So you go from wood and dung to coal and partly because of trains but also factories and whatnot. And then I think you eventually get to a electric powered world electric cars, electric heating, um, as we move towards nuclear.

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       Okay. So we've hit than solar. We pit when, let's just do two of the others. You mentioned one of them right there. Uh, so let's just talk about natural gas. What do we need to know about natural gas generally?

Speaker 2:          00:30:18       Um, I mean, the first thing to know is that just like on so many of the things, Americans are just the luckiest people in the world. I mean, we have so much oil and gas. It's just incredible, like a huge amount of our wealth in the last decade came from this fracking revolution, which of course environmental supposedly hate, although in many ways they really like it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       That was going to be my second one to ask you, but I really, I'm really asking the same question, right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:40       So, um, you know, I think there's two things I think are important to know about natural gas. The first is that it's just way better than coal, like we went and looked at all the scientific peer reviewed research and it's just on every measure. Water use, water pollution, air pollution, carbon emissions, everything. Gas is just better than coal. Of course it is, right? You're using your kitchen and it's safe. Yeah, I mean still explode sometimes. Cultural, they want to talk to you about the exploding. Yeah. Um, and it's not as good as uranium which we use for nuclear. Um, similarly on all the same metrics, uranium performance better. So there's a way in which I just kind of go, there's just, this is just basic energy density. This basic physical facts about these fuels makes there, makes a progression exist wood to coal, to oil to natural gas.

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       You rainium. Um, I think, I think it's important to know, and I think one of the challenges I often make to my libertarian friends is that the government played a very positive role in all of these energy technologies. Um, uh, maybe with the exception of, um, of coal, although there's a little bit there, but you really, um, oil and gas, the US government has constantly been supporting r and d nuclear came out of a military weapons program. Um, uh, so I think that, you know, when you think about these energy transitions, I think there is a role for government because there is a public benefit in terms of moving towards cleaner fuels and also faster and better transportation.

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       Yeah. So let's just do fracking because every time you say fracking, people think of, you know, the fire coming out of their faucet. They think of, to make another simpsons reference. They think of burns is slant oil drilling company that almost destroyed springfield. Is that what fracking? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       you know, the funny thing is the sort of famous a fire, the famous a water faucet on fire scene. We now, I think we now think came from a much older natural gas. Well, I'm not from fracking and um, and the fracking itself is just breaking up the Rock, the shale rock and allowing the gas to escape. That's not the stuff that you would worry about

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       if you cared about the environment, which you worry about is the disposal of the water and the sealing of the, um, of the, of the pipes where the gas comes out. Um, so the thing is people tend to worry about or think about. I think you just got tied up with the word fracking as well, which sounds like a bad word, but the funny thing is like, I'm just like, you know, coal has actually gotten cleaner over the years. Natural gas has gotten cleaner over the years. Oil burning cars, everything is cleaner and better. Um, but never as good as that next cleaner energy source. So the better way to think about it, I think as we get caught up in like how do you get the gas and whatever, you need to have some protection of the environment and the public. But really the main event is to move from these dirty, your energy sources to cleaner ones.

Speaker 3:          00:33:24       Okay. So let's talk about your campaign for governor of the Great State of California. You were a lifetime Democrat and as you said, your parents were progressive, left these liberals. Uh, but you're running as an independent. I'm running as a democrat. Oh, you are running. It did change. It did. Dodo. I, uh, I, when I announced I saw some resident dependent and I, and I was and am frustrated and upset with the Democratic Party. Um, you know, I mean, I was raised like this was like the party of the people. That was what my parents taught me and that's what I believed and it has been completely taken over by basically landlords and energy companies and special interests. And in California and things have gotten worse, not better. Highest poverty rate in the country, highest taxes. Those two things aren't supposed to go together. Those were supposed to go the other way.

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       Exactly. You're just going to have the highest taxes then you should have of Massachusetts, levels of poverty and if you're going to have the highest levels of poverty, then you just have like no tax or something. Right? So something's really wrong with the party. And you know, I'm a little bit like going from that scene, from the abyss when Ed Harris takes his ring off and he like throws it in the toilet because he's so upset with his marriage. I felt a little bit like that at the Democratic Party. It was like just, you know, and then I kind of fished it out of the toilet, you know, put it back on my hand. And I was like, okay, if I'm going to do this, not only do I have to, you know, become governor, we also have to clean up the legislature. You have to get a serious reformers in and we've got to reform the Democratic Party because it's just not responsive to the people.

Speaker 3:          00:34:57       Maybe abyss reference in politics is works for me. Good. Okay. Howard, that ship let's just. Exactly. It had to be at the alien ship by the way. Not to mention the alien ship fusion. Wait. So okay. So you originally said Independent. Now I get your frustrations with the Democrats watching this understands I'm with you on that. What, what caused you to shift? Was that purely a tactical? It's just even back to Democrat. Yeah, yeah. I mean it's, it's a little bit like it's probably more emotional and sort of about just who I am and just kind of being like not wanting to give up on this thing that I believed in. You know, like I said, I think the Democratic Party up until like 1975 was right on a bunch of stuff. It started getting really crazy after that and frankly started becoming kind of the opposite of what it was supposed to be.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       Particularly in California. It became really an aristocratic party we've put in place and almost a feudal system in this state where you have just a huge number of very wealthy people. We subsidize a small number of lottery winning poor people who basically work as the servant class for the rich and then we drive the middle class people out of the state and, and that is not what the Democratic Party was about before 1975. And you truly are not being hyperbolic about this because just as someone that bought a house in the last year that the house prices, and you referenced this earlier about the housing crisis, the house prices are, are legitimately insane. Where I used to live, uh, now I'm in a cheaper area here, I don't want to say exactly where, but where I used to live in west Hollywood to get literally a one bedroom, one bathroom house that wasn't completely dilapidated, literally a million dollar.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       Oh yeah, no, I mean, look in 2011 when Jerry Brown took office, over half of Californians could afford a middle class home today, just 28 percent can millennials in California, only a quarter own homes. And the rest of the country it's over 50 percent. So if you're a millennial or renter, uh, you work for your salary, um, you're on the losing side of how California has got this set up. I mean, so that's why I'm running is I the more I learned about the corruption and really just the destruction of the California dream, you know, which is, which actually precedes the American dream. You know, historically California dream was opportunity owner home, great schools, beautiful weather. We slowed the good weather when there is in fire coming mudslide. Oh no, that's okay. Um, yeah, so it's like the state is full of these contradictions, right? We say we're the most progressive state, but we have the highest poverty rate and the highest levels of inequality.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       You know, we say we're the land of opportunity, but we won't let people build homes. You know, we have this incredible gift which is this tech economy. Silicon Valley is really driving economic growth, not just in the state but in the country and arguably around the world. And yet like we won't let people build like little apartment buildings are a little, little new subdivisions. I mean we've got spectacular natural areas that we're always going to protect. But here's the most stunning thing. The biggest use of land and the state is cattle ranching, still like a 19th century economic activity. And we won't let people. What? We can't let people build a home because of the cattle were putting cattle and cows before middleclass people before millennials that, you know, you and me, a gen x, we might be able to sneak in there. We got our homes at the law we got in before they shut the door finally. But millennials are really in trouble unless we can significantly expand housing. So what is the solution in terms of taxes? It seems to me, I've only been in La for five years. I'm only a homeowner for, or I've only been in California for five years. I'm only a homeowner for basically a year. We were taxed at incredibly high levels. Uh, obviously I'm not into that and as

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       you're saying, the money that they're raising doesn't seem to be doing the things in terms of helping the people who need it the most doesn't even really working. How do you fix that and how would you fix that from inside? The machine that you're saying is actually so corrupt?

Speaker 2:          00:38:50       Well, this is the, this was one of the most exciting parts. I mean, it was funny, um, because I was so focused on energy, you know, and then it was kind of, okay, I'm going to try to deal with, look at California as a whole and my brain's been hurting because there's so much to learn, but when you get a broader view of it, you what you understood, you have a broader picture that goes, look, we need high levels of economic growth. You need high paying jobs. That means that we can't. We've got to stop losing good manufacturing jobs to Texas, you know, we've got to get Toyota to stay here. We got to get, you know, I mean really it's about supplying these big multinationals, Boeing and our apple making high value products for the high value components to those, those products essentially

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       purely a tax break thing. Is that purely the thesis?

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       Sometimes it's just infrastructure and sometimes it's just having housing for their workers. Toyota took 3000 high paid executive jobs from California to Texas because they, because they couldn't afford the housing, the executives were like, look, in Texas I can buy a house for much less. The median price home in California is two and a half times higher than the national average, so just having more homes makes the state more able to retain high paying jobs. So these things are all interconnected in that way. So housing, sometimes just infrastructure, you know, like if an Amazon or a costco or whatever, if they need some infrastructure built and it's a good deal, we should be doing that. And the reason that we're not is because the leaders of our state and the leaders of this party really don't believe in it. They really are about keeping California expensive and elite to themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       I mean, it's really a country club kind of liberalism. It's not. It's really illiberalism. So if Jerry Brown was sitting here and heard you say that, what, what do you think is counter argument to that would be. He would say that he's been trying to get housing built, but he's just got these powerful special interests. I mean, he says that he does say it directly, so as the unions and the environmentalist are opposed to it now, I've looked closely at this question and the truth is that most of the labor unions, especially like sci, you or the Teachers Union, 70 percent of teachers can afford a home in California. I mean, that's just scandalous. Most of the unions want to see more housing. There's three unions, tiny trade unions, mechanics, the mechanical, electrical and plumbing, which are basically working with the anti development environmental organizations to prevent a reform that would very modest reforms that would basically prevent frivolous lawsuits under are very good environmental laws.

Speaker 2:          00:41:08       We have good environmental laws that are being destroyed by people using them to block housing projects for reasons that have nothing to do with the environment. In order to that they can manipulate the projects, get their way in a variety of ways. Can you give me an example of one of those? Yeah, I totally can. I'm in Berkeley in my hometown, uh, the New York Times did a great piece on it. There is a single family home in Berkeley that they wanted to a nice sized lot. They wanted to demolish the home and put up three homes, sort of switched them vertically and you have a little driveway that would go in and one of the neighbors have organized against it. I'm one of the reasons they gave is that complain that it would cast shade on their garden. And it was like they have a photo of the garden, The New York Times and it's just the most pathetic looking like, I'm sorry, like, that was like that.

Speaker 2:          00:41:54       I don't even think those plants are alive, you know, and like they were like, well, we use it to produce food for ourselves. I was like, if that were true, you'd all be starving to death, you know. So stuff like that, um, you know, there's sort of a question, is it, is it economically rational? In other words, if you allow another house get built, will your property value decline? I just don't think there's any. Supposedly you've, you have more supply, the prices would go down, but there's just so much pent up demand for housing. I don't even think that's the case. So it's a lot of that petty stuff. The unions use it a lot to, to, to get high wage project labor agreements. I'm in favor of high wages, especially if you have such high housing prices but, but fundamentally you need a lot more housing. We need a least twice as much housing built annually. Then we're building just to keep pace with demand.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       Yeah. Is there some argument though for that, for that family that doesn't want the shade in their backyard? Even if the garden is nothing or whatever like I can think to here in La, you know, in the Playa Vista area, that's where youtube and Google is and it was pretty much nothing there. Then they put up all of this. Now what is insanely expensive? Um, I mean I'm talking two or $3,000,000 for a town home, not even for your own home with virtually no property, but that it seems to be. There's some argument for the people that did live there for 30 years that don't want all of this monstrous stuff around them. My slogan, I say this as someone that doesn't want the government to mitigate all of that, but you know, and I guess, look at the end of the day, they might get bought out at a really nice rate. Right. So that's. So that would be good.

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       Yeah. I mean my um, the slogan that we're, we're, we're, we're playing with is um, give change a chance, you know, I mean here you live in a city. Okay. You know, you're living in a city near mass transit. I mean, you're in an industrial heavy, you know, your home has increased in value dramatically and then you kind of go, we'll know. No one can make any change in my neighborhood. I mean, I just think everybody is, needs to be more reasonable. I mean, my basic view is like there needs to be more housing everywhere in the cities, in the suburbs protect our natural areas. They're fine. Like there's so much land in the state, plenty of land in the cities and the suburbs. Everyone just needs to be a bit more, give a little bit more, be a little bit more reasonable. Um, you know, and the reforms that I'm talking about are things were don't allow multiple lawsuits against one project, you know, and make sure that you have to identify yourself right now.

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       You can sue anonymously, you know, if you're gonna, if you're gonna, try to stop an important project to house these really valuable workers. I mean, here we have brought people from all around the country, all around the world who are these talented technology programmers and marketing type people or whatever. And then we say to them, oh, you have to pay $4,000 a month for a one bedroom, you know, and if they want to buy a home, we say, you're out of luck. You know, I, it's just, that's not what the California dream was about. It wasn't about, I got mine and now forget everybody else. The California dream was expansive. It was, it was said, hey, you know, this is a, an amazing state in the greatest state, in the greatest country in the world. We've got to be more open. So I sense basically you want lower taxes basically.

Speaker 2:          00:44:56       Right? Which is, that's going to put you at somebody with the Democrats. Yeah, I mean, on the taxes. Let's talk about taxes. I mean the first thing you have to understand is that like there's sort of like, what would I do if I could start with a blank piece of paper? You know, and then there's like, okay, if you become, when you become governor, you're immediately negotiating with all these different interests. And by interests I don't mean just even organized interest groups. I just mean like homeowners who are kind of like, you know, don't want to change. So there's a very famous law in California, probably no prop 13 passed in 1978 and it restricts how much taxes can go up on a home. So if you bought a home for a half a million dollars and it increased to a million dollars in say five years, you would only, you can only, they can only increase your taxes two percent a year.

Speaker 2:          00:45:39       Um, and um, and you know, the reason given a sort of a sound sensible, which is that you don't want to, like, you know, someone for no fault of their own selling, their house is worth a lot and then suddenly they're being hit with the tax bill they can't afford. So you basically, even though you've had a great investment, you can't even afford your investment. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that, again, I think there just needs to be some reasonableness, so it's considered the third rail of California politics to even suggest reforming prop 13. But I think we do need to reform it. And part of the reason is that our current taxes are so lopsided with the highest sales tax in the country, the highest income taxes on the top earners. And you might go, well that's progressive because they have more money. But the problem is, is that every time the economy goes into recession, we're just in massive debt, right?

Speaker 2:          00:46:25       So the when and then when we have a surplus like we had this year, it's because the stock market's been going crazy. So when the one percent, so it's Kinda funny that people that are like, we got to tax the one percent more. It's like, well we've made the entire economy, all of our schools, you know, all of these government services completely dependent on the fortunes of the stock market. So we're a state founded on boom and bust the gold rush. But we gotta get more stability in those finances. So I think there's just got to be. I think these things like housing reform I think has to be done as a whole. And I think similarly the tax and budget form has to be done as a whole because I think everybody, it's a classic prisoner's dilemma, right? Where it's like, well I'm not going to want to think of anything and I'm going to stay on, stay strong because, you know, make them get first. So everyone's going to have to be. I'm still like, I don't know, I can't make my slogan be a little bit more reasonable, but dogs. Um, but I think you've got to get, I mean that's what you're supposed to do as governor race was to bring to the table, kind of go look, everyone's gonna need to make some compromises and I don't think they're that big. I mean when you fly over, I mean certainly la, the bay area, it's just a lot of single family homes, like everywhere and you're kind of

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       like, look, you're right in the middle of the city, you know, you gotta allow like a four or five story building to go up. And similarly you see a lot of lawsuits to block like additional homes in the suburbs by the people that just had their homes built in the suburbs. You know, it's always like, oh yeah, the last guy up the ladder is the one that's like most fiercely kicking it away. Right. Well, West Hollywood that I mentioned before, they put a moratorium. They were building all these sort of what they were kind of calling like these mcmansions, you know, these very modern, tall things. And then they were basically dotting the neighborhoods thus causing shade and everyone else's. They actually stopped them from doing it for awhile I think. I think it just expired. So I mean you kind of go look, you know, you won the lottery.

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       You if you bought a home in California anytime in the last, you know, 30 years or you know, even like you've probably seen your prices even go up just one last year. Look, you've done really well like you've made. You've often male. If you bought your home in like 2010, let's say, you know, or, or if you bought it in 2000 or 1990 or 1980, you made a big chunk of money on your home. So then then to then turn around and say, well no, my taxes shouldn't go up at all, is just unreasonable. It's like, you know, that's just not fair to everybody else who comes in later. You know, they show you in my home, I bought my home, I pay 10 times more in taxes on my home. Then the people that owned it prior, you know, I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay a little bit more in taxes coming a little bit later and uh, know maybe a higher income, but 10 times, you know, that's, that's the part where it's kind of like, what is it exactly going to be?

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       It's like you're going to have to negotiate something that's just a lot more fair than my current situation. I like that you're kind of talking about this in a holistic way because it seems to me that you definitely still have some progressive leanings, which is totally fine, but I can tell you also have some libertarian leanings and I actually do think that that's where most people fall, which is why I think that this sort of interesting center that's developing lately makes some sense. Yeah, I mean, look, the market is absolutely amazing, right? And does so well on so many things. It doesn't do everything, you know? I don't think it just seems to have to be so extreme, you know, it's like, um, like I said, like most of the major technologies and the iphone came out of the Defense Department, you know, jet turbines which allows us to do jet travel, came out of the military.

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       Um, you know, a lot of the technologies that are making the environment better. Um, electric cars, fuel cells, these things are all supported by government, r and d when you're talking about 20 years of subsidies to industries that are plowing money into campaign contributions and the technology's still aren't very good. That's when you have real problems, but it's almost impossible to beat that machine, right? I mean, that's really what you're up against right there. If you're going to really say we got to stop subsidizing some of this massive stuff and I suspect Jerry Brown probably gets a lot of money from those guys and just just that the machine itself has existed for so long. That's really what you're up again. Well, what's cool is that, so when I got into this discovery, this really this corruption scandal that I think is really important, but most people their eyes glaze over, it involves the public utilities. Everyone's like, all

Speaker 2:          00:50:29       right, but I just, you know, I mean what I learned about it is I was like, well, how do public, how do you, how do you solve corruption? Like there's a history here. So what you discover is that there's just these natural cycles of corruption and reform and they've occurred several times in the 20th century. One of them occurred in the 19 twenties and thirties and other one occurred in the 19 seventies. So I was like, oh, like we're overdue for another period of reform. I mean that's, that's where it's, I think people kind of go, you're up against this huge machine. And it's like, yeah, and if you knew how bad it, if you knew how corrupt it was, like I know you will be all about overthrowing it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       Yeah. Is that not though a purely libertarian argument that it's like we keep going through these phases, then we put in new laws, they gets better for a little while, then it gets worse, but that the libertarian argument would be all right, get rid of all these laws were extremely overregulated here in California. Get rid of all of this and let's just see what the market actually does because we just simply don't.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       No. Well, you know, you got for some things. I think that makes sense. And for others, I don't think it does. So there are natural monopolies, um, electricity things where you're just doing a lot of infrastructure that is very expensive and then you're kinda like, okay, so we're gonna have two electric companies like stringing of electric. I mean like it's just, that's how we got, that's why we regulate electric utilities and the way we do. Um, now some of them have been privatized, but you're still, you still have monopoly for the Poles and wires. Otherwise it's like, it's already really ugly. Like all the electrical wires, you know, you're an environmentalist, you know, like I'll bury those. Um, but, but you know, it's like, oh no, we're gonna have a whole second or third set of electrical wires. So the government was like, look, just you can have a monopoly and you can even be a privately owned company but you can't price gouge. Right. So like you're going to come to us and go, hey gotta raise rates. And we kind of go, oh, okay. So some of it's negotiated and just a little bit messier. Is there corruption? Definitely some, some extent. Is it inevitable? I think it is,

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       but I think it's inevitable meaning that because of the way the system worked there eventually, even if they're being controlled a little bit, there's still the only game in town so they can always keep ratcheting it up.

Speaker 2:          00:52:29       I mean like, you know, like Jerry Brown's father I think achieved amazing things in California, you know, the universities, the roads, the water systems, it was a period of high growth as well and he benefited from was there some political corruption in the sense of doing so, giving some contracts to sure you know, what you want is to make sure it doesn't become proportions like we see in the developing world, spend much time in central Africa or in Latin America and you're just getting. You get to the point where the corruption is so severe that nothing gets built. Like at the end of the day it was corruption and Korea where I spent a bunch of time at the end of the day they get the thing built. You know, in other places if you don't get a bill and you're like, well, so I think we've just gotten to a point where it's just gotten so excessive in California, the just the exchange of contributions for contracts and permits has just got to the place where it's just obscene and needs to be fixed and as usual, the best way to fix it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:19       It's just with sunlight and transparency, I mean, you know, they all have these really bad deeds can only occur behind the cover of darkness. And so once you shine a light on it, it tends to take care of itself. Sunlight is the best disinfectant it is. That has been a theme around here. So just tell me about a couple of the other issues that you actually care about that you're campaigning on. Well, one of the ones I'm really excited about is education and you know, what's, what I love about going into an issue that you're sort of new to. I mean, my mom is a public school teacher, was a public, was the teacher's Union Rep and my sister is a, is an education expert. So it's certainly something we've talked about for a long time, but what's the fun to go back into it? Associate fresh and you start to see these fights and arguments between people, um, from a, from a different point of view.

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       I'm not participating in them, but what was so striking for us when we looked at the research was that what's clear is that we've got the school schedule that makes everybody unhappy, right? You go to school at like eight and then you get out at like 2:30, you know, and like all the bad things as you, as you and I know from our childhoods occurs between 2:30 and when your parents come up and then you have these after through the best hours of like. Exactly. I don't. Yeah, I'm going to take them away. That's the problem. You know what I mean? So I think schools have to work for parents, so it be nine to five, like why is it you have to cobble together afterschool programs and these things and that is, we're like, often kids fall behind. Um, I also think the school year should be longer.

Speaker 2:          00:54:41       Um, and I think teachers want to be treated like professionals. There's nothing more demoralizing for teachers than like bad teachers because that's what my parents would come home and complain about bad teachers all the time. So you've got to build to move out the bad principals, move out the bad teachers, you've got to have a proper professional school day. And that first part though, that's it. That's a big fight you'd be taking against it is absolutely. Yeah. And they've got to give. I mean, look, the teachers are unhappy. I mean the turnover rate is just through the roof. I mean, like I said, 17 percent of them can't afford to live here. So. So I do think teachers that are performing should be paid better. I think the school should be nine to five. I think the school year should be longer. What we know is that the more time that kids get instructional time, their performance goes up and our performance in California has been going down even though we put $20 million more in the schools over the last seven years.

Speaker 2:          00:55:29       And that's what seems to be one of the places that again, libertarian, crazy California. It's like you keep pumping money into things, but then every time we tested, every time you look at the numbers and we compare you state by state, it's worse. It's worse than it is, it's frankly, it's a scandal and the people that suffer the most, it's the usual, the poor African Americans, Latinos, um, performance has been flat line or even declining. And so because, you know, if you're, if you're wealthy, if you're, you know, if you're privileged you can send your kids to private summer science camp and stuff like that. So. So I would like to see a significant reform. Again, it has to go with taxes. If you're going to go year round is probably going to cost more. How are we going to finance that? Again, you just got to have a wholesale reform of taxes. I think education, what is exciting though, is that a longer school day and a longer school year, it means you have more time to do the instructional on math and science and reading which kids need to get up to snuff. But then you also have the time for stuff arts,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       you know, physical education. We need to do more physical education and then it allows for the dea. I mean, here we have a digital technology revolution happening in this state that we're leading and the place that it has not penetrated at all is like the schools, I mean there's some amount of laptop use, but what you get with the digital revolution is that you can be a so, so math lecturer or teacher, but the kids can get it now on Khan Academy or they can watch Ted talks that people that do a much better job explaining it and then the teachers can roam and be tutors. My mom was also a tutor and when I was a kid one time she tutored me and she usually tutored learning disabled kids and she treated me. I was like, wow. It was like, I learned so much in like an hour.

Speaker 3:          00:57:04       I was like, tutoring works with all kids. And she was like, yeah, tutoring works with everybody. So you call it flipping the classroom. Kids get the lectures from digital devices, chromebooks or, or smart phones or just from TV's. Um, and then the teachers can roam and do tutoring and then that allows, that solves a big problem which is that both the overachieving kids and the underachieving kids are being neglected as, as teachers try to get the kids in the middle to pass the tests. It's an interesting concept because there is so much information accessible at your fingertips. I mean the amount of people that watch shows like this. Just for some information. My friend Greg Gutfeld, he's been on the show, wrote a great piece a couple of weeks ago about how it's like all the stuff that you're supposed to learn in college that unfortunately now because of the hysteria colleges that you're not learning, right?

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       You can go online and hear lectures from incredible professors like Jordan Peterson again said and listen to these guys tell you all of the things that they're supposed to be telling you at college. And guess what? If Youtube, it's free. It's wonderful. Wonderful. It's wonderful. I mean, Khan Academy is this beautiful. My daughter does it on her. She has an iphone. She's 12, which I was a reluctant about, but with what? With Khan Academy, these beautifully perfect lectures that are designed to that we know that they work, the kids then interact with it. You still need to have a role for people because you need the interaction, you need the group work between the kids. You knew the teachers going around. But I mean we are just massively underperforming as a country and as a state when it comes to education, we're getting our tails beat by, by my much poor developing countries like Korea.

Speaker 3:          00:58:34       Um, the longer school I hear that and I think suddenly I became a 12 year old what I know about myself. So what do you, what do you actually mean by that? Well, I mean, again, I think cost is going to be something we're gonna have to deal with because it will, it will almost certainly cost more money. So, you know, I'm Kinda like, we've got a nine month year now. I'd love to see us get to 11 months. You know, some parents don't want to take their kids away for a month or you know, travel around or whatever. Just like overloading kids with information because I think we're generally, because of our smart phones and twitter and everything is we're in an information overload. What about the value of that two month break that we had as children will. The problem is is that during that break was huge cognitive declines.

Speaker 3:          00:59:15       It's very well documented now that we just. Kids will forget a lot of stuff and then you start the next school year and you review for the first several weeks or months. The older stuff, the kids that suffer the most are the less affluent kids, African American kids, Latino kids whose parents don't send them to science camp during the summer. So, but in terms of overloading the biggest problem of the overloading is the school day. You're cramming all this stuff in between like eight and two, you know, and so sometimes somebody will be like, well what about like elementary school? Like little kids need to take a nap, you know, it's like, great, take a nap. Maybe the teachers could take an attitude. What about arts? And so I think there should be more, like, as a writer, I walk a lot, I don't know how I could ever write anything if I didn't just walk and think about it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:57       So it should be more of, there should be more downtime to respect the fact that our brains get tired and the kids need some time off and the first part of the day's gonna be more productive than the second part of the day. But if you have more time you can deal with that. The other thing is that I'm going to eliminate homework and I'm going to eliminate schoolwork for teachers. So, um, so get yourself back in your 12 year old mind. No more homework. All the homework is done at school. Okay. Because you were losing me a little bit with exactly. But now no homework, no homework. And then my mom would come home, you know, she would come home from school, whatever it was, 4:00, 5:00, make dinner, and then she would go back to work grading papers and preparing for lessons like in the evenings when it should have been family time.

Speaker 3:          01:00:37       Um, and, and I think that what I'd like to say to teachers is just go, look, you get to leave work at work, you get to be what everybody else gets to do. You go home from work and you're not supposed to work anymore. I get to watch television, watch a movie with your kids and then the kids too, they get to leave the work at school and so the homework and the school work, the grading and the lesson plans, all that gets done at school and is opened up by having kids are able to get a personalized digital education with like the best world world's best lecturers and teachers online. So that's an interesting way of kind of splitting the difference. Okay, we're going to extend this day. Yeah. Um, which sort of goes against my feeling about overloading, but they were going to build things in which are going to allow teachers to be able to do some more work and students to.

Speaker 3:          01:01:20       Absolutely. I mean kids are kids used to learn how to draw like properly, right? And we have like art classes, but like who knows how to really just draw, right? Like you look at the 19th century edgy, you know, you kind of go, that might be one of the things that gets taught again, you know, you have some more time to actually. And there's also like a bunch of stuff now about like you need that social and emotional intelligence to perform well in the business world and you know, just to not be a jerk, you know, those are things that can all be taught, but you need to have the time for it. This thing of rushing in 45 minutes through math and rushing for the minutes of reading in history is, is just a, it's a, it's based on, uh, you know, when we were farmers, you know, and when we thought people were preparing people for the factories, now we know that we're all so different and how we learn. We're at different levels. We can go at different paces. I wasn't very good at math. I was very, I was pretty good at reading. You can get an education that's really tailored to you once you have that time and you have to open up that digital universe that already exists. Yeah. Give me a couple more. Your, your major thing. So yeah, so we went through, so we went through housing,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       we went through jobs and through schools obviously energy, cheap, reliable, clean energy is essential to be able to bring back those good manufacturing jobs. There's, you know, people have the wrong idea. They think, oh, the manufacturing has to go abroad, high tech manufacturing needs to be here, but it needs cheap energy and it also needs skilled workers. So one of the other reforms that occurs and as the relationship between the jobs and the school's apprenticeship programs, you know, young people want to have mentors, they want to have masters that they apprentice with will. So let's get Boeing and apple to have supplier companies here, whether it's in the central valley or in La and it should be, have a direct relationship to the high schools and the community colleges. And then we need the cheap energy. So we've got two nuclear plants. They've shut down one of them through and that's what led to the corruption scandal that trying to shut down the second one, they, they provide total 40 percent of our clean electricity in the state.

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       I want to get them started back up again. People worry about the safety. I think they shouldn't be worried, but the other cool thing that's going on is that they haven't made a lot of progress in what are called accident tolerant fuels, fuels that if there is a loss of coolant and as a risk of overheating, it would take many hours and potentially many days before they overheat. So if those fuels, those fuels should be tested in our art. We were innovation central here in California, so we should be testing these, these innovative meltdown proof fuels, um, and then really pioneering their use and their diffusion throughout the whole, um, around the whole country and around the whole world. So I think, um, and then, you know, there's just so many other needs for that energy. Basically, if you have abundant, cheap, clean energy, then you can desalinate water.

Speaker 2:          01:04:03       This whole water crisis that Los Angeles and California find themselves periodically in doesn't need to exist at all with cheap, abundant and clean energy. You can recycle the water, you can disseminate the water. There should be plenty of water for the farmers and for people that live in the cities. La should be green as idea that we have to turn off our water. Is, is just part of that forced deprivation and, and manufactured scarcity that came out of an ideological turn, you know, against the prosperity in the seventies. That's what I want to. I think that's the revolution that we want to offend your telling me. Everywhere I go, we're in between the roads go in one way or the other and they have the grass that's not green anymore because we're saving what it is. That's actually not necessary. You don't need to do it. I mean, yeah, it will cost some energy to desalinate and to recycle.

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       But look, we agreed to the whole desert in California was deserts and turn them into farms. This, you know, this whole area was very arid. Um, we have the technology to produce abundant water. And abundant and greenery and, and we, that's in abundant greenery is wonderful for a lot of reasons that keeps the city's cooler. It captures carbon and um, you know, so there's just, and it makes life more pleasant. But this idea where we all have to sort of this austerity, this forest sacrifice, austerity really starts with an attack on cheap, clean energy and, and in particular on nuclear. Anything I needed to know a lot of the social stuff with you. I have a of, I could probably figure

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       it out. Yeah. Just buy everything else. I know. I don't think the government should decide who gets married. We're good to go. I mostly think that stuff has been a way to just drive us apart. And I mean, Trent is. Trent does anything. Transgender bathrooms. It was like one of the big issues facing California. Nobody does, you know, um, I don't even think that people in North Carolina or wherever that now you think it's a big issue there. I know. So I think like, you know, I, I'd like to actually get to a place where it's like we're talking about what's the common good and not, you know, what effects this interest group or this, you know, I, I just, I think that identity politics has just gone really too far. It's made us lose sense of who we are as a people. Yeah. Well I feel like that might be the sentence we should end this on because I had been looking, my whole audience says I've been looking for somebody that sounded like a sensible, a Democrat that I could, you know, try to want to support.

Speaker 3:          01:06:09       Oh, you know, real quick, uh, my former guys, Zoltan Istvan is also running for California here as, is he running well he's a transhumanist, technically a party that can run or is he running as an independent do? Well, you can. Um, what's cool is that we have, will told an open primary and so anybody can go for anybody. And so if you're Democrat you can go for a Republican and independent just means declined to state. So yeah. So, um, but maybe you're gonna endorse me, not talk about that after, but I had been looking for a Democrat that I go, oh, that's what demo. Yeah, it is. And yet you're not ignoring the future and we'll know because in some ways you go like it was the Democrats pre 1975 that believed in the future. The ones after that side kick away the ladder. What's unforced scarcity and let nobody else come and enjoy this beautiful paradise that we have. But there's plenty of room, you know, this is a, this is a state I want to get back in touch with the values of abundance and opportunity and an openness that I think had been shot and not. And not just by the left either, I think by both sides. Yeah. Well listen, it's been a pleasure talking to you. Good luck on the campaign. And for more on Mike and his campaign, you can go to Shelan Burger.org.
