Speaker 1:          00:00:02       All

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       right, we're going to mix it up this week and talk about something a little less controversial than usual feminism. Everyone agrees on that, right? Okay, good. That's what I thought. My guest this week is Christina Hoff summers. Christina is a former philosophy professor, author and a speaker for the American Enterprise Institute known for her critique of late 20th century feminism. Over the past few months. I've become familiar with Christina because her name kept popping up all over my twitter feed at first related to Gamergate and now because of her tongue and cheek commentary on campus, free speech, trigger warnings and safe spaces. Actually thanks to twitter and to all of you who've helped connect me with likeminded people. The show is really taken off in a way I couldn't have imagined. Suddenly I find myself immersed with people I truly admire and respect. We're all talking to each other in various mediums and strengthening the ideals we stand for, even if we don't agree on every specific issue.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       One such an issue that I haven't tackled too deeply yet is feminism and that's exactly why I wanted to have Christina on as an equity feminists. Christina cares about both women's and men's rights. You know that whole two things can be true at once. Idea that I've been talking about, I shouldn't say that feminism in and of itself isn't one of my bread and butter topics. As you guys know, I love discussing politics, foreign policy, religion and secularism and more, but haven't done a ton on the topic of feminism. Of course, the argument could be made that feminism and the fight for women's rights is an absolute through line. Through all of the topics I just mentioned. Generally speaking, where women are treated with equality, we see fair societies with more secular values and less radicalism. This isn't a coincidence, nor is it something that should be overlooked.

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       Actually, if anything, it should be embraced. If a society treats their women fairly, it is almost always a more successful society. On every other front, the battle for equality of women has been different all over the world and continues in almost every form today. This is one of the main issues that I wanted to discuss with Christina. How is the battle for equality evolved over the years? Have there been unintended consequences by coming so far in the battle? Has Feminism morphed into something that feminist of the 19 sixties wouldn't even recognize today? And what happens when an equality movement actually accomplishes its goals? Do we move on to what's next? There's the battle never truly end. As you can see, I've got a lot of questions and I hope Christina has some of the answers. For me, the battle for women's rights is the same battle that has been fought by the other for all time.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       I want women to have 100 percent of the opportunity that men have. I want the doors to be open and the glass ceiling to be shattered. Winning these battles doesn't mean it has to come at the expense of men, nor does it mean that men should suddenly become less than women and at the same time we should acknowledge the sexes are actually different and that's okay too. From our hunter gatherer days to today, gender roles have existed long before any of us pretending there aren't some differences in the sexist won't magically make it true. Perhaps we can try to embrace these differences rather than tacking labels on everyone and thinking that one group's equality can only come at the expense of another group's opportunity. If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, then perhaps it's time we brought both sexes back to Earth. My guest this week is a speaker and author and host of the factual feminist on youtube. She's known as based mom by the Gamergate gang and just finished a three hour conversation with Joe Rogan, so I hope you have a little something left. Christina Hoff sommers. Welcome to the show. A lovely to be here. Do you have a little something?

Speaker 3:          00:03:34       I do. I do. I'm just getting started.

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       Yeah. So did you did three? Did he go a little over? Where were you with your long?

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       Just his little man cave there. It was the very cozy little studio.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Well, right before is that now we were saying how there's this new gang sort of that has appeared sort of you, Joe, Milo, me, a few other people that sort of have magically connected even though just months ago we really didn't know each other and yet we're all talking about a lot of the same stuff. It's pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          00:04:03       Right? Right. And, and I think that what we are is we're rejecting the cultural authoritarians and so we come from different political places, but we share this commitment to freedom and you know, just live and let live. What happened to that?

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       What happened to that? All right, so I want to spend a lot of time talking about the cultural libertarians and the authoritarians and all of that stuff. But first let's start somewhere else. Let's start with based mom because that's the phrase that popped up many times and I see people tweeting this. Anytime I'm involved in a, in a twitter thing with you based on what is, what does that actually mean for the person? That

Speaker 3:          00:04:38       first I thought it meant cool mom and I was happy with that, but it turns out it means something very positive and just as good but different in the lingo of the gamers and maybe they got it from a rap song or something, but based means grounded, authentic, no bs they would say. And I'm. So that's what I am and I'm happy to be based mom. I like being a mom, which I am. And being based is obviously a good things.

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       There you go. All right. So, uh, so let's start with the factual feminist. Let's go there first. I want to do a little history of feminism, but what brought you personally to be doing these types of videos and talking about this stuff? Just your journey a little.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       Well, I've always been a, I was a professor for many years and wrote skull scholarly articles and books and I wasn't doing videos on youtube. I thought that was at the time I thought it was about, I don't know, cats. It's still mostly, but it's still mostly cat. Yeah. And um, but this young man came to a Gi and wanted to get the scholars on the air and he did videos with all of us and then he came to me and said, you, we want to put you on, I want you to have a weekly show, just come and talk. And I said about what, what are you talking about? And he said, it's no more than five minutes preferably for and how do I do that? But I started to do it and I thought, okay, once a week approximately, I will go on and correct a feminist myth because there are so many.

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       And I just wanted the opportunity to reason with people to analyze some of these factoids, factoids. We are in an inundated with ms dot information, if you excuse the pun, just false information about women. They tend to exaggerate. They, these researchers slash activist tend to exaggerate women's vulnerability and to overstate the strength of men when in fact it's a complicated mix of benefits and burdens for both sexes. And so when they say, oh, women are being cheated out of twenty three cents on the dollar and one for being sexually assaulted, it just turns out these ridiculous exaggerations and the truth is entirely different. And so I just patiently tried to expose the myths. When I first started, my mother said, well darling, are you going to run out of topics? I said, mom, I will never run out of topics because we have had going on, you know, three decades of specious research coming out of gender studies and it all needs to be reconsidered. Some of it might be right. I, I occasionally, I find something that's not a just twisted into I'm a myth. And so I, I correct a myth every week.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       Yeah. So before we dive right into the feminist of how do you like being in this space, because obviously it is new to you to be in the youtube space and interacting with people and twitter and all that. I mean, did you ever expect to be sort of a hero to the Gamer gay community? I want to talk about that later too, but just being in this interesting digital, new thing.

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       No, no, I didn't think I would. I remember a few years ago before I was on twitter, I said, oh, I'll never do that. I don't know how to do that. I just, it was unapproachable. Well now I can't get off. It's so addicting. But um, I didn't expect it, but I'm happy to do it because here's the thing about that I like about twitter, so I don't just give a message, I link if people are interested and try to back up everything I say with solid scholarship and link I linked to the best sources I can find or to my own work that I've done for over the decades. So I linked to books and articles if people are interested. So it's, it's as if all of my writing has a new life.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Yeah. And it's also very validating, I think to be in the space that we are when there's so much misinformation related to whatever, whether it's feminism or political correctness or any of that. And there's so many bad actors. I think in this space, so it's angry people, but, but for us it's nice that we can be like, look, here's some information and then we can go back and forth when we want and it's, it's, uh, it's very freeing to me. I find and then when I'm able to connect with like minded people, I find it to be great.

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       I find it great and all I ever wanted as a college professor, I never saw it as my position to sort of replicate my view of the world in the minds of my students. Heaven forbid I wanted to open the world to them, show them the best that was thought and said on different contentious issues in, in metaphysics and ethics as well as when, when I was teaching occasionally would teach gender theory. But when I taught gender theory, I found that there was the, the, the closed mindedness combined with a kind of a pension for conspiracy theories, paranoid theories about the patriarchy. That didn't happen. It's not to exist, at least not certainly not in the United States or western Europe. And, uh, I just, I thought if I had my ideal university, I would take, I would have some radicals there because you can always learn from people that are pushing the envelope. Sure. But you don't only have radicals and engender scholarship, it may be a bit of an overstatement, but I don't think so really. That's all we have.

Speaker 2:          00:09:47       Okay. So before we get told that, let's back up a little, let's just lay out some basic definitions because I do find that with a lot of these people don't even understand what a feminist is anymore. You know, you have your first wave feminist or second wave feminist, third wave feminists. Now there's things beyond that that, that you've coined. I'm so, can you just break down some of the basic what, what, what was the first feminist movement? Just give me a couple.

Speaker 3:          00:10:08       Well, that would be the suffrage movement and that was the struggle for the vote. And then after, when women earn the vote, uh, there was a period of queen essence and we didn't hear much from feminists throughout the thirties, forties, fifties. And it came back in the late sixties, early seventies, and that was the second wave and it had worked to do. There were a lot of just arbitrary barriers preventing women holding women back. They needed to be taken down. It was obviously time to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       And this was more like in the workforce, things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:10:42       Changing the workplace, changing education. I'm addressing things of, uh, you know, legally for women to have more defenses against harassment in the workplace and so forth. All of that. I was totally on board. That's just basic quest for equality. But what happened is that the second wave of feminism, a lot of the women in the universities were quite radical and they were not about equality. They were not about, I see feminism, the best of feminism. It came from the European enlightenment and it was about the intrinsic dignity of all men and women and extending equality of opportunity and liberty and so forth to, to all they, many of them rejecting enlightenment. And they're not about freedom and freedom of expression. And they are really. They use their classrooms, I think, to promote a very rigid worldview about how women are preyed upon by men and it's almost as if the as if better things got for women, the more bitter they became, and I watched this from close up because I was teaching in the University of Washington. I kept thinking they would be discredited because it their views will not withstand 20 minutes in a seminar room with some just objective scholars, but they do not subject their research to scrutiny of objective scholars. They receive the evaluate one another.

Speaker 2:          00:12:06       Right? So was this a strange example of where things could exist sort of in the academic world where perhaps they wouldn't. These ideas wouldn't have played out in the real world?

Speaker 3:          00:12:14       Well, they didn't and I didn't see them in the real world and I thought they would be contained in the academy and then would go away. That has not happened because partly because of social media and these twitter mobs and things. It's come into the mainstream and now we hear these words like trigger warning or we're going to get plenty of that issue to trigger warning before we sat down. Oh, we should have. Yes, I am a walking trigger warning. Do you consider this a safe space? I'm feeling fairly, fairly frequently. Little microaggressive pond, but not so much.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       Um, okay. So then that was, that was second wave feminism, right. That's a good way. Was involved into that

Speaker 3:          00:12:56       second wave had a radical extreme and that extreme became the mean because they got a monopoly on the, uh, professorships

Speaker 2:          00:13:05       and that's what you would refer to them as third wave feminism.

Speaker 3:          00:13:08       The third. Yeah. Third way was probably the intersectional feminism. Are there various names for it, but it's a, it didn't correct the excesses of second wave feminism. It took those excesses and made them even more extreme.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       Yeah. Now, what would you say to the people that would say, well, all along that ride, even though even if they were to acknowledge some of the things that you're saying all along that ride things, basically we're getting better for women. So maybe there was some reasoning behind, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:13:35       there was some reasoning, but at a certain point what you had is just people. It was kind of a power grab and there were women like me can cal poly a lot of libertarian feminist, dissonant, feminist. We were just disinvited from to a party and students didn't have the benefit of hearing a range of opinion and contentious issues. Take something like something like the wage gap it. If you are an economist and you hear that group a is earning less than Groupie, you know, you want to know why they immediately say discrimination. They blame employers and the patriarchy. But if you do the proper controls that any competent economist would do and you ask, well, how do they differ in any way? Do all the men. Because when you hear that wage gap, they're just doing the average of all the men in the workplace working full time and all the women, well, men and women do not study the same top subjects in college.

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       They do not work the same number of hours. And then on average work more hours. They take more dangerous jobs, women are far more likely to take a few years out of the workplace or more. These are relevant to your earnings. So then what happens when we do the proper controls and they're very good studies. The, the, the Labor Department commissioned a fantastic study that did all proper controls. It gets to a point where they're just a few cents you can't explain now. It could be discrimination and I'm enough of an equity feminist or worry about that if I've been cheated out of a few pennies or a woman are, but chances are it's not. Chances are it would turn out if some innocent explanation.

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       Yeah. So, uh, when it comes to the wage gaps and things like that. So I watched the whole bunch of videos on it before I watched the video, did it, you did on it before this. And partly what I think is what I think when I watch most political things or a almost anything related to news these days, I never knew who to trust. But I watch these studies. I say this study, well why was it done this way? Who funded this? Who funded that? How do you in the mix of all this, figure out what to actually believe

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       what I do, excuse me, as the factual feminist, I tried to determine, well, where, who's the best source? Whereas who sets the gold standard for this research? So when it comes to education, nothing surpasses the, uh, the Department of Education and the Department of Education, they collect statistics and they, they are very good when it comes to crime. Do I believe a feminist activist that tells me that we're all, you know, the majority of women or, or a quarter of women are being raped and assaulted and battered or more, um, I go to the Bureau of Justice Statistics and look at what the, what do the statisticians who do careful and highly disciplined as statistical analyses, what do they find? And they find it something very different and they find out the rape is a terrible, horrendous crime. But it is fairly rare on the campus is not one in four and a or one in five. And, and so I present that. I show people this is what they. These are what sort of objective researchers have found. These are what the advocates have found. Now, some people just want to believe the advocates. I don't understand that.

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       Yeah. All right, well I do want to touch on that in a little bit, but just to finish up just sort of the waves of feminism now. You consider yourself and you coined the phrase, I think equity, feminist, right. Can tell people.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       So an equity feminist. I hope you are. We all are. Is someone who wants for women what he or she wants for everyone? Fair treatment? No discrimination. It's basically comes, as I said, from the enlightenment. It's classical feminism. It's about fairness. It doesn't even have to be called feminism. It's probably humanism or people ism or equalism had I. that's what I assumed most people would be for today. Feminism tends to denote people who are carried away with bail bashing. If I had to reduce it to a few sentences, it would be a women are from Venus and men are from hell and they seem carried away with, with, you know, female chauvinism. I hate to say it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       Okay, so from there. Now let's. Let's backtrack to what you just said about the campus stuff, because I know this is a place where you get a lot of heat for this. When you've talked about the rape situation

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       to overland college and everyone was triggered and 30 people and a dog fled to a safe space. They had a safe room. There was a therapy dog apparently and 30 triggered young women and they went to a safe room and they were so.

Speaker 2:          00:18:05       Which we try to plate, parse that out. What I mean, what does that actually mean? Because I know, I know, we know what it means and we joke about this stuff. I wish I didn't know what they literally because you were coming to speak,

Speaker 3:          00:18:16       that I would give them ptsd now. I have been lecturing on campuses for years and it used to be they'd come and argue and sometimes we part as friends or go to a bar and you know, kind of have a good time to like human beings. And if someone presents me with some good data and good arguments, I'll change my mind. I've changed my mind many times that I look forward to doing it again, but who they are, we're not just something has changed in the last few years on the campus and there's been this medicalization of, of the, of the curriculum and they need trigger warnings for their classes and trigger warnings for this and that. And as I said, they needed them for me and they needed a safe space where they could retreat because as one of them put it, someone would be invalidating my experience. It's like the worst thing that can happen to you. Right? So it wasn't like a good thing to happen. And then because you can't just go by your experience, you have to test it and, and see if your interpretation holds up to criticism. They were not interested in, in any kind of criticism.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       Right? So when, when you hear this happen are new and you see this happen to you and you say, okay, here's the empirical evidence about what's happening with rape on campus. And then they say what? What is their counter argument? Is the counter argument that there's more rape that goes under reported for x, Y, or Z or they're not counting, you know, girls that got drugged or, or something. I mean, what's the, I get that we've become this society that's afraid of every bit of information, but what's the counter?

Speaker 3:          00:19:46       Yeah, well they cite their own studies, but I've spent many years and so many other people looking at these methodological failures. If you, there are ways in which I could, we could throw together a survey tonight and ask people questions and find an epidemic of whatever you want. All you have to do is ask questions that are a little vague and it helps to, to ask a non representative sample of people and um, that's what they do. They ask, they usually a mix of serious questions, but then a few vague ones. That's all you need. Now, does it mean your study is going to be valid? No. Does it mean you're going to generate some useful propaganda for your cars? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       Yeah. Alright. So I saw that, that piece it at Oberlin. And then the other thing that I saw you got heat for was um, the, the cat calling, right? There was this, this video about cat calling and you've sort of said, we're written about that. This is not really a thing, not really thing that, well it exists, but not a thing to be upset by sort.

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       Well, it's complicated and as I said, there are times where it's very threatening, but you have to make distinctions and this is the basis of thought. I mean, human rationality, making distinctions and being out in the public square, there are going to be interactions, you know, people will come up with petitions, people beg for money, people will say things. It's just part of being alive. And these control freaks think that we can police everything that's said on the street and they were actually suggesting that it be against the law to cat call a woman. Well, again, I make a distinction between somebody saying hi, beautiful. I mean, frankly, that wouldn't bother me.

Speaker 3:          00:21:27       It might have bothered me when I was younger, but as you get older you don't mind. Uh, but when I wish somebody saying something disgusting or frightening that is very or stalking you, that's very different, but they, they, to them it's all the same. It's all a micro or macro aggression and they want a law against it. And, and what I pointed out my video is that in Washington DC, there's a place where you can walk and you will be cat called and I have walked there many times and it's in a very busy part near dupont circle and it's a lot of women dressed for success. You know, when their Manolo blahniks they're walking through and the men, well the men are homeless people living in this park and they make comments. So there is a huge class difference between these women. Are we supposed to think these women need to be protected from these guys who are the have nots?

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       Right. So that's an interesting discrepancy that it's not Wall Street bankers walking down the street making these comments were. Then there's sort of an added layer of, of a financial difference in social status and all that. It's usually coming from people beneath, I suppose not always offered it and gave that enough to dismiss it. As, you know. I get what you're saying. There's a wild discrepancy between you. You're cuter whistling at a girl or versus leering and following you. I

Speaker 3:          00:22:51       think men should know that it bothers women. I'm not sure it bothers all women. I mean, I think it depends on the woman and you know, it's very complicated. Yeah. I don't want the women who were the most hypersensitive and for sort of freaked out about male attention. I don't think they should be able to write the rules. I think they should consult other women. What I suspect you would find is that it can be annoying. I mean, as I said, I remember being younger and being annoyed, but it was mainly a. well, there were, I mean, it didn't happen that much on Wall Street or in, in, in Manhattan, but um, so there did seem to be an element of a class involved, but I, but I think you have to, you know, I think in different cultures the women react to it differently. There are different mores and things. But in my neighborhood in Washington, D, c, I don't see it happening and where I live.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       So basically what I sense is you're, you're pretty much saying that your fear in this would be that if you were to allow some laws to be passed related to all this stuff that you're handing the power over sort of the authoritarian

Speaker 3:          00:24:00       police. They can arrest anybody and it would be these. I mean, I think in dc it would be these poor guys. And uh, so I, I think, you know, most men want to be decent human beings and they should know women don't appreciate it and that most don't. And especially if it's in, you know, kind of pushy and certainly if it's offensive, but, but then you're not, don't make laws and don't invite the police in this is. There's so much of this event inviting authorities in and some have called it the pink police state, you know, this feminist police state that we have on campus where your kids and public universities, the young men are afraid to tell a joke or to say anything that comedy clubs that are afraid to sell they veteran, they're unwelcome on campus. It's a hostile environment for humor. And so that's why you have to be careful and sometimes you'll get what you wish for, but then you get a lot more. You get a lot more repression, authoritarianism. It's just not worth it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       Yeah. So it's some of that also that the feminism movement has been a victim of its own success in a weird way because it seems to me that feminist now should be fighting so much more for women's rights in other countries. Now, of course we have a long way to go here, but when we see all kinds of horrible things have, you know, women still can't drive in Saudi Arabia, one of our biggest allies in the Gulf, you know, this is not an enemy country and all over the Middle East and all over Africa where women's rights are basically trampled on if not nonexistent. Why don't feminists groups focus on that at all?

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       You do have genuine patriarchal, oppressive societies and and what what's happening to women's rights in Iran is terrifying of course in Saudi Arabia, many parts of the world. I've been to international women's conferences and you meet these women who represent when then from their countries that I've met from Cambodia and Yemen and Egypt and so forth, and it's very inspiring. It's like meeting the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony that the feminist foremothers of their society and you would think that the know on the campus, these young women would be especially young women that are idealistic and want to be activists. You'd think they'd be making common cause with those women. Instead, these women had overland and Georgetown and you, they're protesting the men on their campus because they and they, they feel they are, they, they feel that they are like these women that are oppressed in, in Iran, that they have it as bad or worse. So it's, it's delusional.

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       Yeah. So I think there's something much bigger going on here and I think this is why so much of our audience, especially on twitter, likes what we're both doing and what people like Joe Rogan a guide, sad and then Milo, many others are talking about. There's some weird movement of Authoritarians were the left now, which is supposed to be about free thinking and debating ideas and doing this right where the left is now throwing out half the people. I had Sarah Haider I last week and this is an ex Muslim who stands up for every liberal ideal. The left should love her and they shun her. At best they were actually treated worse than, than being shunned.

Speaker 3:          00:27:05       When I wrote my first book, which was protesting the, the authoritarianism of feminism and the Anti Intellectual Ism, the conspiracy theories, all of that. Uh, I expected to have a good reception from feminist scholars because I just assumed there was a silent minority of silent majority of reasonable women. And I did, I heard from some great women and from nate, nate [inaudible] and president of the then president of the Acl, you, um, I heard from Erica Jong, you know, this pro-sex feminine feminist novelist and sober and they were great, but my colleagues in the academy were furious that I had criticized and they thought that criticism was the same as a kind of betrayal and show that you were on the side, the side of, you know, the forces of evil. So they didn't just agree, disagree with you. They thought you were evil. Now they don't just disagree with you, they think you're evil and that you give them ptsd.

Speaker 2:          00:28:01       Yes. So you give the ptsd and then it also doesn't give them a license to say and virtually do anything they want to you. Because I could give you a zillion examples of times where I've seen anyone that shifts a little bit away from people on the left where they are slandered and smeared and horrible.

Speaker 3:          00:28:19       They do to other people exactly what they say the right is doing. They demonize, they objectify, they other eyes do use their word. They micro, macro there, there, there. There are massive macro and micro and nano aggression, so they don't hesitate to be rude, snarky, and there's so much meanness. I don't understand feminism with meanness. It was when I. I mean I know there were some eccentric angry women from the beginning of the second way, but mostly the lived experience of most women who were enjoying their liberation was happiness and joy and, and being friends with men not going to war with them.

Speaker 2:          00:28:56       Yeah. So where does this strange a collusion of all these people that all end up on the left doing this? You know, I've said repeatedly on the show. The reason I talk about this all the time and the reason I tweet about the regressive left and want to talk about this because I don't want the left to go over the deep end and that's why I'm talking about a cross section or talking with a cross section of people from literally all over the world because I'm afraid. What happened to the right, where it went so far? Right? Is, is happening right now? What brings these people together, do you think when, when often they shouldn't have a lot in common?

Speaker 3:          00:29:28       Well, I, I will tell you what I know best is among the feminist is a small group in the university's gained control of the knowledge base. I mean what we think we know about and women. So you're a journalist and you need to know something about the wage gap or you need to know something about women and in, in, in education, you go to these people and they are what the journalist doesn't know or the politician or the interested party doesn't know is that they're spinning and they have an ideology that drives their research. So I think a lot of people don't realize that there's it, there's so much a spurious scholarship. So they take it seriously and now it's, there are untruths, exaggerations of fic, toys, factoids that had been repeated so often. They're almost beyond the reach of rational analysis and, and, and if you question them, you are by definition a sexist or worse.

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       So they got a certain amount of power just through this, this, this information, this scholarship about how in this case about how oppressed women were. So you have to sympathize and then they, they, they then kind of went off the deep end with this psychobabble and these psychodramas about. I'm triggered and you know it. I mean at Brown University they have a year or so ago and there was a story about it. You may have seen, I'm sure you did in the New York Times by Judith Shulevitz at Brown University. They had a debate. So it was a feminist feminist, actually a libertarian feminist and someone else, another feminist debating a rape statistics and you would think that's perfect. What more could the students want? They can hear both sides and their sides well represent no, they didn't want the debate at all and they formed a, a safe room. And in that safe room they were playing tapes of frolicking puppy dogs. They had bubbles, coloring books, play dough. Maybe I made up the Plato, I think it was there. So this is so infantilized and again I and many other feminists have my agenda, you look at it and say, this is infantilization, this is, this is the opposite of what feminism should be. And when I got to college we threw out the dorm counselors and the guardians of our virtue and all that. We wanted to be in charge.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       What went wrong? Do you think if there was a, was there a moment that it actually, that's something snapped. If in fact something went wrong and the feminist movement went from these two extremes. What do you think happened there? Well,

Speaker 3:          00:32:04       I think I know what happened. No one listens to me. I wrote this article to the Aad beast where I pinpointed what happened. These were, she'll call this, these, a fainting couch. Feminists and purveyors of myths. They been around for a long time. They'd been in gender studies is too bad, but in 2011 at little known, uh, uh, operatic, no other, no a government official center that was going to sound conspiratorial if you don't know. But in this case it's true. She sent out a letter to all the colleges, universities, her name. She was the assistant secretary of civil rights, Russell and Ali, and she sent out to all the colleges and I think her intention was that they take more seriously that women are harassed on campus and there was too much sexual assault, but she went overboard. She's terrified the universities and made it seem like if they didn't immediately put all like most men on trial and get them out of those schools and believe women because she claimed there was this app or this epidemic of sexual predation that the men at at campuses like Yale and swarthmore and so we're just praying on women.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       So she sent this letter and the schools now can be sued under title nine. This equity statute. It's a wonderful statute. It was meant to be there to give women equal opportunities in education, but it's been twisted now and they've kind of declared martial law on men on campus because of this letter was 2011 and you look at that date and then you see it brought words like trigger warnings and safe space. This whole mindset of a rather somewhat paranoid young women and their mentors on campus it, it gave them the power to to make a federal case literally have their perception.

Speaker 2:          00:33:54       That's so interesting because I can see the line now to when you were talking about the cat calling, why the slippery slope exists. If you were to create a law, well then you could be in this.

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       Well now once you have a law, they already had title nine officers, but since 2011, that's probably the area of greatest growth on many campuses. They have dozens and dozens of people monitoring how the boys are treated in the girls at, at, at Wesleyan, in these are mostly very privileged kids and there's a lot of drinking and I'm sure drunk hookups, but they have redefined drunken hookups to at TB rape of a young man against women. So of course they call them. Then there's a rape epidemic if you're going to enlarge the meaning of this horrible war, but you're going to enlarge it to include drunken hookups.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       Right? So I see. So there's so many pieces here that, that are related to feminism. And so much of this authoritarian stuff and the college stuff, the Yale thing, which we were both tweeting about that happening half ago or so with the professor that wrote the piece about the, you know, the costume Halloween costumes and if you see someone that's wearing saying offensive, either ignore it or use your free speech to engage them and why you are happy with it and hopefully have a conversation about it. Then that professor's a husband, I believe is the dean there. He got into this argument with the student and the student basically said, and it was all caught on camera, basically said this is not a place of intellectual ism. This should be a whole home. I really like. It takes a lot to really get me crazy. But I thought this is dangerous now. What's happening, you know. And I also, I usually don't feel like a Grandpa, but I felt like a grandpa. Like you kids. Like how stupid are you kids? But it really, me as now we have something systemic that we have to

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       dangerous and here's why. Some leftist I've seen or they're embarrassed by it, who wouldn't be, but they say, oh, it's just kids acting out. No, it's not just kids acting out. These are kids who have been fed a lot of bad, crazy information in their ethnic studies or gender studies where it's highly politicized scholarship. They've had it and they may, if they went to elite high schools, they probably had it since 10th grade. They've been reading these conspiracy theories about how bad the United States or a western culture and particularly the men, it's patriarchal male had Gemini so forth and uh, they believe it and, and they do not have much knowledge of history. So if they are doing things that people that know history remind you of the mccarthy era or even the Salem witch trials just in terms of hysteria and contagions of hysteria. Um, they're not aware of it. I mean, and what this is, this doesn't happen often, but there was one young woman that, and this is all over, not all over, but you can find it on the Internet. She burned my book. She gleefully, young woman took the organs boys and burned it and I just, I just, as a teacher and a mother, I just thought Bra burning a book, have a good history, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       now I assume that she tweeted it at you.

Speaker 3:          00:37:03       Well, it was a, it was on tumbler and someone sent it to me.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       So basically they're, they're creating an atmosphere where almost everything. I mean, it really feels 19, 84 or wellbeing reverse everything is this sort of doublespeak and reverse of how we're supposed to have debate, right? I mean, if you can't have an intellectual debate in college, well how are you going to get out to the real world and do it

Speaker 3:          00:37:28       right? And the Supreme Court has ruled many times that freedom of speech is most important on the college campus. It has refused to a Jew to sanction speech codes and the courts have refused to do this. Uh, but schools have them anyway. And, um, it, it, it, if our universities become places where you have to be hyper protective of students, protect them from ideas, and your goal is to achieve massive amount of comfort and safety. You have undermined the purpose of your being. You exist at the universities don't exist for that purpose. Going back to the time of, of, of the, of socrates. The academy was about debate and, and counterargument and, and being able to reason. And, and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:38:18       I think that's why people are responding to us. Right? Because we're trying to bring that back. What else do you think we can do? Because, you know, I, I see this stuff and I talk about it all the time, but every now and again I got, I mean, 100 percent of the. I do feel a little guilty ever. It's rare, but I do once a while, like, you know, in something like the, what happened at University of Missouri. I empathize with these kids if they feel, you know, if they were racist, things happening inside the whole. That thing sounds a little unclear as to what exactly was going on in the poop swastikas and somebody said the n word and all this, but I have no doubt that there is racism on the campus and there's racism in Missouri and in the country. I've moved out. So sometimes I do feel a little. Guilty isn't the right word, but a little.

Speaker 3:          00:38:59       No, I understand exactly what you're saying. Take it then. I have never really gone on about the race issues the way I do with the gender issues. I think they're very different. There's a particular history, a very specific history with African Americans in the United States and, and, and I don't like to see the women's movement pretending that they're women have been oppressed in the same way. That is just not true. Depends on which women. And if you were an upper middle class white woman, you have had a very different history. And this was supposedly the great insight of intersectional intersectionality, but they didn't seem to apply it very consistently. And certain groups, like most men seem to be written out of it. So, um, it's just not, it's not a consistent body of work. They need to bring in more critics, they need to, to hear from dissidents and um, if they think, well, ours is a compassionate movement and they are going after people's jobs and as I said, there are these, these sort of twitter mobs that want to destroy people's reputation.

Speaker 2:          00:40:05       Well, what did you make of that professor at Missouri? The woman who was standing there screaming at the reporter who was, you know, she was saying, we need some muscle around here to get the reporter editor

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       was a thug. It was thuggish and many of the little scenes I've seen on the campuses, uh, uh, reminiscent of a, like these struggles sessions they had in the cultural revolution in China. And those were run by students. I mean it. People say, well, you wouldn't compare them. Those people we know we're throwing people out of windows. I agree that I don't, they're not comparable in that way. For one thing, these kids on our campus don't have that kind of power, thank God. But some that I see such as, they seem so intoxicated with hatred and self righteousness, I don't know what they would do if they had power, real power. They have power to hurt people, you know, their jobs and reputations. But that's already awful. Look, I mean, it's awful what's happening to so many young men and I have no apologies for criminals.

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       They're criminals on campus and taking advantages of, of girls. That's awful. But what is more often the case with so many that we've read about, it's young men that, that, you know, it's like a year later the girl takes a, the young woman takes a women's studies class and rethinks this bad hookup. And then he's brought up on charges, sometimes not even told what the specifics of the charge are. We've had too many of those. And um, so that's what worries me is these people get carried away and these gender studies and other things and then they, they have no regard or maybe no knowledge of, of the first amendment of due process of, of the, the history of the battle that was fought for freedom of speech. Now, of course it will be turned on them. So you're already seeing now feminists are getting in trouble. I think there was a professor that was hired. It was fired for using the f word.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       Yeah. Well now you can see that. I mean it's happening right now. It's turning on them right now. You can see the left eating itself. Right? And if someone on the left, I probably shouldn't be taking that much joy in it, but because it's been so warped, I actually am. I want, you know, as we've been calling them, the regressives I want them to. I want them to go the way of the dinosaur. Enough of this,

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       enough of this I know. And we bring back it just a, an environment of openness and with jokes.

Speaker 2:          00:42:19       Yeah, there shelby jokes. I was, was it? Let's move away from some of the serious stuff, but now I'm going to bring up Gamergate. So I don't know which way is this. Serious or joking will find that tragic comedy. Okay. So actually I remember very much the first time I heard you was about a year ago or so when Gamergate was just starting to percolate up and I tweeted out, I said I want to do something about Gamergate, can you point me in the right direction because I really could not get ahold of it, which it seems like no one still can get a hold of, but your name came up and Milo Yiannopoulos and Adam Baldwin and a couple of other people popped up and I was looking around and I did one video on it and I basically said I tried to lay it out, but I basically said I don't know what's going on here right now. Since then I've had my avalon and I thought he did a pretty good explanation. You've become sort of a, I guess like a heroine of the Gamergate movement, um, for a lot of the reasons you're discussing here. So if you were going to explain it in like two minutes, how would you explain the, the thing that is Gamergate?

Speaker 3:          00:43:17       Well, just the first thing to know. I am not a Gamer and in fact I've looked at some of the games that are con and they, they, and you know, there's too much violence and mayhem mend. It's, I mean, but I also don't like shows like breaking bad or I can't watch them too much violence.

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       So you believe they should exist if people sort of, not

Speaker 3:          00:43:34       my taste, I do prefer, you know, pride and prejudice or you know, the latest pbs, uh, um, Downton Abbey, that sort of thing. But it's not. I don't impose that on everyone. And I recognized there can be great movies. Alfred Hitchcock was a great director but I will never see psycho. I'm too afraid. It's not my, I can't, I don't enjoy that experience of being terrified in the theater, but people do it and it's theirs. It's harmless. And so when the video game controversy erupted, I, I took a, I took a measure of it. I saw some familiar players because I'd been in some of these same battles. And I saw that, um, some of the feminist critics were cherry picking. They were misrepresenting and uh, and that, uh, the gay gate was being judged by. There are some extreme people associated with it at the periphery, but the CD, but like every, what I mean, the occupy Wall Street, there were crazy people on the periphery. Sure. And, and black lives matter if you go to the periphery, but you, what you should do is go to the center and what are they saying? That's what I tried to do is go in and see what they were saying. And uh, these, these critics. First you had critics who said video games are causing mayhem. They create violence. No one has been able to show that. And psychologists are already just tired of it. They're not, forget it, you're not theirs. It's just going in a circle. No one has been able to show that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       Yeah, it hasn't. There been some studies that have proven it actually does the reverse because people, you get some of their aggression out instead of actually shooting similar.

Speaker 3:          00:45:09       And it takes a lot. I mean, no one knows what creates a, you know, a sociopath, a criminal, but it's probably not video games. But, and in previous generations they thought it was comic books. We had a corrupting influence on the morals of the young or it was television and any new medium goes through this and games seem to be there. And then there was a feminist critics and they were saying that it was causing the, well, they were saying two things, but the games themselves are sexist and they, they create a attitudes of sexism. And I, I just do not see evidence of that. I did see that some of them had sexy women and um, but if the players like it and many of them, you know, men are known to like images of sexy women. I just didn't understand why we were demonizing that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:57       And people say, well, feminists will say that, that the male gaze looking at women's bodies objectifying which feminist I was a part of, a group of feminists or libertarian feminists who it was live and let live. I mean, I, I'm not against people. There was a whole group of feminists that were against having, you know, women posing in playboy or, or the sports illustrated swimsuit issue. And all of that, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, but there was a whole group of us that were opposed and I think we won the argument, but apparently they won the assistant professorships. They've been there ever since. It's teaching these.

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       That's all they might've won

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       if they teach. We won all the battles when they were the first so called culture war. We won the arguments. We had the New York Times on our side. We had new, you know, the media and now they've been. They've been laboring away, you know, with their theories and they know relentless and now they have the backing of the Department of Education because through so in the educational system they can make a federal case of everything. So it's difficult. I think in the end we will prevail because I have great faith in just human ability to see through nonsense. Eventually it has to fall.

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       Right. So my question there was what is Gamergate? And I think your answer because your answer. I had almost nothing to do with Gamergate. I think it was the right answer, right? Because that seems to be the confusion about what is Gamergate? Nobody seems to really understand what it is. I think at this point it's morphed into so many details,

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       so many different things, but at the core it was a group of Gamers who were. There were issues. I don't understand. It's not a Gamer. They were irritated by some cronyism in the race.

Speaker 2:          00:47:42       The magazines were being paid off by the manufacturer.

Speaker 3:          00:47:44       No. All that was going on and that that happened. We had, we saw that in radio when it was a younger medium, there was payola and all it has to be sorted out. I think gaming had to go through that and maybe it still has to go, but it's, it's improved since Gamergate, that's for sure. But then they also would find themselves in, you know, getting attacked by game critics or games evaluated because they objectified women or something and, and they were just thinking, we just want to play our games. We don't really. Yeah. So whatever. And then they had these critiques of the Games that were so cherry picked and these gamers, they know their games don't mess with that and they know the games and then so they were is of course Anita Sarkeesian and her videos. It was infuriating to. And these are some young guys, mainland some girls and they see their games being misrepresented or she'll pick a scene out, make it look like one thing and was totally different or take a video. No one ever watched that had you know, a following of five and act as though it's typical of the game. So they knew it was cheating. They knew and they got really mad. Now what I liked about many of them is they, they fought back with arguments, they made videos, they were, it was, it was this explosion of can we get acacia now? There were crazy opportunists at the edges or maybe they weren't even part of Gamergate. Maybe no one knows who sent threats and people on both sides of the controversy. Get them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:10       Yeah. So that's the interesting part that there was this group of. It's younger people playing video games. They felt that the system that they, you know, they love these games, they felt that the man, you know, the video game manufacturers, they're buying the reviews and all that and it starts with that, but I think you just hit it that it became this thing where suddenly this group of people who have nothing in common, we, they don't know what each other's skin color is or sexuality is or any of this stuff is, but they all found this common thing related to authoritarianism and they fought it and that's why I was fascinated

Speaker 3:          00:49:43       and they fought and they fought and they, they, you know, it just, it's, it may erupt again. It goes, it comes and goes. But, uh, there was comradery and to two times, maybe two times we've had these gamer gate hookups where, because you only know each, it's just a Hashtag. It's not an organization. And uh, and in both DC and in, um, in London we had a meetup and I met the gamers that and they weren't there. You can't be a more delightful, friendly group of people.

Speaker 2:          00:50:11       So that, should that be the piece that gives you the hope that you were alluding to a second ago, that there was this group of younger people that said we're not going to take this bullshit and if they're not going to take it,

Speaker 3:          00:50:22       they were, they were, you know, they were, it was a majority guys, but lots of fantastic young women who, and again these are hardcore Gamers, I dunno, maybe 70 or 80 percent male, but there's some fun. The girls that are, they're fantastic and they're part of that group. So they even whatever they were, they could. There are gay women and, and, and every race I mean is, it is represented and you realize gamergate was a consumer uprising really from across the world across racial and class and gender lines. And it was just defending a hobby they love.

Speaker 2:          00:50:57       Right? So that's sort of what it is, is that, that's why the regressive left really hated it, hated it. And they wanted to get the idea that there would be a rebellion. How dare you, you do not talk back to big sister, which is so fascinating because. Because it was a cross section of people, they couldn't figure out who to guilt into hating who more and that I think transcends so many things that we see on college campuses and we see in our public discourse and free speech and all that. For you personally, how does it feel as you just said, you don't. You were never a Gamer, but yet you're based mom. For these people. How does it feel to be part of something that you actually, unlike feminism, where you had a vested interest as a woman, let's say now you're part of something that you want to say. You don't care about it because you care about these people obviously, but as you said, you're not a Gamer, but you're a leader in this thing.

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       It's happened before I came to the defensive wrestlers because they were. Our sport has been demolished by it. Completely unnecessary interpretations of this title Nine Equity Law. And so I made friends with a lot of wrestlers. I've never wrestled and I've never even. I've never even seen it, I don't think except accidentally channel surfing. Right? Um, but I love these. These are just great guys and they, they were, and they couldn't, you know, they, they didn't have a voice in this debate. And these, you know, gender experts speak for the, as if they're speaking for all women or all of the left or something. They speak for themselves. People should know that. So how did it feel? Uh, it, it's fine. It's, I mean, because just because everyone seems great and I, I just, I mean, as I said I haven't, I can't think of a group of people that were just more diverse, more welcoming, good sense of humor and creative. I think, you know, if I were to, based on my knowledge of gamers over the last year or so, it's someone's like obsessive gaming. It's predictive of being an artist or an engineer. They're smart too.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       It's hard to play these games. I mean we've got the army and the navy now playing video games to learn how to actually do things. So it's not that these, you know, I was used to, I was running around is Mary, oh, eat mushrooms. That did for me, but nice. So mushrooms in college. But uh, what about online harassment because that is also a piece of this and it also fits the feminism thing. Um, how much of it is honestly, how much of it is real? There's obviously plenty of it's real and we can look on any youtube comments section and then there's everybody harassing everybody for every other reason that it's endless. How much concern should we actually have for this? Or is it something that is not that important because it's just words

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       digital. We should have concern for a, just a, a certain category of harassment. First of all, we have to make distinctions. If you're online and you know, there are different people can disagree with you that could upset you but you know, live with it and people could insult you. That's life, just unfollow them. Then people can be obscene and you know, like, and it's probably more upsetting to a woman than a man that kind of like sexual and then they can issue like really scary threats right now obviously with the really scary threats and probably the obscenity. Uh, well let's start with the threats there. You have to, we have to do something about that and I think we are. I mean I think they get reported and, and when, if they're credible, but the thing is with Gabria gate and like, has anybody been hurt? Is there any evidence of itch? It's just all internet nonsense. I mean these, there are these threatening males and making mean where are they? I mean were who has been hurt. Exactly. I mean the worst thing I, one of the worst things I read about was milo getting terrible things in the mail, right? Milo Yiannopoulos,

Speaker 2:          00:54:52       bomb threats called we have something that he did. Yes. When we

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       did our Gamer meetup where I met the gamers in Washington DC, a critic of Gamergate sent, first of all, he sent completely rambling, frightening notes to the bar owner telling him not to host us and it was very touching because it's borrowing or was talking to me. He was worried that what he has this critic made it sound like, like he was hosting some, you know, I dunno some Nazis or something and the bar owner said, what can I do? This is America. And he was, he was from Afghanistan, I think, rooted in, in a minute, immigrant or maybe a rocky said, what can I do? This is America. And he said, are you going to keep us out? He said No. And then I, they were so pleased because. And everybody was very generous because we felt bad that they got a bomb threat and the imagine making a bomb threat in DC. They brought in vans and police dogs. But of course being gamers, we just went outside. They partied outside.

Speaker 2:          00:55:53       All right. So it had a, it had a nice ending. And I suppose that's all that we can do is just, you just keep going and you just keep telling the truth and all that. Which sort of gets me to my last question, which is I've been trying to end all these interviews on the hope part of all this. Where do we go from here? With all the things we've been talking about? And uh, I think you were in a piece that I owe that Milo is also in about the rise of the cultural libertarians. That there is this group of people now that cut across the political spectrum that include Bill Maher and rock and people on the right like Milo and people on the left at that have realized we got to get out of people's personal lives. We got to stop othering everybody. We got to stop judging everybody based on color and sex and religion and all that. I'm a firm believer that this is the next political movement in this country. So I guess are you with me and give me something else

Speaker 3:          00:56:48       totally with you. And I think that it was my acquaintance with the gamers that gave me that hope because politically they all over the spectrum but they are very libertarian for sure. And this was their, how they were acting and I just thought that it got some insight into how they were and and two, because they are younger. I mean they're gamers are a lot, a lot younger than me, most of them. And that gives me hope. And, and I. What I like about it too is it can unite us from people who were concerned. I'm still a registered Democrat, but out of respect for my mother and father who are so liberal, I wouldn't dare her register anything else, but they. But you can be conservative, you can be liberal. What unites us as Americans and maybe he's. Yeah, in Westerners to it is a love of freedom.

Speaker 3:          00:57:38       Yeah. I mean that's our. So I think it can bring people together and we've right now it's not, it's, it's sort of the bullies have the upper hand and so it's going to be a battle to um, take the power away from them and give to where it belongs to people who just, who are nice, respectful and who want a of other people and realize other people have different opinions and, and that that's okay. And not to be policing. I don't want these authoritarians here who said they could make the rules, your arguments for censorship and, and, and doing away with due process. They're not going to work. They had been tried before with that with unhappy results. So read some history. But having said that, I do think and any crazy things happening on campus right now, it's maybe a good thing if people are seeing it and will not be so easy. So ready to jump on it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       Yeah. That to me, that's the hope that I've been trying to take for the last few weeks that even even in cable news, which is so endlessly dumb and and pandering that I was noticing people were starting to say, you know, where they'll cry racism every two seconds and sexism and homophobia for the first time. They were kind of coming around and being like, this might be a bit much. So that's got to be that. That. Yeah, that's a good sign. That's a good time. Well, what would you say? Just the average person that, that not someone that's in the public sphere, but the average person that wants to do something about this in their, in their.

Speaker 3:          00:59:07       I would suggest that you be somewhat skeptical, not get too carried away with a cause until you check the facts. Now, if you've got good information and moral energy, that's moral progress. That's Martin King. That's civil rights. If you have bad information and moral fervor, that's fanaticism and history is one long lesson and the dangers of combining misinformation and moral fervor, so be careful. Choose your costs, causes carefully. And um, if you were, if you do that, I think it'll, you know, that that leads to progress to being careful about your causes. And right now, if you are a woman and you a part of campus feminism, I hate to say this, you have chosen the wrong cost. It's not about liberty, it's about repression.

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       Well, you know what, I look forward to seeing some of the comments on this one. We'll see if they agree with you and if they agree, great. And I have a feeling if they disagree, you'll be okay with that too. I'm okay with that. She gave me the evidence. Persuadable. There you go. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you. Finally in actual life we realize we've been doing this and this on twitter. One hundred 40 character thing and I really appreciated the fact that you literally went from almost four hours with Joe right over here. And, uh, what are you going to do for the rest of them?

Speaker 3:          01:00:18       I'm meeting my nephew and we're going out for Margarita is Mexican food.

Speaker 2:          01:00:23       Excellent. All right, well, you guys can check out Christina Hoff summers and all the usual spots on twitter on youtube. It is the factual feminist. And uh, I thank you again and I look forward to seeing you guys next week.
