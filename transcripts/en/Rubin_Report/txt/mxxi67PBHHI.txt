Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Folks, it's official. We are entering the age of unenlightened meant my friend, a true feminist in the best sense of the word, and a fearless defender of free speech. Christina Hoff sommers was invited to speak at Lewis and Clark law school this week. Here's what happened when she began her talk.

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       Christina Christina, victim mentality. Microaggressions are real, real, real, real, real.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Putting aside the creepiness of the comb, like repetitive chanting from the protesters. Their use of free speech actually isn't a use of free speech at all. While of course they have the right to protest your right to exercise. Your free speech doesn't come at the expense of someone else's right to exercise. There's so. What this means is yes, you can peacefully protest outside of an event. You can silently protest inside of an event. You can hold all the signs you want and you can encourage others to join your cause. You cannot, however, use your freedoms to trample on the freedoms of others. This chanting, which again took place before Christina had even begun to speak, reminded me of when I was at Ucla with Milo Yiannopoulos about two years ago, protesters screen spit through garbage cans, pulled fire alarms, and even called him bomb threats before we even took the stage. Perhaps most egregiously though was the group of students who linked arms to create a human wall to stop us and other viewers from even going inside the venue itself. Apparently they aren't against walls, they just don't like trump's wall. Christina has continued through the chanting and the protestors then broke out in song.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       We've gone side. Which side are you on? Fred's. Which side are you on?

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Quite a catchy tune, wouldn't you say? Of course. Christina Hoff. Sommers is in a fascist at all. She's just an old school liberal who dare challenge Modern Day leftism ironically, bs people so keen on fighting the fake fascism in their minds, don't understand that they themselves are the ones who are actually using fascist tactics of silencing and drowning out their opponents until there is no opposition remaining at all. But if you're still confused, here's a simple definition of fascism. Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and Control of industry and commerce, which came to prominence in early 20th century Europe. Do you think that Christina Hoff sommers is for dictatorial power? Is she for forcible suppression of opposition? To top it off, she even works at the American Enterprise Institute, which is against control of industry and commerce. Now, just think for a moment if the idea is that these students were espousing were the set of ideas and power, they actually would be for dictatorial control as they believed their cause is the most just and their opponents are simply evil.

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       How do you think it would be going for dissent and opposition in their system? Perhaps the most insidious piece of the Cultural Marxism that we see spreading on college campuses these days is that it is using the freedoms that are democratic capitalist society has against itself. Of course, they would never offer these same protections to minority voices in the dystopian future that it would bring. While this event thankfully wasn't nearly as violent as when Milo went to uc Berkeley and the school burned down or when it took $600,000 of security to ensure that Ben Shapiro could speak there without threat. This display at Lewis and Clark is just another reminder of how the backwards thinking of Cultural Marxism is coming for all dissenters cloaked in the mask of tolerance and diversity. These incidences are happening all over colleges, all over the country and turning places of higher learning into places where people are just getting high on intersectionality.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Sadly, this story really only broke on right leaning blogs and was only shared by the usual suspects who continually defend freedom of expression. As of recording this, I haven't seen any left leaning websites that covered it. The reason for this, of course, is twofold. On one hand, when you can win arguments by silencing your opponents, your job is pretty easy, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the good actors on the left, which I still believe there are some who want to call out events like this. Rarely do because they know that the same tactics of smearing and silencing will eventually be used against them and then there'll be purged from their former home just as former guests of mine like Bret Weinstein, Laura Kipnis, Lindsay Shepherd, and others who dare speak out against this tyrannical fo diversity movement. The silver lining though, of course, is that the more that people like Brett, Laura, and others speak out, the more room may give for people like you to do the exact same in your life. Speaking of Berkeley, I spoke there yesterday with Heather Mcdonald and Steve Simpson and I'll be speaking at many other colleges in the coming months. Come join me wherever I may be an asked me as many hard questions in the q and a as you'd like. I ask only one thing which is that if you sing, please make it a little snappier than what we just heard. A cover of journey, fleetwood Mac, or even Frank Sinatra would be preferable.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Joining me today is the senior editor of the Atlantic or contributor on MSNBC and the author of the new book, trump ocracy, the corruption of the American republic. David, and welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you so much for having me. I'm glad to have you here. I wanted you on for a couple of years. I think at this point you were a tough guy to track down, but we made it happen. I'm find-able hiding yet. You're not in hiding yet. You couldn't be maybe by the end of this interview because I let my guests talk and you'd never know. Right? That's the twitter formula. You're. You're like 140 characters away from career self-immolation yeah. Well, we've got about 60 minutes. We'll see about emulation immediately. All right, so a lot of the things I want to talk to you about. I thought your, your personal history is interesting and usually when I see you on television, you're talking about the day to day machinations of politics. You are Canadian. I did not know that. I find that I like Canadians. Just everyone does. Why are you people so agreeable? Because we're so passive aggressive,

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       uh, I grew up, I grew up in Toronto. I'm, I'm, I'm, we have a place in Prince Edward County, which is about two and a half east of Toronto, two and half hours east of Toronto where my wife and I and our children are spent summers now for almost three decades. Um, uh, Canada's uh, is, um, is, is a kind of mirror image of the United States with some things, omitted things intensified. And so, and I think it offers Americans often a kind of, um, wha what if a examination of the, of what the United States might have been under different circumstances. That's an interesting phrase. What do you think's omitted and what do you think is intensified? Um, so a candidate didn't have the American south. It didn't have slavery, he didn't have a civil war. Um, Canada had a peaceful separation from Great Britain. So it doesn't have the, it doesn't have the kind of citizen, military traditions. Canadians have a very different attitude towards guns. I mean, they're, my neighbors in Prince Edward County, um, all have, are not all but many have long guns, hunting pieces, shotguns, but the idea of having a handgun or a military style weapon is a very alien idea for Canadians. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       You think some of the Canadian attitude is also that there's a lot of geographic space and not that many people actually. Yes. Um, well, there, there it, it

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       can be Kinda, it can be kinda spooky at night. I mean there, there are great cities and Canadian Canada is much more urbanized place in the United States. Canadians are more likely to live in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, those places. Um, but uh, there, there's a, I'm in a line from a poem. The wild is always there. And even when you live in the center of Toronto, you can be mauled by a lion. You can head off, you can start driving and pretty soon you're in the wild.

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Yeah. Interesting. So your mom was on the Canadian Broadcasting Network

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       or company? CBC. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Corporation. Okay. Linda from tell me a little bit that was Linda from is my sister who's a member of the Canadian, two things where the department know now, but she's a very prominent person to learn from as a member of the Canadian Senate. I'm a leader in the Canadian Conservative Party. Um, my late mother, Barbara from was the host. I it correct here to keep my biography in your head. I was just testing you on your own biography. Uh, she was, um, a radio interview on a show called as it happens for a decade. Um, and then, uh, was the founder of a show called the journal, which was one of those face to face TV shows at a time when satellite in satellite communication was quite knew she died in 1992 at the age of 54. Was Your family always political? I mean, it sounds like probably right.

Speaker 3:          00:10:15       Well, my family was interested in politics. My late father was a businessman, not a, not involved in the political world and he had a lot of distance from, from politics. Um, but yes, I mean, my parents dinner table was a place. It was a high pressure environment. They, they, they thought deeply about things, but they were not ideological. And one of the places where I really, I mean learn to think was around that dinner table because, um, you know, my, my mother is very skeptical about everything, including her own children and the way she, when you were saying something she doesn't like, but she would never argue with you, but she, you just set marching these two lines of interrogatory questions and you would eventually realized I'm caught between these two lines and she would force you to think more deeply about. And not just political things but uh, but everything. Why do you do that? Why do you say that? Why do you think that's funny? And, um, it made you a more conscious person. Um, and I try to live up to that and the way I raise my own children, you never try, try never to tell them what to do or what they, what to think, but instead to challenge them to think and to think more deeply and not just about the big things but everything.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       Do you think that's what we're fundamentally missing in society right now? I mean, I think it's what I try to bring to this show. I try to let my guest talk even when I disagree with them and maybe poke and prod them in ways to, to learn a little bit more, but that everyone in the media these days is just pounding at each other and hitting each other and trying to destroy each other instead of sort of going along that journey with you and figuring out why you think that way and more importantly how you think.

Speaker 3:          00:11:48       I, I think it's just human nature. I think, um, I think it's human nature to be tough on others and soft on ourselves and uh, it, it's a real discipline and um, uh, to say, you know what, maybe I should be soft on others and tough on myself. So there's an interesting story. I want to get this totally right. When you were 14 you volunteered for the Ontario New Democratic Party. Yes. So far so good. So far so good. And for those who don't follow Canadian politics as closely. So the Ontario MD, the NDP is the left party in Canada, it's a multiparty system. Um, and uh, a candidate of course has a parliamentary system and there was a provincial election and I was interested in seeing how politics worked. I wasn't, I didn't really have political ideas, but I was interested in campaigns and I volunteered on that campaign. So on that campaign, you're 14 years old and on your commute you're reading the Gulag archipelago?

Speaker 3:          00:12:42       Well, we, there was a, it was a bus, subway, streetcar to go. It was really something for a volunteer, right? It was summer holiday. And so my mother had given me as a birthday present, I'm the paperback edition of the Gulag Archipelago and urged me to read it. And so I had a lot of time on that commute and uh, it had, it hit me like a bomb. Um, and I, I think, um, I mean my family in know are, were not my parents got out of Europe, my family, my family's got out of Europe before the war, but they left people behind and so in Polish. So most of my father's family were annihilated in the Holocaust and a very. So that was something he was always very conscious in my mind. And then here was this other story that I had not heard so much about it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:26       And it, it, um, it shaped me. How does that shape a 14 year old? Well, it, um, it would, it makes you aware of is that human history is very tragic, um, that you can't really rely that power can be abused and it makes you begin to think very hard about, well, how do we build a society? So there I was on the Toronto subway system in a society that really worked and it forces you to think most societies aren't like this in most societies. People are exposed to random terror and too dictatorial power. How do you make societies that, that work in the protect people and respect human dignity and human freedom? Um, so I began and of course at 14 you have no answers, but you made you become interested in the question. And what you also know is that when people say, I have a great scheme for humanity, it just requires a few prison camps.

Speaker 3:          00:14:21       You learn, you know what, it's probably not such a good scheme, right? Although they usually don't tell you it requires prison gifts. It usually tells you it requires a lot of good things, right? I mean, isn't that the real trick? But it generally. But it tells you at, I'm at you. There are warnings early on, um, their warnings early on in any utopian project like that. We're going to have to, you know, break, break some eggs here to make her an Omelet at first year, right? At first the eggs or not. Um, and at first the eggs are kind of small, but, uh, the first. But you can tell those steps and that one of the things that, um, you know, uh, I mean this is, I think one of the reasons why people look at what's happening on campuses with such alarm. Because, you know, obviously those are the people who are shouting down people on campus. They don't have police forces,

Speaker 1:          00:15:10       but they've made it pretty clear how, if they ever did have a police force, how they use. Yeah. So when I first came across you, I think it was probably maybe 10 years ago, you were on realtime a lot and I would say I would just see you on different television and it was probably when, for me personally, I was a little more left than maybe I am at the moment. Um, or at least the whole overton window has just shifted that it's hard to put anyone on a, on the traditional map anymore, but I always sort of, you always struck me as like a sensible conservative. I never watched you and was like, ah, that's the guy I disagree with on the right, you know, in some like crazed way. What does conservatism because you, you are a conservative, right? I would say I would use the adjective. I am conservative. I stopped using the noun. A conservative. Interesting. That's an interesting distinction and it, it makes sense to me relative to so many things changing right now. What does conservatism generally meet?

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       Well, I think it starts with the way our brains are built, that there are people who, um, are more conscious of risk and their people are less conscious of risk that people who hanker for change, there are people who are ready to stick with president evils rather than try new ones and that's just a matter of brain chemistry. Then when people with those different brain chemistry approach the problems with society, they start building systems of ideas. So the reason I stopped using the phrase a conservative and stopped talking about the conservative movement is what I would've called conservatives. And when I came out of college in 1982 was a set of answers to the problems in the 19 seventies and eighties inflation crime, Soviet menace, the disorder in American life. I'm sluggish. Productivity growth and the Conservatives have those days had a series of policy recommendations for those problems.

Speaker 3:          00:16:58       And by and large they worked and the result was that the problems either were overcome or anyway, so reduced insignificance. They stopped being the most important problems that Americans cared about. New problems came to the fore and about those new problems, conservatives had the same old answers they've had back in 1982 and it became a kind of fetish that if lower taxes with the right way to respond to low productivity growth in 1982, then if you had completely different problems in 2008, then obviously still lower taxes. Must be the same. Must work just as well as they did with a completely different set of problems in 1982. Um, so I, I think what has happened is that the conservative movement, conservative politics is a fossil. It's, it's, it's interesting in that it reveal, it's like an earthing, some piece of rock from a different geological era.

Speaker 3:          00:17:54       It tells you something about what people had on their minds in 1982. But if you say, how am I going to solve the problems of 2018, not so helpful. Yeah. So when people say that are conservatives now, does that have any particular meaning to you? Like, I guess there is the set that you're talking about from [inaudible] 82 that's going, you know, what the answers are then, but that seems very different from now. And then of course, we're obviously gonna spend a lot of time talking about trump and that really has flipped this on it. This is what has made trump possible. This is why the conservative movement has sort of worked itself out of a job. So the actual content of conservatism, as you know, what is conservatism have to say about the opioid epidemic? What does it have to say about, um, uh, the great recession.

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       What does it have to say about the collapse in life expectancy among non college Americans? What does it have to say about America's place in the world in a, in a world in which we're no longer competing with an ideological nuclear superpower of the Soviet Union, but with, uh, with these opportunistic actors that have like Russia and China, um, as conservatism has become more useless to help those problems, what, what has been left behind is an attitude. What conservatism I think means to most people say I'm a conservative because it means anti leftism. Find out what the, what the American left is talking about at any given moment, and not only think the opposite of it, but actually make your opposition to that. That group of people, the organizing principle of your politics, you're sort of defining principle. Basically you're defining principle. Now what that does is first it makes it, does a couple things.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       First, it makes oppositionists it means you're always against never four, and the second thing it means is you never have the initiative because you don't know what you think about anything until somebody else tells you first. And I think that's one of the reasons why conservatives were so vulnerable to trump, is that you had an intellectual with state that was largely untended and falling into disrepair, and Donald trump came and kicked the door down and moved in. Were there any candidates that you like that of that crew before trump came in and wreck the whole thing up? Look, there've been a lot of, uh, I'm, I've almost always supported, well until 2069, always supported the Republican nominee for president. And um, I thought there were, there have been a lot of people who have had real promise to make a good president. Mitt Romney would have made a very, very good president.

Speaker 3:          00:20:24       Conservatism's problem. A Republican isn't a problem, has been that you take people who are, have real promise as leaders and you then connect them to a program that can't win a democratic election. Know since the end of the Cold War. Conservatives want the, the Republican nominee for president has won a majority of the popular vote exactly once and that was in 2004 in the aftermath of nine slash 11. Um, it, it's no longer, there's no longer a national majority for what Republicans are offering and what has happened. And it's no surprise because when you're saying, well, our big ideas to take the medicare guarantee away from everybody under 55 to put Medicaid on the path toward extinction and to use all of that to finance more tax cuts like those that worked in the 19 eighties in a completely different set of circumstances that you're not talking to or about me.

Speaker 3:          00:21:19       I'm so good. People have been committed to an unworkable program. And what has happened then, um, has been that as Republicans have lost, the parties become more desperate and more vulnerable. But what has also happened is that you have had an increasingly self-conscious move and the conservative world, and this is part of the trump ocracy, we'll talk about in the book to say, well, if we can't win a majority of the people, what we're going, we're going to cope with that by redefining who the proper people are. And we're going to define the country. We're going to shrink our definition of who are the people and divide the country between the people and those people and the p. and if we have a majority of the people, that's all we care about and we're going to try to find ways to prevent those people from participating and even voting.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       So a couple of things here. So it's interesting you mentioned taxes a couple of times and generally speaking, when I have conservative sit across from me there for tax cuts no matter what. And that's what you were saying, that there was the 82 crew basically that was born and then this fossil remained and people are always for it now. But it's, it's rare to sit across from a conservative. And you're basically saying that there are instances at least where the tax cuts are not a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:22:33       Yeah. But, but, but one of the really damaging things, societies have states states need revenue. Um, so, um, there are, there are things, there are ways, you know, the United States might not need so much tax money if, for example, um, it didn't spend twice as twice as much per person on healthcare as everybody else in the world. When you look at the actual dollars United States spends on, on pro health provision for terrible results, um, it's very expensive. Um, conservatives by and large are not interested in getting their fingers into that problem. They're not. So the government needs revenue and it has to be funded and part of the fossilization happens. Conservative. Say you say, we've got a problem. I'm whatever it is. And the concern, well, if I can solve it with a tax cut, then I'm for doing something. If I can only solve it by having a spending increase of that, I won't do anything.

Speaker 3:          00:23:30       What then happens is cynical operators say, what if we take our spending increase and instead of doing it through an appropriation, we do it through a tax credit. How do you feel that? Oh, then I'm fine. And the result is that wasn't the problem is housing or higher education or caring for disabled children, that conservatives can be sold a solution in the form of a tax credit, which is usually the least efficient way of solving a problem. Um, and the result is that you get this kind of malformed state where the United States has a really big and expensive government, but it's financed and especially in efficient ways and it addresses problems and especially inefficient ways.

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       So is the first part there though that nobody actually cut spending, you know, I've had Ben Shapiro in here a bunch of times and that's what he talks about it, that we can keep raising taxes forever and ever and ever. But that really we have this just giant monstrosity of a government that's incredibly inefficient. I mean even healthcare side, just everything, all the mid level bureaus and regulators and just this massive federal government that was never supposed to get so big that we never actually really look at how much of that we could chop away at were then if we did a little of that, we could have the, the sort of relevant conversations about tax cuts that you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:24:49       Well that's partly true and partly not the United States. Uh, what is the government spend its money on defense, Medicare, Medicaid, social security. I think that's those things together. I think that's about 80 percent. Um, so, uh, the rest of the government, you know, is, uh, I mean, I think it's true that dollar for dollar, the US government is less efficient than that of other countries. Um, mostly because of the inheritance of not having a proper civil service that I'm, the idea that president starts off by appointing the top 10,000 jobs in the civil service. So it's highly political and you get a lot of people who shouldn't basically have no background in government, don't know what they're doing and things are not done in a very efficient way. Also, the power of Congress means there are a lot of people were always trying to put in some special benefit and things happen that don't make.

Speaker 3:          00:25:46       So you have military bases in places where they shouldn't be. But if you were, this is, this is why I say conservatism is obsolete if you want to reduce the state share of expense. And really, I mean not just by repackaging things as tax that are, you know, that um, I mean, one of the ways we, for example, fund the care of disabled children is through a series of tax credits that are not labeled as expenditures but really are, you have to do something by Medicare and Medicaid. And so the conservative, the idea has been, okay, well the answer is we're going to take away Medicare and Medicaid from people and the reason that the Obama period has been such a crisis and the period afterwards is the defeat over the defeat of the conservative attempt to repeal the affordable care act. And to pass the Ryan plan means the conservatives have to face a world in which the United States has joined the other developed countries and having something like or something closer to a universal healthcare guarantee.

Speaker 3:          00:26:46       The old idea, we'll save money just by not covering people. That is not going to be workable in the politics of the 21st century. So that means you have to actually pay attention to how Medicare works. And you have to say how while covering everybody do we squeeze costs out of the system and that requires a commitment to policy detail that conservatives don't like to do is they like the sweeping comment. We just need to cut all this waste. But the, when you say, well, where is the waste of Medicare? Well, the answer is, would the United States, um, overpays for all of these services, um, per unit, um, and uh, doctors make more money in the United States than they do in other places. You have a, you have these, um, uh, but you also have this problem if you have a sicker population than not people do in other countries. Americans die earlier. They're less likely to wear seatbelts. Um, they have more gun accidents. Uh, you have to delve to deal with this problem. You have to delve into detail in a way that the conservative preference for ideology over factual specificity makes conservatives not very useful at.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       Is anyone good at that these days though? Really like really saying, look, if you look at the real grass root movement on both sides, I mean Bernie was pretty extreme left and trump was w, whatever I can, it's hard to call extreme right, but what we'll get into that, whatever you call that, that you know, just the wrecking of the system. So you had these two competing forces.

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       Look, we have a lot of political messianism that's a really important point. But here I'm here. Let me put a set of looking at what at the two sides. If you were to take the 5,000 people in the United States who know most about Medicare and Medicaid are the hundred who know most about Medicare and Medicaid. I'm guessing 90 of the hundred and 9,990 of the thousand, maybe not 900,000 would be people of the center left because conservatives just don't care about that kind of knowledge. And so they're always at a disadvantage.

Speaker 1:          00:28:46       So is it that they don't care, they just don't think the government should be involved in it like that. The fundamental worst. Well, okay, is that, it's not the job of the government really,

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       but they know, so every once in a while somebody will put his head above the parapet and say, I don't think the government should be providing healthcare for everybody. Right? You lose an election that, that is how Donald Trump became the republican nominee. That's right. Paul Ryan does not think the government should provide healthcare to everybody. The problem is the Republican primary voter thinks the gut. Well, the government should provide healthcare to everybody, but they should provide healthcare to everyone like me. Um, so, uh, yes, they should provide healthcare to all the over 65. They should provide healthcare to all the veterans. But once you do that, you're into a very big program. And once you're saying government should provide healthcare to all the over 65. So that's where most of the spending takes place anyway. So

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       nuclear, you have an ideological difference with maybe the Paul Ryan approach, but you think it's a legitimate of looking at the

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       government, right? It's, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I don't understand what that is. It's a way to think, yeah, for sure. Um, you could argue that point, but it's not a way that a political party wants to compete for power in the United States can think because the voters won't accept it. So what ends up happening is that the Republicans have a bunch of commitment, they have a bunch of theoretical commitments and a bunch of operational commitments and those, they don't line up, uh, and in fact the Republican Party does maintain Medicare. It does make maintain medicaid and it tries to find little economies usually not very efficient ways, but the result is because it doesn't care about how those problems work and it's not psychically committed to them. There is no one there saying we're going to cut. We're going to. How is it that Germany and France and Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, um, cover more people have longer life expectancies and spend less.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       Um, you know, the difference between what the United States spends the difference of the American spending, the American economy and healthcare and that of the other developed countries. It's about three, three or four points of GDP, which is bigger than the defense budget. So what does that say then, just about. We don't even have to make this about conservative per se. What does that say about our system? If a guy came up, let's say a Republican nominee came up and really was talking about that. I talk that the, the ins and outs. I mean, no matter what, let's just look at 2016. I mean, he would have been clubbed over the head by trauma and they still the trump campaign. Trump said trump is a. was a great disco. Trump. This is what I mean by the hollowness. So trump set, I'm going to protect Medicare. I'm going to protect Medicaid trump campaign as the guy who's going to.

Speaker 3:          00:31:30       Who was the first Republican who really made his peace with the American social insurance system. When conservatives said trump wasn't a conservative, they were right and that's why he beat them inside their own party. Trump begins by beating the republican world. He'd been. He begins by defeating Fox News and bending all of them to his will. Now he had no idea what he was talking about. He had no plan for executing any of this, but he do. You think that's really true because I hear this with a lot of people that he had either no idea what he was doing or no plan or anything. Someone who has no idea. He reveals that every day he doesn't know. He doesn't understand, but what does that say about all of us? That's true. Like if one of the. One of the interviewers had said during that Mr Trump, you say you're going to preserve Medicare and Medicaid. What does Medicare do and what does Medicaid do and what's the difference? I will bet you I'm the amount of money the Republican Party are going to corruptly put in his pockets of Maro Lago, but he couldn't have answered that question. Yeah, so that. I completely agree with that. I did a video before the election saying if you want to stump trump asking him what the three branches of government

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       are and what they're supposed to do. He was asked what the three elements of the nuclear triad. Okay. You didn't know that, so that kind of stuff. I do agree, but this thing about sort of, there was no plan. There's no point in some way. Even if even if I can intellectually get there with you, there's something about that idea that then he duped by me. It's scary. I guess I would say it's pretty scary to think that someone who had no plan dupe the rest of us like that, that inherently seems like a planet at some level because we're sort of talking about plans at different levels.

Speaker 3:          00:33:09       Well, Don Donald trump is one of the great scam artists of all time. He scammed the people trump university. He and the scan was possible because of the disillusionment of so many people with a responsible politics. But what, when he intuited, I mean, I mean he's not, that he dumped trump has certain talents and geniuses. Um, he, he is a genius at finding the weakness in things. And he understood the weakness in the institutional Republican Party, which is that they were offering a message that their own voters hate it. And I have a lot of detail on that in the book about how when you actually showed Republican voters, Republican primary voters, what Paul Ryan wanted to do, we just recoiled from it, but he's gonna take away my medicare, he's going to take away my mother's nursing home. That's the plan. That's the famous Ryan plant. So Donald Trump understood that. That and what he then understood as well was that in the absence of a program that this anti leftism that can become a conservative conservatism was this was a series of resentments and rages that we're waiting for somebody who could articulate who, who raged and presented as powerfully as they did. I mean Republicans, the previous Republican nominees with sometimes tap these feelings trying to channel them, but they didn't share them. Donald trump shares them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:35       Okay. So before we go fully into drop and then we're going to spend the rest of the interview on trump. I just wanna talk a little bit about the modern Democrats and the left in general and all that. So what do you make of the, the feeling that he was going for? I think that's a pretty legit feeling on what's happened with the left related to free speech and the endless hysteria and everyone's a bigot and a racist and identity, politics, all of that. That feeling I think is legit. Um, do you see that as a legit feeling? Um, but in our group therapy that feelings are legitimate. The question is, are not even feeling. I see it as a legit reality. The thing that he was talking about there is a legit reality.

Speaker 3:          00:35:14       Um, I will take this w what behind behind all of those things you described is a new fact and the politics, the United States in the past 15, 20 years, um, which is that we are moving into a period of intense intensifying ethnic competition for power, for money. And for the right to say that, what to talk about, to define what it means to be an American. And the country's made this big gamble on changing itself. And across the developed world, countries like the United States have made similar gambles. Um, the proportion of the foreign born in Sweden is now as high as in the United States. The proportion of foreign born in Germany's nearly as high as in the United States that are having massive problems with their all immigration is always a source of massive social tension. And um, we do a lot of the immigration happened without anybody ever consciously intending it and without much of a debate over it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       And with a refusal to tally costs and benefits in an accurate way so these countries have been changed. And what you have is then a series of new demands and new resentments. And that's one of the, one of the reasons that the conservatism I grew up with the so out of date is look back in 1985. The argument between Liberals and conservatives was basically an argument about the economy that, uh, and this is true, not just in every developed country we'd have, you had a party of the people who worked for wages and the party of the people who own capital assets and work for salads. The left were the people who, whose jobs are supported by taxes. The other people's jobs are supported by profits. If you're in management, you were on the right. If you are in a union, you are on the left, I'm not to sound sexist about this, but essentially your relationship to the means of production was the, was this the organizing principle of politics?

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       What also happened in 1995 was it people remembered that this kind of politics could spiral out of control and they'd seen it happened in the 19 thirties and, and uh, you could get fascist movements, you could get communist movements. And so there were attempts to temper the competition between the wage people in the salary people between the owners and the workers. Um, that's, uh, and so you had the, you had kind of a continent. The left accepted a market economy and the right excepted to social insurance state, but that's what the argument was about. And that's what we've run on now for quite some time. But that has ceased with the collapse of socialism. That argument ended. Um, the, the modern left is not really a socialist movement anymore. There, I mean people will sometimes use the word they will have, but I mean back in 1950 there are people who really thought that if the government owned the banks, the banks would make better lending decisions than they did.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       Then they would have their private. No one thinks that now. I mean, I don't even think really. You don't think that there's plenty of people on the left that we'll just sort of incrementally get there. They get 330 million people in the United States, so somebody who thinks every. I don't even know him, but I mean that if that. If Bernie was president, that eventually the EU. I think the creeping movement of this. Yeah. Elizabeth Warren, that do they want to movement? I think Elizabeth Warren does not want the government to own the banks. No, I don't think she. I believe that Elizabeth Warren is not. The government should own the steel companies. She doesn't believe that government should own the commanding heights of industry. I'm sure she does not bladder that. I don't know about owning, but what about just controlling it to the point where in effect it's ownership.

Speaker 3:          00:38:38       I know, I know you. I know she thinks. I don't think she thinks they should manage it. Um, uh, she believes in a social market economy. I mean, if you were to say to her what is the best run country on earth? She bringing, always used to say Denmark was the best one country. Denmark is a free market society. It's got a bigger social insurance system in the United States. And he said that because the reason he said that was it was never serious answer because he didn't stop caring. But that's not what politics is about. What politics is about is in 1985. If I knew how you made your living, I could probably guess how you voted today. If I know where your grandparents come from. I know how you vote. So if your grandparents did not belong to the local ethnic majority, whether in the United States or Germany or Britain, you are in the party.

Speaker 3:          00:39:24       What used to be the lift if your grandparents do belong, did, do, or did belong to the local ethnic majority of your, what is the power of Party of the right Houston? And that's true, however you make your living however much or little money you have, and that was not true in former days. So you have this politics of ethnic competition and that's why politics as one, the reason why politics are so much more very long because in the end you with money, you can always split the difference somewhere. We say, will you take 20 percent? No. Will you take 23 percent when? Oh, 28 percent. Okay, we have a deal. But when you're competing, what does it mean to be an American? We haven't. Who gets to define Americanness? Um, we haven't found a way to split the difference on that. And until we do, we're going to have very, very little politics.

Speaker 3:          00:40:13       I mean, there's this, you know, when, when the Sarah payloads and others talk about what it means to be a real American and some things, a real American, other things are not looking for a way to claim ethnic legitimation that we get. We may not have the numbers anymore, but we still define the country and that is one of the things that's going on. That's what these political correctness battles are all about. I mean, it's, it's always true, um, that there are things people don't say. They're always things that people don't say. Even if they're free to set their things, they don't say, how does that happen though? There things that you don't say and who gets to decide. And that's what we're struggling over the people, what we're calling political correctness as people saying. There used to be a set of rules, a of taboos.

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       We have a new set of tools. We want the old taboos to be unto Bu and we want to impose the new Tibu and the people on the receiving end of that say we like our old taboos and we don't want these new taboos. And that, that's where Donald Trump is coming from. I'm an, if that's a real dispute is, it's important, but it's new and it's dangerous and we don't know how to manage it. And we have this deeply opportunistic actor who's taking advantage of it. Okay. So before we fully dive into that then, what does this show you that our, our brand of multiculturalism, which has worked better than virtually any state, you know, European state

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       are our melting pot. Does this tell you that the experiment is starting to fail? I mean, is this the litmus test for that? Well, you know, because that's what it sounds like. First American melting pot never worked as well as Americans told themselves it did in other states.

Speaker 4:          00:41:50       I'm, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:41:53       has had a lot of civic conflict and its history and not just the civil war and then later 19th century to the most violent labor relations anywhere on earth. And those were often about ethnicity that the strykers would be from one group and the police police who shot them would be from a different group. And the strikes will be broken by strike breakers who are from a third group yet again, um, but multiculturalism is difficult to do and it's especially difficult to do when you have moved out of the age of mass production and was one thing when you're bringing in, you needed a lot of bodies to run a modern economy. You don't need so many bodies today. And uh, and we also live in a world in which whereas before, um, there were a lot of pretty average sized rewards today. We live in a world in which there are gigantic rewards and not such great rewards. And the average, what the average person gets is not as attractive relatively speaking as it was two generations ago.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       All right, let's do it. Let's dive into this trump guy because I sense that everything we've talked about for the first half year, a lot of your answers now are sort of directly related to this guy who saw the weakness but not to the

Speaker 3:          00:43:06       personality of this guy, but to the whole system. Well, here, let me, I'll take one last attempt to do it on a wider lens. And then we'll go,

Speaker 4:          00:43:13       um, you know, I imagine

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       somebody standing on a timeline and the center of the timeline is 1990 and uh, they go forward 25 years, 2015, and maybe they go to sleep and they wake up. Who are the most important politicians in the country when they go to sleep? Bush and Clinton, who are the most important politician in the country in 2015, Bush and Clinton, what are they talking about? Iraq and healthcare. Uh, you go back 25 years from 1990 to 1965 and it's a different world. There's an afl cio. Uh, there were riots in the cities. There are liberal Republicans and Segregationist Democrats. So we have had this frozen politics for a long time and it was ready to be changed. And Donald Trump, the existing Republican party couldn't cope with it. And Donald Trump did. He smash the system open. So he's created some opportunities for a new kind of political arrange, an arrangement because the old one had become so stale. But what he's also done, and this is the theme of the book, is He's raising questions, not just about the way we do politics, but rather the whole political system because he is a deeply authoritarian personality. His project is authoritarian and the way he governs is not compatible with the rule of law society.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       It was going to happen one way or another. Right. Do you think that's

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       fair to say? Where is he so unique or that personality trait or that, you know, the type of person that would be willing to do it is so unique that we have like trump, like figures all over the western world. Um, you know, we have a global crisis of. Well I mean unique to our American system because there was no one, even though Bernie was actually talking about rattling the system the same way. And I think that's why there was some crossover with their audiences. We have people in, I mean there's geared builders. There is Marine Le Pen, there's the alternative for Germany. We just, we're recording. I'm just a few days before people see this program. There's an election in Italy in which the traditional parties were swept aside and I kind of joke party the five star movement, which was founded by a comedian and, which is, you know, kind of, uh, an authoritarian populist party of the left is now in league with, um, kind of neo fascist party and we are seeing the breakdown of the traditional parties of the center driven by slow growth and ethnic competition.

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       Well, that's what I'm saying was it gonna happen no matter what, even if trump had lost this election, trump never rode. So nothing is going to happen, no matter what. People make choices. Um, you know, at the darkest moments in American history in 1930 to 18, 60, um, political parties and political movements converged on programs that were constitutional, that were liberal in the broadest sense of the term. And they found leaders who wanted to uphold the American tradition and change it enough that it could continue, but without violating its assets. This time it's as if huey long had become president 1932, not Franklin Delanor Roosevelt. Okay. So let, let's just do like a couple minutes of Russia so that we can get to that because we can't talk about trump without talking about Russia. You tweet a lot about Russia. Obviously you write about Russia like you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       Do you absolutely believe that he himself orchestrated or coordinated some of this stuff with the Russian government? There remain many secrets in the Russia story or there's no mystery, uh, the exact modalities of how the exchange happened that remain uncertain. But here, here, here is what I think I do know and I think what unit, um, we know that Russia wanted Donald Trump to be president and even more badly wanted Hillary Clinton not to be precedent. Um, we know that they intervened in an, in a massive way and an industrial scale and we're learning more and more all the time. How big was to hurt Hillary Clinton first in the Democratic primaries to help Donald Trump first in the republican primaries and then in the general election to help trump it Clinton's expenses. Can you give me just for people that are playing total category? So what are the examples of that?

Speaker 3:          00:47:13       Well, let me. Here's the most dramatic example. Um, uh, the wiki leaks tropes are dumped in ways exactly timed to help Donald Trump. The trump people were expecting the last wiki leaks stump of the election in the first week of October. They knew it was coming. They expected to Donna about October fourth or fifth. It didn't come that day. Instead, it was dumped on October seventh, within an hour of the access Hollywood tape being broken by David Fahrenthold of the Washington Post, the, the Russians or whoever controls wiki leaks, which I believe is, I believe in Mike Pompeo. The head of the CIA believes is weak. Links is a cut out for the Russians have not directly controlled by them. They time their last Wiki leaks dump to help Donald Trump should he have a crisis in the election. And it did, um, and it, and I, I, in the book, I sort of gave the minute by minute tick tock where you see it seats, um, you know, the Russians. Would that help

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       God is the real question of whether the campaign itself was coordinating that or look, we do all sorts of things with other, with foreign governments and elections and all kinds of stuff. So whether, whether the campaign actually was coordinating it with a foreign government, which obviously we've done illegal, we know that Donald, as opposed to them just doing it and having to work out for trump

Speaker 3:          00:48:29       to, to Hakone Americans. Email is a crime. It's a big crime. Um, if you know that a crime has been committed against Americans by you, by a foreign government, you would be annoyed about that, especially if you aspire to be present. United States the idea that Donald, so we don't know to what degree yet. We don't know to what degree, if any, people on his campaign work in regular back and forth communication with the Russians, but he stood on a stage and in June of 2016 and welcomed the Russians breaking American law to steal his opponents. Email to his advantage. His son took a meeting with people who are offering him Russian hacked information on Hillary Clinton. They didn't do at the meeting, the Russians didn't deliver, um, but you know it

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       well when we say the Russians, we have to clarify between the government and just other actors because everyone says the Russians as it,

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       the lawyer one monolithic thing, the true, the lawyer who was at the meeting with somebody with intense Kremlin connections and who advertise that she had criminal connections that she said in the famous email to don Jr, the Russian government wants to elect your father. I have information from the Russian government. It could help your campaign. And he said, great, I love it. Especially in the summer. I am telling you that if an emissary from the Russian government had approached George W dot Bush in the election of 2000 and said, I have information on Al Gore, that'll help you. There wouldn't have been a meeting. They would know a phone call to the FBI and, and there might even have been a phone call to the Gore campaign. You guys should know about this. What do you think? All right. So.

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       All right, so you believe that without question there was coordinate?

Speaker 3:          00:50:03       No, so I, I believe the Russians helped and I believe that Donald Trump is not a belief. It's on video. You can look it up now. Trump, welcome to help and was ready to accept the help, um, and a profit it from the help and that and that. And I believe it made a difference in the election. I believe also that there were Russian attempts as far as we know, they're not successful to interfere with the actual mechanics of voting in a number of states. What? Here's what I don't know. I don't know whether information regular information flowed back from the United States to Russia after don junior is meeting. I don't know that. I don't know whether the Russian operation to influence the American election benefited from any kind of information provided by American counterparts. Those are things we don't know. What I do know is that Donald Trump did not act patriotically and he did not act with respect to the American political system and I will never get past that.

Speaker 3:          00:50:58       Do you think the Democrats have any of the same dirt on their hands? No. Nothing. I mean, look, it's, it's not been bad. Um, they, they did many, uh, they did many things. I mean, when, when Hillary Clinton found, um, that a South American beauty queen who is offended by Donald Trump, do I, is it possible the Clinton campaign paid her money for her story as that's possible, but there's a difference between there. I really do that there's a bright line difference between the usual operations of American politics. It can be pretty rough and accepting, help from the client, the clandestine service of a foreign government. Wayne, give you another example to make a difference. So in 2004, it was no secret that gearhard Schroeder, Germany and Jacques Chirac, the president, France would dearly love to see John Kerry beat George W dot Bush. They made that very clear. They gave interviews.

Speaker 3:          00:51:56       Uh, they are very clear, they are just counting the minutes until Bush was gone and it was also clear in 2012 that Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel preferred a net romney to Obama. Either your allies have opinions. It is. None of those elections. Did we have hostile foreign states? China, Russia, Iran, actors like that, working, not through talking to journalists, but through clandestine intelligence services to help one candidate and heard another and have it all be visible and have the candidate who was helped except the help and imagine if if ran, he tried to intervene in 2012 against or for Obama or Romney and one of those candidates had said, you know, Ryan, if you're listening, thank you for the help. Inconceivable. But that's what trump did. He did it on video. It's not a mystery so. Right. So I want to really talk about the presidency and sort of the decisions in that, but to sort of get us to some sort of ending with this.

Speaker 3:          00:52:59       If this all unfurls way I think you suspect it will unfurl. I mean I definitely would be for been moved. This is where it's going. So let's start with the part that I'm struggling with. This is if we take all of the people that talk about all of this, it seems to me what we're talking about is, okay, well you impeach trump and then really then we have to do something which is unprecedented. Which is most likely pence knew something and now you have to take the whole administration out. Now we suddenly have Paul Ryan as the president or we have a Redo of the election and then we're really at war with Russia. How trump has already changed this. So no pre heat. The Russia part of this is just one of the things that have happened in no presidents is Lyndon Johnson has operated a business while president.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       Nope. No president in my memory has directed his party's funds into his own personal. About 80 percent of the money that the Republican Party and spend on events I'm in last year was paid at a Donald Trump branded resort. So this is like when they're holding meetings at more or with. A friend of mine sent me this clip, George Schultz, who was secretary of state under Ronald Reagan, had been an important executive maybe ceo at Bechtel, the giant engineering firm, and that his confirmation hearing, he was asked Mr Schultz after you become secretary of state, what would your relationship be with Bechtel? And he said, well, there's only one possible answer. Nothing. That's right. That was the standard, um, so when you have is an attack on every ethical norm of the US government, both financial and national security and the sea and half the country is being born along. Then the discussions we're having, our discussions that I prompt in nine slash 2013 as recently as that.

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       I said, someday we'll be having these discussions. People think, well, we will be so far gone even to contemplate. So that is an unprocessable. Um, are we heading toward an impeachment crisis? Here's what were the crisis we're heading toward. And here's what I really, one of my deepest worries, I think we're, there's a good chance we're going to arrive at this place that Mueller is going to report if he's assuming he's not fired and he's going to discover a lot of things that are violations of the law done by mid level and even upper level people. And he may discover some financial malpractices or a lot of laws about things like declaring you're a foreign agent, that there are technical rules about campaign finance and he will discover or may infractions of those. But the core thing and the Russian matter that people like near concerned about is probably not illegal.

Speaker 3:          00:55:36       It's probably not illegal for an American politician to work with a hostile foreign. I mean, no, there isn't such a law and it's hard to imagine what such law would look like. And so where we may be a year and a half from now is confronting this. Donald trump worked in some way. We may be, I'm not predicting this, I'm just hypothesizing worked in some way with a hostile foreign intelligence service, but he himself broken a law and doing that and now the country's going to have to process, um, how to deal with that. And it's going to be part of what is going on in this new era which is ripping apart the, the, the cords that bind us. Because one of the things that makes a country is the assumption how your connections to your fellow Americans, however much you may disagree with them.

Speaker 3:          00:56:18       And however you may have a different color skin or have a different accent from you, that bond is more powerful than the bonds outside the border. And as American politics becomes emphasized, I think a lot of people were saying, my connections with this global movement of reactionary populace forces are more powerful than my bonds to fellow Americans have different skin and different accent. And because of that, unless you could show me that Donald Trump literally broke a federal criminal statute, I don't mind what he did. So how do we get out of this? How do we get out of either that inevitability or do doing, just ended up literally fighting on the street? The way we get out of it is we have to venue American nationhood. Um, and so we have to do, if we get out of this, we're going to do something. Some are going to sound pretty liberal and some are going to sound pretty conservative.

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       I believe we need a lot less immigration because that's, you have to, we have to make a nation. Again, we've taken on a lot of new people. Um, and I, I'm, I'm a naturalized citizen myself. I grew up in Canada and my family is from eastern Europe. Making nations is hard and time consuming. Um, so that's the conservative part of the part you need to say that sounds pretty trumpy it actually, you'll have the whole left and at virtually every Democrat against you that you need a thicker social insurance network. Um, you need, you need a real healthcare system because what we have to deal with, we have to deal with the crisis in life, expect we have to care for each other more. Um, the idea that we went through in the whole second Obama term, people who didn't graduate from college living less long than their parents, which literally did not happen in the Great Depression.

Speaker 3:          00:58:10       And not only did nobody do anything but no one even noticed. This was founded by pair of economists who happened to look at some data. There's no one was paying a lot of attention to this. The opioid epidemic erupted with no one in Washington paying much attention to it. Um, we need, uh, we're going to need to build a stronger, a stronger sense of national identity and, but it's going to be a different kind of national identity is not going to be Sarah Palin's America, but we have to, we're going to have to find some way of agreeing what it means to be an American, what it means not to be an American or whatever it is, the inherent problem there that were caught now between trump and sort of the democrats that love identity politics. And neither one of those is giving us the answer to that.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       I mean, where is the voice? That's where is the political voice that's saying exactly what you just said. Look, we've been here before, um, you know, that melting pot story that you were told it wasn't true at the time. It was a myth we created later. Um, when the United States entered World War One, the biggest minority in the country was one of the biggest with German speaking Americans. Um, and there was real doubt about what the United States would be able to fight Germany in the first world war because the German Americans might be disloyal and the country went on a ramp, I mean a band, German language, newspapers that suppressed German language schools. And it wasn't a melting pot. It was a harsh and rancorous process. And the United States had in the 19th in the immediate aftermath of world war, one of pogroms in American cities that were very against by white Americans against blocks that were deadlier than the antisemitic programs that took place under the czar.

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       Um, uh, those were facts of our history and other that we built. But I'm in the years after World War Two and for half a century after a strong sense of national identity, we have to do that state building and nation building process again. And some of it's going to not look. I is going to look out partly liberal, partly conservative. Um, but it's going to be a new politics for a new century. And the idea that people are going that. And if anyone is standing around saying, I don't know, I think I prefer the problems of 1982 so I can have the solutions of 1982. I mean, you're just not helping.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       What would you say to the people that would say, and this is a little bit more where I fall in all of this, that the government is just not the answer to any of these things that I hear you on all of these problems without question, no doubt. Um, but that to me at this point that everything you're talking about, he's showing me the government no longer functions this, the federal government specifically no longer functions in a way that it can cope or deal with any of these things we get then bad actors that want to wreck the whole thing. Or we get these mid level management people that never really do anything and that you could look at virtually every member of Congress that all the answers that you're asking for, I would argue have almost nothing to do with the government. And that there's other ways now, especially because of the Internet and everything else. There's other ways that we can connect and build things. Right now. Elon musk is the guy that's getting us into space. Warren Buffet's working on an alternate, um, healthcare plan, you know, like that there's just other ways to do this and that, those machines, they can't work anymore. Looks something.

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       A lot of the great social transformations have in the American history is different from that of other countries in this way that oftentimes the way the country is addressed, the most effective cultural change in my lifetime was prompt with mothers against drunk driving. Um, that changed Americans' attitudes. They changed laws to. I mean the, the government, the state has a role. Um, I, I think for things like the gun debate, I mean that I think that is going to be ultimately addressed if it is addressed not by state action brought by private action, which is whatever the laws are. Just if you, if you have kids and you care about them, don't have a gun in the house, you know that justice mothers against drunk driving change. The idea that it was funny, drunk driving was funny too. The idea that it was not funny, so we have to change the idea that if you're a responsible parent, your arm to, um, a new better understanding that if you're armed, you're not a responsible parent a, but

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       the Conservatives won't be happy here you say. That's right. That's right. A lot won't be, but

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       it's true. It just happens to be. What's the saying? The facts don't care about your feelings. It's just a fact. I'm a,

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       I think ben would argue with that fact, but maybe we can do that, but we will be sensitive feelings.

Speaker 4:          01:02:36       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:02:37       but then of course you had the government has to do this and it's true that dollar for dollar and pound for pound, the American government has always been less effective than other governments. But sometimes it's more effective and sometimes it's less effective or things that the government is going to have to do. Um, and the government doesn't have to administer the healthcare system. I would hope it wouldn't. There's a role for the profit motive and for competition. But the idea that we're going to accept a country in which large numbers of Americans are uncovered are outside the healthcare system and um, that people literally die because they get, they can't afford dental care and their teeth fester and fester and gets into their body and it kills them. That has to change. And that the role of the state is part of, if we're going to have a new ethic of nationhood without higher border and more mutual care. Um, yeah, of course governments going to be part of that. And by the way, not that that only the federal government because a lot of the. I mean the country is big. I mean a running California is challenged enough.

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       So since you don't say you're a conservative specifically anymore, I mean, what if people are listening and going, I get this. It's a little bit of both because there's a lot of big government here. There's, I know you're saying you would prefer the government not have to do health insurance, all that. You're, you're, you're sort of all over the place right now. Which I think a lot of people are. I think that's the situation we're in right now. Um, what do you call that now? Not that. And I only ask about labels because although they're becoming increasingly meaningless, I think it helps people go, all right, this is my starting point.

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       Well, I, I don't have a label for it because I think this is one of those moments in American history where you have to do something new. Um, you know, for, for 25 years after the civil war, Americans kept arguing both about the civil war and about its financial consequences. And then they began to notice that in the aftermath that they had these big cities grow up that were intensely corruptly governed. And I'm a new new movements came along and said, uh, we have. It's not like the legacy of the civil wars is resolved. It's still not fully resolved. But in the meantime we have to figure how do we get streetcars in New York? How do we get the water clean? Um, how do we make sure that the older men are and aren't taking bribes and that new political. And at first they weren't, they just knew what the problems were and as they worked on the problems, they develop labels to describe what they were doing.

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       But first you start, I think one of the ways that, um, especially on the right, one of the, one of the ways that we go wrong, it's a new problem is presented to us and instead of looking at the problem studying it, we reach for volume of the Talmud and we say, what did rabbi I'm Russell Kirk say about this three quarters of a century ago? Oh, he never talked about it, therefore we can't do anything about it. I feel good about this. And I feel like you've presented it. A couple of interesting ideas that I haven't, that I haven't quite talked about here. And you're coming at it from different angles. Is there anyone that's doing this politically? I mean, who are the people that you right now think are making? We're doing it right now. You and I and um, and I think, look there, there are a lot of things that come out of the trump era that are actually good.

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       They're prefers gifts that he's given us. One of them is by lying all the time. He's helped us understand how important it is. The people tell the truth when you know you're concerned about what goes on on campus. You know the phrase post-truth began as a compliment, not a criticism. It began by, by people who wanted to overthrow totalitarian truth structures and open the way to many multiple truths. And they discovered that when you do that in politics, but you don't get the opposite of truth, isn't truth. The opposite of truth is lying. We've seen rising levels of civic engagement and we, I think we are seeing, especially among the young, a sense that the political categories they've inherited are obsolete. Yeah. And they have to start looking at problems a new, uh, and that they have to be begin with the problems and then develop the solutions.

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       And then people will disagree with a new party system will come from is, you know, as we really contemplate, how do we improve the health outcomes of our fellow citizens? How do we deal with drugs? How do we deal with a declining life expectancy of those who don't go to college, they're going to disagree and then they'll find like minded groups and they'll end up inside the Republican and democratic parties. Those institutions will always be there. The content will change. And, and along the way we'll find new names, but anyone politically, I think I appreciate the compliment and I think there are some people that are trying to make some sense these days, but really, I mean, do you think anyone politically, I think it will start at the state level. Um, you know, I think the mayor here in Los Angeles as an example, someone who's trying to figure out how things work.

Speaker 3:          01:07:11       Andrew Cuomo in New York, I'm in kind of a bully, but he cares about why does, why does it cost three times as much or whatever it is to build a subway in New York as in London. Um, and um, so I think this, the regeneration of the American political system has always come from cities and states and I think that will be even more true in the 21st century. A man here in California, what you need, you need a revival of political competition. Uh, one of the reasons why I stay a registered Republican is you. I look at California and say, this is what happens when you get a one party state. You get factional politics. It doesn't mitigate the problems of ethnically driven politics. It makes them worse. So we're gonna need, we're gonna need two party competition. We're going to need a new solutions. And that's what, that's what I try to do in my work is to try to offer, you know, the, the possibility of a more useful kind of politics. It's interesting because, I mean, that's exactly what I tried to do with the show. And even last week I had Mike shellenberger on who's running as a Democrat, you know, he, he's more of an old school Democrat and he's into nuclear power and all sorts

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       of new ideas and using technology to solve our problems running against Gavin newsome, who is, who's the hero of the left than he thinks he's too left. And then this week I have you on to discuss your frustrations with the Conservatives and all that. So that's. This is what we have to keep doing. At the end of the day, that's all we got, right. That's, that's what I was. And as long and we have to defend our ability to do that and defend that both against those who would use violence and against those who would use corruption to try to shut down proper discussions. Perfect. That's a perfect ending right there. Thank you for though, I suspect. Yeah. My pleasure. I suspect we'll do this again. Maybe we'll, we'll get ben in here and we'll do that little facts over feelings, things that we get a couple of other people in here to to mix up some of these ideas for more.
