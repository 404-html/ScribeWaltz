Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Let's go all the way back to one of my favorite years, 1985, and talk about Russia today. There's so much happening in the news lately with this giant country, but since we're all in election mode here in the United States, pretty much all the time, most of the news about Russia is getting completely lost and there's a bunch going on. First. There's the ongoing war with Russia in Syria, which has become the deadliest conflict since World War II. It's estimated that over 400,000 people have died so far, and sadly it seems that there's no light at the end of the tunnel. Then there's the rumors that wikileaks is somehow working with the Russian government to influence our election right here. This is become a big talking point in democratic circles as wikileaks continues to drop information about Hillary Clinton, emails and Clinton Foundation donors, even Julian Assan, Wiki leaks, editor in chief is promising more October surprises and clearly they're not going to be aimed at helping hilary or the Democrats on top of those issues.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       There's a lot of other reasons to believe that Vladimir Putin sees America in retreat around the world and he's looking to fill that void. Russia is occupied Ukraine for two years now and it's clear that Russia is making moves throughout Syria without us approval. Sometimes indirect conflict with American goals, although it's completely unclear to me what exactly those American goals are. Only four years ago in America's last presidential election, Mitt Romney was widely mocked for calling Russia without question our number one geopolitical foe, and yet now it seems that it's the Democrats who are leaning more hawkish on Russia just listened to hillary or Tim Kaine and the debate so far, the democratic nominees are much more anti Russia then either trump or pence. Is trump to close to Putin or does he have other Russian business interests in mind? I guess that's possible too. There could be a new cold war brewing, but this time there may not be a rocky Balboa verse.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       Ivan Drago boxing match on Christmas Day in Mascoutah help us work things out. While I don't think there's any legitimate reason that a direct conflict with Russia is on the way, I do think it's important that we start talking about are deeply complex relationship with Russia in an open and honest way, not just by demonizing and making fun of Putin, which don't get me wrong, he makes it very easy to do, but by really understanding what's going on within Russia and the geopolitical circumstances which have led us to where we are now. If we don't do a little homework now, then we'll all be easily manipulated by both politicians as well as by the media that has their own goals in mind. Boogie men are a lot less scary when you know a little bit about them. My guest this week is author and columnist Cathy Young. Kathy grew up in Russia until the age of 16 when she moved to the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       She's written for the New York Times, The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, as well as my hometown newspaper. She focuses on some of my favorite topics, including political correctness and free speech, and from what I've seen, she equally calls out the bad elements of both the regressive left and the alt right. She's also been an outspoken critic of modern feminism and a defender of the men's rights movement. Those she sees some issues with that movement as well. I've you, Cathy, is one of the few people really trying to take both sides to task and give both sides a chance before forming her own opinions all the while not being too attached to a specific ideology, not being locked into a specific ideology and being intellectually flexible is one of the most important attributes you can have and one that I consistently strive to have for myself. The last few months had been interesting as we've seen many never trump. Republicans slowly fall in line to a lesser degree. We've seen it with the Bernie Bros who seemed far less inclined to go all in for Hillary. The wider point here though, is that everyone is making their own calculations and decisions based on the information around them. The key, no matter what you believe, is to have access to new ideas and concepts and to have conversations that'll either enforce your beliefs or change them for the better.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       My guest this week is an author and columnist who's written for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and is a regular contributor to reason and my hometown newspaper, Newsday, Cathy Young. Welcome to the Rubin report and it's great to be here. I am very excited. That was your hometown. That is. I am a long islander. Born in Brooklyn. Grew up in long island, lived in New York City my whole life. Now here I am in La. You're a Jersey girl though, right? I am. Well, I am originally from Russia yet we're going to get into that, but I have been a jersey girl since 1981, so it has actually been a while. That sounds like a book right there. From Jersey. From Russia to Germany. Russia to Jersey. Well, I did write a book called growing up in Moscow, which was my first book came out in 89 when I was fresh out of college.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       So yeah. Well, that's exactly where I want to start. So, so, well done. Okay. So in my direct message, I talked a bit about Russia and I have a sense that in the next month or so we're going to be hearing a lot more about Russia between what's going on in Syria, people, you know, talking about the Wiki leaks stuff and is there somehow a connection that they want to take down? Hillary does, right? Does trump have a business ties to Russia? All of this stuff. So let's go back to your first 16 years. What was it like growing up, uh, in Russia and uh, if you don't want to give me your exact age, give me a rough estimate of the years that he was born in 1965. Okay. You never, you never know. Yeah, I'm, I'm fine with that. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about it. Talk about growing up in Russia. So yeah, I was growing up in the president of a years and it was interesting because at the time it really seemed like the, that existed

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       at the time was really forever. Um, and it was funny because, uh, there was a book, uh, by Russian dissident named Andrea Mora, called Willis Soviet Union existed until 1984 and he picked that day because of Orwell, of course. And it's so bizarre because at the time, uh, I heard about this book, you know, my father was a kind of, well, both my parents were really kind of closet dissidents and we had banned literature on the house. Um, and what was bad, what type of literature was actually banned. Oh, anything that was critical of, uh, of the Soviet system social needs. And of course the works of dissidents. Um, there were, uh, there is her, we're not even really formally banned, but kind of really frowned upon, um, from, uh, the early years of the Soviet regime, like people who were executed for being a sort of an opposition. I'm war.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       Well, of course was done. Uh, I didn't actually get to read it until I had left the Soviet Union. And, uh, it's interesting because a number of people who read or, uh, well, uh, in the, it was called Samas dot, you know, these typewritten leaflets that were kind of passed around from person to person underground of people who read world who read or, and sort of smuggled in for an to a lot of people in the Soviet Union really were shocked to learn that orwell had never actually been to the Soviet Union. Some of them were sure that we're, well, like George Orwell must've been like the pen name for our Russian emigre because who else could have understood the system so well? Yeah, he did. Yeah. And the sort of the, the pressure of, uh, the pressure to conform to the dominant ideology. So anyway, yes. So, uh, Andre Amalric who picked that date because of, uh, the book 1984, of course.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       And at the time when I first started that it, I didn't, no one could really imagine that this would sort of come true because it actually doesn't exist that long passed the 1984, you know, he was off by 70 years. That's when I was growing up, no one really could have imagined that and I think that's kind of a useful thing to keep in mind when we think of today's events in the sense that, you know, we really have no idea whatsoever what the world is going to look like in five, six, seven years. Things are really unpredictable. They really are. And that's why I did the direct message because I want people to have some knowledge about some of this stuff. So the second we start hearing about this, I know we're not all caught guard and have no cancer, but you know, in terms of what it was like to grow up, uh, in, in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       And it's really difficult to answer on one word because, um, you know, it wasn't in many ways it was a complex society. It was not the same as, it wasn't in Stalin era where, you know, it really was kind of back down the height of the totalitarian. Um, when you know, very little, uh, information or content as we would say today, was allowed to kind of seep in. That was not thoroughly filtered through the official ideology. I'm like, at the time, for instance, uh, back in the thirties and, you know, even the, even the fifties a dusty yefsky was bad. Maybe not, again, not officially banned, but very difficult to get and certainly wasn't studied in schools and colleges. Uh, by the time that I was in a high school in Russia, we actually had a prime and punishment on the curriculum. Um, and, you know, we, the things that mentioned religion were kind of allowed a, anything that really was not very overtly critical of the Soviet Union was, okay, well Dr Chicago for instance, but I did have the experience of um, you know, growing up in a situation where when I was maybe seven or eight years old, but I started going to school and I started coming home and saying, oh, well, we live in the best country in the world because we have communism.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       That was when my parents decided that they kind of had to explain to me that, you know, not, not really, that is not really quick. Can do some of those leaflets that were going around the age of seven, but they just kind of talked to me and kind of gave me a little bit of an explanation of what was what. And uh, um, and I remember very well my mother telling me, you know, he really, you cannot tell anyone at school what we talk about at home because otherwise you will go to jail. And I'm not even sure that they would have because again, at the time, you know, things were a little more flexible and open that they used to be. Um, I actually know of a situation, a friends of my parents that they are sudden started talking in kindergarten about how, you know, he, his dad was saying that Lennon was really not the greatest person who ever lived.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       And um, and nothing. But actually he has one of the teachers, one of the kindergarten teachers called that his mom and said and basically said, you know what? I don't really care what you talk about at home, but you know, please don't do it in front of the kid because you don't know who else is going to tell us. And she was pretty a pretty enlightened for the teacher. But in this society there was a lot of kind of flexibility under the radar, so to speak. But officially it was all very conform as we had to at school. We had to attend these mandatory meetings where everyone had to kind of repeat the slogans and, you know, uh, sing the praises of the Soviet Union. And this is actually one reason that a lot of the stuff that was going on today in American universities really resonates with me because, you know, I've been saying to my mom, my dad passed away two years ago unfortunately.

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       But I've been saying to my mom, you know, this really feels like the Soviet Union where they heard you. And so these meetings where you have to sit there and say all the right things and it's not just that you're not allowed to say, you know, things you're not allowed to say is that it's not. You have to say the things you're supposed to say, which is, well, as I'm listening, I mean, I absolutely see that through line. I'm not saying because, you know, we're not, no one gets hurt into the gulag, you know, their resident. Because I mean, again, when I was growing up, I did know that he could, you know, it wasn't very likely maybe, but you could go to prison, uh, for um, you know, saying heretical things. But you know, we are kind of getting to the point in many areas of society where you can lose your job, you know, for, for saying the wrong thing or ideologically which in the Soviet Union, the 19 seventies, that actually losing your job was a much more likely outcome though I'm going to present. Like, unless you were actually like politically active as a destination.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Right. It's interesting because I find that I used to give anonymous people on line more crap for being anonymous, right. A lot of people would respond and so, you know, I don't want to lose my job right now. I don't know that there's a lot of instances of that in the United States, but it's more about that chilling effect, which is sort of what you're talking about existed all the time. So your parents never went to jail, but they don't really talk about this. It's funny for all that. So, so 16 years old you moved here, was it because you realized that there was this great opportunity

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       when, uh, they started really saying a Soviet Jews in the seventies. And my dad had actually talked for several years about I'm leaving. Uh, my mom was a little, um, more uncertain about it. She had a job that she really loved. She was teaching at one. She's a music teacher and she actually still teaches a, but she was teaching at one of the top music schools in Moscow. Uh, and uh, you know, she had students that she was very attached to when she just really felt it. It was funny because she felt that she would never find that kind of work in the US and she actually ended up doing pretty well, I think. Um, so yeah, but, so she was a little hesitant and it was also just sort of the general uncertainty, you know, moving to a whole new country, learning a new language.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       And I went to a school that specializes in English by the way. So I started learning English when I was about seven and it wasn't really at the time with a view to going to America eventually it was just because, I mean, it was a better school than most and it was a, I think because of English there was also more exposure to materials that you wouldn't normally see on a curriculum and so on. So, uh, you know, for me it was really, at least in terms of language, it wasn't quite as intimidating. Uh, my parents really did have to kind of start all over again. So yeah, if finally, uh, I think, um, my, my parents both felt that things were getting worst were the end of the seventies. Um, and uh, at the time, again, no one knew what was going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:15:46       Yeah. Um, a lot of people thought that there was going to be a kind of resurgence of Stalinist type, uh, you know, really harsh, brutal dictatorship where you could go to present and very easily for saying the wrong thing. Um, and uh, at that point you were, you were allowed to just pick up and leave. Your parents were allowed to just, okay, we're leaving now. Not just, well, no, no, no. It certainly wasn't that simple. I mean, you had to apply for permission to leave. Um, it was, uh, it was not for any one of, was basically limited to so good Jews who were officially being allowed to leave for like repatriation to Israel and worth family reunification. And they really like the Jews, but they weren't letting the Jews leave. Is that pretty much the antisemitism? That was another thing. The antisemitism was growing much more noticeable.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       It was getting to be very difficult for a young Jewish people to get into college. Um, you know, we, my parents personally, new situations where, you know, kids who were extremely good students, uh, were basically blog bull during the admission exams and, and it was this completely closed system where they didn't have to tell you like where you had failed on the exams and the, the, the, it was really, really easy to kind of kill you if, if they wanted to, especially since part of the infants exam, by the way was Marxism, Leninism and quiz here you had to write all these tuxes, you know, the plenary session of the Communist Party in 1956 and then they can quiz you on the stuff and, you know, and uh, and it was really, again, if they wanted to failure, it was just really easy to do that. So, um, you know, and I think that was a, that was another reason that prompted my parents to finally decide to leave.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       But yeah, we officially, um, we were emigrating to reunite with my father, his aunt and Israel. And um, and then what, how it was the whole thing kind of existed under Jackson Vanik. It was kind of an arrangement where the United States where, you know, Russia was where the Soviet Union at the time was getting, um, kind of benefits and trade with the US in exchange for allowing Soviet Jews to leave. Um, and I think there were a few other groups like pentecostal Christians who were kind of a very persecuted sucked who were also part of that, but mainly it was Soviet Jews say. Yeah, once you, once you actually left the Soviet Union, then you got to Vienna as a way station and then you've got a choice of did you want to go to Israel or did you want to go to the states? So you told them or they were under the impression you were going to Israel, but then you went to the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       I think they kind of knew. Yeah, I think they knew what was going on because I think at the time, like by the time that we were leaving, I think about 80 percent of the Soviet Jews who were at a grading, we're actually going to the United States. They didn't really care. So what was it like you, you sort of had the benefit of, as you said, speaking English at an early age and go into A. Yeah, what was it like though to move to New Jersey? 16 and, and he actually wasn't. My very first statement was Jackson Heights, Queens, Queens. Yeah. And uh, this is funny. My, I actually um, worked uh, for about six months before my parents eventually found work in Jersey and that was why we ended up moving. Uh, but um, for a while I was the main breadwinner because I was the person with English and uh, I had a job as a secretary with the boy scouts of America, New York chapter.

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       Uh, yeah, because I also, I knew how to type and I knew how to tighten Russian, but I rented a, a typewriter, an English keyboard typewriter, and it took me about a week to relearn how to type in English and I'm like, what was that like? I mean, you go from Russia and now you're the breadwinner for your parents in this new country learning a new job and all that. I mean, how did that feel? Oh, actually felt really exciting. I, yeah, no, no. That whole period of my life was actually quite exciting because, um, you know, just the mirror experience of going abroad, you know, and my father actually had traveled a bit because he was a musician. Uh, he had traveled with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. He was actually mainly, he was a sound producer, uh, for, uh, for the radio, but he was also a violinist and uh, uh, he did occasionally get the travel. He was, uh, yeah, he had some interesting experiences to. He was actually in England in 1968 when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia and he would have defected for sure if he doesn't have a family back home. And my mom actually wasn't even sure that he was coming back because when she heard about the invasion, she was like, oh, I got you. He's going to the doctor.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       Uh, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       no, no, no, he bought. But he, uh, I, I think he was very, very talented and uh, I mean, I don't think he was tempted to actually do it because he knew that he had a family back home. But he did say, you know, that if it wasn't for that, you know, he probably would have made that decision because it was just a, um, and you know, they had the experience of uh, uh, you know, being sort of booed by the woodlands of London.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       It was just, it was really, really trying for. Yeah, they didn't know we could go on and being an immigrant. But it was, for me, it was

Speaker 2:          00:22:07       really exciting because first of all, it was this whole world of information that had opened up to me. Like, you know, reading

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       well and reading his paper

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       and, and I remember I just the experience and, and I actually still remember this, I remember when, when we came here, you know, I opened, um, I think it was the New York Post and this was, this was shortly before Reagan was elected. So you know, I opened the New York Post and I see this

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       really mean cartoon of Jimmy Carter and I was like, this is just the president and here was this cartoon. It basically did some as a complainant. I mean I love that. I love obviously frame so much of what you write about and, and that was just an amazing and that just suddenly, I mean I still remember that because it was this moment that really crystallized, you know, the fact of being in a free country that you can actually do this. And I want to talk about some of the issues of being in a free country, but let's do, let's do one other thing on first because I mentioned some stuff about Russia up top. What do you make of just generally what's happening with Russia now? Just, let's spend a couple minutes on that. Putin is really trying to fill this void that America seems to be leaving in the world. What, what is going on in Syria? Have they officially taken Ukraine? GimMe Gimme state of

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       Russia on the state of Russia. I thought, uh, you know, pushing. Definitely ever since he came to power, it's been increasingly clear that I think he wants to, you know, rebuild a Russia as a superpower. It can really return to what the Soviet Union was, although I'm not really sure he understands that he took Ukraine right or. Yeah, well he is. He took Crimea. Yeah. There is this view that puts in a sort of super humanly claver right. And, you know, he's this great strategist. I'm not really sure that's the case because, you know, actually, uh, arguably he could have gotten further with Ukraine if he had just maintained a, you know, tried to maintain a friendly relationship with them then, you know, trade and so on without actually trying to force his person. I don't want to say his puppet because. Yeah, I don't, I'm not even really sure that the president who was a who was removed was completely a puppet of the prevalent, but he was definitely sort of Putin's man and I think he in a way kind of overplayed his hand.

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       Uh, in Ukraine. Um, I mean right now he's in a situation where he's much better at kind of messing things up for other countries than he is a, you know, actually doing something good for Russia because right now for instance, the situation with Ukraine is that, yeah, I mean the, the new government in Ukraine is not really able to push through the reforms that are ones partly because it's bogged down in this endless kind of undeclared war that's going on in the eastern regions. And you know, they've got poor breathing down their neck basically. But at the same time Russia is also bogged down in this. I'm declared war and it can really tell. A lot of the stuff can kind of come back and bite Russia because they're creating this kind of quasi mercenary army of armed people who will have the experience now of fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       And the guerrilla war and who knows what will happen when these people are told, well we don't need you anymore because we're kind of done with this. So I think that's good. Prayed a lot of the stabilization in Russia itself. Um, and he and I could go on and on and under does because he's also his god, he's kind of got a tiger by the tail and Chechnya because basically he made a deal with a guy runs on Kadira of, of well you basically like, you make sure church now stays a Russian province and you know, you make sure that on God's 100 percent of the votes and judge now elections, which I think he does and you know, you make sure that, you know, we get a cut of the oil profits and exchange, you can really do anything you want. So, and this is actually kind of interesting because I know that there are people on the rights in the west who see Putin as this kind of bull work of the fence against Sharia law, uh, under Putin's leadership there as a part of the Russian Federation.

Speaker 2:          00:27:14       That is basically a Sharia state, which has changed now. Yeah. And not many people know that this, I didn't know that it actually is. It's, you know, women are forced to wear veils, you know, this was a guy who was actually spoken out in favor of a, um, a polygamy which is technically illegal under a Russian law and, you know, and there are people who have said like, wait a minute, you know, this guy is the president of a, a, you know, a republic that is part of the Russian Federation. What is he doing? Really advocating things that are contrary to the Russian constitution. And of course, who really cares because, you know, the law currently is votes to keep the boats. And also this guy is a Cadeira is, is a very, very strong and supporter. Like he, uh, if necessary he will bring out his troops that are loyal to him, you know, to fight.

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       Uh, I mean, I, I, it's pretty well known that he's sent people to eastern Ukraine to, uh, to fight in the guerrilla war there. So. Yeah. But at the same time, it has kind of a tiger by the tail situation because if suddenly it becomes out of the stages for turn tournament, you know, who knows what's going to happen. And he's a, he's a pretty dangerous guy, you know, he's a, he's kind of the classic warlord who was, you know, God as people who are extremely loyal, they have a potential, is quite as smart as his often given credit for it. I think a lot of the time when he's succeeded, it's mainly because of the failures of the West because, you know, he has his side. He is, he's good at stepping into the vacuum that arises when, for instance, in American leadership kind of pulls back. So that's the perfect segue of course, to everything that's going on in Syria. What is he trying to accomplish in Syria? Is He really trying to.

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       And I think part of that is really just to signal that, you know, he stands behind US allies. Uh, and yeah, he's a sensibly making noises about, you know, creating the preconditions for a, you know, a sod to talk to, talk to the opposition. But, you know, given the way that put him treats the opposition and Russia, I mean, okay, he doesn't carpet bomb, but uh, uh, but that's really, other than that, the rest of it, he's really not a talking to the opposition guy. He's more of a, you know, kill the opposition quietly or, you know, put them in jail or, you know, basically leave them with no institutional support whatsoever guy. And, you know, we, we, I, I think it's really fairly clear that, you know, the, the murder of Boris Nemtsov who was a forum at one point, a really popular governor who later became part of the opposition. And uh, um, you know, who I think, who had the charisma really to, uh, to appeal to people. I don't know that he actually was directly a threat to put in. But, you know, buddy might sell it. It's fairly clear that there was some kind of official hand in his murder. So, I mean, I think that kind of tells you a lot about, um, you know, how puts in feels about dealing with the possession. So basically the idea here, I think he wants to keep us on empower.

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       I think my guy, it's probably good for the economy at some level.

Speaker 2:          00:30:52       Yeah, exactly. And I think it's good for kind of maintaining strong man image both inside and outside Russia put there. I clearly kind of has an affinity with dictators a, he gets pretty upset at regime change anywhere, you know, he was from, I've heard stories and I got and you know, these are sort of rumors from people who are, who have been on the inside, but I've heard that he was extremely upset by what happened to Qaddafi and that he really took that personally. He took it personally. Yeah. Well that's what they may someday way. And I think he, part of his issues with the United States and I think it goes back to a rock and a few other things. But he really does see the United States as, you know, promoting regime change around the world. And um, and I think that's part of this beef with the US.

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       Yeah. So, so is that the irony of where we're at at the moment that it seems to me that the Democrats and Hillary are more anti Russia than the Republicans at the moment. Now maybe trump has business ties for going in and toppling Gaddafi and apparently now it came out that a lot of the leaders of the army were saying don't do it. So. So there is some legitimacy to Putin's fears, I suppose, if you were putting. You can. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       Yeah. Well, I mean I think that, uh, what, when we'll look at it and I don't really want to get until the whole Middle East. We're going, we're going to spend the next hour talking about the Middle East. Yeah, I understand the kind of anti introduction of good men. I think we've definitely overextended ourselves and you know, doing things around the world that get us into really messy situations. At the same time, I'm a little skeptical of this whole kind of line of argument that, oh, well we've made such a mess. There was this assumption that if only it weren't for our intervention, like everything would be, you know, peaceful and quiet. I think that that's necessarily the case and I think that in a way, it's funny because it kind of parallels a lot of the left wing arguments about foreign policy. Like the other day I saw somebody on twitter and I don't, I'm not even sure why this came up, but for some reason they were talking about how, oh, well it was really Nixon who was responsible for the genocide in Cambodia.

Speaker 2:          00:33:39       I don't know what he was actually responsible for that. So it's this mindset that somehow the west is behind everything bad that happens in non western countries. And I think it's again, kind of ironic that we're seeing the same kind of mindset on the, on the anti interventionist, right. Today. And again, this is not to say that, you know, mistakes have been made so to speak, but it really doesn't mean that, you know, if we, if we hadn't blundered in Libya and Iraq and so on, that, that region today would be just, you know, what model of peace and quiet I don't think that we have no idea by the way what would have happened. But we do know that actually Iraq was better and they were having basically free elections and then we left, had signed the thing to leave. But Obama is a collective responsibility for this.

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       I think, um, you know, uh, leaving aside the merits of the invasion itself, I think it's pretty clear that the administration and Iraq post invasion was very badly mismanaged. Dan, I think that was part of why I think they weren't able to get a deal that would have allowed us to keep some troops there. Um, but again, we don't want them to all think what you're saying is that not everything all the time, no, it's not. And that it's really whether you're blaming George W dot Bush or whether you're a blaming Hillary. And Obama, you know, it's really much, much more complicated than that. There are forces, and it's kind of ironic because in a way, in a ways demeaning really to the people in those countries to say that, oh, well, everything they do is really only because of instigation and so forth. They have their own extremely complicated history. Um, and you know, they do things for their own reasons. I mean, obviously we're contribute for better or for worse, but it's, it's really an oversimplification to say that, oh well. And a lot of conservatives are saying that now. Oh, well, Hillary started this mess in the Middle East

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       also. Of course, it always depends on where you want to start history, because there was something called the Ottoman Empire, that realm, and then there was the British empire and then the United States and all that. Okay. So, yeah, so. All right, let's, uh, let's move from some geo political stuff and let's talk about the issues of the day. Let's, let's come back to America for a moment because that's where you do most of your writing about now. And

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       no know I do actually write quite a bit about Russia because I do have, you know, the, the experience that I think, you know, it was really helpful in assessing what's happening there.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Yeah. So. All right, let's start with, we're going to talk about the regressive left and the alt right. Which one would you prefer to start with?

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       What feels like a better transition there? Uh, you mean like what I like to start?

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Well, there were regressive laughter. All right first. Oh, let's do the alt right. Okay. So let's do

Speaker 2:          00:36:55       Italy in Russia is a good kind of segue to the alt right because I think that a lot of people on the outright have the uh, you know, put some cold.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       Yeah. Okay. So how would you just give me your. And of course a lot of them are just crumbling walls. Really. There's a lot of trolls on the. Alright, we know that. But what is, what is your definition of the alt right? What is the outright to you? Because I think nobody's defining it properly. So everyone, everyone uses it for their own right. But they're on purpose

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       right? Well, it's difficult to define actually because, uh, there probably isn't a single. All right. Um, I mean it started maybe five or six years ago, uh, was a bunch of people on really obscure websites and there are these different kind of factions of the outright, some of which are the, like there's the end. I haven't really written about the whole neoreaction array, so called dub phenomenon, which is really about a kind of going back to pre democracy political institutions, you know, a lot of them are three pro monitor care, which is kind of a nonstarter. The United States.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       It's not, let's not tear up the whole system. That was. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38:12       But I think today what people, uh, with people we usually have referred to when they talk about the alt right is it's more kind of white nationalist segments. And I think that has primarily come to be, uh, associated especially with the, um, the trump campaign, which, uh, you know, the alt right has been kind of a, a, an affiliate. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       Way. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but my. My take on it has been that when people refer to the alt right, yeah, they're referring to this white nationalist group of people and these neonazis in that thing. My feeling about it from what I've seen, just being online and talking to people and seeing what people send me things is that a huge percentage of the alt right is just really disaffected. People who love memes and they love shit posting and sending a Nazi imagery to people and all this stuff. Not because they're Nazis, but they're so frustrated with the system that they're just trying to get a reaction. Now I'm not apologizing for them and I don't like getting those things. I wouldn't stop them. Sure we get as long as they're not trying to physically harm anybody, but I. to me, the the white nationalist subset of it obviously exists, but it actually strikes me as a small portion of a movement that really is just pissed it conservatives that are pissed at the people on the right who didn't do the things they said they were going to do. They're pissed at the system, they're pissed at the media. I mean, a lot of the things that I actually do care about yet, there is absolutely a truly Zena phobic component to it that doesn't like black people, that doesn't like Muslims, gays, Jews, et cetera. Do you think that's fair to say that there's some,

Speaker 2:          00:39:52       it's really difficult to estimate the percentages because it's not like it's not a movement where you can do a poll and find out what percentage of people who are sort of affiliated with the alt right online, uh, or actually just sort of disaffected conservatives or libertarians who, you know, like names and shit posting or former liberal liberal. Yeah. As opposed to, you know, actual white nationalists or uh, you know, even neo Nazis, uh, we don't have a know how many people are actually involved because a lot of them could be like, one person was the 30 handles. It could be like a, what was that guy's name? Joshua Goldberg. Remember this was the, a Jewish guy who had all these different identities including, uh, including a Nazi. He posted. Oh yeah. This is an amazing story. And I actually, he eventually got a rust, the current season of south park, I don't know if you're watching, but I know I know.

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       No, but he eventually got arrested I think for a raw trying to stage some kind of a terrorist attack. Like he was talking to some radical Muslims online also and I think he was trying to persuade them that he was a radical Muslim too. And so he was trolling every one, but he had some personas that really were, you know, that we're all right. And so yeah, we could be, you know, dealing with you don't know, you know, you never really know who we are dealing with, you know, you can be dealing with a teenager who know, sitting in his parents bail basement,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       you know, and pretending to be like 10 or 15 different people on twitter. So then what do you make of the, of the strength of it then Hillary, when Hillary calls out the alt right, are we talking about an actual political movement here or

Speaker 2:          00:41:50       is something of a political movement? I mean, we know that there are these, there are people, um, websites like vade there, you know, those are real people, those are not, you know, teenagers a pretending to be somebody you know, well, posting from their parents' basement. Uh, now how much do they actually have? Again, nobody knows. But I do think that there's a real movement there. I think that they are gaining a lot of visibility recently and it's really difficult to even know how to deal with those because in a way of course, by criticizing them, you know, people like me aren't giving them more visibility, but at the same time I do kind of feel that it is important to. And I really hate the word call out because it's been so thoroughly kind of, you know, appropriate. Uh, Duh, Duh, you know, Ms Dot Hughes by the social justice people.

Speaker 2:          00:42:44       But I do think that it's important to point to this and say, yeah, you know, this was really going on in. This was not a good thing. And I think that, um, there are young people who do kind of ton to get drawn in by the stuff. For Real, we have a lot of young people, uh, who are extremely uneducated, you know, and I think that is a problem with the educational system. We have a problem of kind of teaching relativism and the Sun's Thought, oh, well, you know, there's really no such thing as objective truth and I think people have, people have been saying for a long time, you know, those kinds of mindset eventually leads to embracing Holocaust denial that says, hey, you know, who's to say what really happened of the real truth is really historical truth is really only just a matter of who gets to control the narrative, you know? Right.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       That is a big problem because whoever yells, I mean, just yesterday, did you see this guy at the trump rallies screaming about it? It's like, I didn't retweet it because I don't want to amplify these crazy people. And yet at the same point they've suddenly found a voice, trump. And I don't, I don't think he's obviously, I don't think he's a Holocaust denier, but there you. What is the connection to trump in this? I guess it's, the

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       connection to trump is not because of his rhetoric on immigration and not, not his specific positions so much as just that kind of level of vehemence and the common flake, you know, and I'm in the, yeah, it's true that he didn't say all Mexican illegal immigrants are rapists, but like the whole, Oh, you know, these Mexican, you know, Mexico is something as these rapists, uh, you know, kind of stuff. I think it did Sunday message to a lot of people on the kind of genuine, lazy, no fallback. Um, uh, you know, parts of the outright that, hey, you know, this is a guy who thinks that way we do. And um, I think ann coulter is kind of a conduit there too because she's, you know, she's actually engaged for years in some extremely, um, uh, kind of a nasty rhetoric targeting all sorts of different people and including immigrants and invitation to come on the show by the way.

Speaker 2:          00:45:09       Oh, okay. Okay. And you know, she became a big cheerleader for trump. And I mean, the, the, the story that I've heard is that actually it's the success of her anti-immigration book, you know, audio Adios America, uh, was what, what kind of drove trump to decide suddenly to make an aggression, uh, the biggest show of his campaign because he never really. This is kind of the interesting thing. In 2012, he actually criticized Mitt Romney for being too anti integration, which is funny in a way when people talk about trump, you know, being this and that. Ideologically, I think trump ideological, he trump is a trump. See, you know, he's a, is interested in his own advancement. And that's it. That doesn't make him not dangerous because you know, and an ego maniac who is a, you know, very close to being president of. Well, I don't know how close right now, if either one of them went to the trump points.

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       I agree. I think he's, he's out for his own. We don't know it. I don't think we fully understand what his motivations are, which may be all presidents have that. But what I think Hillary is the more conventional, egomaniac political. My fear with the trump thing is that it's not, I don't think he's a white nationalist or something like that by any estimation, but I think he's allowed for it to suddenly become. It's sort of okay, you know, and I like you. I'm a free speech absolutist. So as long as these people aren't calling to harm for letting them be out there and I'm not for banning any of them, just like I'm not for banning Milo from twitter and all that, but I fear at some level that we're normalizing. Well that's, yeah, I think that is a problem and I think that is really why I felt that it was important to, uh, to address this and I have.

Speaker 2:          00:47:09       And I really do have. I mean, I think Milo was a very smart guy who has done some great things and you know, criticizing and mocking the social justice warriors. I mean, I think it was a really, really big mistake for him to start essentially normalizing and legitimizing the, uh, the, these kind of creepy or uh, uh, segments of the outright, right? Yeah. Already. Have you seen them turn on him lately? Because I've seen Nazis show up. And how much of that is theater, you know, I mean, I don't know how many of these people like, yeah, I never actually get out of the basement. Uh, I would imagine so. Yeah, time. It's probably. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I think a lot of what goes on while the outright as theater. I mean, you know, I've gotten threatening tweets and messages from these people that I don't really take seriously.

Speaker 2:          00:48:08       I mean, it's a, I think a lot of that as really just kind of showing off and kind of being assholes on twitter. Uh, so the same time, you know, when, when you have a lot of this very violent rhetoric going on, you never know when it's going to actually, uh, you know, trickled down to the wrong person who actually decides to do something about it and not just some tweets and so on. So I'm not going to say that this is sort of not dangerous because when you have a lot of this rhetoric that demonizes people that calls for violence, uh, I mean there's a lot of rhetoric come calling for, you know, retaliation against enemies of trump. And I've seen a lot of, you know, I, I think that the, the, the rhetorical atmosphere, the rhetorical climate right now is really, is really bad. And of course I'm not going to blame that entirely on the. All right, this may be a good moment.

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       So that's a segue to the regressive. That's exactly where I wanted to go with that because my, the reason I've been somewhat sympathetic to whatever the alt right is, is that I do see, and I'm not defending the white nationalists and for the purpose of this, but for all of the people that are just shit posting and upsetting everybody and are and are sending memes all over the place and trying to be heard and all that. They're angry at the establishment, which I fully understand and they're angry at political correctness and who did that. To them it was the regressive left, it was the people on the left that silenced everybody with these false cries of racism and they're a natural reaction. And that's why I've been sort of what

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       Hollywood kind of chaotic reaction, real argument that I remember actually arguing with my low back. The 40 abroad does articles that were kind of serious way when he was just kind of starting to kind of dabble and you know, apologize for the alt right. And he was basically saying, oh, well, you see what, what's really going on here as that they want to challenge these taboos say because a bit. Because the racist label is constantly being used. The silence conservatives, uh, they're actually trying to kind of make that stigma, meaning meaningless by actually saying that doesn't really work that way first of all bought. But by doing this, um, because I do think that the vast majority of people who are not social justice warriors, who are not the regressive left a nonetheless quite rightly low the and, you know, detest genuine racism and bigotry.

Speaker 2:          00:51:04       Uh, what you're doing by saying all this crap is alienating people who could be, it could be, it could be your allies because you know that they're gonna look at you and say, Oh, well, you know, these people really are racist crepes. No, thank you. We don't really want anything to do with them. Say, you know, I mean, that's really a little bit like a, you know, like if you're a black person who wants to challenge negative stereotypes of blocks, you're not gonna do that by, you know, trying to embody the bed. Like, oh, the, I suppose the, you have some people in the yellow, the rap community who kind of do that and that stupid, you know, and it's, it's stupid when, uh, when anti pc people do it, it's a, you know, but, but, but I totally agree that the, the left bears a lot of responsibility for the climate of uh, you know, the, the, the really, really bad, um, and counterproductive rhetorical climate that we have a uncouple some of that from left because that's, you know, that's why I've spent so much time talking about this show is that I want liberalism to turn to logic and reason and not always demonizing everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       How do I do that? And he said almost too late because we now see whether side gaining power and that much more scared of the people that are stuck. Right. Well, I don't think it's too late. I mean, I don't think we're at the point yet. You know, we're not in the Soviet Union were not at the point where you can go to prison for, you know, wrong thing. But you do see the findings of that. But we do see the underpinnings of that. I think it's really important for, uh, you know, genuine liberals. What I would love to see by the way is a kind of liberal conservative alliance of reasonable people. And I think right now that is feasible. I think we're seeing a lot of that. We're seeing people like, you know, Jonathan chait on the liberal side of, for instance, speaking out against political correctness and getting attacked by the regressive love.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       And as a, you know, the attacks are really always the same. You know, it's kind of, oh, like you're just another white male who doesn't like women and minorities criticizing you and you know, and the only thing worse than a white male who doesn't think the way he spoke was because actually if you look at the article that Jonathan Shade got a talk, he was talking about criticism directed at himself. He was actually talking mainly about women in minorities who were getting a toxin really nasty ways for being politically incorrect. Um, he was talking about people like this Muslim student at the University of Michigan who got really badly harassed for, you know, writing something that mark political correctness. I mean, I think he had like a bunch of really nasty leaflets dropped in front of the door of his apartment and stuff like that. So, I mean, it wasn't even just people tweeting nasty things and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       It was a really, in a way kind of quotes I physical harassment. Uh, so yeah, I think that there is a um, uh, there was a movement of both conservatives and liberals who are very, very ready to reject this and to kind of try to restore rationality. What I would love to see, by the way, and this is kind of my, my own personal dream right now, there isn't a single publication like I read a lot of publications online. I don't think there was a single publication that could have consistently stands up for a non sort of social justice. And I put this, the word social justice in quotation marks because, because, you know, it really is a kind of what passes for social justice today is neil to tell attarian cult really is obsessed with controlling words and thoughts. It's obsessed with identity politics and it's obsessed with politicizing every single aspect of life.

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       It's like when you look at, for instance, the discussions of culture like movie, whether it's movies, video games, uh, books, everything in the progressive media like, you know, vice, a bridge to some extent of in the daily beast, which I've written for in, which I think does, I mean the daily beast is one of the few that doesn't kind of completely cooptive by this and still publishes, you know, good stuff. But, um, he or you know, stuff that doesn't fit that kind of identity politics mode. But a lot of that, like all of the discussion of television, everything, it's completely in terms of, you know, oh, well does this really rough luck, you know, the, the true diversity of the population. And, you know, do we have enough trans people and this. And this is this cultural appropriation. You know, where does this writer really have the right to talk about this ethnic group the way that he or she does and it's all in terms of this ideology and identity and it's ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       So that, and I think what we, what I would love to see. So there's that and there's the conservative media on the other hand up, but there isn't a single publication that could have consistently embraces a, you know, kind of true liberal point of view. I mean there are still some publications are likely Atlantic, the daily based that have that point of view represented, but it coexists with a lot of the really hardcore kind of ideological, uh, Neela to talent tell Ryan as I would call it. And I think what that coexistence very often tends to lead to the liberal viewpoint being pushed out because the, the social justice people, they're really not interested in dialogue. They think that the opposing viewpoint as evil. Yeah. So I mean it's a little bit like a, you know, you can't really have a dialogue between voltaire on Torquemada was volunteering thing burned at the stake.

Speaker 2:          00:57:26       And so I think trend what we really need and I would love to see this, you know, like the, like the old new or a public for instance. I mean the new new republic, it is this, you know, lamentable, you know, shadow of its former self were avoided that, I don't know if you saw the other day there, they had this really bizarre essay called what are white writers for or something. And Yeah. And it contained this line, which I actually screenshot it on twitter that said something like, well for the most part white people have always been able to do everything they want to do. It is detached from reality. I mean really seriously. And it's like these people don't even realize how profoundly elitist because it's like they think. And the guy who wrote this as a Yale Grad, you know, so you think that your experience as a writer who went to Yale, it because your wife is identical to the experience of some white guy who lives in Kentucky and as good of a job.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       But it was going to vote for trump by the way, because you people keep telling him that, you know, he is a racist because he is not happy with where he is in life and he knows that, you know, what I think we really, really need more voices for this kind of liberalism that doesn't, you know, both moderate conservatism, which I think has been, you know, largely edge down these days. But, you know, the rush limbaughs. And so I think, I mean, national review I think still has some really good kind of a national review commentary. Um, you know, those, those publications have some really good kind of traditional conservative voices. But I think we're really, really need more of that and we're needed more liberal, a liberal will publications, uh, that consistently advanced

Speaker 1:          00:59:30       a liberal law point of view. You know, I really liked what you said about this, this new thing for me because I've been sort of talking about a little bit and I've had a few guests that have mentioned it and I've been saying for awhile that it seems to me that defending my liberal values is now becoming a conservative position. That doesn't make me feel good to say that. But, but I think that shows that there's a bridge to be built here. I want to back up to something else that you said, which is that everything's being politicized these days. Because yesterday I saw on twitter somebody tweeted that the, the lead actress in the show, blackish, uh, which has doubled the ratings I suppose. I guess, of, of Tim Allen's newer show. Not home improvement. The one that's on now. And it said that he makes something like 20 times more than him and what the implication was with somehow that he as a white man is making more than this black woman. And I think that line in general is just a misguided way of attacking. But it was really. They were trying to solve some sort of social injustice, but really Tim Allen is a massive star who I think, if I'm not mistaken, it's been around for name. He's the only person ever to have a number one movie number one book and number one second of all at the same. We're all the same week. So this is a massive star who's reaping the benefits of being the headline guy in a sycamore.

Speaker 2:          01:00:46       Oprah Winfrey, I'm sure, makes a lot more money than you do.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       Believe it or not exactly. Sure how the Youtube CPM work out. But yes she does. And I'm a white guy. Ah, what does that prove? There you go. But, but that idea that everything is politicized, it's, it's really dangerous, right? As someone that comes from absolute, everything was political.

Speaker 2:          01:01:09       Absolutely. And, and, and it's, it's really, really discouraging to me to see, especially a lot of the cultural criticism, a couch completely in these political terms. Uh, it's like, you know, you can read a random review of some TV show and suddenly you see a lot in a long the lines of, well, of course, you know, in, in the rape culture of, you know, modern American society, men, women are systematically suppressed, you know, cannot express their wishes freely. And so, you know, and it's like, it reminds me of how when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, you know, going back to that experience, I had these additions of classics like Shakespeare in translation and there was a kind of obligatory thing where virtually any publication of, um, of a classic had to have a forward that had to have at least some passages that put it in the proper kind of Marxist context.

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       A warning before trigger will trigger warning so much as kind of an ideological framework that told you, you know, what the correct weight are we. That was. So for instance, you know, Shakespeare's King Lear is really about the emergence of the bourgeoisie and its replacement. Uh, you know, the feudal family system. So on and uh, and it really has, and there would be a quote from either mark's or London and it was funny because apparently in the Russian publishing industry I've heard people actually used to refer to these Marx and Lenin quotes as locomotives because they were like pulling the, throw the publication of the book, you know, and you couldn't get the book published otherwise. So, and it's not necessarily the person who wrote the foreword believed any of that. I will just this obligatory nod to the reigning ideology and I think we're almost getting to the point where you look at a lot of TV movie book reviews in a, you know, kind of progressive left of center publications and it's the same kind of stuff, you know, you see these, you know, references to the race, gender, you know, sexuality, identity, politics, ideology, a that permeates everything.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       And uh, and it's scary, especially in terms of gender and gender issues and relations between men and women. Uh, we haven't even gotten to the thought, you know, I've been doing a lot of writing on gender.

Speaker 1:          01:03:53       Unfortunately. We're out of time. So you absolutely are going to come back, whether you like it or not, I'm not forcing you to come back, do time next time we're going to do a full hour of gender issues, do all the gender is feminism and men rights and all that. But I, I really do love how you brought this back to where we started because the themes of being in a society that are closed, we're in an open one now and someone like you that's lived through the other side can, can see some of the frameworks of it happening here. So that's why I'm glad that we brought her in. So I'll give you the last word.

Speaker 2:          01:04:22       Well, I mean, I think he, the, he made a really good point about how we have an open society that as suddenly somehow reproducing a lot of these thought patterns of closed society is a society is where there is a dominant ideology. And I think that is something that we all have to be very, very leery of. Um, I think, you know, the saying the world exclusively through a political slash ideological lens, uh, is a really, really limited and skewed way of looking at the world and it also really keeps you from looking at the opposing point of view because, you know, if, if a point of view that is different from yours is not just a different point of view, but the enemy, uh, you know, that is really not a, no, that is really not very conducive to getting a full picture of what's going on in the world. And I think that applies by the way, again, to a lot of people on the right as well as people in the love. I think that, you know, the right kind of has its own version of political, correct.

Speaker 1:          01:05:31       No, I'm not defending the right. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          01:05:35       Yeah. So, you know, I think we, uh, yeah, and I'm gonna repeat it again. I think we need to add my own politics. Quite a moderate libertarian really. I'm not extremely doctrinaire about, you know, minimal government. I mean, I obviously think less government is better, but you know, I'm probably not quite as a minimalistic about government or some of my colleagues that reason. Sure. Uh, I mean, I think that there are legitimate disagreements that we can have about, you know, the size of government, about welfare programs. These are all legitimate subject for discussion. Uh, as long as you know, you, you understand that your point of view could be wrong, you know, that you're not necessarily write about everything. And you know, unfortunately the identity politics are a whole different ballgame because unlike the debates about the nature of the welfare state, for instance, identity politics, uh, does turn to put people in boxes. Identity politics tends to demonize the opposition. And, uh, the, the, uh, the social justice ideology, uh, that, uh, a really kind of seeks to control how people even talk about identity and related issues. And that's a whole difference. And that's a whole different story. And this is where, you know, I, I don't think it's really possible to conduct a dialogue with people who espouse to Terry and ideology.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       I'm going to keep trying. And you absolutely, you're coming back where we're going to get interested in as I last, I like to say on a good interview.
