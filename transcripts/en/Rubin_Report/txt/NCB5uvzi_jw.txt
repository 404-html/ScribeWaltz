Speaker 1:          00:00:05       I'm on a one day break from touring with Jordan Peterson and joining me in studio today is a free speech lawyer and the director of the Individual Rights Defense Program at the foundation for Individual Rights in education, Aka fire red called welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. That was a wordy interest right there. A lot of freedom stuff in there and that that's all the stuff that I like. So I'm looking forward to this same. So you guys fire as an organization is one of the few bastions of sanity these days. Like when I see what you guys are tweeting about and consistently defending the principles of free speech and free expression and open inquiry, I'm always like, ah, there are some good guys left. So first can you just tell me a little bit about the organization, why you guys got started and how you

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       personally got involved? Well, we got started in 1999 with a professor at Penn and a civil liberties lawyer in Philadelphia who were, you know, they both decided that there were, uh, there was a problem. There was an epidemic at our colleges. And Universities of the core individual rights that, that make up, you know, our, our constitution, if you will, um, as individuals, as people, as citizens of the United States, uh, Brent being respected on campuses across the country

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       back in [inaudible] 99. Did nine. Yeah, that's interesting because a lot of people say this is just the totally recent phenomenon.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       I think, uh, you know, a lot of it that there is the political correctness movement to the eighties and nineties, a little bit, you know, that might've had something to do with it, but this has been a problem since the free speech movement back at Berkeley. Uh, you know, long before even the eighties or nineties, you know, censorship is an age old problem that predates the United States of America. Really. Uh, and as Alan and harvey went about creating fire and they decided to locate it and like located in Philadelphia, which is the birthplace of our nation, they really got an outpouring of people saying, Hey, this happened to me too. Uh, and they said, well, this is, you know, this is a problem. This is an epidemic. We need to fix it and fire was born, um, or, or lit, if you will. And uh, over the years getting close to 20 now, crazy enough, uh, that has actually just gone up every year more and more people reach out to fire for help.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       When I got to fire for the second time, I actually was a legal fellow with fire after I graduated from law school before I started in private practice, uh, but when I came back in 2013 getting several hundred case submissions a year, um, and now we are getting damn near close to a thousand a year, a credible. And that's just the stuff that we hear about. I can only imagine how much other stuff is going on around the country for people who don't know that we're out there to them, uh, or you know, people who perhaps go about it themselves. It's, it's crazy to think about how much is going on. Yeah. So I want to talk about some of those cases and some of the specific work that you're doing, but foundation for individual rights in education. I am a believer right now partly because of Kanye West and because of a lot of people online right now that the individual is making a comeback that the idea of the individual versus the collective is actually making a comeback.

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       Do you have any idea when they came up with a name for firewire was so important to put the individual front and center? I think it's, you know, and I'm speaking out of some level of ignorance because I haven't actually discussed this with either of them personally, but you know, if I had to guess, it's because the individual qualities, the freedom of conscious, the freedom of speech for things that allow us to participate in society. We don't get to the collective unless we have the individuals. One is necessary to have the other because what is a collective other than a group of individuals and consensus is a bunch of individual opinions. That throughout the process of winnowing and debating different good ideas and bad ideas, we reach a common understanding. We reach a a, you know, a norm for society and that's how. That's why free speech particularly is so important is because that's how we get to the optimal resolution, the optimal conclusions, that's how we reach these communal positions is only through our own personal expressions of what we believe, which exposes us to criticism or agreements or just flat out discussion with other people.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       So how do you think the ideas of the collective took root so much a college campus then? Well, I think there's the given take in society at large that we really go through every once in a while in terms of thinking about things as individualistic and then worrying about broader concerns of the community and it's not altogether a bad thing and I think the college campus, and it's always been this way, it's a microcosm of what we're experiencing in the broader society and I think that's another reason why it's so important to protect individual rights on college campuses because where they fall on college campuses, they are almost certainly short to fall in society writ large. Yeah. So that actually we discussed this briefly right before the cameras turned on. That's my concern about this. When people say, Oh, you know, there isn't a free speech issue on college campuses and even though I keep going to college campuses and it's very clear to me that there is a free speech problem there, but it's not what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       It's not just the screaming kids right now. It's not that. It's that these are the people that are going to be in leader positions five, 10, 15 years in the future and further than that obviously. And if those ideas take root because they were able to silence us once they are the lawmakers, once they're in charge of public policy, they're not going to be too kind to the people who they were silencing way back when. Right? Yeah. I mean that's really one of the key problems and it's not even just if they get elected to power, even if they aren't elected, uh, and they don't rise to power and they can impose these views on other people. These are future citizens, even if they're not necessarily future leaders. And then discourse of the nation, if that is the, the prevalent feeling in society is going to suffer tremendously as a result if even if they're not in Congress or in the state legislatures, if 50 percent of the country's population thinks that we shouldn't be talking about certain things, we're not going to talk about these things and it's going to be a societal he imposed if nothing else.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       And I think that's incredibly damaging to just about every aspect of our life is as a country. Yeah. It's so interesting to me because I know you, you read about this, but I was at the University of New Hampshire a couple of weeks ago and you know, first we were supposed to give a speech on campus then about two hours before they announced that they couldn't secure the room, that they felt there were too many threats. So they were about 200 or 250 people supposed to be in the room. They moved us to the hockey rink, which seats 7,500 people. So I stood in front of, uh, a little, you know, backdrop and I talked to about 200 people. It was about 150 people that were there to listen and be respectful and all that stuff. And then they were about probably about 50 protesters roughly. Those are the rough numbers, um, but the desire just to shout down, to use noisemakers to scream to chance like robots, they love robotic chance.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       All of these things. And I kept saying to them, guys, do you have any direct questions? Is there something that I've said that you disagree with or is there something you directly like to ask me? And time and time again, the answer was no. And I don't know how you break them out of that other than keep having these conversations and hope that the refugees make it to us. And that's a common problem. I think it really comes down to ideological purity that people are after the idea that if I disagree with you on something, whether it's small or even fundamental, if I disagree, I disagree with you on that one thing. That means nothing that you have to say could possibly be a value to me and that is completely false. That you couldn't be farther from the truth. We can learn so much from the people we disagree with the most.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       Even if I disagreed with you on absolutely everything. It would still be incredibly valuable for me to talk to you if only because that helps me sharpen and really understand why I believe what I believe in and people really discount the importance of understanding why you believe something. So the argument that I've been making for awhile is that, and I do think right now at least in 2018 and this is more of a problem on the left, that they've owned the ideas and the narrative and the college campus discussion and academia and media and all that. They've owned that for so long that the reason these kids end up be are these students ended up being so hysterical is because they never hear a counter ideas. So then you get a pretty moderate guy who's arguing about liberty and freedom for everybody and live and let live.

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       And that actually offends them. Because they never hear anything outside of what they're being taught. That goes to the academic part. I think mostly. Well, I think we're doing a really crappy job of educating students before they get to college about why free speech and our other rights are important. Civics education is clearly in the toilet right now and it's bizarre to me. I grew up in Skokie, Illinois. One of the sites, one of the most famous free speech cases, you know, in recent history. Can you lay it out for those that don't know this story. In the seventies, the American, the American Socialist Party, that Nationalist Party, the Illinois Nazis, if you'd asked the blues brothers wanted to march through Skokie, Illinois, which outside of New York had the largest concentration of Holocaust survivors in the United States. Uh, and skokie tried to stop them and they sued with the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.

Speaker 2:          00:10:12       And it went to, well, both the Supreme Court of Illinois and the Supreme Court in the United States. Um, and the Nazis had the right to March and the courts held so and there were threats of violence. And disruption and all, you know, people out crying as to how this could be allowed, but ultimately the Nazis had the first amendment right to march through skokie and I grew up learning about that case from a very young age. I can't tell you how many times I saw the movie they made about it and it really. It got me thinking at a young age about why this is important, how I think about it, and I can't tell you that as a young child, I completely agree that the Nazis should have a right to march when I was that young, I part of me didn't grasp the overarching fundamental importance of free speech, but I was thinking about it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       It was just. And I got there and I get the feeling that sometimes we're not doing enough to make our students think about why it's important. It's such an important case and I'm glad you mentioned it because it goes really to the heart of this, that the people that lived in Skokie, as you said, the second largest amount of Holocaust survivors in the country. These people literally survived a genocide. Probably virtually all of them lost, some of them probably lost all of their family members and friends and all of that. And yet I would sit here at someone that lost Holocaust survivors on both sides of my family and tell you it was the right decision. You can't let the Nazis are the white supremacists or whatever they are. You can't let them start ransacking property. You can't let them start killing people or harming people, but letting, letting them march at the exchange of free speech and it's kind of Shitty, but you got to defend when it's hard to defend, but you have to find it when it's hard to defend because otherwise it's not going to be around to defend when it's easy to defend.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       You know, once you start creating exceptions and encroaching, there's no end to it. And you know, we've kind of seen even in other countries, uh, that once the encroachments start, it's always, well, we make that exception and just this one other small exception. And then there's inevitably another one and another one and all for perhaps even no good reasons in terms of, you know, ideals. And the goals are laudable. Perhaps I say it every show, the road to hell is paved with good intentions and getting tired and you and me both, but you know, it's really practically speaking, it's inevitable. Yeah. How much of this is just a confusion as to what the First Amendment is. That's also what I've started to realize because when I've gone on college campuses and the protesters are there and I always say it, I welcome peaceful protest. I completely welcome.

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       I welcome the exchange of ideas. The question is all of that, but when, when they're screaming about certain things, I think there's just a disconnect as to what I think to legal things. I think what the First Amendment is and what hate speech is, is or isn't a. So can you talk about that a little bit? I, I, if I had to have to hear one more person, whether it be student, uh, Internet comment or to even journalists are faculty members sometimes say hate speech is not free speech. I'm going to lose it. Okay. So let's do, let's do that one first because I really, I mean this will be maybe what we promo for this episode, but I really want people to understand this. Why is hate speech free speech? Well, on a legal level, hate speech is free speech because the First Amendment and the courts have said nothing about freeze or hate speech being unprotected by the first amendment.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       Speech is protected by the First Amendment unless it falls under one of the very few existing categories of unprotected speech. Yeah. What are. What are those categories? There's incitement to imminent lawless action and these all have very high bars, right? True threats and intimidation. A, you can be sued for libel or slander. Defamation is there. No, not some estates I think actually still have criminal statutes on the book, but books, but they're rarely enforced of fraud. Obscenity, which people often confused with mere profanity or lewdness, but they are not the same thing by any stretch of the imagination. What? What's the difference on those two? Well, profanity and lewdness or are generally protected by the first amendment. Obscenity is a very high bar. It's speech that has to be our expression, I shouldn't say more broadly than just speech that has to appeal to the puriant interest, which is an inordinate fascination with sex, describe or depict sex in a patently offensive way and have no social political, literary or artistic value whatsoever and to get down in the mud that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Had you ever heard of crushed videos? I feel like I have, but I'm honestly not sure what that is. They are videos of women wearing stilettos crushing small animals like hamsters and Gerbils to death and people apparently get off on that. I don't pretend to understand it. Even that is not wholly unprotected by the obscenity exception to the first amendment that that's particularly interesting case. I suppose because the idea of it talking about it seems like A. I would have no problem with that, but the action itself probably there's some legal reasons, right? Like killing it, killing animals. There's some law I guess if trolley state laws, but if you have this pornography you can call it that. I just, I have a hard time getting it. If you have it in you to possess it or you can't be prosecuted for, for possessing that obscene material, it's an interesting distinction that the act is the crime or the act is what is illegal, not the depiction, depiction or disseminating the information or that sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       Right? A child pornography, obviously not protected by the first amendment, but there's. Well, there's the one additional wrinkle of the fighting words doctrine, although there's considerable doubt that it remains a viable, a exception to the first amendment, but it really gets brought up a lot in the hate speech debate to the extent it still exists. It's limited to face to face interactions where say I say something to you that is so insanely abusive that you are likely to punch me in the face without thinking twice about it. Instead of taking a deep breath and either ignoring me or coming back at me and there's reasons why it's fallen into disuse and it's worthwhile to note that the Supreme Court has upheld a fighting words, convictions since the case in the forties when it created the fighting words except for. It's interesting just how far it's fallen into disuse.

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       It incentivizes punching people in the face. It creates an easy way to sensor the people that you disagree with and it would, I assume be some level of a subjective piece of information as to what you think is offensive at the highest order is different perhaps than what I think exactly what some of these other people. Yeah, it it. It creates terrible incentives and it would basically lead to an institutionalized heckler's veto, so it's really not tenable. Yeah, so on the, on the hate speech front, which was clear what the Supreme Court has said about hate speech, you're allowed to do it with, with these exceptions that you've just laid out, you're allowed to see me and things. What I. What I'm realizing on college campuses is they really don't like that. The people that set of people that we're talking about, they really don't like that.

Speaker 2:          00:17:40       So like they think if you like you, it's just the fact you are allowed to say bad things. You can say, I hate all the Jews. You can say, I hate all the black people and all the gays or whatever. You can say it. You can't cause direct call to violence, but what I think they think is that if you keep saying those things, I hate these people, that it's going to incite violence. Now my counter argument would be, no, you have to use free speech to counter those bad ideas. That's the whole purpose of free speech. But do you see that, that, that seems to be the slope that they consistently are on, that if we allow you to say, I, I hate these people, which is bigoted and prejudice and all those things, but it's afforded to us by the bill of rights.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       They think that that's going to get you to violence. How do you combat that notion if you agree with the premise that is something that we tend to hear a lot in the first amendment world. Um, and you know, first of all, generally speaking in this country, we punish the people who do the bad acts. If I watch your show and I get some cookie idea and go off and commit some crime, we're not going to throw you in jail because I'm an idiot and took a terrible idea that you didn't even intend me to take right now. That might be. It might be different though if I was up here saying you should violently attack these people, etc. Etc. Right. Exactly. That's why the incitement standard is so high. Yes. To be likely to insight and intended to incite immediate cRiminal action. So if I tell you, hey, you know, it'd be fun to burn down a building, but you're not likely to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:11       You're going to take it as a joke. I probably haven't committed any kind of, uh, you know, I'm awful expression if I know you're a pyromaniac and I say, hey dave, let's go burn down a building. Uh, I might find mysElf in a very different situation. I sort of left that phase at about eight years old. But, you know, I think that if you take a look, one of my colleagues actually wrote up a piece for quill at a not so long ago about the rwandan genocide and looking over the claims that the radio broadcasts actually caused more violence. And what it turns out is that the radio broadcasts first of all, only incited people who were already predisposed and whoever you felt that way and it made it marginally easier for them to find people and you know, be taught how to do certain things, but it was relatively ineffective as it turns out in convincing people who weren't already in a murderous rage to go out and commit violence.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       Uh, and so, you know, I think that the fear that allowing these views to be aired is going to indisputable, he caused actual violence is somewhat overblown. Now there's a second part to it, which is that people expressing these views might lead to more people adopting those views and having prejudice view. Is that possible? Absolutely. RighT. So that's the part I was referenced, but that's kinda the point is that we put those out there so we can fight them. If we don't have them in public and we can't fight them, they're still going to spread nothing. No idea ever went away because we said you can't say that. It just doesn't work like that. How does the heckler's veto fit into all of this? Because one of the things that I again see on college campuses is when hecklers starts screaming at you and then you say, just a second, I'll get to your question or calm down, or whatever you might say.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       I'm. They'll say, well I have a right to free speech too. They try to flip it on you to make you look like a hypocrite. That actually kinda kinda gets me, but I will give them a little bit of credit. I think You say a university event and somebody comes in and they chant for 30 seconds or they stand up and turn their backs and that's the extent of it. I Think that we should protect that technically. Are they causing a disruption? Yes, but it's minimal. And it's actually maximized the amount of free speech just to be some room for very minimal disruption, but when it gets to the point where they are substantially interfering with the speakers, that ability to get their message across or the audience's ability to hear them through repeated shouting or noise makers or standing in the front and blocking everyone's views, uh, and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:22:15       obviously that's a problem. And last year we just saw a rash of a heckler's vetoes going on and it kind of all started with berkeley and milo yiannopoulos when they protesters were successful in shutting down the event through what had been before that been unfathomable on a college campus for an invited speaker. We've seen invited speaker controversy since fire was founded. Basically never ever am I aware of any incident that came close to something like that. It was just madness. Yeah. And they got away with it. The so few arrests were made. And I can't help but wonder if the students out at middlebury college where Charles Murray was speaking, sees done that and looked at the berkeley students and said, well, they were successful in stopping that event with speech that we also did tested and they got away with it. So let's try that. it's a viable tactic.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       This might be a solution for keepIng this speech. We disagree with off campus and ideas like that, that the tactics that students are able to successfully utilized, they will. Behavior that is rewarded essentially is going to be repeated. Yeah. And I see that all over the place right now. So for example, just a couple of months after milo went to berkeley and that happened, a ben shapiro spoke, they already was largely nonviolent, but it cost the $600,000 to make that happen. I mean, I think an atm was broken in a couple of windows and that's it. But that's part of the tactic is if we can keep ramping this up, we'll keep pushing the security costs and as I said, they had to move my event to a freaking hockey theater that a hockey arena that couldn't have been cheap and and several other. These I saw, I'm sure you're familiar with the case of lindsay shepherd up at wilfrid laurier from Canada and she just had to crowdfund I think around six grand to get security for one of her events.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       So that almost seems like the new tactic. It's almost like we don't have to, we can scare them with some threats of violence and some other stuff and then will cause the security costs to be so high that you guys will just give up. Well, and that's another problem we've been fighting since even before all of this came to a head is colleges and universities trying to charge student groups security fees for the speakers based on the anticipated protest or controversy. And that's plainly unconstitutional. It has been for a long time since the supreme court said that a listener's reaction is not a content neutral basis for regulation. You cannot charge more for controversial speakers because they might drop protest that places have a price tag on expression and prices, like you said, it will price the controversial expression out of the marketplace. They're not going to be able to afford it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       What student group has $17,000 to spend on security, none of them and you know what it comes down to is administrators at the university itself has to be the guarantor of last resort when it comes to speakers ability to speak and this is the business they are in and sometimes it's unpleasant and sometimes it costs a whole lot of money, but if you're not going to have a campus where we can discuss things and we can debate things, even if it gets loud and boisterous and raucous and contentious, which is everything free speech should be. If your campus isn't going to be a place where that occurs, then what are you? What are you doing? So I do want to make a point of saying that some of the campuses are getting it right and I'm sure you know some of the campuses that are doing a little better than some of the others.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       But for example, uh, at the beginning of September, 2017, I spoke at claremont mckenna at, they're doing a big free speech push because of what happened the semester before with Heather Mcdonald and all hell broke loose and on the campus and I was completely welcomed there and they, even some of the students who disagreed with me, I mean they asked me questions and all of that good stuff. So it's where I alwaYs think it's worth mentioning that some schools are doing their best to manage some of this stuff. Absolutely. And on two levels, I think, you know, first of all, fire rates, policies at schools, we raised over 400 different colleges and universities on a red light, yellow light, green light level, a red light being, you have policies that are clearly in substantially unconstitutional yellow light being. You have policies that are susceptible to being applied in bad ways and greenlight schools where none of their policies poses a serious threat to free speech in the past couple of years.

Speaker 2:          00:26:54       The number of green light schools that we have has nearly doubled, which is tremendous. Now, still close to 60 percent of schools have a yellow light, so there's work to be done. But you combine that with the 38 schools that have now put out statements expressly committing themselves to free speech. Uh, something that, you know, the university of chicago kicked off a while back. There's reasons to be hopeful and we work regularly with administrators who are happy to have a consult on their policies and say, you know, here are the changes we would make a. And, and we're, we have amicable relationships with so many administrators, which is really gratifying. But on the student side also, part of it is overblown. And I think by media there are a lot of students out there who do get it and people have all ideologies and all political, you know, sides. There are a lot of students out there who get it. I speak to them on a daily basis and I, there is a lot of reason to have hope. This is not a lost cause.

Speaker 1:          00:28:01       No, I agree. I think it's important talking about it because even again at that university of New Hampshire, think 75 percent of the crowd at least was there respectfully decently to hear ideas and, and do that what I felt was important after and why I still want to talk about and have you here and all that is because I want people to be armed with the right arguments so that when these set of people, even if it's just a smaller set that's just really loud. So as a disproportionate amount of influence, I want people to understand there are tactics you can use to fight it. So I'm curious on that list of 38 schools that's kind of doing it right right now when they've instituted some of these policies. And I remember when university of chicago did it about a year ago, um, is there evidence that things actually get better? Because I'm going to guess that when you give some rules, some of these students, they don't want to be kicked out of school and they might actually

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       behave better. Well, so I think you know this, there's a lot of conversation right now about some legislation even that's going on about a disrupting speeches, mandatory punishments for students who do sell a certain number of times. and I think that's actually less important than I actually have somewhat of a problem with the laws that create mandatory punishments for vaguely defined terms like disrupt, which, you know, could be applied to pretty much anything that a sneeze, you know, um, but I think more important is when administration is saying, hey, these are the values that really, that this is the wellspring of intellectual vitality, that our institution relies on a, these are the, the ideals you should be paying attention to. This is what's going to make your experience really worthwhile. I think students will will listen to that instead of maintaining the policies that say thou shalt not say mean things about your classmates that get students in a very different mindset when they come to college.

Speaker 2:          00:29:57       What are the statements are or what are the principles that you add? You guys want to see in those statements. The principles are largely, this is a place of debate. This is a place of intellectual exploration. It is not our job as administrators or as faculty members to silence ideas that we find controversial or protect you from them. It is our job. It is our mission to expose you to ideas that you might disagree with and give you the tools that you need to analyze them, think critically about them, formulate your own ideas and participate in the conversation because that's what you're going to have to do when you leave after four or however many years you're here, that's part of life and our democracy is participation. If you don't participate, then you know as the saying goes, if you don't participate, you have no grounds to complain.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       We have to really get students in the mindset that these are important life skills and they're important to even in other instances in the workplace. That can be important if you have a policy position, If you're working at a company that you think is either bad or one that you want to promote, you have to be able to think about the people who disagree with you and what they're going to say, anticipate their response and formulate an argument that resolves it. You know, there's countless situations in the world, outside of college were being able to think critically is incredibly important and really, uh, I think that you get a lot of value out of doing that outside of the classroom because it teaches you how to contextualize the skill, the teaches you how to apply it, not just in the, I read this assignment, let's talk about it kind of way, because that's really not how life works once you graduate.

Speaker 2:          00:31:47       I wish it was. It would make things a whole lot simpler, but you'd be out of a job probably. That's true. I would have to find something else to do. All right, so we touched on the first amendment a little bit in the first half, but I think there's also just a fundamental misunderstanding about what speech is related to the first amendment in that the first amendment basically is about what the government is not allowed to do and people have now extrapolated that to think it means what everyone can't do. Can you talk to. There's that famous xkcd comic about a people have the right to tell you you're an asshole on the internet and it doesn't violate the first amendment. and that's true. Although I see it all day long, I get, I get that comic thrown at me sometimes even when it's a government institution doIng the censorship.

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       So it's, it's overused a little bit too and that kinda just gets in my craw a little bit, but tHe first amendment really only Does protect you from the government and it doesn't just protect you from congress. It protects you from the states. It protects you from the municipalities that protects you from the public colleges and universities and their administrators. Uh, those are all state actors for the first amendment, but it doesn't protect you against is your private employer, which means that I could well be fired for anything I say on this show today. See what I can do, not to give you an ideas. Uh, you know, your parents don't. If you say I remember saying free speech to my parents and I was very young probably right after I read it about the skokie case and my mother giving me a side, either burn a hole through my skull at this point, but you know, it only protects you against the government.

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       It doesn't protect you from criticism of your peers and your contemporaries and it shouldn't, you know, that's kind of part and parcel of having the public conversation is if you have a bad idea and you're out there spouting it, we all have the right to tell you you got a shitty idea and we should say that because otherwise, well we might see that shitty idea is spreading. And, and that's kind of the point of, like we were talking aboUt earlier about letting these terrible ideas out there is so that we can stand up and defeat them. Yeah. Are you seeing any major threats right now from the government related to free speech? Because a lot of times I'll see people saying, well, trump Is attacking this or he texts journalism a lot now. it's no secret what my feeling about the mainstream media is these days.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       I mean, I think it's largely just partisan garbage. I don't think you should be killing these people are harming these people in any way. Just to be very clear. I hope that by by mocking them and exposing their nonsense will get a new generation of better journalists and people who really live to the code of trying to find truth and all of that. But do you see a direct threat right now coming from the government, either from trump or or elsewhere? There's always indirect threat yet. I mean, let's be clear. People in power will always, if given the opportunity, silence their opponents, they will preserve the status quo and it's not just people in power. It isn't entirely human reaction to want to censor the people we disagree with. We think we have terrible ideas. That's kind of a baser instincts that we all have now.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       We have to overcome that and understand the value of, of not doing that, but it's. It's kind of understandable in a way and that's why we have to be so vigilant in protecting free speech because once the tools are there, they don't go away and we've seen this throughout history and their wield it and people laughed at me when I was talking during the election cycle to I guess kind of betrayed some of my personal political. Leif said, you know, I was kind of talking about how the executive branch overreach as many people did have the last administration was problematic because you know, what about the next guy comes to power? Maybe he's going to do something crazy and nobody. They all laughed at me. Hey, I was talking about that. I was talking about it when bush was doing it, I was talking about it when obama was doing it and they laughed and then donald j dot trump was elected president and I looked at them and I said, what now?

Speaker 2:          00:35:53       Uh, and you know, you, you said, oh, it couldn't be possible that somebody we disagree with all that much who we think is really terrible, whatever, get elected president. And when they started melting down over the election, I looked at them and I said, told you so you can't be for if executive actions when it's the guy you like, but then not for them when it's the guy you don't like, of course they're all going to do it if you give them the power to do it. And it's the same thing with free speech. and I think what's really important to remember is that those mechanisms, those tools with censorship are never ever going to redound to the benefit of the marginalized communities that people are oftentimes seeking to protect. It just doesn't happen. The reason they are marginalized is that they don't have political power.

Speaker 2:          00:36:45       They're not going to be the ones implementing these rules and that's incredibly problematic and people don't understand that very practical reality that those tools and censorship are going to be used to defend the status quo, which is what these people are trying to disrupt and disruption is kind of the just the major threat that everyone in power feels and it we've seen it throughout history that they're in the civil rights movement when protestors were arrested for sitting at lunch counters or for engaging in nonviolent protests, but were arrested for disorderly conduct because people reacted to their protests and violent ways because there were violent vicodin, thugs. They were only exonerated Because of the first amendment and it took going to the supreme court and it's really important to remember, I mean, how many lgbt artists and authors and publications faced censorship and had their materials deemed obscenity at times and not even sent through the mail, you know, sometImes before and preventing them from integrating into the national consciousness.

Speaker 2:          00:37:56       I mean, it's, it's really, really important to. Yeah. So is there something happening right now via the government that you think shouldn't be happening? I get the broad sense sort of blue sky version of this that yes, people in power always are gonna want to maintain power and do what they have to do to silence people, etc. But at the college and university level specifically, I think a lot of it is coming from the department of justice and the office for civil rights of the department of education. A few years back I had an agreement that they called a blueprint for sexual harassment policies at colleges and universities and it basically defines sexual harassment is any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including verbal conduct, which we also know as speech and the breathtaking broadness of that policy really kind of spread like wildfire. And you know, these harassment policies have always been problematic at times.

Speaker 2:          00:38:59       This is directly tied to title nine, right? Yes. And you know it's, it's one of the. I don't know if it's even an unintended consequence. It might be a very well unintended consequence, but you start seeing things. I, for example, just the number of years back, there was a student at the university of Oregon who was sitting on the ledge in a dorm room window and she saw a couple outside and as a joke she shouted, I hit it first, which I didn't even know what that meant when it first came into my head to look it up and I realized that it was about ray j, uh, having sex with kim kardashians and kanye. I guess that's the thing people care about nowadays. I don't know, man. Yeah, he is the leader of speech movement. Boy, maybe I do need to find another job, but anyways, that the couple was offended and ran upstairs and talk to the ra.

Speaker 2:          00:39:52       And this student was hit with several disciplinary charges including sexual harassment for just shouting. I hit it first. And this is because of the latitude that these laws gave colleges to. Well, once, you know, department of education said, this is what we consider sexual harassment. Well, no college in university administrator in the right mind is going to look at that and say, oh, we'll just ignore that. They're going to write new policies because they don't want huge investigations that costs a lot of money, take a lot of time, and have ultimately the potential to cost the school all of its federal funding when it comes down to it. So we've seen the proliferation of these really broad policies, some of which have hilarious lists of examples of things that could constitute sexual harassment, like inappropriately directed laughter, elevator eyes is another fire fame for it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       These are all things that are known as flirting recording or whatever you call it, term, but like that's how you meet people and sometimes it, it really is. And, and, and honestly it's the sexual harassment angle has become a broader discriminatory harassment angle because a lot of these policies start to look the same based on any protected class. And so when you say that, you know, any unwelcome comments based on a protected class, uh, you know, the not drawing from a particular policy or anything is harassed. Discriminatory harassment. Well that's a big problem because that cuts off subjectively whichever way you go. Basically half of a, a debate. People, for instance, on different sides of affirmative action are both going to find their opponents ideology probably offensive. Of course, if you are against affirmative action for whatever reason, you might be a people who support affirmative action, they're gonna say, well, that is discriminatory based on a protected class race and they shouldn't be allowed to say that.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       We've seen students hosting events like affirmative action bake sales to kind of make a point about what they think is the unfairness and affirmative action and administrators have tried to shut them down and sometimes succeeded and shutting them down and I can give you countless examples of things just like that, but it's. It's dangerous because it kind of creates an orthodoxy of what we're allowed to say, what we're allowed to think and you know, there is no position in that. I can think of that I'm and I can say actually I think there is no position that shouldn't be subject to challenge. There is nothing that shouldn't be susceptible to somebody disagreeing with it in a public way and starting that conversation. Nobody has the right to declare this is how it is. That is, I guess our collective to circle back to the beginning. It's our collective right to participate in that decision of what we believe. Yeah, and that's why I have

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       problem with this related to the way that the modern left fuels with these things because if you're going to say, all right, we're not going to draw cartoons about certain things. Now I'm not saying you should go out of your way to offend people, but once you say we're going to allow certain things not to be done, you've handed all of your faculty, all of your power, all of your decision making capability over to a certain set of people. It doesn't matter what those, what those people believe in or are. But then it's like, well then they know, well, we got them with something. We can just keep going and going and going and before you know it, you know it's too late to, to fight back.

Speaker 2:          00:43:35       I mean, and again it's going to backfire. It's going to backfire against the people and, and I, I think that you see it backfiring sometimes. You look at the faculty members recently who have been targeted by outrage mobs of people calling for their heads or their jobs or sometimes both. Sometimes when by the way, and my good friend bret weinstein, it still does not have a job just recently for more straightening example even is a fresno state random gerard treated some intemperate and not particularly polite things about Barbara Bush right after she died. Um, and you're being very kind and she can do whatever she wants. But yeah, it was pretty nasty stuff. My mother told me never to speak ill of the dead sea. I, it, I really know. I mean you were being nice to, to what was tweeted feelings here and it was the right that was calling for her head and I mean, one of my colleagues, I felt really bad.

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       I was the one who helped write the letter, but he was the one who wrote our public facing blog post done on the website. He was getting hate mail and probably still is getting hate mail from people saying, how could you defend this woman? How could you. I mean, it goes both ways. Everyone's going to sense try and censor their opponent, so just really be careful. Right. Well, I'm glad you brought that one up. So basically this, this woman who's, she's a professor, she tweeted some really nasty stuff about Barbara Bush who had just died and by, by every account, Barbara Bush was a totally decent woman, but that's actually irrelevant for this. And yes. Then the right started screaming and oh, she should be fired. She should be fired. She was not fired. The fresno state. She's still there. Um, I thought, wow, this is an exact example of how free speech is supposed to work.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       She said what she wanted people mocked her or supported her. The university decided to make a decision. Now it's interesting. If the university had fired her, let's say they had said these ideas are beyond the pale. And then people started digging into some other things that she's said that are, that are pretty radical. If, if that had happened where you guys have offered her defense because doesn't the university have the right to make the decisions that it wants? I don't know what their policies are on tenure, for example, or that sort of thing, but don't they have the right to employ people that they want to be employed or not? Not that I want to give that power to the mob because we know that the mob does awful things. It depends when the government as an employer, the government actually is restricted in what it can do.

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       A for a, an with respect respect to an employee's off duty speech when a, and I think that's particularly important with faculty members who are supposed to be public intellectuals. They're supposed to be out there kind of discussing and debating this is what we expect out of faculty members at colleges and universities, but when the government is the employer and the speeches made as a private citizen on a matter of public concern is this very clearly was then the government has to make a pretty high showing that that speech so materially interferes with the provision of services that the government is involved in, that it warrants overcoming the employer employees first amendment rights. Uh, and we actually wrote a long letter and lose co-sign sign by the aclu of northern California, uh, electronic frontier foundation and a whole bunch of other, uh, organizations and on [inaudible] behalf and sent it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       And incidentally, shortly after they got our letter, the university issued their statement that they weren't going to discipline her. Right? So, so you are making the distinction in this case that because this was not on campus, this wasn't being in a class taught in the class or, or brainwashing students in the classroom, that's different what she's doing on her private side. And especially because as you said, as a public intellectual, you're supposed to be talking about stuff that that's different than perhaps if she had said these very same things in class, they could have taken a different stance that maybe would have had a little more legal positioning. Is that fair to say? That's where it gets tricky because there's a circuit split. Get the supreme court back in 2006, held that speech made pursuant to official job duties is basically speech that's commissioned by the government and therefore it does not have first amendment protection and you can be fired for it, but they did not decide whether or not that would relate to speech that relates to scholarship or teaching as a supreme court put it, which is due to the special concern about academic freedom that we have for the reasons of faculty members being public intellectuals.

Speaker 2:          00:48:17       The fourth circuit and the ninth circuit where California is. Have both said that no, this ruling, that speech pursuant to official job duties does not apply at colleges and universities to speech that relates to scholarship or teaching. So in California she could have been protected either way, but it's not that way all around the country. Some courts have declined to find that exception to the 2006 garcia ruling. Others have kind of ignored it for the time being. So one of these days the supreme court is probably going to have to make another decision on that. I'm curious. I know you guys are a nonpartisan organization, but if these decisions were left up to the states, do you guys have a position on that in and of itself? I'm sure you have a personal position, but does fire have a position on that? I mean I, I think our, our position is that the exception for scholarship or teaching absolutely should be applied across the country.

Speaker 2:          00:49:11       It's really fundamentally important for faculty members to be able to conduct, you know, controversial, disruptive, you know, as it relates to the status quo, research and writing without fearing for their jobs because that's how we're going to get new ideas. If you just talk about things that aren't going to rock the boat, if you just researched things that aren't going to rock the boat, we're never going to get anywhere. You need the bomb throwers. There's room for that. So what about cases where, and I guess this brings up a little bit related to tenure because I think there is something interesting because it's, it's funny, I hear from professors, I get a ton of email from professors saying that they, they love what we're doing here and that they're afraid sometimes tenured professors are still afraid of the mob, they know they're not going to get fired, but they'Re afraid of the mob.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       Is there an inherent problem in tenure in a way now because you could, if you have that protection, and I'm all for saying whatever you want to say that technically if you were a history history professor, let's say you could start, you could just start losing your mind and teaching really dishonest, complete reversal of the truth stuff. Um, and have the protection of not being fired like that actually handicaps the pursuit of knowledge from, from the university, doesn't it? I'm not terribly concerned about that because generally speaking, there are ways for faculty to be disciplined or removed even with tenure. Oftentimes for gross professional competency issues. Um, you know, if you are say teaching math and you're teaching students that two plus two is 17. I think that the common core you can, there's ways that the university can address that and that's not really what we're seeing.

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       What we're seeing more often is a, for instance, the professor who's teaching physics who is on the side of the holocaust denier a and he's, you know, maybe not necessarily teaching that in class, but does that have any ramifications for his ability to teach physics? Probably not. That's not a competency competency to teach the topic that you were hired to teach thing. Right. But if it leaked into the classroom then that then it's a separate issue. That's. Well, if you are teaching a class on physics and find some occasion to talk about the holocaust, I think you're probably not teaching the thing that you were hired and then it's up to the school to decide what to do. That's it. It's a different problem I think. I think that that indicates pretty squarely along with the denial of the holocaust happened that you are in fact losing your right.

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       So what are some of the cases and maybe one or two cases that you guys are working on right now or that you have your eye on right now that you think are particularly relevant that people should know about? Well, we just, uh, issued a press release this morning. In fact, uh, just a mere hour or two before I came here, uh, at syracuse university where we sent a letter on friday. Uh, this one is just bAnanas. Yeah. Let me pause you for a second. I haven't read it yet, but I wanted to go to syracuse to be in broadcasting because I wanted it to be like a news anchor or a or a sports center. Anchors road. I really want it to be. But there are big broadcasting school, so I'm already fascinated by this as a place that's, you know, about disseminating information or you might be glad you didn't hear this.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       Here we go. a fraternity had an event every year where the pledges or new members would come in. It was a private event and they would do skits that roasted the other members of the fraternity. A lot of fraternities have this kind of tradition, I'm pretty sure that mine did, but they went through some skits and one of them, for example, was making fun of a member of the fraternity who was unknown and vocal, trump supporter and conservative. So they satirized him by having somebody who was supposed to be him starting a rival fraternity that was quote unquote a white empire. And to join people had to take a horrifically racist, antisemitic oath so far. Sounds like it's all in good fun. Well, whatever it may be tasteless, but all good friends over and you know what the satirizing any. It's no different than you see comedians doing all the time on a stage.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       you're satirizing people. Yeah. Uh, another one was, uh, they satirized one of their brothers for being chronically whipped by his girlfriend and portrayed him as a mentally retarded and we had him in a wheelchair and all that stuff. And this was all on a private event. And you hear the laughter in the audience indicated that nobody was really offended by it. They understood this is kinda just poking fun at people. The problem is that videos of it leaked in the student newspaper, published them, which you know, they had the right to do as well. It can't be grudged than that, and of course, as you might imagine, outrage erupted and the within a matter of days, the fraternity had been expelled permanently from campus. 18 students have been charged with disciplinary conduct or discipline, disciplinary code violations, and they're being threatened with suspension or expulsion and this is like all right, before finals, and meanwhile a adjunct faculty member had the gall to express concern about how the university was handling all of this and they immediately told them because your views don't align with ours, you are no longer qualified to teach at syracuse university.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       Unbelievable. And it's incredibly author authoritarian sounding. I mean, they are, they're just willing to steamroll over anybody who gets in their way in pursuit of really just giving somebody a head on a pike so that the crowd is mollified, you know, it's nuts. They've charged them with a sexual harassment, discriminatory harassment. Uh, nevermind the fact that nobody who the speech was actually intended for actually was offended by it. It didn't really, it's not their fault, you know, they don't know how the videos lead, they're posting to a private facebook page and somebody must've had access to somebody's computer or something like that, but the speech was purely private and nobody was offended by it. And if every conversation between two students can be the grounds for a disciplinary investigation because a third party later found out what was said during that conversation. Well, we don't be in jail.

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       Exactly. It reduces free speech to a complete melody. It's crazy. Uh, and you know, it's just, it's really, it's galling and the, just really a harsh and punitive bent of the, of the university and all of this is, is mystifying. Wait, so just on the technical side now because this is something good that trump's done related to this because he got rid of a lot of the title nine expansions and all that and devoss and they got rid of that stuff, which I assume you agree with. Right? Basically, I mean, it's stuff that we'd spent a lot of time fighting against. Okay. So obama expanded it. Trump got rid of it. I think for the name and the name of free speech, when you hear stories of like laura kipnis, who I've had on and, and many others, the witch hunts that happen that are crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       So these policies that they are saying that these students violated, these have nothing to do with government policies, right? These, they're saying they violated school policies, is that correct? They're discriminatory harassment policies are obviously drawn on a lot of the same language because they receive federal money in the form of student loans and things like that. So they actually still have to adhere to title nine even though they're not a state institution obviously, but you know, they been charged with this laundry list of offenses. Uh, they've, the administration has been rushing through, trying to kind of get the process over with as soon as possible. Meanwhile, not giving them really a lot of details until just recently in terms of, you know, what the charges are based on, in all of this. I mean, it's very clearly a steam rolling and, uh, it's, it's outrageous.

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       Uh, and you know, that's kind of the most recent thing. So tell me a little bit about how you guys get involved in that. So okay, so you issue a press statement now or a press release now they know they have a little bit of public defense. Do you guys actually work with the students, like just kind of lay out how that whole process goes? Yeah. So, uh, on our website we have a format anyone can fill out to request help and me and my team every morning we will go through the case submissions and uh, we'll review them and follow up for more documentation if necessary. And like I said, we get damn near close to a thousand of them a year now, uh, which is a whole lot of work. And we investigate and develop the cases and figure out what the best situ, you know, the best possible tactics in each case would be a.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       Usually the next step involves writing a letter telling the university which in syracuse case we sent that on friday, telling them, hey, this is the applicable law, are these applicable norms that you should be adhering to as though college, um, and here's why what you're doing has run a foul of all of that. Generally speaking, you know, we'll wait for a response in good faith given university some time to acknowledge our concerns and work through them and, you know, otherwise we will, excuse me, issue a press release and start bringing public pressure to bear sometimes in public college and university cases. We'll take it to litigation if we have to. Not every case obviously because you know, there's a range of cases that are, you know, make for a good lawsuit. But even just recently filed a lawsuit at joliet junior college and this is kind of, again, kind of flips the narrative a little bit because there was a students who saw a people, uh, basically talking about how capitalism is great and decided that she wanted to make a good point about socialism.

Speaker 2:          00:59:18       So she handed out and flyers about how, you know, it said shut down capitalism, inviting people to like a workshop, a about socialism. This was actually not far from where I live in chicago, joliet junior college, and she was actually confronted by a number of campus police officers who pulled her to an interrogation room, demanded to examine the flyers and then confiscated them and saying, you can't do that here. You know, the, the political climate right now is, you know, might start something. I'm actually shocked to hear it happening that that story is not the reverse. If this is an odd one, I'm glad you used it as an example. Actually, you know, it goes to show. I actually, you know, you'll be interested to hear this. I, my, my team and I actually did a really a quick analysis, and this isn't scientific or anything of all the public cases that we've had on our website from the beginning of fires history and actually more than half of them have nothing to do with politics.

Speaker 2:          01:00:20       More than half of them are simply administrators having power again. And when they have the power, they will use it to regulate or silence speech that they find inconvenient or critical of the university or administrators or, or just kind of not nice, generally less than half of our cases had to do with speakers being silenced specifically because of the viewpoint that we're espousing on a political level. It's, you know, it kind of undoes a lot of the narrative. And to be honest, I'm kind of a little bit tired of the whole, whether the right or left love censorship, more argument. I think it's completely unproductive and does nothing to solve the problem, which is we all need to understand why protecting free speech is important. I'd mUch rather focus my time there. Um, and you know, so it's really that that whole narrative can, could use a little deconstructing for a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:01:23       And I'm glad that we had that case that kind of allowed us to, to show it and people appreciate it. I got a lot of messages from people on the right who said, you know, I disagree with everything that that young woman had to say. And I would sit there and now and yelled at in her face, but you know what, I'm damn glad you guys stood up for her rights. and you know, when I get messages like that, it just, it warms my heart and I get them from people on both sides saying, you know what, I probably wouldn't have reacted in the same way you did leaping to a defense of free speech. But I'm glad you did it because I got something out of that. Uh, you know, it made me think about why my reaction wasn't that, uh, and if I, if I get, if I can elicit that in people, I feel great about my day.

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       That's the heavy lifting, I think. Well, that's a beautiful thing and that's why I did what you guys are doing. A, the thing I want to mention is that I just remembered in this last moment that the reason that you're here, I, so I had wanted to have one of you guys on for about a year or so, and you've been on our, our master list of all this. And then I think about three months or so ago, someone tweeted at me that they were at school at school library and they were watching a video of me and ben shapiro and that they were reported to the, either the diversity office or one of these things that it was hate speech and that another student shouldn't be allowed to watch these, these evil things, etc. Etc. It turns out that this was in the uk, so it was not under the jurisdiction that you guys a cover, which obviously is the United States.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       Um, but it just shows that this thing, this monster that we're fighting is not local to us here in America. It's all over the world. And there are other organizations like fire that do this work. And uh, yeah. And although it's depressing to know that somebody is being reported for watching a video that I put out there, it's good to know that you guys all came to the rush. You all came to the defense and you were like, who is it? Can we connect with them? You know, I connected them with some of your people, I think. And maybe you've passed them on to them with spikes over there. Yeah, it is. And you know, you see it happening in Canada all the time in the uk. I mean, you can, I have google alerts set and every. No, I wouldn't say every morning because it's more like 40,000 times a day.

Speaker 2:          01:03:40       I get emails from google with the latest headlines about free speech and it's not just even the uk and Canada. There are students protesting in India about freedom of speech issues and all kinds of countries. Australia, it's a big conversation right now. This is, you know, this is not limited to here. It's not limited to anywhere. This, the idea that college campuses are kind of a, both a microcosm of society and a, a training ground and an eye, a place where the ideas of the country, uh, kind of come from in a large sense. That's a kind of a global, a concept. I don't think that's limited to higher education in the United States. And you know, it's, I really hope that we can convince students that's where it's safeguarding. Uh, it's, it's too important not to rel. Said my friend, I'm with ya, and for more on the fine work that ari and the fire folks are doing, checkout the fire.org.
