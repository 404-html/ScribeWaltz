Speaker 1:          00:05          Joining me today as a sex researcher, a neuroscientist and cohost of the wrong speak podcast, Dr Deborah. So welcome to the Rubin report. Hi, I am glad to have you here. Finally,

Speaker 2:          00:16          I'm so happy to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:17          All right. We got a lot to talk about. I thought the best way to start this thing. I don't like to look at my notes up front, but you had a line on your patrion page that I thought summed up the whole damn thing pretty perfectly. Your patrion bio says creating journalism that defends science and free speech. You've come to the right show. All right. I think so. Yeah. Okay. Should we talk about sex first? Should we just start with sex and then can you talk about it all bleeds into one thing. Um, okay. Uh, you started as a neuroscientist, but you were sort of more attracted, for lack of a better word to, to studying sex. Tell me about that.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Yeah, so I mean, I decided to go back to school and do my phd in neuroscience and along the way I had the chance to do a placement in sexology. So I'd never heard of sex research before, I had no idea what it was, but it was so fascinating to me and I thought it's crazy that we have the technology to look at people's brains and look at sexual arousal in the brain and it tells us so much about what it means to be human. So from from there I was hooked. I loved it. My Phd was in using brain imaging to look at Paraphilias, which are atypical sexual interest and hypersexuality and men and I love research. I always will. But then I made the decision to leave academia and work full time as a journalist now because the climate had changed so much. Even between when I started my phd and when, when I finished.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Yeah. And that's why the stuff that you're talking about really is at the nexus of everything that I'm doing here because now you're on the journalist side, but it's because of the hostility that you were facing on the academic side. So what we're. What is it that you were unearthing are studying that was so triggering to people?

Speaker 2:          02:01          Well, within sexology you can't really study anything that isn't triggering, I'd say across the board, someone's going to get mad at you no matter what, but

Speaker 1:          02:09          no, you're really looking at facts. You're looking for. You're looking to find that.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Yeah, exactly. And even with brandon machine, I mean, that's, that's definitely, it's a growing field. The technology is legitimate, but no matter what I think because sexist still considered very taboo, people will either project their own ideas and beliefs and values onto it or they just don't see the value and they think, why is the government funding this? I feel really lucky being in Canada, we do have a pretty amazing, uh, scene in terms of sex research. Um, and my colleagues do manage to get funding. So I think that's excellent. But my decision to leave academia, uh, in the last two years I had noticed things were starting to go a bit weird and in terms of the climate and in terms of mainstream media, I was seeing piece after piece about transgender kids and how young children were socially transitioning. Getting on blockers, pubertal, pubertal blockers, and the media was basically saying this is the greatest thing.

Speaker 2:          03:04          This is something that we should rejoice about that these kids are so much better off after, but from a scientific perspective, the research actually shows that the majority of kids who are gender dysphoric actually outgrow their feelings. They're more likely to grow up to be gay in adulthood, not transgender, and so it makes sense for them to wait, not for them to socially transition at a young age. So I wanted to write a mainstream piece about this and there has been a very long standing history between trans activist and a sex researchers. Very ugly history of activists going after sex researchers if they don't like what someone's study says or what they say publicly. So I thought about it for a long time. I wrote the piece and I sat on it probably for about six months and I wasn't sure if I wanted to put it out.

Speaker 2:          03:48          I asked a bunch of my colleagues and mentors and they all said, you know what? The science is solid, but you know, you know what's going to happen. If you do put this out and at the time I wanted to stay in academia and I said, should I wait until I get tenure? And everyone told me, even if you have tenured nowadays, it's not going to protect you. You can still lose your job. So I decided to actually I couldn't stay quiet and I thought I'm not going to stay in an environment where I can't speak the truth and I can't even pursue questions that are meaningful anymore because I have to worry about who's going to get mad and then I'm going to lose my money and my funding and I'm going to lose my job. So that piece went out and it was called the white transgender kids show a transition and then I haven't looked back since.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Yeah. So I re-read. I've read the piece before but I reread it this morning, but thank you. Got here. And there's a lot here. So how much of this is just bleed is just blatantly a misunderstanding of science. Like I think there's partly that you have a misunderstanding of science and then you just have activists who just want you to bow to them all the time. Are you able to sort of quantify how much of the backlash is each?

Speaker 2:          04:53          I think to be charitable, I try to look at the other side and give them credit and try to think that they have good intentions. Maybe people. I mean, it's pretty consistent. All 11 studies ever done on the topic of distance. So this phenomenon I talked about where kids grow out of their feelings of gender dysphoria, all of them say the same thing. So the final statistic is about 60 to 90 percent. So this is the vast majority of kids. You can't really question those data. So I think what it could be as people, I mean trans people have a history of having to deal with medical gatekeeping of people telling them they don't really what they feel isn't real. I do think gender dysphoria is a real phenomenon and I do think we should have empathy for people who are suffering. Um, so I think it could be coming from that, of, of that place of, well, we don't want people saying that this isn't a legitimate thing or that trans people should be forced to not feel the way they do, but um, in terms of these children, we should be thinking about the best outcome so it doesn't make sense for them to transition if that's not actually going to help them in the longterm.

Speaker 2:          05:56          I, I to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I do think the activists, they, on some level, I think they know that they can bully sex researchers because of that history. They know that there's only so much an academic can do and they've won a couple battles. So I think that's part of it as well.

Speaker 1:          06:13          How shocking was it to you when you were discussing this with colleagues, um, that they were kind of hinting you may want to wait on this thing. I mean, did you think that you'd be in that situation? And I'm, I'm wondering, did any of them sit on some other things because they were afraid to.

Speaker 2:          06:31          It was eyeopening. Yeah. Um, but I, I kind of knew, um, one one I guess instance I can talk about is one colleague, Michael Bailey at northwestern university, he wrote a book that upset transgender activists and they went off after ruthlessly. I mean they really tried to destroy his life and thankfully, you know, he's, he's still considered one of the foremost experts in sexology internationally. But I would say that, you know, I've written about him previously. I think he's kind of been the poster boys to why people are really terrified to say anything that goes against the Trans Narrative.

Speaker 1:          07:07          So I think you've already hinted at this and I know your work otherwise, but so you have no issue with trans people as people. Just to be clear, this is purely about the science related to transitioning and hormone blockers and things of that nature of a certain age where they're doing it as young as I think you're right about 14.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Oh, younger than that now. Well, yeah, I mean if there's parental consent, definitely. And I have to say for a transgender adults, and I'd say even kids who reached puberty and still feel that way, I think transitioning is, is totally up to you. If that's the path you decide to go, then power to you. I don't think there's any ones, any, it's anyone's business to tell you what to do at that point.

Speaker 1:          07:44          So why are there basic parameters related to age then?

Speaker 2:          07:48          Well, there are insurance. So I don't work with children. I don't do clinical work anymore. But um, in terms of the research literature, usually clinicians will wait until puberty and see how the child feels at that time, when the body starts changing, when they start having crushes on their peers and that kind of thing. And the research does show that, um, when kids start to, you know, have crushes and start dating and that can play a role in terms of how they feel about their bodies and whether they do outgrow it.

Speaker 1:          08:18          Just at that point, your whole body is in flux. Your mental states and physical states in flux. And as you said, what, what did you say a percentage on that? Of How many of them turn out to just so yeah, so they, so 60 to 90 percent of the children undergoing these feelings turn out to be gay and then I assume the ones that don't transition, probably most of them ended up being okay with being gay, I would imagine. Roughly.

Speaker 2:          08:42          Yeah. And I would say even like I grew up in the gay community. I have a lot of gay male friends and they've said to me when I was young, I told my parents all the time, I hated being a boy and I want it to be a girl and I am a girl and why can I become a girl? And now as a gay man, I'm so comfortable. I'm so happy. And they say to me, you know, I'm, I'm kind of glad I'm not growing up in this time because I think I probably would have transitioned.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Yeah. Well that's why the, the external pressure seemed so crazy to me because you just don't know at that at that age. And even if you do know waiting a little bit, is that a, for the science to flesh out here? That's not going to kill you. It's just hard talking about this evening.

Speaker 2:          09:20          Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the thing is, what people also aren't talking about is that for these kids, in some cases the parents don't want a gay child and this is what upsets me the most. So if you have a little boy who's very feminine, he's likely going to grow up to be a gay man, but if you take that same level and allow them to transition to female, when he grows up, he's going to appear to be a straight woman. And so these parents are being lauded as progressive when really they're homophobic.

Speaker 1:          09:46          Oh God. How perverse that is. That is. That's interesting what you just said about a certain amount of gay men that grow up, you know, they wanted to be a or it felt more like a girl or whatever, and then eventually grew out and we were okay because I never felt that. Like I played sports and I played video games and transformers, all the, all the things that my friends did or I never felt like I was a girl or more feminine. People always say to me, I don't seem gay, and I'm always like, I don't know what that, you know, it ain't like I'm married to a guy that's pretty gay, but I never had that. But that, that sort of just interesting about the psychology of gay people in general. There are gay people that grow up feeling very feminine or gay men that grow up, not feeling that way and I'm sure there's women that grow up feeling very butch or whatever. And there's women that grew up that are, you know, lipstick, lesbians and the whole thing. Have you done any research on it, on any of that?

Speaker 2:          10:36          Uh, in terms of my research, no. But in terms of what studies have shown it as about hormone levels in utero. So testosterone, if you are exposed to higher levels of testosterone in Utero, you're more likely to be male, typical and masculine when you're born. So whether you're male or female. So most boys are exposed to high levels of testosterone. So at that explains when they're born, why they are interested in Male, typical toys and activities. Um, so for gay men they were likely exposed to lower levels of testosterone, which is why they're more feminine. And the same with, with girls, if they're exposed to higher levels of testosterone than more likely to be masculine and lesbian.

Speaker 1:          11:11          Right. Even though there's obvious outliers. Oh yeah. This is on average. On average. Yeah. Is, is there a danger in talking about that because I would imagine that the certain amount of people in the gay community that would want you to never go down that road because then you could end up in a place where, oh, we would be able to prevent people from being a ultimately if we can really figure out the science behind all this.

Speaker 2:          11:34          Definitely. And I mean, as a straight woman, I have to say I even, I even right now feel like maybe I shouldn't be saying these things because I'm not gay. I can't speak for the community. But as a former sex researcher, I am very much a proponent of A.

Speaker 1:          11:46          I'd rather you speak as a researcher that a gay person or a straight person or anything else. I mean this is, this is the problem though, you're, you're know what I mean, like you weren't, you were an expert in this and it's like even for you who's so brave on all of these issues, it gets weird to talk about it. And even for me I just, it's like a little weird to talk

Speaker 2:          12:04          like a trader.

Speaker 1:          12:05          No, I am what I am and that's all that I am. That's it. But like I know that just even talking about this just gets people crazy and I know what our, what our twitter feeds are going to look

Speaker 2:          12:15          right after this, get ready. So I mean it's crazy because even my colleagues who have the best intentions are doing this research because they just want understand why are people the way they are. It's not. There are no nefarious intentions there but people are so quick to jump on. I mean there was earlier this year there was a study about using ai to be able to detect whether someone is gay by looking at their face. And so again, studies have shown that on average you can see differences between straight and gay people. Both men and women in terms of facial features and so everyone's freaking out about this study and I'm thinking, why aren't we saying this is amazing that we're able to know this? And I mean, I think I've really good Gaydar I've always thought I have and now I think great, like there's actually some quantitative data to suggest that I'm not just making things up.

Speaker 1:          13:03          Right? And they're also, they always say, well gay guys have Gaydar something else that maybe you can see or whatever it is. Or they'll. I don't know the people say it anymore, but people used to say gay face. Like there's just something about the facial features sometimes of gay men. Maybe they were a little softer or whatever it is. I don't even know what it is, but like people were talking about that in the gay community. Then it comes out through some sort of science lens and it's like, Ooh, we better watch out for that.

Speaker 2:          13:28          And the thing is then researchers see that and say, well I don't want to go through that. So then they don't want to touch that topic. So now there's, they're eventually going to be only like two different things you could probably study unless you know that what your findings, what you're going to find is going to be politically acceptable, in which case you shouldn't be doing the research because that means you're not actually doing science.

Speaker 1:          13:44          Yeah. What do you think it is about you that makes you brave enough to do this sort of thing? Because I bet a couple of other people we're going to talk about James Debord a little bit because you've also written about him and why the whole thing about diversity and all that, but I've had a bunch of outliers in these communities on the show and I'm always curious what it is about the specific people that make them sort of put it out there and go, I'm going to do it. Whether you like it or not.

Speaker 2:          14:08          It's probably my personality. Yeah. I mean I just generally don't really care what people think about me and I'm pretty stubborn and I. I'm very. I feel very strongly about sex research being taken seriously and my decision to go on it and gone into that field that you deal with a lot of stigma as I mentioned earlier. You deal with it on both sides, you know, and when you make the decision to go into the field, suddenly when people know what you do, they will judge you on a personal level. So I think that was part of it. You know, I grew up very thick skin from saying I'm going to do what I find interesting and people can assume whatever they want about me and that I think that just translated into now what I do as a, as a science journalist, but the, I would say too, and I'm sure you probably went through a similar experience once you speak out, it becomes much easier and I find I can't, I can't stay quiet now. And I find the people that are gonna, you know, turn their backs on you let them because you don't need them in your life.

Speaker 1:          15:02          Yeah. Once you start, you can't stop. Actually, it's built into you. You just can't stop. So one of the things I think is really interesting is how, you know, there's such a movement always to say that gay people are born this way. Right. Lady Gaga even wrote it down on the bathroom floor in this way and yet at the same time, if I know for a fact, like I have a friend who for many years was my lesbian friend, my one good lesbian friend and she was dating girls all the time and all that. Then about three years ago we were sitting there and she told me that she met a guy and now she's been with this guy for about three or four years and they're getting married and she's identified as basically as bisexual now, but she's only. She's exclusively been with a guy for about four years. But what I find interesting about it is that her lesbian friends have basically all turned on her and this is supposed to be the. These are supposed to be the people of tolerance and we should accept your sexuality and all that. But when it goes the other way, suddenly it becomes this other thing. Have you have. You seen that before?

Speaker 2:          16:09          Do you have. I can imagine that I'm. I'm guessing they probably think that she sold out. She's a sellout or something. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          16:15          you're taking the easy road or something like that. Like every insane cliche and I know her to be completely authentic and real.

Speaker 2:          16:22          How does, how has she dealt with it? I'm curious.

Speaker 1:          16:24          It's been. Well, it's woken her up in a zillion other ways, so for a lot of the other things that we talk about about free speech and politics and freedom and all that, she's started to wake up to all of that. She was a huge lefty progressive and now she's basically a libertarian because she saw that authoritarian thing. Why do you guys want to control me? The second I think differently. You guys want to control me, so now she's like the

Speaker 2:          16:49          good stuff. All of my friends so to speak. That's the thing. I think all of us are eventually going to have a moment like that where you realize what you thought was the truth is not the truth and there's so many other things. It's like falling down that rabbit hole and real and you start to question everything then, and it's really liberating. But uh, you know, in terms of sexuality, that's. I mean that's very common. Women, female sexuality is much more fluid than men. Some men tend to be very category specific. If you're into women, you really like women. You're not two guys. If you're into guys, do you guys not to women than women tend to be a little bit more flexible.

Speaker 1:          17:23          It's like you find, you know, there are supposedly straight married men that on the dl or sleeping with other guys, but I'm pretty sure there aren't many gay men that are in relationships are married that are sneaking out and sleeping with women.

Speaker 2:          17:34          No. Have you ever seen one of those who? Your research. Okay. There's a, you know, I think the first case I think is probably closet gays and then the second case I have to think about that

Speaker 1:          17:50          gay man. Well, I guess you might be sleeping. Yeah, I mean I did it like I slept with women as sort of like a, an overcompensation or I was trying. It's not even overcompensation. I was really trying, I just thought I should try. I and tried. I tried and you know, eventually I tried no more.

Speaker 2:          18:07          Yeah. I think also for gay men when you come out, it's such a big thing and I think to make that decision to come out is really committed to this as much as you know, we don't like identity labels. It is an identity label. So I would see it as being less common for someone who's gay to be sleeping with women on the side because he would have likely just stayed in that camp. That would be my guess.

Speaker 1:          18:31          Yeah. So. Okay. So you mentioned that you, you study a lot of this related to the brain, how a lot of this is sort of built into us and you studied this across sort of fetishize the right word.

Speaker 2:          18:42          A paraphilia is, yeah, fetishes, a specific pair of failure, but um, across the board basically.

Speaker 1:          18:49          So wait, what's the definition of Paraphilia,

Speaker 2:          18:51          uh, unusual sexual interests and how's that different than fetish? Well, if fetishes, a specific object or body part that you have a preference for.

Speaker 1:          19:00          Got It. So, uh, so let's talk about a couple of those located.

Speaker 2:          19:04          There are a lot of them, so I always, I tell people this and no one ever believes me, but I'm actually very, very traditional vanilla, not kinky.

Speaker 1:          19:13          Love it. You're going to ask you all that at the end about yourself.

Speaker 2:          19:16          Good. Okay. Yeah, but I mean, I'm fine. It's super fascinating and I guess it's my way of living vicariously, you know, so in terms of different paraphilia is, I mean there's a foyer ism is known as peeping toms and exhibitionism, so people like to expose themselves a sadism and masochism which are different from bdsm. Bdsm is consensual masochism, sadism. So masochism being, wanting, wanting to be humiliated. Sadism is one, just your partner, be humiliated. Bdsm is very much about consent, so it's not true masochism or sadism because a partners will negotiate beforehand and not do anything outside of particular boundaries and that kind of thing. Uh, what else is there? Fraud or ISM. So it's when people like to rub up against unsuspecting people, there are tons I could go on forever.

Speaker 1:          20:04          Yeah. And so how are these all connected to the same parts of the brain? Is it the same mechanism that's working in the fetish itself is just manifested in

Speaker 2:          20:13          different targets? Yeah. So with my research, when I was still a researcher, I found that for men who are Kinky, when they look at kinky pornography, the same brain network activates as when non kinky people are looking at regular or vanilla pornography. So it's adjust that paraphilias maybe akin to a sexual orientation. So it's not to say that's the same as being gay, but it's the same idea conceptually that it's someone's preference. It can't be changed. Um, and it's with them from, from very early on.

Speaker 1:          20:41          Yeah. How does the Internet play into all this? Because I know you've written about a porn and things like that where now all of this stuff is so accessible where obviously even 15, 20 years ago it was a lot harder to get.

Speaker 2:          20:56          Yeah. I think people are probably able to test out different things and go searching for things out of curiosity. But if you really like something, I don't think it's because you happened to find it on the Internet and with porn addiction in particular, there's no research to suggest that it's a real thing that excessive porn viewing is akin to an addiction. Usually if you talk to someone with problems with porn across the board, it's, there's always some other reason why either they're anxious, they like to procrastinate. Well, they don't like to procrastinate, but they use it as a way of procrastinating and avoiding other things. It's not that they're actually addicted to pornography.

Speaker 1:          21:30          Right? So when you hear though that people will say, well, you're getting that dopamine. Isn't that partly what being addicted you? Wouldn't you become addicted to that? What? My understanding of the term addiction slightly incorrectly.

Speaker 2:          21:41          That's true. Um, but dopamine is released during the number of different things. If you eat a nice piece of food that you like dopamine's released, um, if you see a nice picture, dope, mean reward, but it's responsible for a lot of different things. So I think that's one case of. I mean, I do have some issue with science journalists watering things down and liking to take one finding or one study in kind of a, you know, representing it or misrepresenting it. So it's not really an accurate take on it, but I understand why people think that because dopamine has been seen as the addiction neurotransmitter and then you see so much about porn, porn, addiction, sex addiction. I'd say probably a year ago it was everywhere. Everyone was talking about porn and sex addiction even though they're, again, there's no legitimate research to suggest that those things are real.

Speaker 1:          22:28          Hmm. So when you've studied all of these things, what are, what are you finding out about the brain as a neuroscientist and can anything be done for any of these things? If somebody was partaking in these things and either didn't want to or at least wanting to understand it or whatever else.

Speaker 2:          22:44          The biggest thing I would say is find a partner who accepts you for who you are. Whatever you're into. Especially for men, it's not going to change. And so the difference between someone who has

Speaker 1:          22:54          so meaning women's kinks or whatever will change with time where a man would be less inclined to.

Speaker 2:          22:59          Yeah. The same with, you know, in the same way with the sexual orientation, women tend to be more flexible with their sexual preferences. So if are Kinky, they might be really kinky with one partner or if they have a partner who's very kinky, they might be into whatever he's into if it's a straight couple. But then if she's with someone who's less Kinky, it might not be as much of a problem. Whereas if it's a man who's really into something, if his partner is not into it, he's always going to be into it. He's just going to have to hide it.

Speaker 1:          23:21          Yeah. Have you heard of this phrase, lesbian bed, death. I'm all, I'm all over the place. I'm just going into the fall and seeing come up with. Have you heard this phrase before?

Speaker 2:          23:32          It's means that there's no sex after a certain amount of time.

Speaker 1:          23:34          Yeah. That lesbians, it sort of burns very hot for that early period and then the u haul shows up as a joke and then just like the, the desire for sex just disappeared.

Speaker 2:          23:46          There's just lots of cuddling. I haven't heard of that. Well, men on average do tend to have a higher sex drive, so I could see if you're in a relationship where it's two women, how uh, this, you know, their sex drive might be a bit lower. Not sure what else?

Speaker 1:          23:59          Like what, what are you really thinking about right now in general? What are the topics that are really on your mind related to all this?

Speaker 2:          24:09          My concern number one is probably seeing how gender is being warped to facilitate particular political agendas. Um, as you mentioned the James Damore and seeing how that whole thing unfolded last summer.

Speaker 1:          24:23          Okay. So let's talk about that. Could you wrote a piece on it? I remember the piece coming out.

Speaker 2:          24:27          Yeah. Um, so I remember when that news first broke, uh, that this sexist memo was going around and I read it and I thought, okay, this is not sexist. And then I saw the statement from Google that he was perpetuating gender stereotypes and I thought, oh no. And so I wrote that column for the Globe and Mail to speak to the science and say, you know what the science said James cited was absolutely 100 percent legitimate and there shouldn't be anything wrong with saying that. And if you actually read his memo, you'll see that he's not a misogynist. And we actually saw the podcasts that I cohost with Jonathan Kay called wrong speak. We actually interviewed him for our first episode and if you listened to him speak, you'll, you can see, I mean, he's very much for equality between the sexes. He says that if men and women don't talk to each other, that's going to harm both of us. Um, but it was much easier for them to paint him as a misogynist and as an outright failure because I guess, you know, there's nothing else going on the news.

Speaker 1:          25:22          Did you feel that the article, or at least when James was able to get out there and say what he thought, whether he did it here or, or on Rogan or a series of other podcasts, did you feel that that was able to break through to some of the people that needed to break through to like, I know it gets to the masses, right? It gets to the people who appreciate maybe what happens in here or on Rogan or things like that, but for any of the people that really need to hear it, the ones that are at Google or the ones that are setting the diversity agenda at schools and all that, is there any sign that any of this, a pushback against it has taken root?

Speaker 2:          25:57          No, I think it's gotten worse, if anything, honestly, which is terrible. Um, I think they are so set in that mindset that you really can't. You can't say anything. I think reasonable people if you talk to them. I was surprised actually at that time because a lot of people that I knew that were really intelligent, really rational had bought into this narrative that he was a sexist person who said that women are biologically inferior and are not capable of engineering or working in tech, and I said, well, why don't you think that? Did you read the memo? And most people had not, but then because the left wing media was so adamant about this message, people just assume, well, they're not going to lie. Why would they lie and you know, we are in this industry, so of course we know, but I think most people just take it face value. They're. They have their jobs and so they see a headline or they see an interview. They just think, well, I like a mainstream interview. They think, well, they wouldn't be saying these things if there wasn't some truth to them, but no, they. They're blatantly lying.

Speaker 1:          26:55          They're blatantly lying. Has all of this and being part of this and being very public about your opinions. Has this changed your politics at all? I find that it consistently has changed people's politics. Usually it shifts people to more of what I would say as a classical liberal position, but what a libertarian, just more of a less government position because you want. Because that's where I think at the moment, the most freedom lays.

Speaker 2:          27:21          Yeah, I would agree with that. And especially the idea of the government. I used to. I used to be definitely more left, much, much more left. Um, I was still calling myself a liberal, but definitely now that I see because I used to think was good for the government to come in and help people and to kind of set the tone. But now now I'm seeing things that are not hate speech or being considered hate speech and genuine facts. We're not allowed to say them anymore. So I'm much more skeptical now of government intervention of policies dictating what people can and cannot do or say. So I would say I have moved more to the right, but I would still call myself a liberal. I mean, the fact that I write about sex research for a living is pretty low.

Speaker 1:          27:57          Yeah. You're my kind of liberal. So you're, you're good to go. In here, so one of the things that I think is fascinating about all of what we're talking about here is that it's not just about gender and sex and sexuality, but this is also leaking into all sorts of other things, talking about ethnicity and color of skin and all of that. Uh, you've written a bit about this.

Speaker 2:          28:18          I have, yeah. I wrote about how a university applications, and particularly Harvard has been discriminating against Asians for decades and how to the point where Asians, when they apply to university, will want to hide their ethnicity in hopes of that. That's going to give them a fair chance of actually getting into.

Speaker 1:          28:35          So the school. So. All right, so somebody that's watching this right now that doesn't know about this, they're gonna go, wait a minute, why would harvard discriminate against Asian people?

Speaker 2:          28:45          Because apparently there are too many Asians there. If it's based solely on sat scores and meritocracy, um, there's a very high proportion of Asian students. And so in the name of quote unquote diversity and inclusion, um, Asian students get penalized.

Speaker 1:          29:01          So this to me is the most blatant example of why this diversity stuff is complete nonsense because people on face value, it seems nice. We want to help people, we want to help groups that maybe have struggled more for whatever reason and there's probably many good ways to do that. Maybe investing in more education or whatever else. I'm happy to hear your thoughts on that, but what they take as a good thought then they don't think all the way through, which means okay, now we're going to have to punish people who have worked very hard and done everything right. And by and large, the Asian community, whether it's Chinese or Japanese or Korean or whatever else, have

Speaker 2:          29:42          worked really hard and put a focus on education and family. And then what is the result of that? It's now harder if not almost impossible at some level to get into Harvard. And the craziest thing, I don't understand why people think is acceptable. And even when I wrote that column, I had a number of Asians reach out to me and say, you know, don't, don't be used as a token for the far right. And I'm totally okay with this, this is fair. And I'm thinking, you know, what are you on the times? Do an op Ed, I think by an Asian woman coming mistaken. Yeah. Saying that this is okay. And I just, I mean, what do you do it that you are fighting for true equality that is simply not what they're fighting for. I think it's indoctrination at some level. I think especially for the kids who are applying to these schools and who are okay with having to score much higher on the sat in order to get a fair chance.

Speaker 2:          30:37          I think they've just been told, you know, this is how it has to be, um, but this idea that it should be equality and equality of outcome as opposed to opportunity is, is silly and it doesn't actually deal with actual differences in terms of opportunity, in terms of the differences that we see and the reasons why there are these differences. They're not actually being addressed. Please tell me that you got some nice support from members of the Asian community that it wasn't just sort of brainwashed lefties that were. I didn't know. I didn't, I got across the board of, of, you know, many races, so I was grateful for that because I wasn't sure how people were going to respond to that piece, but I felt very strongly that I had to say something as Harvard issued a response to any of this or do we even know where they're at with all this?

Speaker 2:          31:22          No, as far as I know that the lawsuit is still ongoing. It's just, it really is just crazy. So are you with me on this? I sense that there's some massive minority groups that are breaking right now. I think the Asian community, because of the, I hate saying community, but you know, you have to use some words to describe how this. But I think the black community is breaking. This is what a lot of what candidates. Oh, is talking about. I sent to this happening in the gay community. I sent to this happening in the Jewish community on very similarly because of the Asian community, because of hard work and an education and all that. And so did you decide yet we have to put you at the bottom of the oppression Olympics. Um, so there's an interesting like, strange alliance now, now building up or are you seeing that?

Speaker 2:          32:04          I could say yeah, I see it coming. I see. Well, we were talking about the bit about this earlier, about how the left is going to eat its own until there is only one person left. So it's only a matter of time really. We're all going to find each other and say, yeah, we've had enough of this. I mean, gay men, you guys don't count. It doesn't count to begin anymore. So, um, but I never wanted extra credit. I wanted equality, equality, equal credit, not extra credit. In a weird way. I'm actually okay being thrown out in that regard of this pyramid because I don't want to play that game. But I think actually finally some gay, especially

Speaker 1:          32:40          gay white men because now they're, they're fully thought of as the enemy. I mean, I've even seen things on college campuses where lgbt organizations are saying, well, you can't be a gay white man and be the president of the organization because you're, you're one of the bad guys. I mean that. That's really dangerous thinking.

Speaker 2:          32:57          Well, I saw what you had to deal with too at that professor who said that the lgbt community doesn't want you at the. Was it the University of University of New Hampshire?

Speaker 1:          33:05          Yeah. Do you know that? So I didn't know at the time, so I think much of my audience will know what you're referring to. But I spoke at University of New Hampshire and there were all these heckler's there and there was a trans woman who I did not know was a professor. I didn't know that until literally two months later who was screaming at me how much I hate trans people and all this. And I kept saying, I want you to have equality under the law and I want you to be treated with decency and respect and I hope you find someone that loves you and all of the things I would want for anyone else. I just don't want the government using a dictating what pronouns I can use to, to refer to you and you know, basically she was calling me all right and all that it did. And of course it turns out she's a gender studies professor. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          33:44          It should never be a surprise anymore,

Speaker 1:          33:46          but there's gonna be no discipline at the school or anything like that. I mean I could probably make more of a hey, have it and see what happens, but it's like,

Speaker 2:          33:53          yeah, you know, you handled it amazingly well and I mean it's only a matter of time. Like I see with feminism, they're turning on white women now too. So it's insane.

Speaker 1:          34:03          Is that the only logical outcome of these disciplines because they are not held to the scientific standard of everything else that we discussed here in the first app that you, that you are held to as a scientist?

Speaker 2:          34:14          Yeah, I think because everything is, there's so much based in subjective feeling and validating people's experiences. You apparently can't question someone's experienced. So if someone's offended or they don't like you, what can you say? So I, I could see that and it's, it's very much rewarding people for being emotionally driven instead of, I think the best way to have a debate as to remove emotion and just try to look at the facts as objectively as you can no matter what the issue is. So, um, it's that, it's, that they don't really have any sort of method to how they do their, even their research is, I mean, it's kind of a joke,

Speaker 1:          34:51          but rob kind of hearing that even the methods now are part of the patriarchy and all of those things that you're using facts, they don't want facts to actually count because they believe in this postmodern drivel that, that facts have been arrived to by mechanisms that they don't believe in. That's a, that's a tough thing to trick somebody out of.

Speaker 2:          35:13          Yeah. But you know, I think on some level, I think some of these scholars know that what they're doing is very lucrative. And so they're just basically trying to shut people down in any way they can. They can't really justified, but you know, they just keep screaming about it and academics who have better things to do, like actually do real research and they've got their courses and their students and a million other things and their 80 hour work weeks, they don't have time to deal with this. So this is why there's a lopsided discourse in terms of what you see coming out of the universities and there are some institutions that, you know, they won't allow academics to engage with the media without permission for. So that, that's part of it too. It's just, it's really an unfair battle right now that's being fought.

Speaker 1:          35:52          Yeah. How do you think we get to a place where specifically related to sexuality and topics related to gender and sex, where we will be able to talk about it in a, in a better way. So for example, the me too movement where everybody I every, I think basically thinking person understands that there were some really bad people here that did some really bad stuff. Obviously Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and some people that really that drug people in that you know, years of history of doing all this and then there's all sorts of other people who seem like they're just getting swept up in it or basically accused all that. Now you can be for the idea of the me too movement without being, for taking down. All of these other people are also, and I guess what the real issue is litigating everyone's history where we could all look back and go, I did this. Someone did that to me, this, that, the other thing. College kids now have an assigned things before they hook up. I mean really where we're creating this situation where our interpersonal relations are going to have almost nothing to do with the stuff that's hard wired into us. The stuff that you study

Speaker 2:          37:01          [inaudible], I think me too probably started as something honorable and I do agree that women and men have been dealing with harassment for far too long and that it doesn't get taken seriously sometimes, but it's to the point now where relations are so strained, especially between men and women. I, I sense men are terrified and that's not going to be helpful across the board for anybody. Um, I think especially when you look at shades of gray, well, I mean there's so much I could say on this. I'm trying to think what's the best place to start would be, um, with consent. Say I think one message that's been missing is women I've written about this. Women need to advocate for themselves and that's not to say if you were experienced harassment or if you were assaulted that you are at fault. I'm not advocating victim blaming, but I think what's missing from this narrative, women are portrayed as though they're helpless and if something happens to them, they're helpless and that, uh, they're basically, they have no say in terms of how men behave towards them.

Speaker 2:          38:02          And you, I've written about sexism in the sciences and how women are basically being scared off, I think of going into the field. Um, as someone with a phd in a science field. Yeah. You deal with sexism and it's unpleasant. But I still got my degree and now I'm speaking out about it. So if you want to achieve something, you can, uh, sexism is not so terrible in the world that women can't achieve what they want. So going back to consent, you know, I think women need young women especially, you needed to be told, you know, you have a say in this if you don't like something or if you don't want to do something, say so, don't, don't feel like it's on the man to um, I know, read your mind and I feel like I'm going to get in so much trouble for saying this, but I think that empowers women instead of telling them, you know, just really hope that this doesn't happen to you. And if it does, then get on twitter and use the Hashtag and talk about how men are terrible and men are trash. Men are not terrible. They're lovely men in the world. I love men. You know, there are some bad men, but you can't generalize to all men.

Speaker 1:          39:03          Yeah. But we love the generalizations. It's easier. I mean, you even see this, the amount of articles where I see, you know, we have to take down white. It's always white men that we have to take down or, or now it's women's turn to rule the world or all of these things and it's like, well, a woman could be president or a woman could be, you know, anything that a man could be, but it shouldn't be because she's a woman. It should be because she's capable, but, but we've seen this sort of hysterical reaction to it and I think that that now is just another one of these places where we're on this crazy pendulum just bouncing back and forth.

Speaker 2:          39:38          Yeah. I'm hoping it's going to come back to the middle. Um, and hopefully not too much damage will be done before that happens and that the relations between men and women or I couldn't be so terribly strange. Um, I do think we're reaching that point though because there are only so many men left to have it been accused of a me too moments. So, you know, it's only a matter of time.

Speaker 1:          39:57          You know, it's interesting. I have a running joke with some of my friends that I know a lot of great straight girls in La that are single lot of straight great girls. I don't know, a lot of straight guys that I think are great. Like I know I know some straight guys that are kinda whatever, but I don't know like a lot of straight guys that kind of have their shit together that are. So I have all these girls that are like, okay, you set me up with a guy and I'm like not guys I know, which does show that there's sort of a crisis I think in masculinity or something. And, and obviously Jordan Peterson is addressing this at some level, although now I've spent so much time with him. I think he's addressing it in a certain way. You almost equally for men and women, although people only focus on the male part. But do you know, is anyone doing research on sort of what is happening to young men in particular right now?

Speaker 2:          40:46          Hm, that's a good question. I know that uh, levels of testosterone are lower on average more recently. So I don't know if that has something to do with it.

Speaker 1:          40:57          Do we know what the reasoning for that is?

Speaker 2:          40:59          Could be. Maybe there's more estrogens that are, that we're putting into our bodies. I'm trying to think of what I can give you [inaudible]. That's an interesting. So how old are your friends? I'm curious.

Speaker 1:          41:09          Um, this sort of set of friends that I'm talking about. These girls usually are in, they're sorta like early thirties. Yeah. Kind of thing. And they're, and they're single, which, you know, most often cases, a lot of them, their friends are married already and like they're, they're on the hunt and they've got good jobs and they look good and they take care of themselves and all of those things. And I just don't see the equivalent here. I don't know, maybe there's an odd subset of. Because la is like a little bit of an odd place. Maybe there's more gay people here. I don't, I don't know. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          41:36          Yeah. I mean, I could say the average age for people getting married as 28, so I don't want to, I don't want to generalize and say that across the board you sciences, it's incredible and to be fair, yeah, but I mean it could be that for guys who are a certain age, if there's a reason, but at the same thing for women of a certain age, and not to say that your friends of course, but um, you know, if you're focused on your career, maybe you're not used to giving your time to someone else. That could be part of it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:05          Do you think that the feminist movement, which I know is sort of, we sort of ancillary been talking about it this whole time that they really did give up something very special by putting so much focus on work and success in that way. I mean, you know, I think back to my childhood now, which I think in retrospect was so amazing. My mom was home for most of it. She, she worked before. I'm the oldest of three. She worked before I was there and then she didn't work all the years that she was raising us and then went back to work after, um, and that having someone at home that was cooking and taking care of us and making sure we got to school and all of those things, like, that's like the greatest thing that anyone could do. It happens to more often be the woman, but that's a, that's a pretty great thing. That's often been sacrifice. Now we're thought of it. It's marked in a way.

Speaker 2:          42:55          Yeah. I mean, I've always been a atypical in terms of I've, I've always been felt more masculine. I've always been very focused on my career. Um, but I definitely think that feminism and for some people it or some proponents of feminism, they will denigrate female typical roles, um, and motherhood and wanting to be a, you know, at home with your family. And I think I've, you know, I've heard from women who say, know, I've been told that the path to happiness is for me to focus on my career and to neglect my personal life. And then they reach a point where they realize, no, I do want those things and I don't think there should be anything wrong with that. And the same thing, you know, I've written about how there's such an emphasis for, for girls to be like boys now I saw you tweet about babies, babies. And underlying that is a sexism that it says that girls need to be like boys in order to be equal or worthy of respect. And no one's talking about that where people are just saying, yeah, for sure. Let's just, you know, tell girls that they have to be the same as boys and women have to be the same as men.

Speaker 1:          43:57          Yeah. So the article you're referring to, there was this piece, I think it was in Newsweek that these parents are raising their twins as Fabian t, h e y babies, babies, uh, and they're going to let them pick their gender and it's like you're going to create more psychological problems then you were trying to hide them from most likely, I think.

Speaker 2:          44:21          Yeah. And it goes back to biology again, and hormonal exposure in utero. You, I think it's great. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:26          It might've been NBC news I think.

Speaker 2:          44:28          Okay. Yeah. Newsweek. Okay. Yeah. But yeah, I think there are a couple outlets that were so excited about this and the whole, that was why I wrote about it. Not because of the thing, you know, these parents can do whatever they want and that's what I followed up with immediately after an appearance can do whatever they want and then when the children are of age, they can either decide my parents were crazy or not write this on the parents. Right. And all that. But it was. But that wasn't the issue for me. It was that the way these headlines are always written, it's like that this was like this is the new thing and the implicit piece of that is you better do this to be a good parent, to get tolerant parent to be a progressive parents and that open minded person. And that to me is the danger here.

Speaker 2:          45:07          Not The little isolated case necessarily have these people that are doing something. That's an outlier thing. And the thing is, I've heard stories now where people are terrified of giving their daughters dolls and which is what's really funny is you have some of these really progressive parents who raise their girls. They only have gender neutral toys or they give them boys toys and then the girl obviously goes to school and sees girl typical toys and wants to play with them. And the parents were horrified and they think, oh, this is the patriarchy coming in return of the is biology and we shouldn't be afraid of that. And we shouldn't. We shouldn't shame girls for wanting to be female. Typical.

Speaker 1:          45:42          Yeah. But this is why when people say, I think to a bunch of us that are in this space, this, oh, you guys are overstating what this thing is. It's just a bunch of angry activist or whatever. It's like we've seen it, in fact, academia, which you addressed already. We've seen it, in fact, the home and how you're supposed to raise your kids. Even just thinking about this now, it's like, I think I read something on this and that and if not there's definite proof of it that Disney made a decision along the way. Now that they have star wars and marvel that star wars was going to be more marketed to girls and marvel was going to be the boy's thing. Now I'm a big star wars guy and I would see these commercials and it was all girls, you know, girls in the ships and grows with the light lightsabers live. I have no problem with that. Obviously a rave, a leading character. The last one is a girl. It's all good. The girls can do that, but. But pushing marketing on them seems odd to me. And, and although I'm sure there are many girl girls out there that want to be a jetta I, there's obviously more boys. So the way that we even market and I suspect they're marketing in a way that's hurting their bottom line in the name of tolerance in the name of what I don't know.

Speaker 2:          46:49          Yeah. So I mean, how did the boys feel about that?

Speaker 1:          46:51          Right, right. So you're going to get this odd thing, then we'll eventually, if there enough marketing boys are going to want to play with the girl thing and then feel weird about it.

Speaker 2:          47:00          God, that's messed up. How much time did you have? Too much time on their hands. Yeah. Yeah. Just say like kids do what they want and acknowledged that as long as you give them free choices, you probably won't have too much say at the end of the day, but at least you know, they, they'll be happy.

Speaker 1:          47:14          Yeah. Uh, is there anything else that you're researching at the moment or that's been on your mind that, uh, that we haven't covered?

Speaker 2:          47:21          Uh, the only thing I would say is, so with [inaudible], we are going to be launching our second. We just launched our first season last month. Um, so spoke with James Damore, Lindsay Shepherd. We also did an episode on rapid onset gender dysphoria. So it's this phenomenon of adolescent girls who were suddenly saying they're transgender even though they've had no previous signs of gender dysphoria and actually their problems have nothing to do with gender. So what are the problems? That's just societal stuff or pressure or wanting attention or all of the above. Usually autism as well, so they either will be diagnosed by a mental professional, but the person will say, I can't say that I have to, you know, affirm your child's gender. Um, because they can otherwise get a lot of trouble and lose their jobs if they don't, um, you repeat that again so that they will lose their jobs if they don't have to affirm their.

Speaker 2:          48:13          They have two clinicians nowadays have to affirm these kids. If a child says they're transgender and you have to, they'll lose their jobs otherwise. So, so technically a therapist or a clinician could feel that this is some other issue going on, but they have to actually affirm what the child says. Yeah, the parents and in all the documents because they will lose their jobs. They're terrified. And so in Toronto, what happened? What, what the Preston case was, uh, my colleague, Kenneth Zucker, I had a clinic where he saw gender dysphoric children and people said that he was practicing conversion therapy. He was not. So conversion therapy I do not stand for. It's trying to turn gay children's straight, but sexual orientation is not the same thing as gender, so gender and young children is flexible and it becomes more stable with age. So when he, when patients would come to him and say, you know, I want to be the opposite sex, he would say, okay, what's the underlying resentment? When you say gender is flexible, you don't mean the amount of genders. You mean the feeling that you have related to gender? I just want to be clean. I know there are two genders. Let's be clear on that. Okay. Um, so if you have an example, even using, if you have a little boy who says he's a girl, he will likely be a gay man and he will likely grow to be comfortable in his male gender identity. So for 99 percent of us are biological sex is our gender,

Speaker 2:          49:41          man, this, this thing. It's, it's a real monster. Yeah. There's a lot of misinformation out there. So what I was saying with my colleague has clinic got shut down. He wasn't doing anything unethical, but because of that, it's set this chill across the field. Now, clinicians do not do not want to have the same thing happened to them because activists will go after them. There's no one really practicing or anyone sort of thought of as legitimate. That's practicing conversion therapy anymore. Is there? I hope not. I have nothing against it, like the that it just never worked. Like it was just something that I guess it's sort of twisted. Idealogue was practicing not using real evidence or science and it just fizzled out basically. I do think there are some practitioners who are still doing it. Not, I wouldn't call them legitimate, which it makes me very uncomfortable when I see that, but yeah, definitely sexual orientation is biological. It's genetic and it can't be changed, so conversion therapy is completely useless.

Speaker 1:          50:42          Yeah. Well I'm glad we got it. At least I think. I think most people won't be angry at you on that. Well, I guess maybe some people on the right might be angry on that one,

Speaker 2:          50:51          maybe, but you know, I'm all about presenting the data and speaking to facts and the science and standing up for sex research, whether it infuriates people on the left or the right.

Speaker 1:          51:00          Yeah. Science facts reason pretty much. Pretty much all but all sort of packaged within, within the free speech thing. Yeah. Can I call you a member of the intellectual dark web? Please do. I don't know that I have that power, but I'm going to go back to the clubhouse later and I'm going to get me a membership. Yeah, yeah. You know, we have to vote on it. It's a weird thing and we can be a white man some days. Oh, right. That was the thing. It was like the, you know, whatever. All these idiots that are writing all these nonsensical piece is about as tall white man and it's like

Speaker 2:          51:32          there are a bunch of us that are not white, but I mean they call them. I've been called a white supremacist. I've been called a Nazi, so you know, that's the level that we're at right now and they have nothing else. So I think it's a good sign

Speaker 1:          51:42          in a weird way. It absolutely is a good time. Well, it's been a pleasure. I'm so glad that we finally got to do this. So much fun. Yeah, we will. We will do. I sent these issues going away, so we're going to have to do this again, right? Very good. Uh, for more on Deborah, you can follow her on twitter. It's at Debra Hill.
